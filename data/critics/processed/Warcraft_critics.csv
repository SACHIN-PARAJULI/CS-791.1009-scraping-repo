"Mar 31, 2023"," Based on the video game series, Warcraft follows a human warrior (Travis Fimmel’s Anduin Lothar) as he reluctantly agrees to work with a fearsome Orc (Toby Kebbell’s Durotan) to prevent an all-out war between their two species. Filmmaker Duncan Jones, armed with his and Charles Leavitt’s screenplay, kicks Warcraft off with an absolutely disastrous opening stretch that is, to put it mildly, rather off-putting, as the dense, plot-heavy atmosphere, which contains little in the way of an entry point for the viewer, is compounded by a proliferation of dull, one-dimensional characters and an almost comical overuse of computer-generated special effects – with, in terms of the latter, the movie’s flat, uncinematic visual sensibilities going a long way towards heightening the pervasively unwatchable vibe. And although there admittedly is some novelty in seeing certain elements of the game reproduced here, including an entertaining visit to Ironforge, Warcraft progresses into a sluggish midsection that’s been suffused with a series of over-the-top yet entirely meaningless action set-pieces – which, when coupled with an absolutely endless third act, ultimately does cement the picture’s place as a hopelessly misguided endeavor that fails in virtually every manner imaginable.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 21, 2022"," Certain films enter theaters already burdened under the weight of negativity. “Warcraft” was immediately met with a barrage of snarky ridicule and dismissive criticism. To be fair the horrible track record of video game-based movies is enough to warrant a good measure of hesitation. At the same time the snooty, cavalier approach to the film by many critics was predictable. The presumed shallowness of video games and the condescending attitudes towards anything related to them showed in many of the more ferocious reviews some of which compared this film to the likes of “Battlefield Earth”. Despite what many may say, storytelling and world building in video games and in movies isn’t that different. The evolution of the platform has allowed writers and developers to craft engaging narratives and immersive experiences within their games. And just like movies some hit their target while others wildly miss their mark. Director Duncan Jones brings a special level of intrigue to “Warcraft”. He is a filmmaker who received high marks for his films “Source Code” and “Moon”. But he also comes from a video game background. In an interview Jones revealed a deep passion for the video game space and a knowledge that attracted him to the “Warcraft” property. This affection works heavily to the advantage of Warcraft fans who will easily identify Jones’ respect for the source material. Those unfamiliar with this universe will find it more challenging depending on your expectations. I am versed in the Warcraft universe, just not heavily versed, and I had no problem navigating the world Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt put together. “Warcraft’s” ambition reaches beyond a single film. It clearly sets itself up as a series which handcuffs this film to the normal first installment issues. We get a lot of table-setting and we get information dumps aplenty. Many characters are introduced and sometimes the sheer number of them can be overwhelming. At first it can be a struggle to see where everyone fits in, but over time each finds their place within the story. All of this contributes to what is unquestionably a setup movie, yet I quickly found myself engaged in its hyper-fantasy landscape. A big reason for that engagement is due to Jones’ heavy focus on character development. It doesn’t do every character justice but for the most part it adds more depth than expected. It offers the mandatory introductions but also tries to define the characters’ personalities and their motivations. Unfortunately it tries to juggle too many which leaves some characters and relationships underserved. Side stories also fall victim to the film’s attempt at tackling too much. It felt like certain plot lines needed more attention, but at the same time their inclusion showed a clear desire to offer more than the usual shallow story and even shallower characters. It could also be said that some of characters aren’t helped by the casting and performances. Ben Schnetzer instantly comes to mind. His portrayal of a young ostracized mage gets better as the film progresses, but is really rough early on. There is also the odd casting of Ben Foster as mystical Guardian named Medivh. He never seems completely comfortable with his character. While others also show some inconsistencies, Tobey Kebbell certainly does not. Here he once again amazes in a motion capture role. He plays a respected Orc chieftain and a new father named Durotan. He is the most compelling character even though Travis Fimmel is the closest thing to a lead role. As a whole the story has an entertaining messiness to it that mixes well with my appreciation for the source material. But it should be said that the messiness never leads to incoherence (as some have suggested). The plot is very straightforward and the side ventures into the world’s composition never derail the simplicity of the main story. As I mentioned, some side stories and relationships deserve more attention, but Jones does a good job of spelling out their relevance to the world and his main story. I also think the film looks really good. Sure, a CGI-heavy movie like this has moments where the effects are not top form, but much of it serves the fantasy world well. The orcs look spectacular in both appearance and motion capture quality. The world’s locales were also presented vividly and with unique character. Perhaps the worst visuals were in the real life costumes. The human armor is noticeably flimsy and fake. But as a whole the movie presents some wonderful visuals. Strangely “Warcraft” is a film with noticeable flaws that should significantly hurt it yet doesn’t. It is another popular punching bag for critics yet I still found it to be fun and entertaining. Perhaps it is my affection for the video game franchise. Maybe it is my love for the corny 80’s fantasy pictures like “The Ice Pirates” and “Krull”. The question becomes how does this film work for those without that lighthearted connection? So far it doesn’t seem very well. That’s unfortunate because “Warcraft” actually deserves better. You went easier on this one than I did.  I don’t disagree with many of your points, but the fact is, is that the movie threw a ton of stuff at you, and if you weren’t familiar with the game/s, there was a very strong possibility of you getting lost in regards to what’s going on.  For me, the movie hits every mark with flying colors except where it matters most:  The story and character development.  The Orcs were awesome, but the human characters were…meh.  The movie feels incomplete to me.  For a movie with a run time of 2 hours, it feels like they cut out a lot of important character moments that would have made the movie a lot better.  Don’t get me wrong, Warcraft is quite possibly the best video game-based movie since Mortal Kombat, but the whole thing reeks of studio interference.  I’m expecting an extended cut of the film to hit home video in September/October.  I really do hope a sequel gets made, because there’s a LOT of potential here, especially if Duncan Jones comes back.  He’s the reason the movie didn’t flat out suck, I think. You hint at something that has me thinking. If they had allowed another 20 minutes I really think some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more. More time could have been given and I think the movie would have been stronger. For a fantasy movie, a three hour run time really shouldn’t bother a lot of people.  Look at Lord of the Rings.  I know comparing Warcraft to LOTR is kind of silly, but the more run time the movie has, the more room it has to breathe and get everything out.  Now, a three-hour video game movie would definitely put people on edge, I understand, but this is the kind of video-game movie that would work with a longer run time. I like you even more after you referenced Krull! I liked the sincerity of this film. It took its storyline seriously and made a real attempt at building the world. And I agree Toby Kebbel is the best thing about it. He never disappoints. I’m going to wait for it when it comes on TV.  Besides, I like Duncan Jones’ work as a filmmaker and await for his next one which I heard is a smaller yet more interesting film.  Plus, I don’t want to rush to the theaters and end up not liking it as I wanna give the guy a break.  He just his dad.  We love his dad. That’s a surprisingly good review! I thought it was decent considering what he was working with, but Duncan Jones should be doing much more interesting movies. After Moon and Source Code I think he should stick to the middle-budget cerebral sleeper hits. But I guess it’s hard to stay as consistently awesome as his father! Interesting read. It got some OK/good notices over here before all those negative reviews in the US, as it was released a week earlier. I was surprised by the level of vitriol sent its way, but I haven’t seen it yet, so can’t really comment any further. I hope to catch it in the next week or so while it’s still around. That’s a very positive review Keith. Personally I wasn’t engaged at all by it and never felt an emotional connection to it. In my review I did state that I thought if this movie had been half an hour longer it might have been better as it would have allowed to give the characters more background/depth. Even though I had no intentions of seeing it, I’m kind of bummed critics are ripping it apart just because I love Duncan Jones and wanted him to succeed. I also know a lot of people who loved WoW, so I figured it would’ve had a massive audience going in. We have different opinions on this one and while I think you make valid points in favor of the movie, I really could not get into it. The messiness of it all just didnt sit well with me and most of the time I was just really bored. Glad you had a better time with i. And I understand. I do think it comes down to whether or not the movie is able to connect with you enough so that you can overlook it’s faults.  Fantastic review, Keith! So glad to see you enjoyed it so much. I was going to see this with my hubby, but he ended up going with a friend. He played WoW for years, so he was obviously interested, and he enjoyed it. I am looking forward to a DVD/Blu-Ray release so that I, too, can catch up. I am interested to see how they Warcraft lore is brought to the screen, because in the games it is fascinating. Yeah, he quite liked it, thought it looked cool and all that, though he said there were some issues. He’s interested to see where they take it, so they got that right at least xD Glad he liked it, looking forward to catching it eventually, too.  You’re right. Not surprising. It is a shame though. It has flaws but it is a lot of fun and it lays the groundwork for a solid franchise. Hopefully the good reception overseas will help us to get another film. I felt pretty much the same Keith. I didn’t have much knowledge of the video game, so came from that point of view and found myself engaged in the characters. Totally agree about Ben Foster though he was such a strange choice! Glad to read a positive review! And I’m just as glad to hear a positive response! 😉 I really think don’t think this film deserves the drumming it has received. Sure it has some flaws, but I found it to be a really fun time. Do you think we will ever get that sequel? I think the only hope lies in the overseas numbers. The US audience didn’t come out but the numbers in other territories have been good. It was a sensation in China. Hopefully those numbers are enough to get us a sequel. But I don’t know. Dude, I thought of this post as I composed my King Arthur: Legend of the Sword thoughts. That is another movie that is getting more hate than it deserves. I actually think it is a fun epic summer fantasy, not without its problems, but still predominately fun. Really? I’m glad to hear that. I may just give it a chance then. I recently bought Warcraft on blu-ray. I’m actually anxious to see it again. ",POSITIVE
"Apr 11, 2022"," Readers looking for another heated bashing of Duncan Jones’ Warcraft should go elsewhere. The long-awaited screen adaptation of the popular video game franchise has stirred up ugly responses. Critics have used this moment as an opportunity to unleash hell upon the production, writing shallow assessments about a film that deserves to be recognized for its technical and narrative merits. Having no personal experience with the video games and no particular interest in seeing the film, I entered Jones’ world of Warcraft aware of the poor initial reception, but otherwise free of expectations. To my surprise, I was greeted by a character-driven fantasy about universal themes such as family, honor, and survival. And aside from a few dull moments and an overall unoriginal quality to the fantasy, Jones has made Warcraft into a film that kept my attention and left me hungry for more. For the uninitiated, Warcraft consists of an extensive franchise, first created in 1994 by Blizzard and Interplay Entertainment as a home computer game. In the original game, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, players could choose to play as either human or orc, and then build villages, command armies, and conquer enemies. After several video game sequels, Blizzard released World of Warcraft and revolutionized online gaming. Their 2004 online game established a virtual fantasy world in which more than 100 million international players built their various character types, sometimes spending real dollars for virtual items such as weapons, skills, and magical powers. What’s more, when you put the controller down, the game’s world keeps living on the internet without you. World of Warcraft’s legacy has long been ingrained into pop-culture, and even urban legend. (Surely you’ve heard stories about players who wear diapers so as not to disrupt gameplay with a pesky bathroom break; or worse, the tale about a player who killed himself after a concerned friend deleted the player’s character.) When Blizzard Entertainment first began developing a live-action film version of their game in 2006, they followed the basic plot of the original game, in which warring humans fight giant, green-blooded Orcs. However, Charles Leavitt’s initial script was told from the humans’ perspective, a quality Jones was determined to change when he signed to direct in 2013. Jones rewrote Leavitt’s draft and stabilized the conflict, balancing it with sympathy on both sides—as opposed to human heroes against a monstrous, inhuman Other. Elsewhere, Jones paid close attention to how richly conceived motion-capture CGI could bring these creatures to life. The detail is such that I found myself appreciating fine touches in the Orcs’ porous skin, the hairs on their shoulders, or their expressive faces. In no small way, Warcraft breathes life into these characters visually and through its storytelling. Of course, Warcraft isn’t revolutionary or new. We’ve seen tales of humans fighting an ancient evil or invading monsters before, to such a degree that Warcraft’s basic story is unquestionably derivative. And yet, Jones’ command of the material also remains unquestionable. The screen story tells the origins of the human-orc conflict, beginning with a number of Orc tribes, led by demonic sorcerer Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), searching for a new home. Using evil green magic drained from the life force of slaves, Gul’dan opens a portal into the human realm called Azeroth, planning an invasion. Fortunately, not all Orcs are so megalomaniacal. Tribe leader Durotan (Tony Kebbell) just wants to exist with his wife Draka (Anna Galvin) and their newborn child. Durotan follows Gul’dan’s orders at first but begins to question the sorcerer’s motivations when he sees how Gul’dan’s black magic, called Fel, begins to eat away at Azeroth land, just as it ruined the Orc realm called Draenor. On the human side, brave army leader Lothar (Travis Fimmel) defends King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and Queen Taria (Ruth Negga), his sister. When Lothar receives a warning of the Orc invasion from an apprentice mage, Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), he seeks the guidance of the Guardian (Ben Foster), an all-powerful wizard tasked with protecting Azeroth. Before long, the humans learn of Gul’dan’s plot to open a portal and allow entry of all Orcs into Azeroth. As ground battles ensue, a thickening plot leads Khadgar to discover that someone on the Azeroth side of the portal must be working with Gul’dan. Meanwhile, fearsome half-breed Garona (Paula Patton) plays a central role after Lothar captures her. She understands both sides and sees the value humans place on their lives, but she also understands the Orcs’ ingrained sense of honor. And while these various plot strains may sound familiar, they play out in unexpected ways, resulting in a few unexpected deaths and room for a sequel. Whether or not audiences ever get to see that sequel remains another matter. Countless failed sword-and-sorcery yarns have bombed at the box-office. Studios often adapt a known property and rush the first entry; and in their hopes for a long series of lucrative sequels, the filmmakers deliver a slapdash effort. The quality of the filmmaking and ruinous performance end up warranting their own failure. The examples of this are many (Eragon, Inkheart, Jack the Giant Killer, The Last Witch Hunter, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Seeker: The Dark is Rising, and The Seventh Son come to mind). But Warcraft is not one of these. It’s a solid technical and dramatic effort that, like The Golden Compass before it, doesn’t merit such a harsh critical reception. And, unlike the others mentioned, it deserves a sequel. Jones has made a solid film, despite the sometimes underwhelming, underdeveloped human cast, some run-of-the-mill setups, and a certain corniness about the character designs themselves (the Orcs’ distracting bottom tusks had me wondering how Orcs are able to talk, kiss, eat, etc.). The director cares about his characters and approaches the material like a craftsman or storyteller, instead of just adopting a bunch of commercial franchise formulas. After all, Jones began with a small, character-driven story on a shoestring budget; his debut Moon (2009) was an impressive science-fictioner boasting a tour de force performance by Sam Rockwell at the center. He followed Moon with Source Code (2011), another thought-provoking story, this one burdened by a frustratingly convoluted finale. Jones’ budgets have increased monumentally in seven years (as is often the case with many young filmmakers). He commands a $160 million price tag and an army of cast and crewmembers on Warcraft, and every cent appears onscreen, from the lifelike mo-cap animation to the immersive backdrops of Azeroth. And yet, Jones doesn’t lose sight of what draws an audience into this or any film: character, drama, and an engaging conflict. Warcraft has all of those things and manages to impress with its technical and narrative cohesion. Editor Paul Hirsch delivers solid, easy to follow action sequences, and composer Ramin Djawadi sets them to a stirring theme. Best of all, Jones commits to this world and resists trying to make it relatable with annoying modern trends (his characters never say “I got this” or “I know, right?” or anything similar). In the realm of fantasy on film, Warcraft may not challenge Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it’s certainly more satisfying than the last entry in Jackson’s Hobbit trilogy. In the end, a viewer willing to accept material in which heavily armored humans battle green-skinned Orcs, glowing-eyed sorcerers teleport from here to there, or an Orc child floating downriver to become Orc-Jesus, is the kind of viewer who will find Warcraft a worthy effort and an underrated entertainment.",POSITIVE
"Mar 8, 2022"," Let the gibberish (and the parade of false red squiggles of potential spelling errors) begin.  The orcs of the realm of Draenor are besieged by world that is dying around them.  The powerful magic-wielding green orc Gul'dan (Daniel Wu of AMC's ""Into the Badlands"") has merged the orc clans into an army called The Horde.  Among them is the red orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes""), a noble chieftain of the Frostwolf clan and his pregnant wife.  Powered by what is called the Fel, Gul'dan can drain life energy from organisms around him to drive his magic, which includes opening a mystical portal to a new and fertile world on the other side, namely the human-ruled world of Azeroth. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) of the Stormwind Kingdom is the most respected ruler of Azeroth, joined by his queen-consort Lady Taria (Ruth Negga).  His trusted military commander, the knight Sir Anduin Lothar (""Vikings"" star Travis Fimmel), encounters a young mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer of ""The Book Thief"") that has tracked the negative presence of the Fel energy from recently raided villages.  To gain insight and an advantage against the orcs, King Llane calls upon the powerful archmage Medivh (professional movie creeper Ben Foster), the Guardian of Tirisfal, who rescues them from an orc ambush. After this first skirmish, a few catalysts come to the forefront and change the dynamic.  The captured half-human/half-orc slave Garona (Paula Patton) is rescued and agrees to help the forces of Stormwind.  Within the ranks of the orcs, Durotan learns the reason worlds are dying around them is the decaying power of the Fel magic wielded by Gul'dan and he too defects to join King Llane and Sir Anduin.  Before the inevitale knock-down-drag-out battle royale ensues, bushels of unintelligible exposition fill the bulk of ""Warcraft.""  Enjoy deciphering talks of mana pools, demonic possession, the presence of boomsticks, and feeble attempts at creating codes and honor between both warring factions. All of this messy, weird, and humorless exposition is thinner than helium and a waste of time and talent, including Duncan Jones (""Source Code,"" ""Moon"") in the director's chair.  Outside of a cinder of spark from Toby Kibbel's Durotan, no one in ""Warcraft"" shows any character magnetism for audience investment.  Little reason is presented to like, root, or care at any level.  Connection has to come from more than cool looks and cool powers.  It needs actions that transcend words and reinforce the destinies supposedly being forged.  The blandness is contagious. To its credit, ""Warcraft"" looks the part of a summer blockbuster.  The immense visual effects and performance capture character creations are very impressive at times.  The film has a 3D pop that will play well on the big screen.  Even then, a movie this loud (pushed by an unmemorable Ramin Djawadi score) shouldn't be this boring.  Showy visual splendor can only go so far.  Anyone can take a product (say a Kia Sephia, for example) and dress it up with fancy vocabulary and fake style.  Underneath, it's still crap. Here's the worst part of what ""Warcraft"" tries to execute.  With its riffs on exotic worlds, magic, big battles, and monstrous creatures, it fashions itself to be high fantasy and epic spectacle right there with ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars.""  Universal Pictures thinks it is sitting on a crossover franchise that will sell merchandise and recruit new gamers by the millions.  Child, please!  You cannot make the bizarre endearing without substance behind it.  To be a weighty and impressive piece of high fantasy, a story or film such as this has to exude an aura of importance.  That's character building and mythology.  That's a foothold into something with coherent gravitas.  That's tangible peril and an infused purpose.  None of that is present in the portending and pondering happening here between bland characters and weak ideas. With that gravitas in mind, ""Warcraft"" was doomed from the start for the same reasons films based ""Saturday Night Live"" characters rarely work.  You cannot easily extend a definitive narrative from something that was never meant to have one, or at least not a very deep one.  The rabidly popular ""World of Warcraft"" is a MMORPG (massively multi-player online role-playing game).  Translation, gameplay there is open-ended and never-ending.  Nothing binds it past that cinematic introduction that sends you off skipping with your catchy character name, starter weapons, and first-level spells.  ""Coneheads"" and ""The Ladies Man"" should have stayed skits.  ""Warcraft"" should have stayed a game.  They both play better in smaller forms.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 18, 2021"," For the sake of decency, movie theaters playing Warcraft should offer free popcorn to all non-gamer audience members who survive the first 20 minutes of the film. Fans familiar with the Blizzard Entertainment franchise will doubtless weep sweet-and-salty tears of joy that a motion picture is speaking directly to their console-controlled hearts, but most moviegoers will find it a chore sitting through expository sequences as graceless, clumsy and impenetrable as those on view here. Yet after this trying and torturous opening, the story starts coming into view, and Warcraft soon emerges as — well, it’s still a feeble flick, but it improves enough to avoid the year-end 10 Worst placement that initially appeared to be its birthright. With its mix of humans, orcs, dwarfs and even a Gollum (OK, a Golem; close enough), one would be forgiven for mistaking this movie for The Lord of the Rings: The Bootleg Edition. The plot involves the skirmish between humans, whose ranks include scruffy soldier Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), young wizard Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and veteran sorcerer Medivh (a badly miscast Ben Foster), and the hulking orcs, who seem like they might be decent chaps were they not imbecilic enough to serve under the transparently evil Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). There’s also the half-orc Garona (Paula Patton), who inexplicably falls for the lackluster Lothar, as well as some imposing wolves apparently borrowed from Princess Mononoke. Duncan Jones, son of the late, great David Bowie and helmer of the excellent Moon (as well as the flawed if intriguing Source Code), fares better as director than co-writer, since the battle sequences are far more accomplished than any of the scenes in which characters stand around spouting inanities. Even when at the mercy of shaky CGI, the skirmishes are competently choreographed and suggest that Jones might have been able to make the leap from low-key sci-fi to big-budget extravaganzas had the material been stronger. The film also boasts a tremendous score by Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi, suitably bombastic music that works overtime in trying to lend majesty and import to what’s occurring on the screen. Alas, it’s a losing battle.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 3, 2021"," Of course critics are ripping apart Warcraft; the majority of them compare this film to Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. It’s laughable to me that these high-brow critics couldn’t be bothered to delve deeper into the source material to understand the series and yet are so ready to judge a film simply based on creative material that bears no resemblance other than being within the same genre. It reeks of a closed-minded viewer. Two intellectual properties does not a genre make. Perhaps this can be attributed to the fact that most critics assume fantasy is a fringe genre, one that isn’t to be taken seriously. Studios like Marvel have made an impact for the comic book genre, but critics who have lived through Lord of the Rings seem unable to expand their horizons to give this film an opportunity outside of unrelated yet aesthetically similar projects. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]Many of the negative reviews describe the film as clunky, unoriginal, and boring. I’m sure it is if you go in armed with only a cursory knowledge of the fantasy genre through the shallow lens of popular culture. I’m not saying that if you don’t know anything about the Warcraft games you’ll be bored, you won’t. But when you go into any movie already set on what you’ll think about it, of course you’re going to judge the film based on those beliefs. Critics are harshly criticizing this film in the same way that some people scorn independent dramas and foreign films for stereotypically being too dense and pretentious, they do so without giving it a chance and writing it off before the film begins because of the preconceived notions. And all this is to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I abhor the unfair beating its gotten from critics. It was beautiful and fantastical, it brought back memories of playing World of Warcraft and shows a deep appreciation for the source material that only a fan of the series could properly portray. As a fan of fantasy in general, as someone who enjoys the complex world that fantasy video games often portray but rarely are praised for by traditional media, this film gets a foot in the door for future films. What makes this such a success for me is the feeling that I get after watching it; it’s not a film that makes me embarrassed for loving it, it gets me excited and hopeful for more to come. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]Warcraft never dials back in its execution. This film is the definition of going all-in. The first half is packed with dense world building — some of it is done well, some of it is more of an info dump. This was inevitable in a film that tries hard to not only appease long-time fans, but also to draw in a new horde of fans and viewers. Large amounts of exposition is needed if you want to achieve some sort of feasible plot. The story documents the beginning of how the orcs found their way to Azeroth and the conflict that inspires an entire universe of lore and creation. Throwing caution to the wind and leaping into the lore is something that pays off for Duncan Jones. Instead of holding back, he dives deep into the world of Azeroth. This is crucial in order to understand and sympathize with the struggle between the Alliance and the Horde, especially with the orcs, which casual viewers might immediately view as the enemy because of their physical appearance. One of the strongest aspects of Warcraft is its attention to detail with the visual aesthetic. Visually, this is a masterpiece. The motion capture and the CGI graphics are stunning and serve to elevate the story to a more fantastical level. The actors who portray the orcs are able to show a full spectrum of emotions and their action scenes exude ferocity and strength without looking artificial. Indeed, some of the strongest aspects of the film lie with the orc characters and the horde’s story. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]Much of the exposition deals with the Horde coming from their dying world through a portal conjured by Daniel Wu’s Gul’dan, a warlock orc who wields fel magic (dark magic that feeds on life). Gul’dan is immediately a malicious character, exchanging lives in order to orchestrate dark magic. Although his actions save the Horde, his intentions are far more selfish as the fel poisons his mind. The film not only shows the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance, but also the larger struggle between the balance of dark and light. Toby Kebbell’s Durotan serves as the lead protagonist for the Horde. He is a noble character, and while he is a fearsome warrior he also possesses a level-head in the midst of chaos. Kebbell’s performance strikes true through all of the motion capture and Durotan serves as both a relatable character and also one that inspires his people as an eventual mythical hero. On the flip side, while Travis Fimmel does an admirable job as Anduin Lothar, a knight champion of Azeroth and the Alliance protagonist, many of the Alliance/human characters lack the same development that the orcs possess. Fimmel’s Lothar has been compared to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Aragorn — god only knows why, being a male warrior protagonist in a fantasy film does not immediately make you Aragorn — but he bears little to no resemblance. While he is a strong warrior, capable and relied on by his kingdom, he struggles to come to terms after the loss of his son. He is light-hearted, and even humorous, at some moments. Ben Foster’s Medivh and Ben Schnetzer’s Khadgar both have a middling performance, with high points and low ones in equal measure. While Foster’s Medivh sometimes looks too youthful, he accomplishes the job of keeping the audience guessing about his loyalties and where they lie. Similarly, Schnetzer’s Khadgar seems to have the potential for greatness, but sometimes defaults to bumbling. Regardless, both magic casters add to the strength of the story, just perhaps not their own characters. Dominic Cooper’s performance as King Llane never quite lands as solidly as his other performances in different projects. Lothar steals much of the spotlight while he is left with the paperwork and the burden of leading. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]Although Warcraft bears an uneven casting between male and female characters, Paula Patton’s Garona, Ruth Negga’s Queen Taria, and Anna Galvin’s Draka all show a surprising amount of strength and dimension. Patton’s Garona straddles the boundary between the Horde and the Alliance, this offers her a position as the outsider to both sides. Negga’s brief appearance as the Queen of Stormwind is a steadier performance than Cooper’s, she seems a surer leader and has the potential for a lager part in the future. Galvin’s Draka wins the most cutthroat mom award in the movie, going into battle while in labor and fighting to the death for her son in a Moses-like origin for Thrall. Warcraft is chock full of tropes that we are all too familiar with, themes of light and dark, betrayal and loyalty, father and child. While for some this can seem tedious and stereotypical, in the complexity of the Warcraft universe, there needs to be something that an audience can hold onto. Amidst the fel magic and the orcs and the Alliance and the flying eagles, there needs to be something that is acts as a lodestone. Much of the origins of the mythos of the universe plays on these tropes — view them as myths and legends. We are seeing a story that has already been written, told, and retold, this is the genesis story. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]As packed with information as the first half of the movie is, the full piece never falters in pace. It doesn’t go from 0 to 100, it starts at 100 and stays there. For those who go into this uninterested, this can seem clunky, noisy, and tiring. The editing cuts the story in a way that jumps back and forth, from the Horde to Durotan to Medivh to Stormwind. It may prevent a casual viewer from fully immersing into the story, since it never lingers in one place long enough. It’s only when the different factions start to braid together that the story becomes more coherent. Along with some of the unsteady performances in this film, the screenplay has some weak points where the dialogue can feel awkward. The two hour run time is not nearly enough time to explain the intricacies of two vastly different worlds and an even larger number of different cultures and clan cultures. With the info dump also comes lengthy dialogue and some hand-holding from the characters to move the plot forward. Again, this is an inevitability. They need to lay the groundwork in order to build on it. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]Plot-wise, the film seems to lean towards the Horde, with many of the most “human” characters being orc. Durotan’s sacrifice and Draka’s sacrifice are two of the more emotionally saturated scenes, same with Garona’s last scene with the King. While many might view orcs as warmongers and only capable of violence, Warcraft exposes the honorable and admirable side to an often misunderstood race. The ending leaves a couple things up in the air, hinting at a potential sequel for a hopeful franchise. With so much groundwork laid out by this film, there is certainly a lot more story for the viewers to consume should future films be created. Should creators look closely at audience reviews and less at critical reviews, we will hopefully be in for more of the story. [Legendary Pictures, Universal Pictures and ILM]Final Thoughts: A visual stunner that only benefits from a 3D IMAX viewing, Warcraft has been misinterpreted by traditional media critis. It will impress those who love the fantasy genre and those who enjoy the Warcraft games with its no-holds-barred format of storytelling. It is a immensely fun to watch if you suspend your disbelief at the door and open yourself up to a completely new mythos and adventure.",POSITIVE
"Dec 5, 2020"," ith their homeland in ruins, noble chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and his Frostwolf Clan band together with all other orcs under powerful warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), to seek new lands to colonize. Using the life forces of vanquished enemies to fuel his dark magic, Gul’dan opens a portal into the peaceful world of Azaroth and orders a war party in to begin conquering its denizens. When King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), leader of Azaroth’s human kingdom Stormwind, receives reports of his cities being demolished by gargantuan monsters, he sends loyal knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) to investigate. Teaming up with outcast mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), Guardian sorcerer Medivh (Ben Foster), and former orc prisoner Garona (Paula Patton), Lothar must lead Stormwind’s soldiers into battle against an overwhelming force of bloodthirsty foes, all while a sinister being plots in the shadows to destroy Azaroth for his own nefarious purposes. As with many 3D films, “Warcraft’s” extra dimensions never get more effective than the smattering of company logos that precede the title credits. From there, the extensive computer graphics exceed in their depictions of faces and textures and muscle movements. The close-ups are stunning (especially when studying skin, hair, and facial musculature), but the further the camera inches away from the action, the more the physics and motions are cheated, betraying their computer-generated inconsistencies and deficiencies. Despite the continual advancements in technology, it’s still the backgrounds, environments, and nonorganic structures that appear most photorealistic and convincing. The castles and dungeons, desert wastelands and ceremonial altars, and fortresses and camps are all feasts for the eyes, though they receive extremely brief screentime – in favor of insufficient exposition or lengthy battles. Locations seem to change every two minutes or so, while new characters are introduced at twice that speed. Although the existence of orcs is enough of a stretch for the imagination, it’s the steady influx of unexplained magical contrivances that drives a wedge between modest entertainment and head-shaking nonsense. When the film looks like something out of “Mad Max: Fury Road” or “Waterworld,” it works more favorably; when it brings in components from “John Carter” or the realms of Tolkien, all the colorful zigzags of neon, electrical sparks – or mere sorcerer’s summonings – become overbearingly silly. Magic is always the convenient, terribly easy way out of any predicament – whether it’s used to win a fight, explain a special power, transport a party, or progress the plot. During its best moments, the film resembles “Avatar,” full of alien wonders and breathtaking sights; but at its worst, it’s like “The Last Airbender,” riddled with incompetent spontaneity and confusingly undefined supernaturalism. The biggest problem for “Warcraft” is the source material. To do justice to all the lore and mythology generated by Blizzard’s prized computer game would have required a good four hours or more (or several movies, as the structuring of the film clearly hopes for), which would have potentially pleased fans but shaped a practically unwatchable leviathan for everyone else. As it is, the story here is convoluted and unfocused, attempting to cram so many characters and ideas into such a limited outlet. The world gets too big too fast, unable to delve satisfactorily into origins and cultural identities that could have given meaning to all of the hubbub (though the action sequences possess an undeniable level of suspense and violence). Lots of visual bluster continually occurs, but none of it feels significant. And numerous scenes fall away or fade out, as if sloppy, sacrificial cuts were made to shorten the running time. Every subplot – including the clumsy young mage learning his trade, or the characters trading backstories, or opportunities allotted for human/orc romance, or even politics – are half-developed or abandoned, as if another movie’s worth of footage was set aside for the inevitable home video extended cut. Plus, it doesn’t help that, even with all the ornate costuming and detailed character designs, the basic concepts of destiny, betrayal, unsure allegiances, interspecies pacts, undying devotion to patriarchs, and commitments to foreign traditions are treated as intrinsic to high fantasy. “We’ve got a demon to kill!” Designed by Mike Massie | © 2006-2024 Gone With The Twins | All movie related images © their respective owners.

"Aug 23, 2019"," De un tiempo a esta parte, compruebo que hay películas que se convierten en objetivos fáciles para el linchamiento. Suelen ser superproducciones y todo empieza con unas reacciones negativas. Se crea un efecto de bola de nieve, en parte por falta de personalidad y reflexión, cuyo propósito es derribar a un gigante. Y se regocijan con sus críticas por pertenecer a un grupo de propósito tan vil, en lugar de abordar la película sin prejuicios y formar su propia opinión. Este año ya ha pasado con ‘Dioses de Egipto’, ‘Batman v Superman’ y ‘X-Men: Apocalipsis’, entre otras. Ahora es el turno de ‘Warcraft: El origen’. Tras la primera proyección, fans y jugadores de la saga de Blizzard aplaudían una película que llevaban esperando durante años mientras unos cuantos “críticos” decidieron iniciar un fuego. Se cebaron con ella de tal forma que cabe preguntarse si realmente la vieron. Quizá no. Pero lograron llamar la atención y otros están siguiendo su ejemplo. Desde aquí animo a dar una oportunidad al estupendo trabajo de Duncan Jones. Con un presupuesto estimado de 160 millones de dólares, ‘Warcraft’ se puso en marcha con el desafío de romper la maldición del cine basado en videojuegos. Hasta ahora, las adaptaciones eran decepcionantes, poco más que una excusa para convocar a los fans y sacar provecho económico de una marca popular, justificándose con referencias a los elementos más característicos de los juegos pero sin entenderlos. Fracasando en los dos aspectos clave: pasión por el material original y talento para narrar una película. Por suerte para los jugadores de ‘World of Warcraft’ y para todos los que amamos el cine de entretenimiento y la fantasía, Duncan Jones ('Moon', 'Código fuente') reúne los dos requisitos fundamentales para llevar la batuta. Es jugador de 'Warcraft' y un excelente cineasta. Sólo faltaba un proyecto a la altura del reto y los estudios (Blizzard y Legendary) han hecho todo lo posible por poner los medios para construirlo. El veredicto: misión cumplida. Es posible que no conozcas nada del juego pero el material publicitario no engaña a nadie. ‘Warcraft’ es pura fantasía, una aventura en mundos imaginarios donde humanos y orcos, guerreros y magos, mantienen un enfrentamiento. Ingenua y orgullosamente, es eso, y se entrega en cuerpo y alma, a su universo, a sus personajes y sus tramas, con la esperanza de que el público sienta curiosidad y esté dispuesto a divertirse con estos elementos. Es un contrato muy sencillo. Sin embargo, leyendo comentarios que atacan la película da la sensación de que hay gente que pretendía encontrar algo diferente a lo que es ‘Warcraft’. O han acudido siendo conscientes de que no les iba a gustar, lo cual es absurdo. Es como ir a un concierto de un grupo que te irrita. Entiendo que los medios deben cubrir el estreno, y hay críticos “obligados”, pero en este caso creo que lo normal es ser profesional y entregar un texto que pueda ser útil a los lectores. Defender ‘Avatar’ y abuchear a ‘Warcraft’ es un sinsentido. Visualmente es espectacular. La expresividad de los personajes creados por ordenador es extraordinaria, los orcos parecen reales (en este sentido hay que elogiar tanto el equipo de efectos visuales como a los actores, entre ellos Toby Kebbell y Rob Kazinsky). La recreación de las escenas de magia también están muy logradas y consiguen resultar genuinas, a pesar de las numerosas películas con hechiceros y brujas que hemos visto en la gran pantalla. El resto del reparto ofrece un trabajo desigual. Lo bordan Travis Fimmel (aportando humor y carisma a Lothar), Ben Schnetzer (creíble y divertido) y Ben Foster (consigue transmitir el conflicto interior de Medivh), mientras que otros como Dominic Cooper o Ruth Negga están muy desaprovechados, poco más que aparecen y sueltan sus diálogos. El personaje de Paula Patton no me termina de convencer pero culpo más al guion que a ella. Estando familiarizado con el juego, a Jones no le cuesta plantar guiños y referencias para deleite de los fans (¡un murloc!) por lo que sus mayores retos son acercar la mitología de Warcraft al público que no conoce la franquicia de Blizzard (y sólo puede apoyarse en sagas similares, como ‘El señor de los anillos’ o ‘Juego de tronos’) y entregar a los productores un blockbuster que puedan vender al mayor número de espectadores posible, para recuperar la elevada inversión. Mis problemas con 'Warcraft' son las inevitables concesiones que, me temo, deben realizarse para conseguir que una superproducción sea rentable. Sé que hay un montaje del director más amplio, y es culpa de Jones que se noten cortes bruscos y tramos resumidos. Arranca muy acelerada, le cuesta encontrar el ritmo. También preferiría una película más adulta y violenta pero hay que ser realista; el objetivo es lograr un éxito que prepare el terreno para una franquicia. Quizá en la secuela haya menos límites... La he disfrutado mucho. Da lo que promete: fantasía y entretenimiento a raudales. A veces es vibrante y asombrosa, otras cae en lo convencional, pero, repito, lo achaco a su condición de blockbuster e introducción a una saga. Duncan Jones firma la primera película que saca partido a las posibilidades de un videojuego, en lugar de pervertir el original. Me interesan sus personajes y estoy deseando ver cómo continúa la historia. Por cierto, cambiando el fel por dinero, ¿no tenemos aquí una grandiosa metáfora del mundo?",POSITIVE

Warcraft is clearly a 3D fantasy adventure designed to appeal to fans of the novels and computer game series. For those unfamiliar with the worlds and wars within, let’s just say Warcraft the movie is striving to be The Lord Of The Rings meets Game Of Thrones, but falls way short of its ambition. It is set in the land of Azeroth, where the human population, under the leadership of King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), supported by his loyal military commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), is wondering how to fend off an orc invasion. The orcs are controlled by the supremely evil Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), who is a master of Fel, a magical force that gains strength by sucking the life out of humans. Gul’dan wants to open a portal to let through the Horde (his orc army) and find them a new home in the human lands, but faces resistance from orc clan leader Durotan (Toby Kebbell).    Anticipating a battering, the Azerothians seek help from guardian Medivh (Ben Foster), a wizard proficient in the magical arts. Aided by his apprentice, the young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), Medivh attempts to protect the humans, but the Fel is strong in him, and he is gradually won over by the dark side. It’s up to Khadgar to step in and save the day.    Director Duncan Jones aces the special effects and motion capture, but the derivative nature of the story is irksome. There are elves and dwarves, orcs and bearded wizards. The mythology in this orcs vs humans battle is also a little hard to swallow, not least because the orcs are given human characteristics such as romance, childbirth and survival. If this sounds confusing, it is. And it’s far more so when you see all the characters on screen. It’s hard to tell one growling, sabre-toothed orc apart from another.  Unlock a world of Benefits!

"Aug 13, 2019"," The Beginning is the end is the beginning this week on the Dare Daniel Podcast.  Magic school dropouts Daniel Barnes and Corky McDonnell travel to the Uncanny Valley to review Duncan Jones’ incomprehensible Warcraft. A film that only serves to set up the many sequels that will never get made, Warcraft is all ambition and no execution.  It creates a world where motion-captured orcs feel less fake than actual humans.  The Bud Light commercial-level production design and an unfathomably dull lead actor do no favors to the nonsensical script. Why did Ben Rice dare Daniel and Corky to watch Warcraft?  “Of course Duncan Jones rocked Moon, a practical effects masterwork starring Sam Rockwell.  But then someone decided to hire Jones to direct a CGI-filled blockbuster based on a video game?  There’s never been a good video game movie.  There’s no way to make WoW, one of the most expansive universes of all time, a remotely watchable film. AND you hire a director who clearly excels with practical effects and struggles with CGI?  Surely this is a steaming pile of sweet Rockwell man-ass.  Or is it?  Spoiler alert: I fell asleep in the theater for half of this film’s runtime.  It’s backbreakingly boring.  Enjoy!” IMDB synopsis: “As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.” Film critic Daniel Barnes and comedian Corky McDonnell host the Dare Daniel podcast, where they do your dirty work by watching and reviewing the worst movies you can imagine.

"Jul 9, 2019"," To me, one scene above all other defines Warcraft, a movie as breathtakingly nonsensical as it is irresponsibly chaotic. A young, generic hero person who can sometimes burp blue flame, named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), stands in front of a pulsating box of gelatinous black goop. A door opens in the goopy box. Khadgar, with no hint of intentional comedic timing, asks a robed magic dude “So…should I go in?” To which the robed magic dude says “I don’t know. This has never happened before.” And that is Warcraft to me: A series of WTF moments blended with acting so impotent that full audiences now have permanent erectile dysfunction. As someone who has never played the video game Warcraft, this synopsis is going to be a trainwreck. And not the good kind, where, like, a caboose filled with bunnies spills out everywhere for free cuddles. This will be the gross kind, where toxic goo spills everywhere and doesn’t even turn anyone into a superhero. Alright, so apparently, fearsome orc warriors, who look like super-steroid professional wrestlers with the worst underbites ever, invade a realm filled with humans in order to kill them. That’s it. That’s the entirety of the plot. Now, some orcs are good and feel bad about people-murder; they’re light-skinned. Some orcs are bad; they’re green-skinned. I don’t think this was some kind of coded racial commentary but was done so that people like me could understand why some of the orcs were hitting other orcs with big hammers and how they decided which orcs to hit. The humans… God, I legitimately don’t know where to start. Um, one of them is called Lothar (Travis Fimmel), and he seems really angry, probably because he still has a mullet. And there’s something called a “Guardian” named Medivh (Ben Foster), who doesn’t actually seem to guard anything and gets really bad acne after peeing green magic into a blue pool. And there’s something about a portal that has to be closed from each side or something. Look, it’s mostly just a lot of loud noises and people barfing colored magic air. The one good thing is that the orc’s eyes are really well done. I’m serious! For the longest time, the “uncanny valley” that existed in making CGI characters seem “real” had to do with this strange, off-putting deadness in their eyes. I didn’t feel like the orcs were actively trying to steal my soul from my body when they had close-ups. So that was good! Also good was…nothing else in the movie. I am told that fans of the video game are enjoying Warcraft. Awesome! I loved Duncan Jones’ Moon and am totally rooting for the guy. I also know that films like this, by their very nature, have to deal in a great amount of fan service. I’m just not a fan, and there is nothing in it for non-fans. At all. So, oh dear God did I hate this movie. One day, there will be a video game adaptation than unites lovers of the original genre and movie lovers. This is not that day.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 19, 2019"," There’s a reason why the Warcraft franchise eventually became defined by the sequel World of Warcraft. It’s because Blizzard Entertainment, the makers of the game, had thoroughly crafted a story of incredible scale and proportions—an entire world built on generations of characters, conflicts, and big freaking weapons. The film version of Warcraft comes out this week and it both lives and dies on this concept. But mostly the latter. Directed by Duncan Jones, Warcraft is a two-hour set-up to a movie I really want to see. It was undoubtedly crafted with passion, but it’s act one to a larger story. Its complexity and intricate asides show Jones and his team respect this franchise and want to do it justice. The problem is, the film seems so busy establishing the world of Warcraft (so to speak) that it never feels like it’s in the moment. In its obvious hopes to become a huge franchise, the film is constantly setting up things that very rarely pay off. The end of Warcraft is one of those things that pays off. It gives us three truly great moments that show what the movie should have been: moments of shock, awe, and compassion, each earned by everything you’ve seen before it. The problem is, just as the movie finally hits a stride, it suddenly ends, leaving everything interesting dangling as a cliffhanger. The success of those moments then lingers as a very unfavorable juxtaposition with the rest of the film. And the rest of Warcraft is devoted to explaining itself. Orcs live in a world that’s barren. One of their evil leaders, Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) creates a portal to the human world of Azeroth ostensibly so the Orcs can invade and make it their own. Once they get there, though, a few of the Orcs realize Gul’dan’s plan is self-serving and built on a dark, evil magic. Once the humans realize the danger, it becomes a race between humans and Orcs to save, or destroy, the world. It sounds relatively straight-forward, but that’s literally the bare bones of it: There’s more magic, multiple kingdoms, double crosses, factions, belief systems and more. There’s a ton going on. The characters themselves are a problem too. One of the major facets the movie borrows from the game is having good and evil characters on both sides, with the result that there isn’t one real villain or one true hero. There are several of both. That may work in a game but, in a movie, you need someone to cheer for. Jones gives you plenty of options, but the film is juggling so many of them, it’s difficult to connect with any of them in particular. In fact, because there are so many main characters that the supporting ones, like the Orcs played by Robert Kazinsky and Clancy Brown, instantly get more interesting. At least they have a very clear, defined role in the story. The look of Warcraft also takes some getting used to, mostly because it’s so incredibly heavy on effects. While fans have long complained that the film looks too fake, for the most part, the finished product works. Does it look fake? Sure, but it’s a video game movie, it was going to have some of that. The performance-capture Orcs are genuinely astounding, while the costumes and props are even cooler. Fortunately, one of the ancillary benefits of the effects is that they give you something to focus on as long stretches of the movie bombard you with mind-numbing exposition. When the characters aren’t standing and talking (which they do, a lot) the action in the film does add some much-needed energy. If you are going to see Warcraft strictly for huge-scale action, you probably won’t be disappointed. However, while the battles start big and fun, they lack character. Eventually, because you can’t really care about them, they mostly degenerate to scenes of massive, but indistinct chaos. Unexpectedly, there are even weirder things going on on the tangents of Warcraft. Much of the humor completely misses the mark or comes at inopportune times. A lot of the world-specific dialogue and descriptions don’t add much to a basic understanding of the story. And every once in a while there’s an odd aside or shot that very obviously is there to set up something in the future. The question is, will we ever see it? Warcraft has some good moments but mostly it’s a huge disappointment. There’s no doubt it was made with the best intentions, but the translation into a digestible, single, satisfying story is simply not there. Maybe with another 30 minutes to bring closure to the twists at the end of the film things would’ve been different. Or maybe cutting 30 minutes out would’ve made it feel less stagnant. We’ll never know. What I do know is, if they do make a sequel, I’ll see it. I just won’t watch Warcraft again.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 12, 2019"," Anyone knows me knows I am not a video game player. I have a lazy eye and so video games have always been tough for me to play and so I’ve never had any interest in them. However, I’ve seen a good movie based on a board game in Clue. I’ve seen a good movie based on an amusement park ride in the first Pirates movie. Anything can produce a story worth telling on the big screen. I wasn’t planning on seeing Warcraft with everything going on getting ready for my trip but I ended up with a free evening so I figured- why not give it a shot? I went into the theater with an open mind hoping to at least have dumb fun and I came out baffled. I think I’m a pretty smart person but I can’t think of when I’ve been more confused over a film’s narrative in my life. I couldn’t even tell you a name of a single character. The thing about a movie like Lord of the Rings is it seems complicated but in reality it is very simple. There is good vs evil and a powerful ring that needs to be destroyed.  That’s it. Everything else is either an obstacle or assistance to that objective. The problem with Warcraft is it splits its time between 2 groups- humans and orcs. It’s never clear who is the good guy and who is bad. There are many characters within each realm and each has a backstory and motivations. Without a lead narrator to focus on like say Willow in Willow it felt impossible to remember all of this. I guess that’s where being a fan helps because you already know who all these characters are. Then there is magic called the fel and a portal but I didn’t really understand what that magic did or how it was used. The rules of the portal were very murky. And some scenes just didn’t make sense. Like towards the end the characters are battling and then Travis Fimmel’s Lothar is knocked down to the ground. The screen goes black and he wakes up. All the orcs are watching him and then he takes on the leader orc. Why are they all watching him? What has changed from when they were just battling with each other? I have no idea. There is also a pool with special fel powers that seemed to be both good and bad. Ben Foster plays Medivh who is a wizard I think but he’s no Ian McKellen. That’s for sure.  Most of the time he seems good but then he is bad and I didn’t know why he was bad. Paula Patton is one of the most beautiful women in the world and she looks like a bad Princess Fiona at Comicon. She is half orc-half human but her relationship with Lothar and Dominic Cooper’s character is confusing.  She’s so wooden in the part I think she will be nominated for a razzie. Toby Kebbell is the best part as Duratan but the movie goes away from him for long sections and I felt like he should have been more of a narrator. It was confusing why the bad orc Gul’dan didn’t just take Duratan out when he had the chance. Why did the orcs put up with Gul’dan was never clear when Duratan seemed like the natural leader? There was the fel but I didn’t get it. Honestly I fell asleep twice for a minute or two. I guess it looked ok but other than that I found Warcraft to be a boring mess. I’m told fans of the game love it, so that’s cool. I can only speak for myself and say it didn’t work for me. The acting was also really poor from everyone.  Glen Close does appear and that scene made no sense to me (sensing a trend here…). But Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Paula Paton, Ben Foster, Travis Fimmel, Daniel Wu have all done good stuff but here they all felt flat and wooden. My advice to future fantasy directors- KISS- Keep It Simple Stupid.  Fantasy that works like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings are at their core simple stories of good vs evil and a heroes journey. All the cool special effects and world building mean nothing if the story doesn’t work for this kind of movie. KISS! KISS! Your husband sounds like a very wise man. It’s good to hear that a fan can look at it objectively and see it isn’t a good movie. And I agree it’s not bad enough to be funny like Gods of Egypt was. And he’s absolutely right. I was totally lost. The main problem was not having a true lead character or any kind of narrator to give some structure. And NO Sheldon Cooper cameo, FOR SHAME!!!  Also, didn’t know that one part was Glenn Close until your review, I knew it was someone familiar, but thought it was someone else for some reason. Spoilers Abound in this Comment:
Nope, never played it.  Some of the rabid fan-base around it always scared me off a little and I think it’s mainly for computer, I play console stuff instead.  Saw this out of curiosity more than anything and for a batch of silly fantasy fun and in terms of fantasy silliness I had some fun with it here-and-there with all the sorcery weirdness, big battles, and griffins.  But anytime a character opened their mouths and started talking about the important politics of the Land of Googlehopper as overseen by Lord Pricklypants on the third age of Ultron or whatever I was lost and couldn’t keep most of the characters straight.  Like, I know one of the Pumbaas was good, but I sometimes confused him with one of the bad ones.  Also, if Paula Patton is part-Pumbaa/part-human/All wardrobe inspired by Pebbles and Bam-bam and hair inspired by Helena Bonham Carter, then how did this happen if the people act all shocked by seeing Pumbaas the first time, when exactly would’ve a human… you know… with a Pumbaa?  Also, King Young Howard Stark tell Paula PebblesandBambam to kill him but the logic behind that whole thing made no sense at all. How does that help human-Pumbaa relations, especially since it only seems to hurt them?  I’ll admit, the spoiler stuff in the trivia in imdb, makes little to no sense or me either, it all seems to be in some language I don’t understand!  I do like how they gender-switched the typical ‘I’m going to battle, I hope to come back to you’ bit that most of these things have, but I will say even knowing nothing about this world I totally knew Bland-Yet-Serviceable Lead’s son was going to die in battle just based on the fact that that’s how these things are known to happen, so I guess… yay on some comfortable predictability in a movie that otherwise made little-to-no sense!  Ratchet and Clank is still SO much better and one day people will truly appreciate its brilliance! Hahaha. Great comment. I think for me to have fun I have to at least know the characters and what is happening. Like you said I had no clue who was bad or what the protagonist was. To me it was just frustrating and boring.

"Apr 2, 2019"," The fact that director Duncan Jones has hammered any kind of story out of one of the most popular videogames of all time is impressive, but Warcraft goes one better and manages to be pretty damn entertaining.  It’s perhaps a little overstuffed: noobs will almost certainly get lost without a glossary, and the number of characters jostling for screen time means nobody gets the attention they deserve. However, Jones has a natural eye for directing action on an epic scale, and Azeroth has never looked so gorgeous. The bloodthirsty orcs in particular are a marvel of cutting-edge motion capture wizardry. Warcraft may not be the perfect videogame adaptation we’ve been waiting for, but the late Goblin King would be proud of the wonderfully hammy fantasy adventure his son has created. SYNOPSIS: The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another. As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other extinction. Phil is a copywriter from Sheffield with an unhealthy addiction to Lotus Biscoff cookies and Henderson's Relish (though not at the same time, that would be weird).

"Feb 5, 2019"," La primera vez que jugué Warcraft fue cuando salió Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos en 2002… Me encantó. Fue como darle un nuevo giro a todo lo que ya había introducido Age of Empires (fue lo primero que jugué del tipo), además de que le metieron mejores gráficas. Después de allí la saga despegó con World of Wacraft, un Massively multiplayer online role-playing game, juego que jamás llegué a jugar porque requería una suscripción pagada y la verdad es que no tenía dinero para pagarlo y pedírselo a mis papás… Había cosas mejores. El punto es que esta saga fue sumamente exitosa (y sigue siéndolo de cierta forma) y por fin Jalibud ha decidido que es el tiempo de que haya una película. Así llega Warcraft: El Primer Encuentro de Dos Mundos, dirigida por Duncan Jones, una cinta basada en la historia que narran los juegos de vídeo. Y allí reside su mayor problema. La historia te suelta de golpe en un momento trágico en la existencia de los Orcos, en donde su líder está intentando abrir un portal para cambiarse de mundo, pues el que tienen ya lo han destruido. Para eso absorben la vida de criaturas indefensas y sus esclavos. El chiste es que envían a sus mejores guerreros para que conquisten el otro mundo, donde habitan los humanos, para capturarlos y aplicar la misma absorción, pero ahora para que el resto de su prole llegue a poblar este nuevo mundo. Así se las dan estos cabrones en toda la película, hay intrigas y demás… Pero el problema es que ninguno de los personajes es desarrollado en su totalidad. Tenemos a Garona (Paula Patton), un híbrido entre orco y mujer que es rescatada de su esclavitud. Nunca se sabe como es que un ser así puede existir, aunque posiblemente la respuesta sea «por arte de magia.» También está Lothar (Travis Fimmel), el chingón de la película, cuya única misión es proteger al reino. Está el Rey interpretado por Dominic Cooper, una figura sumamente gris y con poco seso que esperaba muriera en los primeros 30 minutos de la cinta. No lo hace para desgracia de todos.  El único personaje medianamente desarrollado es Khadgar (que cada que lo dicen suena a «cagar») que interpreta Ben Schnetzer. Él es un aprendiz de mago que dejó la universidad por motivos no conocidos. Pero quien se lleva las palmas con personaje menos desarrollado de todos es Medivh, el Guardián interpretado por Ben Foster, quien termina siendo la clave de toda la trama… aunque nunca demuestra motivos claros para sus acciones. A la cinta básicamente le hizo falta extensión, más tiempo para estirar las piernas. Por lo que hemos reportado aquí en Cinergetica, la versión original tenía 40 minutos extra. Posiblemente ese es el tejido conjuntivo que necesita esta película para ser una gran cinta… Eso quiero pensar, porque como está actualmente se siente inacabada. No termina en nada y parece el preludio de algo mucho más importante, el problema es que no se sabe que podría ser. También el rollo está en que se mueven de paisaje en paisaje en un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Simplemente se teletransportan de un lado a otro y eso hace que todo parezca que va en cámara rápida. Otra cosa que tampoco me gustó es que muestran locaciones muy interesantes que sólo están presentes por menos de 30 segundos… ¿Para qué molestarse? El problema es que en EUA no ha hecho buena taquilla. De momento quien está salvando el asunto es China, pero realmente es una mala idea dejar todo en manos de eso. Es prácticamente un volado que continúen con la saga y eso me requeteencabrona. En algún lado hay una buena película dentro de Warcraft: El Primer Encuentro de Dos Mundos, pero por decisiones pendejas por parte de quien sea, mocharon la historia. ¿Vale la pena? Si, pero no como para gastar más dinero en verla en salas premium o 3D… aunque igual si la sacan en 4DX sería una experiencia interesante. Pero no, no hay que dar lana a quien corta tiempo de película por meter más funciones al cine. Mejor échale un ojo cuando esté barato el cine o ya de plano en formato casero… a menos que seas súperfan de Warcraft.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 15, 2019"," If you take “The Lord of the Rings,” “The Hobbit” and “Star Wars” franchises and mix them up in a blender, I’m pretty sure the result would be the new film “Warcraft” – a mind-numbingly dull fantasy world excursion based on the popular video game. “Warcraft” takes place in a Middle Earth-type world where a group known as orcs are on the brink of extinction. Led by evil warlord Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), the orcs open a portal to a peaceful kingdom known as Azeroth and become intent on claiming the land for their own. The kingdom – led by a warrior named Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) – fights back with a little help from orcs, including a half-human/half-orc named Garona (Paula Patton) and an orc warrior Durotan (Toby Kebbell) who seeks a better life for his family. You also get a wizard (Ben Foster) and a king (Dominic Cooper) as part of the proceedings, but really no one brings much to a film that has very little to offer from the start. Director and co-writer Duncan Jones has been responsible for a pair of underrated but quality films (”Source Code” and “Moon”), but he can’t save a film that clearly plays to the video game fan base and chucks any attempt at a broader audience. All the characters and performances are nothing more than disposable parts. You could have easily swapped actors and roles, and I don’t think anyone would have noticed. The cinematography and set designs are just as bland and offer very little imagination in a world that should have been a magnificent spectacle on the screen. Instead, it just looks like the sets were leftover from other films, a series of visually bland sequences that are as dull as the storylines. Unfortunately, “Warcraft” hints at future chapters with the ending leaving more questions than answers. Hopefully, the film’s tepid box-office receipts in the opening weekend nix this franchise. Then again, a second chapter would have nowhere to go but up from this bottom of the barrel attempt at a blockbuster. Another disappointing new release this week is “Now You See Me 2” (C), the sequel to the 2013 film that isn’t nearly as bad as “Warcraft” but doesn’t live up to the surprisingly breezy fun of the original. “Now You See Me 2” finds the Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco and newcomer to the series Lizzy Caplan) forced out of retirement when a tech genius (Daniel Radcliffe) recruits them to pull off a seemingly impossible heist. The job is just part of a grander scheme, with faces from the Horsemen’s past (including Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine) resurfacing to get revenge on the quartet. “Now You See Me 2” uses the same frenetic pacing and visual style as the original, with Jon M. Chu stepping in as the director this time, but it all feels more like a rehash of that first film. You can almost see a checklist of all the stuff that worked in the first film trying to be duplicated, but it just doesn’t have the same freshness the second time. Radcliffe and Caplan are meant to provide a little jolt, as is Harrelson playing a dual role this time as the brother of his original character, but it doesn’t really have the effect I’m sure the filmmakers were seeking. There are a few scenes that work here and there, with Chu’s fast-paced visual style giving a few of the action sequences life, but for the most part “Now You See Me 2” proves to be nothing more than one big slight-of-hand trick. “Now You See Me 2” is rated PG-13 for violence and some language and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 12, Regal Greenwood Mall Stadium 10, and Highland Cinemas in Glasgow.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 1, 2018"," Starring: Travis Fimmel (Vikings), Paula Patton (2 Guns), Ben Foster (Lone Survivor), Dominic Cooper (The Devil’s Double), Toby Kebbell (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Ben Schnetzer (Pride), Rob Kazinsky (Pacific Rim), Clancy Brown (Highlander), Daniel Wu (The Man with the Iron Fists), Ruth Negga (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) Warcraft is a film that has a lot riding on it in the video game community, for it has long been the project eyed as the one that might finally break the video game movie curse. It’s got its creators Blizzard Entertainment supporting it, a wonderfully talented director and massive fan of the property in Duncan Jones, and a budget that is more than ample enough to bring the world of Azeroth to life in an accurate and fantastic manner. All it now has to do is have a well-told story and strong characters…and that’s unfortunately where Warcraft hasn’t quite nailed it. From a basic story perspective, Warcraft is a solid fantasy adventure that relies on tropes of the genre but also puts some unique spins on those elements to create something fresh. Most importantly, it eschews the traditional good vs. evil conflict and adds dimensions to both sides of the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde. It shows that our heroes can be prejudiced and susceptible to corruption, and that our supposed villains can value friendship and honour. In a similar vein, neither side feels like they dominate the other; victory and tragedy occurs on both sides, and by the conclusion there is no finite victory. It’s not quite Game of Thrones levels of complex, but it does genuinely keep you on your toes about which side will win and leaves plenty of interesting avenues to explore in potential sequels. Regrettably, however, a lot of the execution feels fumbled. The story’s pacing is far too fast, especially in the first act as it rushes the audience into the plot without much introduction to key characters and elements of the mythos. Once the film settles in and the story begins to ramp up, it does begin to flow a lot more smoothly, but the hasty introduction makes it hard to be invested earlier on. It does feel like a lot was cut out to make for a breezier runtime, but in the process it’s made the story feel sloppy and overstuffed. The tone of the film is also somewhat inconsistent; at some points it embraces the sillier elements of the lore through comedic asides or references to the game, but at others it takes everything desperately serious in spite of the ridiculousness of the situation. Having said that, the real stumbling block for Warcraft is in its desperate lack of character. Many of the main characters, especially those on the Alliance side, don’t get much personality or development, too often motivated by the necessities of the plot rather than their natural motivations. Travis Fimmel’s Lothar suffers from this the most, being introduced suddenly with little fanfare despite ostensibly being the main character and his only reason for fighting being a bland son he only shares a handful of lines with. There’s a lot of great potential for a complex character in him, but it feels like they haven’t gone much deeper than you’d see on a brief character summation. This wasted promise is similarly felt in Ben Foster’s conflicted guardian Medivh and Ben Schnetzer’s inexperienced mage Khadgar, who are also too thinly drawn to become invested in their characters. Because of this, there are some big moments in the story that fall flat or don’t impact quite the way they should. It wants us to care about the fates and relationships of these characters, but it simply hasn’t set them up well enough for the audience to do so. In an odd switch to the norm, the Horde characters are far more fleshed out and compelling to watch, especially in the conflicts of loyalty displayed by Toby Kebbell’s Durotan and Paula Patton’s Garona. Motivated by his devotion to his wife and newborn son, along with a strong friendship with fellow orc Ogrim (Rob Kazinksy), Durotan possess everything that all of the characters in Warcraft should have by default. Garona is similarly fascinating as the bridge between the two sides, with all including her unsure of where her alliances fall, and the way her story plays out makes for a tragic character with fantastic promise in further stories. If nothing else, Warcraft easily takes the title of most accurate visual translation from video game to motion picture. Though I’m not a huge fan of the franchise, the iconography on display from certain sets, creatures, props and costumes feel ripped right out of any of the games, and though many look garish and impractical on first glance they quickly become just another part of the outlandish grandeur of the production. The visual effects are also impressive and look spectacular in motion, even if the orcs never look 100% realistic. There are times when the movie just looks like a cinematic from the games when there’s nothing but CGI characters on screen, but when paired with massive armour and humongous swords of the Alliance characters it all surprisingly melds together. Top it all off with some beautifully sweeping cinematography (that sometimes even mimics the camera of the classic Warcraft games) and a suitably epic score from Ramin Djawadi, and you’ve got a film that certainly looks and sounds epic even when it doesn’t quite feel epic. Sadly, Warcraft isn’t going to be the film that becomes the blueprint for video game movies moving forward, but it is at least a solid step towards that eventuality. As a translation of the source material, it has all of the elements it needs to be a genuinely great film but it still hasn’t quite grasped that key component: audience investment, and how that differs between the two mediums. In a video game, investment becomes easier because we are in control of far more of the action; we bring far more of our own personality into the experience. But in a film, it’s up to the filmmakers to craft the journey and, through careful manipulation of emotion, make us care about events on screen we have no control over. As much as Warcraft has tried to create a richly detailed world and complex characters to inhabit it, it hasn’t quite done enough to make a passive audience emotionally connect with it. When a video game film can finally grasp that, then we might have finally reached zenith we’ve been waiting for. Regardless of its final quality, I will make this final statement: if you want to see more good video game movies, please go see Warcraft for no other reason than to support an honourable effort and show Hollywood that they are a viable commodity. If you don’t, its failure will be written off as another example that “video game movies don’t work” and we’ll never get anywhere. They haven’t nailed the formula yet, but they are damn close. We just need to give them a few more chances.",POSITIVE
"Oct 31, 2018"," Like a video game that’s all cut scenes and no interaction, Warcraft lumbers across the screen with a sense of inescapable tedium. Whereas most films are content to adhere to the traditional narrative structure of beginning, middle, and end, Warcraft sits itself firmly down in the beginning and refuses to move forward for its entire two-hour runtime. It’s only one of the many problems with this misbegotten, would-be franchise-starter that only the most diehard players of Blizzard Entertainment's series will likely get any true enjoyment out of. The plot, as much as there is one, revolves around a horde of orcs ruled by evil sorcerer Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). Using a dark, life-draining magic called the Fel, Gul’dan plans on relocating his people from their barren wasteland of a world to the lush, human world of Azeroth. Responding to the threat as all good fantasy monarchs do, King Llane (Dominic Cooper) enlists the aid of Azeroth’s resident archmage Medivh (Ben Foster), and a small party of adventurers that includes knight Lothar (Travis Fimmel), wizard-in-training Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), and half-orc warrior Garona (Paula Patton). They may or may not have an ally on the orc side with noble war chief Durotan (Toby Kebbell), one of the few orcs who rightfully deduces that Gul’dan’s uncontrolled use of the Fel is what destroyed the orc home world in the first place. In the hands of a skilled director, even that collection of boilerplate fantasy tropes could make for an interesting, entertaining film. By all rights and expectations, Duncan Jones should be that director, having proven himself already with the lean, mind-bending sci-fi films Moon and Source Code. Unfortunately, when given the key to Hollywood and a nine-digit budget, Jones’ personal style and unique voice gets smashed and buried under a relentless barrage of tin-eared dialogue, wooden acting, and plasticine CGI armies.  Although the source material may have its share of milestones and creative depths, there is absolutely nothing innovative about the adaptation. Everything in it has been done better in other places, except for perhaps for a gorgeous CGI griffin that makes enough appearances to warrant a supporting cast credit. The film is constantly weighed down by a pervasive sense of laziness, from the numerous green-screen failures to the ponderous and simplistic fight scenes, which make even the punch/punch/slam duels of Batman V Superman look almost balletic. Half the cast is comprised of motion-captured characters, most of which look fine enough until they have to interact with the live-action portion of the film, although even then they don’t look as artificial as the sets.  That lackadaisical approach even extends to the actors; nobody gives a truly believable or dynamic performance, although a few come dangerously close to being interesting. Ben Schnetzer’s Khadgar stands out if only for the sense of youthful enthusiasm the actor seems to have for the material, and his tense interactions with Ben Foster — who himself ranges from “as little as possible” to “endearingly Shatnerian” — craft some genuine wit and spark in an otherwise leaden and shamelessly expository script. Their chemistry is far more natural than that of the plot-dictated romance between Travis Fimmel, whose rakishness and rogue spirit is diminished by his wildly inconsistent accent, and Paula Patton, whose already limited range is shackled by an ill-fitting and inconsistently applied set of orc half-tusks that make her lisp like a vampire mook from the first season of Buffy. Toby Kebbell admirably does what he can with Durotan, but any personality he may have tried to inject into the character often gets lost in the effects piled onto his voice. And that’s still more personality than either Daniel Wu or Dominic Cooper bring to the table, who never rise above their respective stereotypes of Chaotic Evil Wizard and Lawful Good King.  What little enjoyment the film offers probably lies in its faithfulness to the source material, even if that’s as much a flaw as it is a virtue. Fans of the Warcraft series will likely delight in seeing so many characters and locations brought to life, and Jones seems to be trying to cram in as many easter eggs as he possibly can. Of course, the rest of us may just end up confused by a film that is constantly and abruptly changing viewpoints and listing off names and places that we’re already expected to know about. Very little of the film is presented in any kind of context accessible to those outside the fandom, and that leads to any number of seemingly random, disconnected moments, including one involving an uncredited Academy Award-nominee who obviously owes somebody a favor. It’s impossible to become emotionally invested in the material on its own merits, and doing so in the first place seems an exercise in futility. There's two hours of build-up, but absolutely zero pay-off. At one point, over the decade of development hell that Warcraft spent between green-light and release, Uwe Boll allegedly petitioned Blizzard for the director’s job. As Boll tells it, they flat-out rejected him because they didn’t want his reputation sullying their flagship franchise. But at least an Uwe Boll version would be an enjoyably awful spectacle of lowered expectations. Duncan Jones’ approach is generic and flat, a fact made all the more disappointing because of the promise Jones displayed on his previous films. This game is over before it’s barely even begun.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 24, 2018"," First off, WARCRAFT is a movie. Not just in the sense that it’s getting a theatrical release, with projectors and ticket stubs and popcorn and all that good stuff, but also in the sense that its makers have worked at creating characters who have motivations and relationships and ambitions, played mostly be adept actors. WARCRAFT also happens to be handsomely made and full of action, but that’s par for the course with a major studio adaptation of a videogame. Is it the best sword and sorcery to be had these days? Even if GAME OF THRONES weren’t around (and it is), the answer would still be “no,” but WARCRAFT has enough sense of internal conviction and general movie chops to be worthwhile. People who know far more about Blizzard Entertainment’s mega-hit WARCRAFT game have said that the film, credited to screenwriters Charles Leavitt & Duncan Jones (Jones also directed), from a story and characters by Chris Metzen, actually has its roots in the very first iteration. This is the pre-history of the Massive Multiplayer Online Game that WARCRAFT aficionados know today. To start things on a note of welcome novelty, we are introduced to events not by any of the traditional heroes, but by Durotan (motion capture performance genius Toby Kebbell), an orc chieftain who is part of the larger orc Horde. As we gradually learn, the orcs’ world has been decimated, but their sorcerer Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) creates a gateway to a green new land inhabited by other species, including humans. Since Orcs like nothing better than fighting and conquering, this sounds great to them, though Durotan worries about the health of his fierce, very pregnant mate Draka (Anna Galvin). In the medieval kingdom of Azeroth, on the other side of the gateway, the Orc incursion is met with consternation. Warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) and runaway student mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) are sent by King Llane (Dominic Cooper) to seek out the elusive chief mage and realm guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) to find out what’s happening. Also in the mix is half-orc/half-human warrior Garona (Paula Patton), who has been badly treated by the orc community, but still despises the weakness of humans. WARCRAFT manages to generate some ethical as well as physical conflict, as Durotan is a very honorable being on his own terms, even if he’s completely happy wading into battle against people who are just defending themselves. It’s also fun to watch the workings of the orc characters, as their proportions are novel and their faces are expressive, even with the makeup and motion capture. Durotan’s conundrums, as he begins to see the flaws in Gul’dan’s leadership, find some parallels on the human side. However, when we get into human royalty, warriors and mages, it feels like so much plot has been crammed into comparatively limited screen time that we don’t get the same sort of depth with them. That said, Foster has completely thought through what he’s doing, and is persuasive in his wizardly depression. Ruth Negga, in a small role as the queen, is warmly regal. The 3D is used deftly, giving us big crowds and large vistas for all of that crafted war, and the costumes and production design are sumptuous. Care has been taken to differentiate the hairy, hulking orcs from one another. There aren’t as many grace notes here as there could be, but WARCRAFT rumbles along, keeping us trying to guess how various alliances will form or fall apart, and how a number of combat sequences will play out. It’s got a good story, it looks fine (apart from a bit of skitter CG near the beginning) and it’s made by people who seem to truly care about what they’re doing. It’s not Westeros nor Middle Earth, but it largely is what it’s trying to be.",POSITIVE

"Aug 22, 2018"," All along the banks of the internet, there is a horrible sound. It’s the sound of critics tearing into new game adaptation Warcraft like hyenas on an injured zebra. They’ve called it “dull-witted”, a “CGI slugathon” and a “colossal missed opportunity”. MaryAnn Johanson from Flick Filosopher said derisively of it: “A masterpiece of cinema that truly speaks to the interests of white male teenage nerds from 1987” – dismissing an entire legion of women and black nerds who also love the game (or are we not considered “real” nerds?). Gamers like myself have long been waiting for a director to bring one of our favourite titles to the silver screen, and Duncan Jones has done it with gaiety and sincerity.  The film looks spectacular, the characters are marvellously cheesy and, instead of the subversive wink to the audience that we might expect from a title like this, Jones is never condescending to his demographic. He is as earnest as a bright-eyed choir boy about these orcs and mages and knights. He doesn’t make us feel stupid for loving them, yet never pretends that these over-the-top imaginings are more than they are. There are no double entendres here, no political metaphors. Warcraft is what it is meant to be: a great-looking piece of escapism. It’s as fantastic and voyeuristic as all good gaming titles are meant to be. Is the acting good? No, it’s horrific. Is the dialogue well crafted? No, it’s about as tacky as you would expect from gaming dialogue. But is it a whole lot of fun? You betcha. I’m telling you to go and see this movie because, if Warcraft succeeds, it opens the door for more gaming titles to be turned into films. And if gaming titles start earning big bucks, that could well see the demise of comic-book movies (trust me, I’m at the point of nausea). Even the likes of X-Men and Captain America have turned into a slog. And then, we might just see a Diablo movie being made. ",POSITIVE
"Apr 23, 2018"," In JRR Tolkien’s Middle-earth, orcs are nothing more than foot soldiers that are too willing to do whatever their evil overlord bids them to do. Their existence serves no other purpose than to wreak havoc in the world. When pop culture took over Tolkien’s creations, orcs were given semblances of character and culture into creatures that were nothing more than literary symbols of the mindless destruction brought about by greed. They became mainstays in role-playing games, with players being granted the capability to build their own fantasies around creatures like elves and dwarves by means of a pen, paper and a whole lot of imagination. Video games then took over, and the added visual component to the world of fantasy gaming pushed the orcs further into the spotlight, making the race of strong but vastly bizarre-looking giants an eccentric choice to represent the gamer. Blizzard Entertainment’s Warcraft, a real-time strategy game that pitted orcs against humans, has one clever conceit. It allowed the gamer to choose a faction to control, giving him the control to command the armies, as well as a perspective in whatever lore and civilization there is in the game for either factions.  Instead of following a pre-existing story that most role-playing games possess, Warcraft has one primary goal for the gamer, which is to completely eliminate the opposing faction. This forces the gamer to imbibe whatever faction he chooses in order to win – whether or not they be the humans that look exactly like him or the orcs that were probably once part of his scariest nightmares.  Given that Warcraft has spawned sequels and spin-offs, it is inevitable that a film version will get made, and at the helm is Duncan Jones, the director of the satisfyingly cerebral space-set mystery Moon (2009) and the fun but smart time-loop flick Source Code (2011). With him, there is a clear effort to pull away from the witless routine of most game to film adaptations. Jones and co-screenwriter Charles Leavitt acknowledge that an immense part of the charm of the video game that they are adapting is the empathy that it gives the orcs. Given this, Warcraft attempts to provide a complete portrait of the land it reimagines in the big screen by providing a story that overlaps between the two warring races. The film portrays both of them as victims of a bigger evil that is gloomily referred to as The Fell. Warcraft’s awfully curated collection of uncharismatic, humorless and archetypal characters is only symptomatic of the film’s very own confusion with what it wants to do. The film seeks to please the fans of the game, yet it also wants to establish its very own franchise of films, with this one being the first of what it hopes to be a whole series. In its push to retain its nagging umbilical cord with the popular video game, it supplies its derivative narrative with various obscure and illogical references, which would prove to be a stretch for those uninitiated with the game’s universe to understand. The result is a film that is overburdened by unnecessary details that unfortunately do nothing to expand the world or to turn its key inhabitants into characters that are worth rooting for. They are just ornaments to appease fans. Instead of turning itself into a predictable invasion story where the only quest for the heroes is to prevent their lands from being taken over by savages, it reshapes an all too familiar narrative into one that is a tad more sophisticated. Perhaps, it is even relevant in this day and age when nations are concerned with issues about borders and refugees. Of course, this is all due to the fact that the film does not make the mistake of preferring one faction over the other. In that sense, the Warcraft film – with its story of mostly tolerant humans protecting their villages and towns from desperate foreigners with exotic customs – is akin to the Westerns where heroic cowboys ride the prairies to defend their homesteads from so-called “savages.” Jones’ film has sprinklings of everything. It has the subtle moral ambiguity of the humans positioning themselves amidst the onslaught of needy but warmongering orcs. It even hints of interspecies relationships. It has sidestories of camaraderie and heroics in the face of death albeit without the charm, the scope, and the defying romance. However, all these are drowned by the artificial gloss and digital spectacle. They are buried by the miserable performances of Travis Fimmel, Ben Foster and Dominic Cooper – all playing humans who have less than half the emotional resonance of their computer-generated counterparts. The film is all too eager to keep itself dumb. It prevents itself from exploring the exciting repercussions of molding a universe that is opening itself to a conflict that resembles one of our own. Francis Joseph Cruz litigates for a living and writes about cinema for fun. The first Filipino movie he saw in the theaters was Carlo J. Caparas’ ‘Tirad Pass.’ Since then, he’s been on a mission to find better memories with Philippine cinema.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 21, 2018"," Based on the Warcraft series of video games — best known for the multiplayer online game World of Warcraft (WoW) — and shot in Vancouver, the film takes us into a medieval world filled with mages, orcs, flying beasts and noble knights. With a visual scheme that lies somewhere between Iron Maiden album covers and airbrushed van art, director Duncan Jones presents a film packed with garish visuals and epic ambition. The story revolves around the battle between the orcs and the humans of Azeroth. The former is a race of massive, Hulk-like humanoids forced to flee their dying world. Their sinister warlock leader (and we know he's sinister because he has spooky, glowing green eyes) has a plan to use a portal to invade Azeroth. But Durotan, a wise orc chieftain, sees the how their leader's dark magic is corrupting his people and decides to seek another way.  On the human side, Anduin Lothar leads the charge to repel the invaders. Travis Fimmel plays the generic knight with can-do spirit and a look borrowed from the Harrison Ford School of Scowling. He's joined by Ben Schnetzer as young wizard school dropout who somehow senses the oncoming threat. They're also aided by The Guardian, a supernatural lifeguard-of-sorts played by Ben Foster, who cranks his acting up to 11. To call Warcraft sprawling doesn't really do justice to this shambolic, Dungeons and Dragons fever dream of a story. You can feel Jones — a filmmaker who displayed a knack for smart storytelling in the movie Moon — straining mightily. Like a bad Xerox of The Lord of the Rings, random characters and races appear with little explanation. Who are the purple people with the impressive eyebrows? Is that a dwarf? Oh look! Callum Keith Rennie in a robe as The Guardian's butler. Oh look! A flying eagle-lion thing. And there's Paula Patton as an orc-human hybrid (and looking like Gamora's second cousin). She seems to have a thing for Lothar. But he's worried about his son. Warcraft seeks to bludgeon us into submission with its vast visuals. But from the tusk-faced orc warriors to the knights in armour, there's a derivative feel to much of it.  While the film's CGI attempts to give the mythic menagerie a sense of grit and gravity, the dialogue is disappointingly undercooked. No one ever tells a wizard to 'Shut up!' in a Tolkien novel, but that's what passes for wit in this realm.  But if you squint and look beyond the crashing mallets and clanging swords, you can see director Jones waging his own valiant struggle to shape this into something grander, notably with the fate of the orcs and Durotan in particular. The warrior and new father is willing to risk everything for his people's future. Indeed, Warcraft is meant to be the beginning of a new movie franchise. Here's hoping the next installment finds a better balance between overwhelming action and satisfying storytelling.  Eli Glasner is the senior entertainment reporter and screentime columnist for CBC News. Covering culture has taken him from the northern tip of Moosonee Ontario to the Oscars and beyond.  You can reach him at eli.glasner@cbc.ca.

"Dec 5, 2017"," Directed by Duncan Jones.
Starring Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Robert Kazinsky, Clancy Brown, Daniel Wu, Ruth Negga, Anna Galvin, and Glenn Close. The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another. As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction. From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home. Never once while watching Warcraft (the silver screen adaptation from the video game and novel lore of Blizzard’s World of Warcraft franchise) did I feel that director Duncan Jones had made a terrible movie, but rather one that was not meant for those unfamiliar with the series, or concerned at all with how critics would receive it. This one is strictly for the die-hard fans, and it shows right from the very beginning. With that being said, it is very difficult to get invested into Warcraft when you are constantly being bombarded with locales and various terminology getting name-dropped left and right. In other words, the common moviegoer heading into this high fantasy adventure will just be left nodding their head up and down at most of the dialogue exchanges, trying and hoping that they understand the gist of what is being discussed. On one hand, this is absolutely terrible storytelling, but after factoring in that Warcraft was not made with someone like myself in mind, I kept telling myself “Man, fans of World of Warcraft are going to be having nerdgasms every 30 seconds watching this”. Duncan Jones (also the son of David Bowie for those that don’t know) is a gifted science-fiction storyteller; that’s just a fact with masterful films such as Source Code and Moon on his resume. Warcraft is not flawed in presentation, and as a matter of fact, I would go as far to say that Duncan Jones wholly understands the material he is adapting, and has a genuine love for both the production process of the movie and his finished product. In some regards, he has made the first truly good video game movie. However, there are areas where Warcraft is not so good no matter your background, particularly the acting. Most of the dialogue comes across as wooden and flat, with no energy. Some actors fare better than others, but the worst of the performances definitely comes from Ben Schnetzer as a young mage alongside the humans. Simply put, he sounds bored out of his mind and as if even he doesn’t even know or comprehend the terminology he is spouting. In general, most of the human actors are fairly forgettable, however the voice-over performances from many of the orcs (Toby Kebbell, Daniel Wu, and Clancy Brown all put in some fantastic work) all carry the right tone and fierceness in their vocal cords to match their imposing physical dominance. Additionally, the orcs are rendered with outstanding computer special-effects, boasting an insane amount of detail all over their towering bodies, over-sized war hammers, and various other facial features such as horns. Towards the end of the movie is a very brutal knock em’ down drag out fight between two of the more prominent orc characters; it last for quite a few minutes and is by far the crowning achievement of the experience, both for its violence and storytelling relevance. It also should be mentioned that although Paula Patton is not playing a CGI character, she does do a convincing job portraying a sort of orc slave with human proportions. The problem for many moviegoers again comes back to the overall narrative, which even if you accept that the plot is geared more towards extreme fanatics of the lore, is still incredibly generic and full of clichés, with nothing really new on display for the fantasy genre. Much of the costume design of the humans is standard medieval stuff, while the orcs, look like orcs. Sure they are rendered outstandingly (and the special effects team does deserve to be commended for that), but at the end of the day they are something I have seen countless times across every other entertainment medium. The story itself is also spread far too thin, leaving little room for actual characterization, meaning that when important characters die it’s hard to really muster up a care in the world to give. Every once in a while though there will be something visually pleasing, whether it be bright colors from the portal connecting two worlds, chrome white battle-armor for the king of Azeroth, a savage looking demonically possessed all-powerful grand mage, and much more. Essentially, Warcraft is a mixed bag as far as visual appeal goes, but with that said, expectations should be kept in check that this is not a game-changer of any kind. Putting it bluntly, it’s generic high fantasy passably re-created with state-of-the-art CGI, that more often than not makes Warcraft come across as watching a high-end produced cinematic from one of the actual games. The best possible news about Warcraft is that after a little over one hour into the movie, much of the exposition and references to things only aficionados of the lore will be able to take with more than a grain of salt, the movie transforms into something of a nonstop action thrill-ride. The last act in particular features a massive battle that is large in scope and beautifully shot (even if much of the scenery and characters look ugly and colorless), with what essentially feels like two different boss battles going on simultaneously elsewhere. It’s a lot to take in, but by that point, everyone will understand the basics of the plot, able to really just sit back and bask in the chaos. So much so, that by the end of Warcraft, I was finally won over in a way. The movie isn’t for everyone, but as I’ve been saying, anyone that has sank thousands of hours into the lore to the point where they have literally lost significant others to their addiction, they are going to have a blast with this movie. Duncan Jones is assured with the material and knows what he is doing to deliver crowd-pleasing results to the hard-core fans.",NEUTRAL

"Nov 5, 2017"," Traditionally, movies based on video games have never turned out to be that great. For every MORTAL KOMBAT (which I’m sure hasn’t aged very well) or RESIDENT EVIL, there’s a SUPER MARIO BROS or WING COMMANDER. So going in, director Duncan Jones’ WARCRAFT is bound to be viewed by most people with much skepticism. And they should, because what we are given cinematically (by an uber talented director, mind you) doesn’t live up to the game franchise’s beloved status. You will have to fight the feeling to walk out – or at least I did. There’s been a disruption in the peaceful force of Azeroth, a human world ruled by King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and Lady Taria (Ruth Negga) and protected by young Gandalf-esque great wizard Medivh (Ben Foster). Orcs are using dark magic called “the Fel,” to open up a portal, fleeing their dying world in order to colonize another, seizing it with brute force. Amongst those leaving for a better life are kind-hearted chieftan Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and his expectant wife Draka (Anna Galvin), who are leery of their leader, nefarious wizard Gulden’s Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), who’s been corrupted by the Fel. And he’ll stop at nothing less than tyranny to reign supreme! Once arrived, the orcs plan to build another portal to bring more of their horde over – something that would spell sure-fire destruction for the citizens of the seven kingdoms of Azeroth. The key to helping end Gul’dan’s reign of terror is “half-breed” slave orc Gamora Garona (Paula Patton, playing the Zoe Saldana of this piece), the king’s henchman Lothar of the hill people (fake Martin Henderson Travis Fimmel), and mage/ wizard-in-training Kadghar (Ben Schnetzer). Good Lord; Shakespeare is less difficult to decipher than this plot. Never has there been a film that’s been more “not for me” than this one. Granted, somewhere in the world, this will be someone’s favorite film – one that will inspire them to get an arm tattoo like Kadghar’s or train their dog in the Orc language. Usually in gigantic tentpoles such as this, the world we’re stepping into is over-explained. Not that I want to add any length to the over two hour run time, but this is one of the rarer cases where important mythology and lore are actually under-explained. That might be a plus for the fans, but for the majority of people who’ve never played the game, all of it will sound like nonsense. What’s the difference between the green orcs and the brown-ish ones? Why do Lothar and Kadghar have to jump through so many hoops in the beginning to go see Medivh? Why doesn’t Draka leave with her child when Ducan warns her? Plus, there are so many loose ends in the third act that are clearly based on a wrong-headed assumption that this will hit big and sequels will be greenlit. See how well that worked out for THE GOLDEN COMPASS? It barely works as a stand-alone film, let alone an exciting set-up for a entire franchise. Perhaps the biggest problem from the get-go is that we’re pushed into a world where we don’t care about any of its inhabitants. When the orcs ambush the humans in their first clash in the forest, we don’t know who to root for as there’s been no hint at any formidable character development. Attempts at humor fall flat due to the stone-cold seriousness of the narrative. It’s a sobering realization that SEVENTH SON, a fantasy film that shares similar aesthetics and co-writer Charles Leavitt, is far better than this. There’s very little to praise, but let me try. I admire Jones and Leavitt’s screenplay for trying to tie in some real-world relevance of absolute power corrupting absolutely, immigration and colonization. However, it never quite comments on these things in a smart, cogent manner. It’s nice to see two female characters supportive of each other. Despite ultimately ringing hollow, Jones – with help from production designer Gavin Bocquet – utilizes scale and scope, building an expansive world. Mayes C. Rubeo’s costumes are beautiful so at least they add some visual interest to the generic shenanigans taking place. Perhaps this film is just for the numerous fans of the Warcraft games, who are already familiar with the world and its characters. Unfortunately, Jones’ adaptation is a longshot to expand that audience. Maybe it could have used some more Leeroy Jenkins. As it is, this should be renamed “Snorecraft.”",NEGATIVE
"Oct 30, 2017"," There are only so many times one can reiterate without tiring that the book, or in this case, the video game, is better than the movie. Even as a video game, a lot of Warcraft's strength lay in the graphics. The movie is no different, in this regard. But when it comes to entertainment value, Warcraft is the kind that can leave you with a splitting headache and an empty wallet. With a plot that's probably older than the Earth - creatures from a foreign world come to invade a settled ruling civilisation's world and before you know it, there's war. But mind you, Warcraft doesn't even want to make good on that. Rather, the final war sequence (spoiler alert) doesn't even revolve around the ongoing spat between Orcs and humans. There's a billion loose ends in the screenplay, likely to be finished off with an obviously impending sequel. Going by the standards of this film though, there's very little hope for the franchise. Characters are equally unoriginal in creation. One good guy who's got a loser reputation and his nose in books (read: not macho) but will potentially save the day. One warrior with tremendous honour who's a hit with the ladies. One conflicted female character who's strong headed and independent. One good guy with a bad side who realises there's still some good in him only when he turns villain. You get the picture. Overall, Warcraft has nothing new and exciting to offer in terms of cinematic quality. Even the visuals and effects, though remarkable in bits, aren't enough to make you sit through. A lot of it also looks all too familiar to Harry Potter, The Lord Of The Rings and Game Of Thrones. Two moments of witty banter do get you to chuckle but it's not worth the ticket price, for gaming enthusiasts or otherwise.

"Oct 23, 2017"," Memo to all writers of what I know you won’t like me calling ‘chick-lit’ novels: you know the central female character you’ve worked so hard on, the one you’ve spent hours and hours making just the right blend of kooky yet lovable and blessed with that surprising passion for high heels, cupcakes or fresh bread?  Well, be warned – when Hollywood comes a-calling and waving big cheque books around, just try to remember how much you love her because, casting-wise, it could, unless you’re very careful, be about to go horribly wrong.  My good friend Sophie Kinsella was lucky – she got the lovely Isla Fisher, an actress with that happy knack of improving just about every film she’s in, to play the retail-addicted Rebecca Bloomwood in Confessions Of A Shopaholic. But others have not been so fortunate. The normally bankable Anne Hathaway was by far the weakest thing in the 2011 film version of David Nicholls’s bestseller One Day, largely because – wobbly Yorkshire accent notwithstanding – she was nobody’s idea of what Nicholls’s central character, Emma, looked or sounded like. There will be men in the audience contemplating assisted suicide themselves rather than spend another minute in her simpering, over-ingratiating and, above all, irritating company. This surely is not what Moyes had in mind when she wrote her bestseller about a young, warm-hearted waitress from a small town who takes a new job as a carer, only to fall in love with Will – played by Hunger Games star Sam Claflin – the handsome quadriplegic bloke she’s supposed to be looking after. At this point, some of you will be asking ‘Emilia who?’ And I might have been too had I not recently become aware of a new unwritten rule in film viewing – every time an actor or actress you’ve never heard of suddenly pops up in a major role, you can be pretty much certain of the reason why: Game Of Thrones.  I’m not a devotee, I’m afraid, but I’ve seen enough of Clarke’s popular turn as Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons, to know that she’s far more convincing in that than she is here.  Maybe it’s the blonde wig; maybe it’s the dragons – who knows? But the fact is that in Game Of Thrones she’s good and here she isn’t. Her eyebrows almost deserve a credit of their own, while her facial expressions – for large parts – seem to range from ‘small simpering smile’ to ‘large simpering smile’ and back again with nothing in between. Indeed, in this particular case it just makes them annoying, which has a devastating knock-on effect on how we perceive the rest of the film. Time and again, there are too obvious echoes of Bridget Jones – mini-skirt-malfunctions, Will’s habit of calling her by her surname, eccentric choice of work-wear and, of course, lashings of romantic snow whenever the story requires.  During her audition for Game Of Thrones in front of HBO executives, Emilia Clarke was asked to dance - so she did the 'funky chicken' and the 'robot'. The formulaic shallowness of Moyes’s underlying story is also exposed. Will may be wheelchair-bound but – naturally – he’s drop-dead handsome, hugely wealthy and, very conveniently, has a hunky Antipodean male carer who comes in and does – unseen – all the nasty, messy stuff that goes hand-in-rubber-glove with life in a wheelchair but has no place in this sort of super-sanitised romantic fiction. All Lou has to do is wander round looking pretty, work out imaginative ways to cheer him up, and desperately try not to fall in love with him.  Too harsh? Well possibly – Claflin’s not bad (oh, how he must wish he was playing opposite his Love, Rosie co-star Lily Collins) and there are some nice supporting performances from Charles Dance, Janet McTeer and recent Doctor Who departee Jenna Coleman, who might have made a very good Lou herself but here has to settle for playing her older sister. What laughing I could hear during the screening was largely female and young. And, as the end drew near (an end that incidentally might have more of an emotional impact if it was clearer what was happening), there was certainly some female snuffling going on.  Normally, as a metrosexual man comfortably in touch with his feminine side – I loved the not dissimilar The Fault In Our Stars, for instance – I can empathise with such emotion even if I don’t feel it myself. But the Los Angeles-based screenwriter and occasional director also loves a good noir-ish thriller, complete with missing dames, drunken private eyes and corrupt city officials.  Just over a decade ago it was the latter that helped revive the then flagging film-acting career of Robert Downey Jr with the highly enjoyable Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which Black both wrote and directed.  Now, however, he returns to more familiar territory with The Nice Guys, a comedy-thriller with A-list central casting – Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe – but with a screenplay that certainly entertains, occasionally dazzles (it has a great opening) but never quite realises its considerable potential. Set in the LA of the late Seventies – and yes, the soundtrack does have fun with the music of the day – it’s the slightly muddled story of a private investigator, Holland March (Gosling), who is hired to investigate the death of a porn star and to look for a missing girl, Amelia.  But Amelia doesn’t want to be found and she’s hired her own PI, Jackson Healy (Crowe) – a man more at home with a knuckleduster than a notebook – to make sure she isn’t.  When Amelia really goes missing, the pair have no alternative but to join forces in a story that at times feels like a cross between Boogie Nights and LA Confidential (do look out for Kim Basinger in a cameo role), with echoes of Mulholland Drive tossed in for good measure. Crowe is better – and funnier – than he has been for a long while but Gosling struggles to bring his character (a hard-drinking single father) to life, while Black takes the easy comedy option rather too often. Still, I wouldn’t mind a sequel. To some extent you can see Race as a pretty standard biopic, with few of the creative ambitions of comparable sports pictures such as Chariots Of Fire.  But it tells such an important story – that of the four gold medals won by the black American sprinter Jesse Owens at the so-called Nazi Olympics of 1936 – and tells it so well that the fact that no one runs along a beach in slow motion to the strains of Vangelis doesn’t matter at all. Among the many things we learn is that Owens faced every bit as much prejudice and discrimination at home in the United States as he did in Berlin.  He was under massive pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People not to run, and the decision to send an American team to Berlin at all may well have been the wrong one. Stephan James, whom you may have spotted in Selma, is excellent as Owens, as is Jason Sudeikis as Larry Snyder, the Ohio State University coach who really didn’t mind what colour a man was as long as he could run fast.  There’s good support from Jeremy Irons as the compromised American Olympic boss Avery Brundage, and from Game Of Thrones star Carice van Houten as Leni Riefenshtahl. What really impressed me, however, was the screenplay from British husband-and-wife team Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, which is clear, well structured and keeps the truly shocking revelations coming right to the end. We finish with two films both aimed at younger audiences of assorted ages, both featuring portals between two worlds and, amazingly, characters that look like be-tusked warthogs. Despite the fact that it’s directed by David Bowie’s son Duncan Jones, Warcraft will surely be of interest only to fans of the long-standing video game on which it is based.  Early on I didn’t care for the overt sexualisation of Megan Fox’s character, TV reporter April O’Neil, in a children’s film, or for the violence.  But it soon finds its stride as arch-enemy Shredder is sprung from jail and enters into a bizarre trans-dimensional, intergalactic pact that sets him on the path for world domination while April and the turtles – along with ice-puck-hurling new boy Casey Jones (yes, really), played by Stephen Amell – try to stop him. ",NEUTRAL

"Jun 1, 2017"," Contrary to what you might believe based on the thrashing it has taken from critics, Warcraft isn't a complete trainwreck. Don't misunderstand: It's not good. But there are moments where its true potential shines through — brief glimpses of the intriguing blend of characters, plot beats and pitch-perfect high fantasy setting that have turned the original Warcraft strategy series and its massively multiplayer spinoff World of Warcraft into an internationally beloved video game franchise. Going back to the subtitle of the 1994 original Warcraft game, the film follows two sides of a fantasy conflict: orcs and humans. Though they intersect in a few important moments, each side has their own heroes, villains and plot twists. The orcs, led by the evil warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), leave behind their dead planet and invade the world of Azeroth through a giant portal fueled by the blood of innocents. On the human side, stoic knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) must rally the troops to defend their capital of Stormwind as the orcish hordes threaten to overrun it. If there's enough high fantasy mumbo-jumbo in that last paragraph to turn you off, you should stay far away from Warcraft. The film fully embraces its source material, for better and worse. Within 10 minutes of the movie starting, it's already throwing dozens of strange character names, epic locations and other bits of terminology at you. I wouldn't necessarily consider this a problem so much as an inevitability, except for one issue: Warcraft never really takes the time to get viewers invested in the characters. The closest it comes to success is with Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the noble leader of the Frostwolf clan of orcs, and his pregnant mate Draka (Anna Galvin). The film actually opens with these two lying in bed, soaking in the final moments of quiet together before the invasion begins. It's a little awkward, as most viewers will still be coming to terms with the heavy CGI makeover the actors have received, but it does a good enough job humanizing these characters and introducing those unfamiliar with Warcraft to the concept that orcs are not just mindless bad guys. Things are not so good on the human side. Fimmel's Lothar is a powerfully boring character. As he struggles with reigning in his overeager son Callan (Burkely Duffield), protecting the human king Llane (Dominic Cooper) and falling predictably in love with the half-orc Garona (Paula Patton), Fimmel ironically fails to deliver the humanity on display during Draka and Durotan's scenes. Where the orc protagonists seem to be trapped in a real moral dilemma with huge stakes and no easy answers, we're seemingly meant to care about what's happening with the humans ... well, just because they're human. This may be my pro-Horde bias showing, but I had a lot of trouble really getting invested in the human side of Warcraft's conflict. And that's a fairly serious problem, since the movie spends quite a bit more than half of its runtime with the larger human side of the cast. Part of the reason humans get more attention is simple logistics. The orcs are new to Azeroth, and they have one war camp, albeit one that is quickly expanding as they burn down human villages. The humans, however, are but one faction of the Alliance, a loosely banded together council representing all the known races and nations of Azeroth. What few glimpses of the wider world of Warcraft we receive come from humans. As with everything else in Warcraft, these moments are hit and miss. There are some real clunkers, like when King Llane summons a council of Alliance leaders to ask for support in the war against the horde. The dwarves, mages and elves that make up the other nations refuse to help ... for ... some reasons that are not terribly well explained. (Inexplicably, in the film's climactic battle, the humans are still shown using Dwarven pistols even though the dwarves seemed firmly against supplying arms earlier. Whoops!) On the other hand, there are scenes like runaway mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) visiting the magic floating city of Dalaran. While the deus ex machina plot beat that happens there is laughable, the city itself is one of the film's greatest moments of spectacle, of the kind it sorely needed more of. Dalaran looks incredible, and especially for those who have visited it in World of Warcraft, it's stunning to see it represented on screen so splendidly. The visuals, across the board, are Warcraft's strongest suit. For as much shit as the movie's first trailers received for overly relying on CG, that concern melted away for me within the first 15 minutes or so. By the time humans are regularly in the same frame as orcs, I was fully immersed in the world and did not find myself distracted by the non-human characters. On the contrary, I regularly had to remind myself that the animation I was witnessing was not just a human actor. This is one point where director Duncan Jones deserves praise. If you've seen his previous films (Moon and Source Code), you know that this guy understands how to make movies look pretty. While Warcraft is on a hugely different scale than either of his previous efforts, Jones' love for the source material shows through in how the film is framed: its sweeping aerial shots of battle, its wide-angle views of Azeroth's gorgeous vistas, even its moments when it gets down in the muck, letting you witness the war up close. In fact, Warcraft is at its best when it's just focusing on visuals and not on characters. The action sequences are, if not groundbreaking in any way, at least entertaining and well-shot. When orcs and humans clash, especially in the climactic battle, it comes across like, well, something out of a video game — and I absolutely mean that as praise. The fights are like extended versions of World of Warcraft's beloved CG videos that are created for each new expansion. They only fall flat when they drop the action for drama, as in a death scene midway through the film that was meant to be stirring and dramatic and provide motivation for one of the heroes, but mostly just left me speechless at how silly it was. Drama may be Warcraft's biggest enemy. As in 2015's horrendous Fantastic Four, Warcraft seems to have missed the memo that summer blockbuster genre movies are allowed to be fun and funny. It's self-serious to a fault, constantly hammering in how awful and terrible the war is in a way that makes it real difficult to actually sit back and enjoy watching it. Levity slips through in a few moments, but it's always quickly deflated by forced gravitas. Schnetzer's Khadgar is one of the few characters given to jokes rather than speaking every line with grave earnestness. Too bad that Schnetzer's lines are often dead-on-arrival bombs like when he enters a massive library and proclaims, ""I never knew this many books existed!"" If Jones deserves praise for how Warcraft looks, he deserves equal criticism for the writing (he co-wrote the film with Charles Leavitt) and especially how it all comes together in the final theatrical cut. Warcraft has no sense of pacing and regularly jumps from scene to scene without providing viewers an anchor — any hints to understand why each scene matters, how it contributes to the overall picture that is forming, why they should care about any of this. These choices would be bad in any film, but for one that's asking audiences to buy into this fairly complicated, goofy fantasy world, it's a killer mistake. The average moviegoer who doesn't know or care about Warcraft already is just as likely to leave the theater unable to remember the names of any of the characters, or to fully comprehend just what the hell was happening in the plot. As soon as negative critical reception for Warcraft started pouring in, Blizzard's marketing machine switched directions on the film. It is, they would have you believe, a movie made by and for fans of Warcraft. Of course critics wouldn't understand! I'm sure Blizzard is right about this to some degree. The hardest of hardcore Warcraft fans are going to find something to appreciate in the nostalgia on offer here. They'll get enough satisfaction out of the thin dusting of magic that's sprinkled throughout the film. But I don't think it will be enough for everyone. For me, as someone who's been playing Warcraft games for over two-thirds of my life, Warcraft was just good enough to make me aware of what could have been — and just bad enough to make me despair that it wasn't.",NEGATIVE

"Sep 26, 2016"," Given the immense popularity of the massive multiplayer online role playing game “Warcraft,” it always seemed inevitable that a movie would be adapted from it eventually. Since the first game was released back in 1994, there have been a multitude of sequels and expansions that have gone towards creating a rich and detailed world full of characters, and while I’ve not personally played them, there have been plenty of people who have raved about how amazing the series is. The question became who should be the one to attempt the difficult task of bringing this material to the big screen. It would have to be someone with a grand imagination and somebody who wouldn’t balk at all the technical challenges involved. In that respect, Duncan Jones (the man behind “Source Code” and “Moon”) seemed like the perfect choice. With such talent directing the film and co-writing the screenplay, what could possibly go wrong? As the film opens, we meet the orc horde from the dying world of Draenor. Their powerful leader, Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), has created a portal to the human realm of Azeroth so that they might invade and conquer it. Their attack immediately catches the attention of Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the leader of the human forces, and while inspecting one of the sites, he discovers a runaway mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer). When these two consult with King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), the latter is able to convince him to seek guidance from a guardian known as Medivh (Ben Foster). The humans begin to plan how best to defend against this new threat, but things are soon complicated when an orc chieftain, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), attempts to call a truce after he realizes that Gul’dan’s power would bring the same ruin to Azeroth as it had to their home. “Warcraft” is the kind of film that, I’m sad to say, almost immediately started to remind me of M. Night Shyamalan’s disastrous “The Last Airbender.” With a film like this, all you can really do is sit back and slowly nod your head in acceptance of the fact that, at one time or another, all of it made perfect sense in the minds of the writers. You can try to question the character motivations throughout, including a dark magic causing some of them to do crazy things or Durotan figuring out rather late in the game that the orc leader is not such a great guy, but really, you’ll more than likely only end up confusing yourself more. The main problem behind all of this, however, appears to be that there’s not nearly enough plotting here to sustain the inexplicable two-hour runtime. The story itself is rather basic: orcs are invading the human realm and the humans have to stop them, but for some reason this short story is stretched out to the point where there are more lulls than actual plot points. Because of this, by the time you reach the halfway point, you feel as though the film should be coming to an end, but you’re merely an hour into what quickly becomes a mess of subpar CGI, a half-baked storyline, and paper-thin characters. The last of these is actually one of the main reasons this film is never able to truly come to life. Along with the unexplainable character motivations mentioned earlier, we are given practically no backstory for any of these characters, leaving them as flat as they appear on the screen. By the end of the film, you’re not likely to remember a single character’s name, not only because they have rather unusual names, but because we’re never given a reason to care about any of them, human or orc. A little character development would have gone a long way for a film like this, but because the writers didn’t take the time to flesh them out, we’re left with nothing to get attached to, character-wise or story-wise. All of this makes it seem nearly impossible that the talented Duncan Jones had anything to do with it. The man who had once dazzled us with the smartly-written, contained science-fiction film “Moon” and the intriguing “Source Code” did indeed seem like a fine choice to try to bring the sprawling world of “Warcraft” to the big screen, but it appears to have been a little too much for him and his co-writer, Charles Leavitt (“K-PAX,” “Blood Diamond”), to handle. No doubt they thought they might get the chance to expand upon their work in a sequel or two down the line, but with the film being a massive domestic flop (though rather popular overseas), it’s unclear if they’ll ever get that chance. “Warcraft” may be a film that’s more accessible to the fans than it is to general audiences who have never played the games, but even so, with its numerous issues, it’s unlikely that even the hardcore gamers would find any satisfaction in this misguided attempt at adapting the material. There should have been plenty of excitement here for fans and non-fans alike, characters to root for as they go about trying to save their realm, and a story to grab the audience’s attention as they journey through this epic world. Alas, what we’re given fails on all of these counts and more, leaving us with a film that is only destined to be remembered for what it could have been. “Warcraft” comes to Blu-ray in a 2.40:1, 1080p High Definition transfer of outstanding quality. The image is sharp and clear throughout the entire two-hour duration, and while the CGI is not as good as it should be, it’s at least displayed well thanks to the excellent transfer. The Dolby Atmos audio is fantastic, giving you all of the dialogue, sound effects, and the thunderous score in pristine quality. Overall, the film has been given great treatment, ensuring a fine experience in both departments. The World of Warcraft on Film: A series of featurettes that goes behind the scenes of the film, exploring areas such as its origin, VFX, costumes, and stunts. With its stretched narrative, thinly-written characters, and sub-par CGI, “Warcraft” is an adaptation that’s not likely to please long-standing fans of the games or those merely looking for an entertaining fantasy adventure. It’s a terrible shame too because there was such grand potential here to build an impressive cinematic world around the material, one that could have generated a wonderful series of epic films. We can only hope that one day someone else will try again, and in doing so, deliver an adaptation that checks off all of the boxes that Jones’ attempt clearly missed.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 14, 2016"," Hollywood has an unfortunate track record with video game movies. While a few films like Dredd and Edge of Tomorrow successfully incorporate aspects of the gaming experience, direct adaptations invariably fall flat. Warcraft is the latest failed attempt. The film, based on the origin story of the earlier Warcraft games, benefits from a ready-made (if basic) fantasy narrative, plus a cast of warriors and faux-historical royals from the Warcraft mythos. You can actually see how this could have been a good movie, but that core story was ruined by almost every aspect of its execution. After exhausting the life force of their homeworld, an army of orcs migrate through a portal to Azeroth, a realm populated by humans, elves, and dwarves. This sets up a compelling reason for war, because while the orcs are technically the invaders, they’re fighting for the survival of their race. The real problem is their leader, the despotic warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). Toby Kebbell stars as an honorable orc chieftain who wants to depose Gul’dan and broker peace with the humans. Travis Fimmel plays his human counterpart Sir Anduin Lothar, indistinguishable from his sleazy-yet-heroic role as Ragnar Lothbrok in Vikings—right down to the Nordic accent. (The British, American, and European accents in Warcraft were seemingly distributed at random.) As a World of Warcraft fan with a respectable pedigree of lower-budget sci-fi movies (Moon, Source Code), Duncan Jones seemed like the ideal choice to direct Warcraft. With his co-writer Charles Leavitt (who penned the critically derided fantasy flop Seventh Son in 2014), he envisioned an adaptation where orcs and humans received equal screentime and character development. This is technically what they produced, in the sense that everyone’s characterization was equally minimal, and the clichéd dialogue was spread evenly throughout the cast. Some Warcraft fans will be happy to see such a thematically accurate adaptation of the franchise, but for the most part, this feels like a disappointing successor to Avatar. The CGI motion-capture does a good job of recreating the performances of the orc actors, but the overall aesthetic is pure cheese, with none of the gravitas of Lord of the Rings. The core storyline, an epic tale of war and the corruption of power, is overshadowed by scenes that could easily have been lifted from the disastrous 2000 Dungeons & Dragons movie: A fight with an unconvincing golem; a council scene populated by extras in LARPing costumes; a whistle-stop tour of video game locations whose names will be forgotten in seconds.   Warcraft‘s cast rivals The Fellowship of the Ring in size, possibly exhibiting an overzealous devotion to Warcraft canon. Why not cut some characters? The first casualty should have been the young wizard Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), an unbearable dweeb with a peach-fuzz beard and no redeeming features. Half an hour into the film, I was genuinely shocked to realize he was meant to be a leading hero. He almost felt like an intentional self-insert for an unflattering stereotype of socially awkward gamer dudes, a magic-school dropout who achieves greatness due to a clumsily foreshadowed “chosen one” destiny. No thanks.  When promoting Warcraft, Duncan Jones and actress Paula Patton (Garona, a green-skinned half-orc) emphasized the film’s Strong Female Characters™, an admirable goal. This translates to a handful of female warriors in the background of battle scenes, plus Garona and two women among a supporting cast of at least ten men: Ruth Negga as Dominic Cooper’s queen consort, and Anna Galvin as a tough orc woman whose main role is to be pregnant and then have a baby. (The green CGI baby is adorable, by the way. If Warcraft involved more orc baby scenes and flying griffins, it would’ve been a more watchable movie.) The film even passes the Bechdel test, with a scene that feels like it was included for the express purpose of passing the Bechdel test. And conveniently, Garona’s half-orc status means she can look like a green-skinned human woman in a leather bustier, as opposed to the gigantic, fanged appearance of the male orcs. After two hours of this, you have to feel sorry for some of the people involved. Cooper, Negga, and Fimmel escape unscathed, returning to dynamic roles on Preacher and Vikings. Robert Kazinsky, a die-hard WoW fan, probably had the time of his life playing an orc named Orgrim Doomhammer. Duncan Jones, on the other hand, spent years grappling with a $160 million studio blockbuster, ultimately failing to translate the qualities he valued in the game. So now the torch will be passed to the upcoming Assassin’s Creed movie, reuniting the stars and core creative team behind last year’s indie Macbeth. Good luck. ",NEGATIVE

"Sep 2, 2016"," An early moment in Warcraft holds a lot of promise. Durotan (Toby Kebbell), chief of the Frostwolves orc clan, and his wife Draka (Anna Galvin) are in their tent. Draka is almost ready to give birth, and the two lovingly tease each other about being fat. It’s a surprisingly warm and human moment, and between two entirely CGI characters. It’s also, unfortunately, the last moment Warcraft shows any ambition. Warcraft is a movie fanatical about perfectly replicating every character model, every location, and above all every scrap of lore and every plot point from Blizzard’s sprawling video game franchise. There are points where director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) will swing the camera out as if the viewer was a player moving units around the map, or reenact moments from cinematics in the game. The problem is that none of that stuff was all that compelling back in the late ’90s when it molded in tie-in novels nobody bothered to read. Warcraft‘s sub-Tolkien silliness has always been the least interesting aspect of the franchise, and an element not even the game itself takes all that seriously most of the time. If you’re a hardcore WoW player or have been, it might be thrilling to see Ironforge or Stormwind for a second, but it’s still just a fairly generic fantasy setting. And the movie spends a lot of time depicting it. For all the plot importance and impact an early montage of places and locations has, we might as well be following Ye Olde UPS Guy instead of the movie’s hero, played by Travis Fimmel. Oddly, the game’s humor is the one detail that’s been nixed. Warcraft games are full of gags and dumb puns, the kind of stuff that makes nerds giggle. Its absence, combined with some painfully clumsy and poorly timed attempts at gags, really emphasizes how dry and generic the whole exercise is as a story.

This still might have been salvaged if the rest of the sprawling cast had been given the small, human moments that Durotan and Draka have. But mostly, they just take meetings. If there’s one reliable measure of an action movie’s script quality, it’s the ratio of meetings to run time — the higher, the duller — and Warcraft is chock full of tense discussions around maps. Boy, does this movie love to gather its characters around a map and make somebody, usually Dominic Cooper, explain the last few minutes of the movie to us. Watching Warcraft left me with an oddly familiar feeling, and as I walked out of the movie, I realized what it was. It was the same feeling I get whenever I have to sit through an unskippable cinematic in a video game. “Cinematics,” for the non-gamers, are little CGI movies games throw in to advance the plot, and there is nothing more frustrating than seeing one fade up, hammering every button on the controller, and realizing you just have to sit there, captive, while the game you paid $60 for refuses to let you do the thing you bought it to do. The really grating part of all this is that Warcraft plays as if everyone assumes it’s going to be a massive hit and that this is just the first of many installments. It might not be wrong, too. This isn’t going to make much of a dent in America; I went to a Thursday night showing, and that was attended by less than 20 people. But the Asian market, and China in particular, is going to put it through the roof financially, or at least ensure that the multiple production companies that backed this make their money back. So we’re likely going to have far more Warcraft in our future, whether we want it or not. But there is one bright spot: At least I didn’t pay $60 to sit through this cinematic.

"Aug 9, 2016"," The many creatures and civilizations who call Azeroth home have lived in peace for generations. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) rules fairly, with compassion, treating human, dwarf, elf and mage all alike, attempting to facilitate a sense of community that will unify the land if evil ever decides to stand against it. His brother-in-law, valiant knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), commands the armies, while the powerful wizard Medivh (Ben Foster) is ready to do King Wrynn’s bidding if ever the need should arise. It now has. Thanks to a magical portal linking far off lands one to the other, orc shaman Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) has lead his followers to Azeroth with plans to rule. But some in this throng do not follow him blindly, especially Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the beloved leader of the Frostwolf Clan. A new father, he is not happy about what it is that Gul’dan is doing, noticing how his black magic the feeds off the essence of the living has transformed him into a shadow if his former self. It has perverted their leader, made him a monster, and while the rest of the orcs haven’t yet realized this to be the case Durotan is not about to see his clan destroyed by any of his insane machinations. Welcome to Warcraft, a movie based on, inspired by or adapted from (take your pick) the phenomenally popular Blizzard Entertainment video game that has been thrilling players around the world for over two decades now. Moon and Source Code director Duncan Jones, co-writing the script with Charles Leavitt (In the Heart of the Sea), attempts to do for this world what Peter Jackson did for J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings or John Boorman did for the King Arthur legend with Excalibur and, in the process, create the first movie lifted from a video game that actually matters. Sadly, he does not succeed. But not for lack of trying or an absence of filmmaking acumen as there is plenty here for Jones to be proud of. The motion capture technology utilized to bring many of the amazing creatures residing in Azeroth to life is astonishing, the orcs most of all. Kebbell, no stranger to this sort of work thanks to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, is superb, giving Durotan pathos and depth in ways that are increasingly astonishing. Anna Galvin nearly equals him as the Frostwolf Clan leader’s loving wife Draka, while Robert Kazinsky as his second-in-command Orgrim gives a surprisingly nuanced performance as the character discovers his loyalties continually shifting to and fro as events progress. The synergy between what the actors all accomplish and the visual effects technicians supporting them is incredible, and as such there is a level of believable intimacy created that is as organic and as concrete as any I could have hoped for before watching. More than that, the scope and scale never feels beyond Jones’ reach. As personal and as controlled as both his previous two science fiction favorites might have been, the gigantic landscape this particular sandcastle has been built upon is shockingly organic, living and breathing with robust vivacious enthusiasm. The director has no problem whatsoever staging massive battle sequences. More, his attention to detail is incredible, and not once did I ever lose track of who was fighting who, where it was the skirmish was taking place and why it was they were at one another’s throats. It’s an impressive feat, things progressing with a focused electricity that’s oftentimes breathless in its gripping joie de vivre. Even so, the end result is something less than wonderful, Duncan and Leavitt’s juvenile script more Dragonheart than it is Dragonslayer, more Krull than it is Ladyhawke, more The Hobbit than it is The Lord of the Rings. There’s so much going on, so many characters to be dealt with and so many different clans and factions to keep track of, a lot of times all of them end up becoming one gigantic blur of fantasy action-adventure supernatural caricatures than they do anything else. There’s also a ton of narrative shorthand utilized in order for things to go from A to B to C, so much of it things break down into genre cliché more often than they do anything else, some of it so laughable it’s almost as if Jones and Leavitt wrote with the SyFy Channel in mind and not for a summertime theatrical release. Then there is the stuff that’s just plain ludicrous. Paula Patton plays a half-human, half-orc hybrid named Garona, and as good as she is in the role – she’s terrific – the character as written is still a total mess right from the start. Kept in chains by Gul’dan, she’s still important enough he makes sure she joins him on the other side of the portal during the conquest of Azeroth. When captured by Lothar and presented to King Wrynn, they decide to trust and arm her even though her intentions remain a vague mystery throughout. In fact, the monarch ends up putting so much faith in Garona he ends up asking her to do the unthinkable for the greater good, a late third act twist that feels more born out of convenience than it does it anything else particularly silly. I don’t have much of a problem with the hints of interspecies romance that take place, and I do love how multicultural the film is, even as it pertains to the Orcs and their hierarchy. There are so many unanswered questions, though, while the blatant set up for future sequels, of which there will likely be none, isn’t just obnoxious, it’s moderately insulting. While there are a few solid payoffs, including a stunning standoff between Lothar and Gul’dan’s chief enforcer Blackhand (Clancy Brown), there just aren’t enough of them to make sitting through all the supercilious cartoon fantasy nonsense worthwhile. Although Jones is still a major directorial talent from which big things continue to be expected from, Warcraft can’t help but be a major disappointment, the game all but over as far as this particular fantasy franchise is alas concerned.

"Jul 19, 2016"," Full disclosure: I have never played any iterations of World of Warcraft so perhaps I fall outside the target demographic for this big-screen adaptation, but this strangely lifeless and disengaging movie must be lacking any of the appeal of the hugely popular video games, which are loved by millions around the world. Director Duncan Jones, a self professed WOW fanatic, tries in vain to give the story from the Warcraft games a cinematic edge - and is left with a thoroughly clunky, plodding two hour-long CGI fest that is likely to alienate fans and newbies alike. The at times unintelligible plot sees a group of fearsome Orc warriors (the de facto bad guys) fleeing their dying home through a magical portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth, home to humans, dwarves, elves and other good guys, led by the exceedingly young King and Queen, played by Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga. Fighting on the side of the humans we have roguish and fearless warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), while on the Orcs team we have Durotan (Tony Kebbel), a chieftain who realises that peace between humans and orcs is preferable to endless battles and mindless slaughter. Other characters have big parts to play - including the Guardian (Ben Foster), a revered wizard and protector of the people who is holed away in a sky-high tower, Garona (Paula Patton) a green-skinned half-orc, half human character whose loyalty is tested, and Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) a wet-behind-the-ears apprentice wizard. Jones wastes no time introducing the characters and world of Warcraft, so those not already familiar to the video game might have a hard time getting on board. Leaving the frequently confusing plot and jargon-heavy dialogue aside, the appearance of the movie is spectacularly unappealing and the 3D seems like a bit of a pointless exercise.  The performances across the board leave a lot to be desired, especially Cooper, who looks to be phoning it in, and the usually excellent Foster, who manages to suck the life out of what could have been an interesting character. Ruth Negga fares better as the Queen, giving her a bit of an edge, while Travis Fimmel provides the only vaguely amusing moments in this steadfastly earnest, tedious adaptation. Although the film desperately tries to inject some emotion and gravitas to the proceedings, the CGI-heavy treatment and underdeveloped characters result in a curiously cold end result. © RTÉ 2024.

"Jul 14, 2016"," The film throws audiences into the deep end of the pool right away. We are in the midst of an Orc exodus. Their home world dying, Orcs led by the evil-looking mage Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) travel through a portal made possible by wicked magic called the Fel, which is powered by extinguishing life. Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin) are among those who travel through the gate as part of the war party establishing a beachhead. The Orcs must gather humans on the other side of the portal in order to power a gate that will bring the rest of their tribe through. The slaughter and pillaging that follows rouse the humans of Azeroth, who live in peace with dwarves and elves. Anduin (Travis Fimmel) gets word that a group of humans has been killed, and is shown by a young mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) that the evil Fel magic is what, um, felled them. So Anduin hops on a griffin (obviously) and flies to the castle of The Guardian, Medivh (Ben Foster), whose white magic will help against the Orc horde. I’ll be honest: I had to rely heavily on Wikipedia and IMDB to reconstruct that first half of the first act. Not so much because of the plot—though it does get more and more convoluted as the movie progresses, in ways that make less and less sense—but because of the names. If you thought Frodo and Bilbo and Aragorn were hard to keep straight in your head, wait until you get a load of Garona and Moroes and Wrynn. Lord of the Rings is the most famous antecedent to Warcraft, and it’s instructive to compare how Peter Jackson eased viewers into Middle Earth versus Duncan Jones’ swim-or-sink approach. By starting in the Shire—after a brief flashback explaining the mythology of the One Ring—with the (essentially humanlike) hobbits, and gradually introducing more and more exotic creatures, Jackson helped us make sense of their strange world. Viewing Warcraft, on the other hand, is like parachuting into the midst of a Chinese village armed with nothing more than a rudimentary knowledge of local wildlife. Warcraft is occasionally kind of funny in the way that big, brash action flicks tend to be, with one-liners here and there lightening the mood. And Ben Foster is always fun to watch. There’s something slightly off-kilter about the actor; he’s often a bit too intense for the subject matter. Regardless, he makes every genre flick he’s in—from the very underrated 30 Days of Night to the slightly underrated Punisher (2004)—a little bit better, and Warcraft is no exception. But the film as a whole is a real mess. Not that it matters. The Chinese market is going to ensure that we are treated to Warcraft stories for years to come.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 11, 2016","  To give credit where it's due; the effects are good for about 95% of the time, and Jones remembers every 10 minutes or so to make use of the 3D and put a prop front of frame to show a bit of depth. But he drowns under the weight of the world of Azeroth and its gazillion inhabitants, old and new. Sure, it doesn't have the luxury of Game Of Thrones' serial set-up to do a deep-dive of all the interested parties' vested interests, but there are too many characters to really care about. Any attempts to show glimpses of Jones's humour and irreverence fall flat when the rest of the film just takes itself so seriously. There aren't even any references to Chesney Hawkes or a ""Leeroy Jenkins"" moment that could potentially elevate it into another league. It's frustrating that a director as talented as Duncan Jones comes up short with his first turn at a big budget movie.

Warcraft: Orcs & Humans was a video game released back in 1994 that you played on your personal computer.  This is back in the day when you needed several CDs to install the program and the computer graphics weren’t all that flash.  It was set in the fictional world of Azeroth where human and orcs fought against each other in pursuit of victory. 
I know this not from experience.  That’s just a summary of what I gleaned from a Wikipedia article.  I was never much of a video game player so I never played the 1994 release or any of the sequels that followed.  The same goes for the almost 30 Warcraft novels that have been published at a rapid rate since 2000.  This movie is my first introduction to the characters. 
We’re told by way of introduction that there has been a war between humans and orcs for as long as people can remember.  This film chronicles where it all began.  The orcs had destroyed their own world and, after using a mysterious portal to travel to the land of Azeroth, they are intent on annihilating the human inhabitants and claiming the world for their own. 
It’s just a matter of who has the strongest muscles and the most powerful weapons.  Magic also has a part to play.  The humans are led by King Llane (Cooper) who has called upon the services of the Guardian (Foster), a strange man who keeps a low-profile but has magical powers at his disposal when required.  The king’s expansive army is led by the wise Anduin Lothar (Fimmell) and he is assisted by a young sorcerer (Schnetzer) and a captured orc (Patton). 
Almost as much time is spent following events from the perspective of the orcs.  They are ruled by Gul’dan, a ruthless dictator who doesn’t like being questioned or challenged.  He’s assembling his own army and is preparing to attack the humans.  Not all the orcs are villainous though.  Durotan leads an influential faction and he is wondering if there’s a possibility for humans and orcs to live together in harmony. 
I’ve said this before but I often feel guilty when a studio takes a chance on something new and it doesn’t quite payoff.  Hollywood takes too few risks these days.  Warcraft: The Beginning contains plenty of detail… perhaps too much so.  It took me a long time to get my head around these characters and the way in which they weave their magic.  It was also a struggle to adjust to the orc’s muffled accents. 
The orcs are the more interesting group.  The division amongst them makes for some interesting conversations.  More of this was required instead of the repetitive fight sequences that are heavy on special effects and not particularly exhilarating.  A few twists have been thrown into the finale but it’s a long wait to get there. 
It seems that Chinese audiences were a lot more positive than me.  The film was released last weekend and grossed $156m USD in its first 5 days.  That’s the biggest opening in history for a movie in China.  In comparison, it made just $24m during its opening weekend in the United States.  The popularity of the video game in China in addition to a fierce marketing campaign paid huge dividends.  Those figures alone will ensure a sequel.  Hopefully a few more subplots will be wrapped up next time.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 5, 2016"," At first it seems as if the movie advocates opposing forces working together for the greater good, but this idea is dropped, to be replaced by the message that violence is necessary to attain peace. The concept of ""honor"" is valued above teamwork or peace, but this is ill-defined. The film features a strong female character, but she functions more as a symbol than anything; she's mostly just convenient for the plot. And she decides to commit an act of violence to achieve peace, which doesn't make much sense. Other warriors exhibit bravery, but they're so thinly sketched that the focus is more on action than their courageousness. Fantasy battle sequences include bashing with giant hammers, stabbing with swords, and slicing with knives. Skulls are crushed, necks snapped. Primitive guns and shooting. Some battle wounds, but not much blood is shown. Characters die. Some scary scenes/characters (monsters, a bad guy sucking the life force from a human, etc.). Gruesome dead body. Horse smashed up against a tree. A (fake, CGI) baby in peril. Parents need to know that Warcraft is a sci-fi/fantasy adventure based on the hit video game franchise, and teens are very likely going to want to see it. The biggest issue is violence, which is frequent and strong, with lots of visual effects, fighting, and killing. Characters are stabbed with swords, shot with primitive guns, and bashed with giant hammers. There are quick images of skulls being smashed and necks snapped and a horse smashing up against a tree, as well as some scary images (monsters, a bad guy sucking the life from humans, etc.) and a digital orc baby in peril. Characters die, but not much blood is shown. Expect a bit of flirting and a woman in a skimpy outfit; while the movie does feature a capable female character, she -- like the rest of the characters -- isn't very fleshed out and seems there solely to serve the plot. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In WARCRAFT, the land where the orcs live is dying, but they can survive by traveling through a glowing green portal to a human-inhabited world. As the orcs begin to take over, the king (Dominic Cooper), his best warrior (Travis Fimmel), and a young mage (Ben Schnetzer) try to stop them. They summon their protector, the wizard-like ""Guardian"" (Ben Foster), and they also meet a kind of half-orc, half-human refugee, Garona (Paula Patton). Meanwhile, the benevolent, noble orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell) decides to try to team up with the humans to stop their cruel leader, who's using dark, evil magic to stay in power. Everything leads up to a final battle, wherein the portal could be opened again, and all will be lost. Disinterested, disengaged storytelling, stale dialogue, and an overuse of familiar visual effects add up to a forgettable big-screen rendition of the beloved video game. Even fans will find this dull. Most of Warcraft is likely to make you think of other, more successful movies -- Avatar frequently comes to mind -- or else makes you wonder what the heck is actually going on. Story elements are either dropped, ignored, or forgotten, and eventually viewers are left either confused or bored. The movie seems to want to be about teamwork and striving for peace, but, as it ends, it seems to promise only more war. Characters are extremely thinly drawn (it will be difficult for non-fans to even remember their names), and their emotional interactions are mainly dialogue-based (i.e. they explain their relationships to one another). There's no feeling here. It's a shame, since director Duncan Jones' previous two movies (Moon and Source Code) were so smart, and Warcraft is just the opposite.

"Jul 1, 2016"," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Una de mis pasiones, aparte de cine, está en el mundo de los videojuegos. Me gusta escribir sobre ellos, al igual que las películas, y aunque por cuestiones de tiempo no juego tantos ahora como cuando era adolescente, todavía les dedico algo de tiempo. Sin embargo, nunca tuve la oportunidad de meterme en el mundo de «Warcraft». Es por ello que fui a ver esta adaptación cinematográfica dirigida por Duncan Jones (Moon, «Código fuente») con la mente abierta. No sabía qué esperar porque no tenía referencias de los juegos, y a pesar de que los trailers no eran tan buenos, consideraba que un director tan talentoso como Jones podría sorprenderme. Y fue precisamente eso lo que hizo, solo que no de la manera que me hubiese gustado. No, Warcraft no es un desastre como muchos otro críticos han manifestado, no se trata de la peor película del año, ni mucho menos. Es más, ni siquiera se trata de la peor cinta basada en un videojuego que se haya hecho. Pero lo que sí, Warcraft es una película frustrante, mediocre, con mucho potencial que lamentablemente Jones no supo alcanzar. La trama no es nada complicada, aunque demora un poco en agarrar tracción. Toby Kebell interpreta a Durotan, un orco que, junto a su tribu y muchos otros guerreros más, viaja a través de un portal al mundo de Azeroth bajo el comando de Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). ¿Su objetivo? Colonizar y destruir a quienes se pongan en su camino. Lamentablemente, quienes terminan poniéndose en su camino son los humanos, que bajo el liderazgo del Rey Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) harán de todo para proteger a los que más quieren. Sin embargo, Gul’dan tiene algo que los humanos no: una magia maligna, la cual requiere vida para poder mantenerse, razón por la cual los orcos van adquiriendo muchos prisioneros humanos. En medio de todo este conflicto se encuentran Gamora (Paula Patton), una mestiza que se aliará con Llane; Lothar (Travis Fimmel) un soldado humano, fiel al Rey y muy valiente, que peleará en la guerra contra los orcos; Medivh (Ben Foster), el mago Guardián, encargado de proteger el reino de Azeroth, y Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), un aprendiz de mago que ha desertado, pero que quiere hacer algo para ayudar al rey a combatir la presencia de la magia maligna (representada por el color verde).  El problema principal de Warcraft está en la edición. Estoy casi seguro que el guión original con el que trabajó Jones hubiese resultado en una película de cerca tres horas de duración; desafortunadamente, «Warcraft» dura solo dos horas (algo corta para una producción de esta envergadura), por lo que el producto final se siente apresurado, caótico. Los primeros treinta minutos de metraje son vertiginosos, presentándonos información nueva cada dos minutos a través de escenas cortas y diálogos breves, sin dejarle tiempo al público para que respire o pueda absorber la historia y el desarrollo de los personajes.  Y el resto de la película, aunque con un ritmo algo mejor, igual sufre de un pobre trabajo de montaje. Muchas escenas se sienten incompletas, como si hubiesen sido cortadas bruscamente para poder tener un filme más pequeño; varias reacciones son brevísimas (o incluso están ausentes), y algunos momentos tranquilos se pierden en medio del caos de las batallas o los efectos especiales. En general, «Warcraft» se siente como una cinta editada a la mala para poder apaciguar las exigencias de un estudio que posiblemente quería un filme corto, fácil de vender a las masas. Me encantaría ver una edición del director o versión extendida con todas las escenas que fueron eliminadas. Visualmente, la cinta es un cajón de sastre. Los efectos digitales y tecnología de captura de movimiento utilizados para traer a la vida a los orcos funcionan de maravilla en los planos más cerrados, e incluso en planos medios. El detalle en los rostros de estos personajes, el brillo y la textura de su piel, el sudor que recorre sus cuellos y sus frentes, es simplemente impresionante. Lamentablemente, no se ven igual de bien en los planos más abiertos, en los que sus movimientos se sienten más caricaturescos y exagerados.  Además, hay un par de decisiones técnicas que no siento que tengan un buen fundamento. Por ejemplo, ¿cuál era la necesidad de hacer que los enanos sean digitales? No se ven realistas, y son un tipo de personaje que muy bien hubiesen podido ser interpretados por actores maquillados y bien caracterizados (como en la trilogía de El Señor de los Anillos, e incluso en la de El Hobbit). Muchos paisajes y fondos se ven exageradamente digitales también, restándole algo de verosimilitud al mundo que Jones está tratando de presentarnos, y haciendo que el público se sienta como en el interior de un videojuego (irónicamente). Esta falta de verosimilitud también puede ser relacionada, nuevamente, a la pobre edición. Si hay algo que hacía muy bien la trilogía de «El Señor de los Anillos», era dar una palpable sensación del paso del tiempo. La Tierra Media se sentía grande, enorme, porque ir de un lugar a otro tomaba tiempo: Gandalf se demoró en llegar hasta Saruman por primera vez; y la Comunidad se demoró más de media película en llegar solo a Rivendell.  Puede sonar injusto, pero en «Warcraft» sucede todo lo contrario. Todos los personajes viajan con una rapidez envidiable de un lugar a otro (Medivh no cuenta; él se puede teletransportar), ya sea en caballo o en pájaro o a pie. Tanto así, que Azeroth termina por sentirse como un lugar enano; solo da la impresión de que existen cuatro lugares: el castillo del Rey, el campamento de los orcos, el lugar donde vive Medivh, y la ciudad flotante de los Kul Tiran. Esto le resta mucha magnitud a la historia y al contexto en el que se desarrolla, haciendo que «Warcraft» se sienta más como un intento fallido que como una verdadera película épica. Las transiciones abruptas entre escenas y las elipsis frecuentes definitivamente no ayudan. Sin embargo, no todo es malo. De hecho, no odié la cinta; las escenas de acción están muy bien realizadas, por ejemplo. La brutalidad de los orcos se siente cada vez que utilizan un arma o le pegan a alguien, y hay escenas que desarrollan tensión de manera muy efectiva. Adicionalmente, las actuaciones no están del todo mal, aunque admito que algunas están en registros diferentes. Como Durotan, Toby Kebell le otorga humanidad y sentimiento a un personaje potencialmente ridículo. Paula Patton está bien como Garona, vulnerable pero fuerte en el campo de batalla. Dominic Cooper se ve algo joven para ser Rey, pero no molesta en un rol simple pero importante (eso sí, el diseño de su armadura es espectacular). Travis Fimmel, no obstante, parece ser el único actor que se divierte. Mientras que el resto del reparto se toma todo absolutamente en serio, Fimmel actúa la mayor parte del tiempo con una sonrisa en el rostro, interpretado a Lothar como alguien sarcástico pero leal. Se trata de una interpretación enérgica y divertida, algo a lo que la cinta definitivamente le hacía falta. «Warcraft» no es el desastre que muchos críticos habían estado despedazando, pero definitivamente es una oportunidad desperdiciada. Alguien tan talentoso como Duncan Jones tenía la oportunidad de desarrollar una historia interesante y visualmente impactante pero, al ser un fanático acérrimo del juego, quizás se dejó llevar por el cariño que le tiene a su fuente de inspiración.  Sé que a la mayoría de fanáticos no les gustaría escuchar esto, pero «Warcraft» se hubiese beneficiado con una estética diferente a la del juego, al tratar de presentar una historia completa (sí, el final es abierto, para variar) y coherente en vez de solo satisfacer a los grupos del fandom que querían ver un calco del juego y nada más. Ahora que Jones ha sido (parcialmente) derrotado por la “maldición de las adaptaciones de videojuegos”, solo nos queda esperar a que se estrene la película de «Assassin’s Creed». En Justin Kurzel y Michael Fassbender debemos confiar. Esperen a ver la edición extendida (2:43 hrs) aproximadamente dura. Y con respectoa la película, pienso que está demasiado bien ya que Durotan aunque fuese un orco, era diferente al resto de Jefes de Clanes por su manera de pensar (rasonable), y siempre fue asi… Vean la historia de por qué usa a Colmitormenta (Lobo que usa en Representación al Clan Frostwolf), es por eso su lealtad con la Horda y no con Gul´dan.  Te apuesto a que querías ver la historia de Arthas, como muchos querían…. pero recuerden que la historia es sobre Orcos contra Humanos (Igual que el titulo del primer juego Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans). Arthas aparecería en Warcraft 3 (ojalá hagan la trilogía) en el reino de Lordaeron. En mi particularidad, me encantó la pelicula y espero mucho mas en la edición extendida que tiene mas que contar, pienso que el director dió lo mejor de él para hacer la pelicula parecida a la historia…Musica, trama, escenarios, personajes… TODO QUEDÓ EXCELENTE PARA MI!!! Es la primer critica sobre la película que me agrada, si bien, me gustó fue mas que nada porque  yo conozco bien su historia, pero tuvo muchos fallos por querer hacer una película muy neutral en la que los orcos no son tan malos y los humanos son muy buenos. La inclusión de las otras razas fueron demasiado forzadas y sin sentido, hicieron una junta con la alianza de todos los reinos e ignoraron al reino de ventormenta y le dijeron «arreglatelas solo» cuando era un problema que afectaba a todo el mundo o el enano del principio que su único fin fue darle el arma de fuego a lothar y ya, minutos extra que no hicieron nada relevante. DIRECTOR: se caracteriza por lograr tramas originales, sorprendiendote con algo que no sospechas, Asesorado por el creador de la trama de los juegos.
EFECTOS VISUALES: de vanguardia, supervisados por el 2 veces ganador del oscar, en este apartado.

MUSICA: por el graduado con los maximos honores de la mejor escuela de musica del globo. Logro la musica de Iron Man I, Piratas del Caribe I y Juego de Tronos.
SONIDO: de punta en Dolby Atmos, DTS:X y Auro 3D. El numero de referencias y detalles con que cuenta es impresionante.Obviamente la debe volver a ver, para darse cuenta de lo que no entendio, la trama es muy agil, no haga apuntes solo ponga atención.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 1, 2016"," For those who aren’t familiar with the video game Warcraft, ask  the new cinematic adaptation probably isn’t for you. This is a feature made for the long-term fans of the game and a bit alienating to those — like myself — who don’t know the game well. Although the feature offers some solid visual effects and a few strong moments, the feature drags on for too long and never offers a strong enough story to keep viewers enthralled. Durotan (Toby Kebbell), one of the lead characters here, is an orc whose world is being destroyed. In order to save his people, he allies himself with the mysterious Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), a fellow orc with magical powers who helps save Durotan’s stillborn child. Gul’dan’s powers derive from a ‘fel’ mystical force that grants him the ability to open a door into nearby worlds. Gul’dan’s plan for survival calls for the orc takeover of Azeroth, a land where humans currently hold power. The orcs begin invading the peaceful land, where they face off against a human army. Anduin Lothar  (Travis Fimmel), one of the human military leaders, takes command and attempts to stop the orc invasion. Lothar teams up with a mage — who operates like a magician/sorcerer —named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and an ancient sorcerer named Medivh (Ben Foster) to prevent the orc army from advancing. Director Duncan Jones, who previously helmed Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011), attempts to build a visually captivating world here and mostly succeeds. His work brings the dueling civilizations to life and his depiction of the large and the commanding orc army stands out as a distinct achievement. Fans of the games will be pleased that Jones honors the source material while building upon it. The script by Charles Leavitt and Jones does little in really building up the myriad characters here or creating a captivating story. Unlike the brilliant fantasy world of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings series or even the breathtaking television show Game of Thrones, this script does little to create memorable characters here. There are admittedly a few solid relationships established but unfortunately, they are given short shrift. Two of them stand out above the rest.  The relationship between Durotan and his love Draka (Anna Galvin) strongly provides a familial grounding for some of the proceedings. The couple’s conversations help establish Durotan’s noble goals and honorable personality. Also, the relationship between Lothar and his son Callan (Burkely Duffield) sets up an interesting dynamic during the raging battles. The father wants to protect his son while the son wants to serve honorably in the military. The other relationships aren’t as interesting though. Nor is the story, which never really adds anything to the genre. Even Garon (Paula Patton), a half-orc who works alongside the humans, doesn’t receive enough time to create a strong character, despite Patton’s best efforts. King Llane (Dominic Cooper) suffers a similar fate. Both actors deserved better than this. Warcraft will likely be remembered for its solid visuals but this cinematic adaptation never does enough to build a story to stand out. Video game fans may be pleased but others should steer clear.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 28, 2016"," Since “Super Mario Bros.” in 1993, film adaptations of popular video games have never done as well as expected at the U.S. box-office. What propels studios to finance them is international acceptance, especially in China, where more than two million people play the World of Warcraft game. The story revolves around a race of gigantic warrior beasts, called Orcs, who are forced to flee from their dying homeland of Draenor when the warlock Gul-dan (Daniel Wu) opens a portal to Azeroth, where they battle unsuspecting humans, led by war-chieftain Blackhand (Clancy Brown). Only the Orc soldier Durotan (Toby Kebbell) asserts that peace can be achieved through compromise with King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and Lady Taria (Ruth Negga), whose brother is the noble knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). In the meantime, Lothar’s son Callan (Burkely Duffield) is determined to impress his father on the battlefield and Durotan’s mate Draka (Anna Galvin) has a baby. Plus, there’s the ascetic Azeroth wizard Medivh (Ben Foster) with his young apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and a fanged half-breed with green skin, Garona (Paula Patton), who claims to be half-Orc and half-human. Utilizing Chris Metzen’s branded characters and story, British director Duncan Jones (“Moon,” “Source Code”), sharing co-writing credit with Charles Leavitt (“In the Heart of the Sea”), crowds the sci-fi plot with too many mythical creatures, magical subplots and visual effects, since all the exotic Orcs are motion-captured via digital animation. The concept also ‘borrows’ liberally from films like “The Lord of the Rings,” “Star Wars,” “Avatar,” “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” and TV’s “Game of Thrones.” FYI: originally named Zowie, Duncan Jones is David Bowie’s son; his birth prompted Bowie to write the song “Kooks” for his 1971 album “Hunky Dory.” In conclusion, one should note that – in the past few years – the gaming industry has evolved, abandoning “games” in the literal sense in favor of inter-action, creating a mini-cinematic experience for players.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 24, 2016","Unless you are very familiar with the video game or novels, trying to follow the plot of this movie is like trying to follow a story committee meeting in which the participants are having a lot of disagreements. It is hardly a standalone story.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 23, 2016"," You can tell there is a lot of heart and effort that went into the making of “Warcraft,” which makes its artistic failure as a would-be fantasy epic all the more depressing. Hackneyed and cliched, it tries to rise to level of the “Lord of the Rings” films but never quite gets off the ground. That it was co-written and directed by the talented Duncan Jones (“Moon,” “Source Code”) only adds to the frustration when sitting through it. Based on one of the best-selling video game series of the past twenty-odd years, it’s a prequel of sorts, consisting of a simplistic story crammed full of boring exposition and mostly uninteresting characters. The plot, to use the term loosely, is a first-contact story detailing the arrival of the brutish orcs on the world of Azeroth via a portal opened with black magic called the Fell by the warlock Gul’Dan (Daniel Wu). The orcs have fled their dying world, oblivious to the fact that the Fell consumed its life force and has slowly corrupted them. One chieftain, Durotan (Tony Kebbell), suspects the truth, and seeks a way out for at least some of his people. Meanwhile, King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper, Preacher) and soldier Anduin Lothar (Travis Flimmel, Vikings) flit back and forth between their realms and their castle as they fret over what to do; rookie wizard/bargain bin Luke Skywalker analog Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) investigates the source of power behind the orcs; enigmatic sorcerer Medivh (Ben Foster rocking a slightly Christ-like beard and some snazzy robes) hangs around looking stoned; and half-orc Garona (Paula Patton) proves that Kermit the Frog was right and that it really isn’t easy being green. “Warcraft” is a very busy movie that spends a lot of time flitting around but going absolutely nowhere, in a constant rush as if to distract us from the fact that it’s a sprawling story a mile wide but only an inch deep. The only time it perks up is when the orcs are onscreen, specifically when the focus is on Durotan’s story; there’s some genuine drama and compelling storytelling to be had there, but alas it falls into self-seriousness sealed with a clunky and ill-conceived Moses analogy (seriously). The movie also suffers from inconsistent pacing and surprisingly sloppy production. There are some clunky edits (most likely made to avoid an R rating) and the effects are often generic and even shoddy and unconvincing. There are times when one is left wondering if exteriors were actually shot on location or on a soundstage in front of a green screen and just badly lit. Warcraft’s biggest sin, however, is one that filmmakers should know to avoid by now: Focus on the movie you are making, not on setting up the sequel you haven’t earned. Have we learned nothing from “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” or “Terminator: Genisys”?",NEGATIVE
"Jun 23, 2016"," Boy it’s been a bad year for fantasy cinema in America. Time and time again fantasy films have failed for the most part, and “Warcraft” is one of those casualties. I admittedly have no experience with “Warcraft,” but for those unaware, it’s based on a massive multiplayer role playing game that’s become so popular it’s almost a way of life for most people. It’s a game so terrifyingly addictive, that a cousin of mine even pulled me aside once warning me not to play lest I be sucked in. Now that their Orc world has died, the orc shaman Gul’dan has used dark magic to open up a portal to the human realm of Azeroth. Once a peaceful land ruled by man, the Orc army known as The Horde, now plan to populate the world and rule over it as their new home led by the noble Orc warrior Durotan. Teamed with a female half Orc named Garona, the human army of Azeroth plan to go to war with them, led by fierce warrior Lothar, their King Llane, and two wizards. Events spiral out of control though when Durotan begins rethinking the invasion and their leader Gul’dan, while Garona is torn between her loyalties to the noble humans and her people. While I’m still convinced video games just won’t translate in to a good movie, “Warcraft” is still a very good time and a nice bit of escapism. It’s a mess narrative wise, and is painfully convoluted, but often times I found myself very entertained and intrigued by the conflict of the Orc breed struggling to fight for a new world against a human race. There’s also the themes of religious corruption embedded within the giant walking statues and graphic war scenes, which probably also helped enhance the experience. I won’t argue “Warcraft” is a masterpiece, since it tries and often fails to reach “Game of Thrones” levels of drama and intrigue. In the attempts to be just as adult in its character dynamic and ideas about xenophobia, and warfare, it becomes tough to follow. The first half hour has a lot of information to disperse to the general broader audience, and I literally had to sit at attention to hopefully absorb what exposition the writers were trying to relay to people that have never been in to the digital world of Azeroth. Much to my surprise I cared about the characters and conflicts. I wanted to see sword wielding hero Lothar stop the impending Orc invasion, all the while uncovering the rising evil tide of his kingdom’s powerful mage. Director Duncan Jones splits the time of the film between the Orcs and humans and turns Durotan in to a very complex hero with his own ideas about what can be gained by invading Azeroth. All the while Jones stages some fun battle sequences, including a showdown between Lothar and a murderous general in the climax. While not everyone’s performances are top notch, Travis Fimmel is great as Lothar, while Toby Kebbell does a bang up job with his motion capture performance as Durotan. It’s up in the air at the moment if “Warcraft” will continue in to a second part of its epic tale; I’m not ashamed to admit I had a good time, and should we be granted a follow up, I just may return to see how the humans win back Azeroth.",POSITIVE
"Jun 23, 2016"," No me puedo considerar un experto en Warcraft. Ni de cerca. Jamás he jugado en línea y tengo un vago recuerdo de los primeros juegos. Eso sí, con todo el impacto mainstream de su momento cumbre, recuerdo pasar horas aferrado en el modo historia de Reign of Chaos (2002) que fue una maravilla. Además, claro, de que diariamente juego mi dosis ñoña del Magic edulcorado que es Hearthstone. Así, a pesar del recuerdo oxidado de este vasto mundo, a pesar de todas las críticas que había escuchado y a pesar de la sorna que mis acompañantes periodistas echaban a media película, no pude odiar el resultado. Hay algo en esta cinta que me cautivó y que aplaudo, en medio de todos sus visibles errores. Porque Warcraft es para un público específico al que consciente y atiende. Es un logro, sin duda, balancear el impacto de las producciones millonarias y el cariño hacia un público específico (véase Guardians of the Galaxy), pero Warcraft no hizo concesiones: esto es masividad para un grupo restringido de cariñosos geeks. Y para hacer eso, incluso en nuestra era de amor a la ñoñés diluida, se necesita un inmenso valor. Crear algo tan específico en un modo tan enorme es exponerse al desprecio de todos aquellos que se sienten marginados por un universo que desconocen. Y aquí, el contexto no se les da a cucharadas cuidadosas sino con un enorme mazo en la cara. Es por eso que las críticas destrozaron la cinta, es por eso que los medios no especializados la desdeñaron y es por eso que, en el cine, verán a gente burlándose altaneramente. Y no, ésta no es la peor película del año, esta cinta no se compara con Fantastic Four (2015) y Duncan Jones, definitivamente, logró algo mucho mejor de lo que todos esperaban. Aquí va, entonces, en forma de reseña SIN SPOILERS, un eco de cariño ñoño que intentará defender los logros de una cinta que merece continuar en franquicia. Porque aquí, contra todas las leyes del mercado, un amplio presupuesto se casó con una intimidad única para el corazón geekero de sólo algunos. Se habla mucho de la maldición de los videojuegos: parece imposible trasladarlos al cine sin crear una completa pifia. Digo, yo creo que Mortal Kombat (1995) y la terrible Street Fighter (1994) tienen su encanto: la primera por ser una completa locura alucinada (y por Christopher Lambert con rayos en los ojos); la segunda por tener el honor de ser una de las últimas apariciones de ese gran tipo mítico que fue Raúl Juliá. Antes tuvimos la terrible película de Super Mario Bros. (1993) –a pesar de Bob Hopkins, John Leguizamo y, claro, el gran Dennis Hopper como Koopa–, y luego vinieron los horrores imperdonables de la saga de Resident Evil (2002); babosadas sin sentido como Pixels (2015) –que, aunque no sea adaptación, se empantana en revivir viejos juegos ochenteros–; las locuras de Dead or Alive (2006); las espantosas Alone in the Dark (2005) y Farcry (2008) del pobre Uwe Boll –que quiso dirigir Warcraft pero que Blizzard, con justa razón, mandó a volar–; los horrores recientes sin alma de Angry Birds (2016) y Need for Speed (2014); las dos bazofias de Hitman (lo siento Mila Kunis); la pésima adaptación de Doom (2005) y un largo etcétera que sólo se salva, tal vez, con la visualmente impactante e innovadora Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001). En este marco poco halagador, Warcraft exigía, desde hace tiempo, una adaptación. Porque es un juego que ha cambiado al mundo con la red de gaming online más tremenda de los últimos tiempos, con una franquicia tan vasta como compleja y una historia inmensa con mitología propia y ramificaciones que van desde líneas temporales paralelas a descubrimientos de nuevos continentes y antiguas amenazas. Entre todo esto, no había muchas esperanzas puestas en la película. ¿Cómo adaptar un videojuego con una historia tan enorme? ¿Cómo lograr vencer la maldición de las adaptaciones con algo tan ambicioso? Nadie podía responder a estas preguntas… y nadie contaba con el as que Blizzard tenía bajo la manga. Para lograr la hazaña, la casa productora contrató a un fan declarado de Warcraft, un gran ñoño admitido y cariñoso, un talento incuestionable en la dirección que ya nos había demostrado su enorme capacidad con el clásico contemporáneo Moon y con su segunda cinta, menos afortunada pero también bastante sólida, Source Code. Duncan Jones puso todo su cariño geek en esta película que resulta un blockbuster de verano pero que se siente curiosamente íntima y personal. La historia comienza en el marco de la Primera Guerra de la mitología de Warcraft, cuando los orcos, guiados por el perverso Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), cruzan por primera vez el Portal Oscuro con una ofensiva mayor, para invadir el pacífico reino de Azeroth. En el marco de la trama fílmica, el asunto se simplifica: ya existía una precaria alianza antes de la invasión de los Orcos y el rey Llane (Dominic Cooper) está a la cabeza del reino de Stormwind, en conjunto con los otros reinos de Azeroth. Se ve la estrecha relación con los enanos y los altos elfos, se ve la concordia de todos en este universo apenas explorado. Pero, del otro lado, dentro de la Horda, hay tensiones reales. El líder del pequeño clan Frostwolf, Durotan (Toby Kebbel), comienza a dudar de las intenciones de su líder Gul’dan y, en particular, de su uso indiscriminado de la Fel Magic, una magia poderosa que consume vida y que termina pervirtiendo profundamente a todo aquél que la controla. Se ven, así, los primeros lazos con la Burning Legion sin que todavía se explique, en la trama de esta cinta, los potenciales conflictos que después vendrán. Durotan intenta entonces separarse de la horda prometiendo una alianza con los humanos para derrotar a Gul’dan antes de que destruya otro mundo como también destruyó Draenor, el mundo orco. Durotan, claro, vive un momento difícil: al atravesar el Portal Oscuro, lo siguió su esposa, embarazada de su primogénito que nace, apenas cruzado el umbral, en Azeroth. Gul’dan le insufló vida con la Fel Magic y Durotan no puede más que cuestionar cuáles serán las consecuencias de este acto nefasto en el desarrollo de su hijo. Formando una peculiar alianza con el gran guerrero humano y mano derecha del rey, Sir Aduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), Durotan se enfrentará a su propio clan con todas las consecuencias nefastas que esto puede tener. Mientras, en el lado de los hombres, el joven y talentoso mago Khadgar (Ben Shnetzer) comienza a descubrir las raíces de la Fel Magic después de la llegada de los orcos. Y sus indagaciones pueden tener, también, ramificaciones terribles. Todo parece indicar, en efecto, que alguien en Azeroth ayudó a los orcos a abrir el portal. La misteriosa raíz de este mal en el mundo de los hombres se observa en el combate interno del gran mago y guardián del reino, Midivh (Ben Foster), que, después de seis años de aislamiento, no parece ser tan poderoso como alguna vez lo fue… Y todos estos conflictos se entretejen en una compleja red de alianzas y traiciones que llevarán a un desenlace que promete mucho futuro. Porque esto es apenas la instalación de un universo: entre toda la red de tramas que se nos presentan, vemos, por ahí, junto con la consolidación del gran Lothar, el nacimiento de un guerrero que, tal vez portará, algún día, el nombre de Thrall. Como pueden darse fácilmente cuenta, aquellos que no estén familiarizados con el mundo de Warcraft se pueden perder fácilmente en la enorme cantidad de personajes y en sus profundas resonancias. Porque aquí no nada más tenemos a Lothar, Khadgar, Gul’dan, Durotan y Medivh, sino también a Orgrim Doomhammer (Robert Kazinsky), a Blackhand (Clancy Brown), a un muy joven Varian Wrynn, y a la presencia maléfica e innombrada de Sargeras. Es por eso que hay algo tan cariñoso aquí que resuena profundamente en el ñoño pecho de cualquiera que tenga propensión geek: esta adaptación no se va por la tangente explicativa y maniquea de Hollywood. No, aquí Jones no nos lleva al mundo de Warcraft con paciencia y cuidado: la introducción es, por el contrario, confusa, caótica y directa; este mundo se nos planta en pantalla con una explicación mínima de sus ramificaciones y, muy rápido, exige que entremos de lleno en la lógica de la fantasía pura y dura. Es por eso también que aquellos que sólo tienen como referencia de fantasía las películas de Lord of the Rings y la serie de Game of Thrones no van a ver con ojos cálidos este violento ingreso a otro universo que demanda una comprensión exigente. Es cierto, el universo de Warcraft nació de un imaginario de fantasía bastante claro: hay orcos malos y humanos buenos; los enanos están en minas creando armas; los elfos son antiguas y poderosas creaturas; hay grifos, destellos medievales, poderosos conjuros de magia negra y blanca; dioses y demonios antiguos; portales entre mundos y paisajes majestuosos llenos de misterio. Éste es, claramente, el legado de C. S. Lewis y J. R. R. Tolkien. Pero no nada más. Como estructura misma, el juego de Warcraft plantea un mundo en permanente guerra que no puede ser maniqueo: las fuerzas del bien y del mal son puntos de vista relativos y hay héroes en todos los bandos. Incluso, visto como una poderosa fuerza totalitaria, la antigua maldición de Sargeras tiene intenciones de bondad trascendente: destruir completamente el mundo para crearlo de nuevo sin sus principios de corrupción constitutiva. En este sentido, por el hecho mismo del gameplay en donde se puede cambiar de bando entre campañas (como también propuso el mítico juego de Blizzard, Starcraft), una adaptación fiel requería que no se planteara una versión moral simplificada de bondad contra maldad. De hecho, el primer guión a cargo de Sam Reimi, disgustó profundamente a Duncan Jones por ese mismo motivo: el joven director quería transmitir algo más que una burda pelea entre los humanos como bondad pura y paz y la Horda como facción guerrera fundamentalmente perversa. Como estructura misma, el juego de Warcraft plantea un mundo en permanente guerra que no puede ser maniqueo: las fuerzas del bien y del mal son puntos de vista relativos y hay héroes en todos los bandos. Como estructura misma, el juego de Warcraft plantea un mundo en permanente guerra que no puede ser maniqueo: las fuerzas del bien y del mal son puntos de vista relativos y hay héroes en todos los bandos. Así, esta película guarda algo profundamente cercano al sentido mismo del juego: los villanos están en todas partes y los héroes son de todos los bandos; las maldiciones antiguas trascienden a los guerreros y las víctimas siempre son los pequeños combatientes que se quedan atrapados en un conflicto masivo que los sobrepasa en tiempo y espacio. En ese sentido, esta adaptación fue hecha por un fanático para todos los fanáticos. Y se siente también en los detalles: vemos el juego visual con los magos creando círculos alrededor de ellos para los encantamientos; las perspectivas elevadas en dónde se pueden observar los establecimientos de la Horda consumiendo madera y recursos; la estética de armas masivas y de cuerpos masivos… Así, en general, disfrutamos aquí de un apabullante aspecto visual que refuerza profundamente el respeto al juego y los guiños a los que lo disfrutaron, o lo siguen disfrutando, en sus distintas formas. Es por eso también que, a pesar de la enorme cantidad de CGI utilizado para crear este mundo imposible e improbable, encontramos en él el cuidado de un fanático y el detallismo de un perfeccionista. Porque Jones pulió hasta el más mínimo detalle en la encarnación de criaturas diversas, en el despliegue del mapa milenario de Azeroth desde el techo de la fortaleza de Stormwind hasta la torre de Karazhan y, claro, en la guerra con sus banderas, colmillos, armas y armaduras. Así, a pesar de no poder llegar a los extremos de Game of Thrones, las batallas están representadas de manera bastante cruda y brutal. Porque Jones pinta un universo que está destinado a un amplio público en su clasificación pero que sabe explotar bastante bien sus proezas visuales para mostrar lo cruento de las batallas, de las muertes, de la enorme violencia paciente de Gul’dan y de la desmesura de fuerza entre los orcos y los hombres. Pero, claro, no todo este gusto ñoño por la película no quiere decir, tampoco, que sea una cinta perfecta. Ni de cerca. Porque Warcraft es un proyecto demasiado ambicioso: Jones quiso contar su propia historia, traducir el comienzo de la mitología de Warcraft con el primer contacto de Azeroth y Draenor durante la Primera Guerra y establecer el principio de una franquicia en poco más de dos horas. Es una tarea titánica que todo el cariño voluntarioso del mundo no puede abarcar. Y sí, el detallismo visual, los guiños a los fanáticos, la panoplia de personajes y la trama general acorde a una mitología y a un gameplay, terminan por empantanar un guión que no siempre logra los efectos que busca. Mientras que los personajes de los orcos tienen aristas interesantes y una cierta profundidad, sus oponentes humanos no siempre están muy bien logrados. Mientras que Anduin tiene un carisma indudable y logra proyectar su seguridad y fortaleza con porte, el rey Llane y su esposa Taria son personajes bastante esquemáticos, mal actuados y mal caracterizados que muestran, solamente, la premura con la que querían deshacerse de ellos los escritores y el director. También, si el sufrimiento interno de Medivh está muy bien representado por Ben Foster, si Khadagar, Garona y Anduin son personajes interesantes (sin llegar muy lejos en sus conflictos), las interacciones entre ellos acaban siendo algo acartonadas, los giros de humor en el guión no siempre funcionan y las emociones que despliegan no llegan a impactar profundamente. Así, el guión cae con frecuencia en frases ya hechas, en clichés esperados y en formulaciones que, lejos de funcionar íntegramente en la trama, resultan torpes. Y también podemos observar en esta cinta un pecado común en los inicios de franquicia. Como pasó con Batman v Superman, se siente en Warcraft la necesidad de crear rápidamente un universo amplio para después desarrollar, con más detenimiento sus conflictos. Esta premura es la que causa, en muchas ocasiones, la impresión de que se abarcan demasiados temas sin llegar a profundizar íntegramente en ninguno de ellos. La película no tiene un inicio ni un final claro y, si la sensación de entrar a la trama in media res sirve para dialogar con los fanáticos, el final abierto deja demasiadas tramas sin resolver que exigen una continuación de la que aún no podemos prometer la realización. En ese sentido, si los grandes magnates no exigen una secuela a esta película o descartan a Jones para dirigir, rápidamente, una continuación, podríamos quedarnos con una cinta que prometió cosas grandes pero que se quedó, empantanada bajo su propio peso, en futuros incumplidos. Y eso sería una verdadera lástima. Finalmente, Jones imprime un toque cariñosamente geekero a su mega blockbuster logrando un resultado endeble en muchos aspectos pero que resulta, al final, entrañable e intrigante.Warcraft encuentra sus logros y sus deficiencias en que no es una película para cualquiera. Aun así, tiene más encanto de lo que una crítica, poco acostumbrada a la fantasía y a esta mitología, le quiso dar. Porque esta película respeta el sentido del juego, visual y temáticamente, logra ser entrañable y poderosa y plantea, ciertamente, el inicio de una franquicia que podría dar increíbles resultados. Con todas sus torpezas, con el guión acartonado y la complejidad de sus ambiciones ñoñas, la cinta exige un alto compromiso del espectador. Así, es fácil sentir que se pierde el interés, en la extensión de la cinta, por todas las ramificaciones de la trama que no terminan por mostrar un camino claro en la historia. Aquellos que conocen el juego y la mitología, aquellos que disfrutan de todas las locuras de la fantasía con recuerdo a las excéntricas sagas de estética rebuscada de los años ochenta, podrán tener la paciencia suficiente para abandonarse al esplendor visual y disfrutar la película con todo y sus pecados derivativos. Aquellos que nunca han disfrutado este tipo de universos y no conocen nada del juego, van a rendirse mucho antes y podrían llegar a sufrir verdaderamente estas dos horas de locura estrafalaria. Al final, es verdaderamente ñoño lo que sólo es para el gusto de la sesuda ñoñés. Dividiendo opiniones por su clavadés rebuscada, esta película sólo tiene encanto para los que siempre van a disfrutar la fantasía alocada y las ramificaciones de una historia que va mucho más allá de lo que están viendo en pantalla. Para ellos, todo, para los demás nada. Y esto, en sí, me parece una apuesta valiente que, a pesar de sus enormes deficiencias, nos muestra cómo Duncan Jones es capaz de cambiar la escala de sus presupuestos apostando siempre por el público al que le tiene más cariño (aunque esto signifique, aquí, el completo desprecio de la crítica mundial). Esta película es mucho más de lo que aparenta y mucho menos de lo que pretende. Con todo, no es ninguna decepción y, de hecho, me parece una grata sorpresa que volvería a ver, encantado, por su ambición desproporcionada y sus torpezas entrañables. Tal vez sea el único que opina esto, dejándome llevar por mi ñoñez constitutiva. Tal vez. Lo que sí es que esta película me hizo sentir una fascinación por un mundo nuevo de fantasía en pantalla que hacía mucho tiempo no sentía. Y si eso no es loable en una perspectiva amplia, al menos, en mi vida, es tan significativo como la primera vez que vi, en la pequeña pantalla de mi computadora, el mundo fascinante de Warcraft desplegándose para mis ojos con toda la emoción de una curiosidad infantil que aún no se daba por vencida.",POSITIVE

"Jun 23, 2016"," Even when you set aside the curse of the video game adaptation, Warcraft: The Beginning‘s status as the first really ambitious big screen fantasy since Jackson met Tolkien means the odds were always stacked against it. Although only marginally brighter in tone and colouring than Jackson’s films, the so-called “high” fantasy world portrayed on screen here just can’t shake a slight feeling of silliness within the context of contemporary pop culture. If we can somehow separate the film from the expectations implied by the genre-defining LOTR – and the genre-redefining Game of Thrones, for that matter – the unique pleasures of Warcraft: The Beginning become a little easier to embrace. The greatest of those is a commitment to presenting the other side of the battle between man and monster, done so by splitting the perspective between the noble humans and the hoarding CGI orcs, rendered in luscious mo-cap informed by a tangible physicality. The battles are staged with creativity, there’s a heap of cool action set-pieces, and some fantastic backdrops. Some of the humans (Bens Foster & Schnetzer) are wizards, and as admirable as the film is in replicating magic from the game, their spell-casting scenes occasionally evoke the earnest staging of a sub-par Renaissance Faire. The evil magic in the film is represented by an everpresent flourescent green mist that perhaps represents the film’s greatest barrier to being taken seriously. Ominously emanating from the eyes of the evil Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), the mist flows into whomever he controls and helpfully turns them green so we know they’re bad. The colour can’t help but recall the titular ooze from 1991’s TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze and stands as a visual metaphor for Warcraft‘s hammier elements. I had a ball watching Warcraft: The Beginning. But enjoying it may require a willingness to go along with the film’s creative choices. And a high tolerance for bright green.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 21, 2016"," Apart from fans of the popular video game World of Warcraft, the movie Warcraft is also of interest to two other sets of viewers: those who have been missing their regular dose of orcs, dwarves, wizards and kingdoms caught between sorcery and normalcy, and fans of Duncan Jones. The British filmmaker has built a solid reputation on the basis of the films Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011). Both were well-directed and performed movies that were packed with smartly explored themes and visual tricks. Jones’s first big-budget movie is, by contrast, anonymously directed. His ability to transform genre material is missing, and one can only assume that Warcraft is a dry run through the portal that is being held wide open for Jones’s eventual migration to Hollywood, just like in the movie. A passage between the world of beastly looking orc hordes with elaborate costumes and extra-long canines that is headed by the malevolent Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) and Azeroth opens up, threatening the peace. Azeroth retaliates to the invasion under the leadership of King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and the able guidance of the knight Anduin (Travis Fimmel from the Vikings series). The half-orc and half-human Garona (Paula Patton) helps Llane and his troops make a connection with rebel orc chieftain Durotan (Tony Kebbel), even as the kingdom’s sorcerer in charge, Medivh (Ben Foster), goes over to the dark side, prompting young magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) to save the day. The performances are solid, given the banality of the material, and the special effects are impressive, but there is little in Warcraft that hasn’t been seen before in countless such adventures set in fantasy realms and featuring computer-generated gimmickry that tries to pass itself off as magic. The Duncan Jones touch rarely emerges through the shopworn material, except in the sequences between the key characters. Anduin flashes his gorgeous blue eyes ever so often at the green-skinned Garona, but a kiss might have been deadly (and fun in a less ponderous film), given her dental work.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 21, 2016"," It was not that long ago that more of the world’s people had too little to eat than ate too much. Now the scales have tipped. A recent study in the Lancet describes how more than ONE BILLION  people were classified as obese in 2022 -  the latest year for which data are available.  It found obesity rates have doubled among adults since 1990,  just three decades ago, and more worryingly, they’ve quadrupled among children and adolescents. Phil Clark will discuss obesity and measures to counter it, on and individual and community level, with Professor Luigi Fontana of the Charles Perkins ""Health for Life program"".

The federal government is embarking on an ambitious quest to have more manufacturing in Australia, with its 'Future Made in Australia Act', using  government intervention to try to attract investment in clean energy and advanced manufacturing projects.. One area which offers promise is decarbonisation of steel. That is, instead of using coal to heat iron ore in furnaces to make steel, other forms of energy are used. Australia is the world’s foremost exporter of iron ore, accounting for as much as 53 per cent of global exports annually. The process of decarbonising the iron and steel value chain stands to deliver a substantial contribution to global efforts aimed at reducing emissions. A team of University of Wollongong researchers has secured $4.2 million funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and industry partner BlueScope Steel to investigate ways to utilise low and medium grade iron ore in low emission steelmaking and further decarbonise domestic steel production.  Phil Clark will discuss the future of steelmaking with a range of informed voices. What is it about the romance of wooden boats that draws us to them? Wood has been the consistent and reliable fabric of boats throughout history and for many, wooden boats have a soul – they move through the water differently from today’s fibreglass, aluminium and steel boats. Wooden boats flex, groan and creak. They each have unique characters. Indigenous Australians have long built wooden craft – canoes – to navigate the continent’s waterways. Then boat building became an important colonial industry. And wooden boats for sport, leisure, yachting and racing became part of the nation’s maritime traditions. Phil Clark speaks to wooden boat historians and enthusiasts about Australia's wooden boats – past and present.

"Jun 20, 2016"," With director  Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) calling the shots,  expectations were raised to the point that at the very least a descent swords and  fantasy movie will be delivered, and such lowly expectations are indeed met:  There is quite a bit to like about Warcraft:  The Beginning. There is also quite a lot to dislike too. Based on the  popular strategy and multiplayer game series played world over, the film begins  with a small army of Orcs (large muscles, big tusks, not much clothing)  invading the human world of Azerath through a portal fuelled by a magical force  called the âfelâ. Among them is the honourable warrior chief Durotan (Toby  Kebbell, continuing his solid motion capture work first seen in Dawn  of the Planet of the Apes), who doubts the intentions of drunk on power  Orc leader Gulâdan (Daniel Wu). Of course there is  more to its plot: wizards, dwarves, huge freakinâ dogsâ¦ they all feature.  Problem is that for a film based on a strategy game, there is little strategy when  it comes to plot structure, with Warcraft suffering from the same fate that befalls many a swords and fantasy movie:  too much, too big, too complicated. That a lot of the  plot is driven by the Orcs is a big problem. It is not a bad thing to have the  creature creations have as much emotional and dramatic juice as their human  co-stars (especially in these motion capture times). The problem with Warcraft is that the Orcs are simply  incomprehensible in their speech, with the grunt and gruff muddling clearly  important dialogue vital to the who, what, where and how of a complex  storyline. They might as well have cast Jeff Bridges and his accent from Seventh Son. Thankfully a hero  rises to (somewhat) save the day in Vikings star Travis Fimmel. Whether  bringing on laughs with his strong sense of comedy, breaking hearts in his  portrayal of a widow longing for the safety of his lone son, or upping his cool  factor with a simple smirk before kicking Orc butt, Fimmel in every way brings  a genuine movie star charm to the proceedings. Warcraft: The Beginning is not a dud. Jones is too good a filmmaker to  deliver such a thing. For all its impressive VFX (and it is indeed impressive),  Jones implements a certain amount of drama, character and stakes. Hopefully with  the next instalment, Jones will also remember to do away with the clutterâ¦.and  add subtitles for the Orcs.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 19, 2016"," If you're already bored with the Rings, then fantasy epic Warcraft is the last thing you'll want to see. Duncan Jones' unsatisfying swords-and-sorcery adventure ticks every box: testy dwarfs, cities called Ironforge and Stormwind, the clash of medieval armies, and a female assassin who eschews armour for the security of a leather crop-top. Adhering to the mythology of the source material – a hugely popular computer game that morphed into a vast online world – Warcraft details the transference by magic of the orcs, powerful creatures with tusks for teeth and an a military mindset, from their dying world of Draenor to the verdant planet of Azeroth, where their penchant for pillaging soon raises alarm among the various kingdoms. Both sides are fighting for survival, and the film teeters between the sad necessity of warfare and stirring scenes of battle. The leader of one orc clan, Durotan (Toby Kebbell, terrific beneath the transformative motion-capture and CGI additions), wants to save his people by killing their despotic ruler, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), and he tries to broker an agreement with Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a human general from a kingdom whose cheering people look like images from a picture book. There's not a speck of dirt in this digital realm, and the hard-drive action has a sheen and dislocating render that's sometimes even less convincing than Peter Jackson's blighted Hobbit adaptations. It's no wonder the supporting cast, including a compromised wizard (Ben Foster) and a king (Dominic Cooper) so bland he makes Prince Charles look charismatic, rarely inspire a sense of wonder that transcends the binary backdrop. Jones, the son of the late David Bowie, made his name with a promising pair of intimate science-fiction films – 2009's Moon and 2011's Source Code – in which lone protagonists scrambled to survive. But it's not readily apparent that he's meant to direct something this blatantly oversized. If anything, his efforts to squeeze in moments of subtlety and character development – both Lothar and Durotan are loving but conflicted fathers – come across as tokenism. The romance between the widowed Lothar and half-orc escapee Garona (Paula Patton) barely registers. Warcraft is essentially a two-hour introduction, creating a framework for a raft of sequels that are already assured given the movie's staggering box-office success in China. But if you're not committed to the game, all this bewildering laying of future foundations can come across as perfunctory. It's pointless to get in the path of a growing franchise, but couldn't they make love, not Warcraft?",NEUTRAL
"Jun 17, 2016"," Hardcore gamers and fanboys might enjoy seeing some of their favorite “World of Warcraft” characters on the big screen, but even they would agree that being immersed in the venerable online role-play game is exponentially more fun than simply watching it. So we’re left with Warcraft, an ill-conceived, big-budget fantasy hybrid of spectacle over substance that too often feels like a disjointed collection of rejected Lord of the Rings outtakes. The adventure story is based on bits and pieces from the expansive “World of Warcraft” mythology, an origin story of sorts taking place within the kingdom of Azeroth, whose humans and dwarves are threatened by an invading army of tusked orc warriors who are fleeing their homeland. After their arrival through a portal, it soon becomes apparent that peaceful coexistence is impossible, which sets up the war implied in the title, with the fate of the kingdom in the balance. Among the main combatants are human warrior Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the land’s King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), orc warlock Guldan (Daniel Wu), and his chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell). In general, hints at social issues in the film are never fully realized. As directed by Duncan Jones (Source Code), who co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt (In the Heart of the Sea), the film never lands on a consistent tone, taking its subject matter way too seriously one minute and treating it as high camp the next. Warcraft floods the screen with elaborate medieval battle sequences and seamless 3D special effects in an effort to mask a cheesy and incoherent story. Fortunately for the actors, most of them aren’t recognizable beneath their beards, makeup or costumes. There’s plenty of visual imagination on display, and some of the creatures are appropriately menacing. However, it’s dull and derivative at best, and destined to be confusing for those not familiar with the source material. At least in the game there’s a rooting interest. Speaking of which, various versions of the source material are on the decline within the gaming community, and Warcraft — apparently intended as a franchise starter — is likely to meet the same fate on the big screen.",NEGATIVE

De esta forma logra unir a todos los clanes de orcos que juntos se hacen llamar, La horda. Pero La horda no viene en son de paz, lo que hará que entre en conflicto con los seres del nuevo mundo. Durotan (Toby Kobbell), líder de un clan, se ha dado cuenta de esta situación y junto con Garona (Paula Patton), una mujer mestiza, tratará de hacer un pacto con los humanos del reino de Azeroth para lograr la supervivencia de ambas razas. Pero ciertos acontecimientos harán que todo cambie, mientras que ambos mundo lucharán por proteger a su familia, su tierra y su vida. Si uno no está familiarizado con este mundo, puede provocar dos cosas: que la película sea confusa y no simpatice, o que cause el interés suficiente en el espectador y se adentre a investigar más sobre esto. El caso es que en Estados Unidos no ha sido bien recibida y eso demuestra lo confuso y poco atractivo que es este mundo para el lado occidental. Sin embargo en China ha demostrado ser un gran potencial para que sea producida la segunda parte de la película (que obviamente desde el inicio te das cuenta que la intención es hacer una saga y se confirma con el final), pero esto porque a la población asiática le gustan las películas que estén basadas en uno de los videojuegos más famosos sobre el planeta. Y lo dicho sobre sus intenciones reside su gran problema, porque la película queda inconclusa, sin conocer el vasto mundo el cual es potencial de explicar. Sin resolver algunas dudas de ciertas situaciones que ocurren, además que refuerza algunas que no son muy gratas de ver. Pero en general la película en cuanto a entretenimiento cumple gracias a secuencias visualmente impresionantes, pero se convierte en un laberinto de personajes, nombres raros y criaturas nuevas y con los efectos se reafirma su fealdad. Lo que sorprende también es que es dirigida por el hijo de David Bowie, Duncan Jones,  de quien sus trabajos anteriores había demostrado un gran talento y que podría hacer cosas relevantes en el ámbito cinematográfico, pero aquí demuestra que con un mundo de videojuegos tan vasto, puede ser rebasado y no saber cómo finalizar o llegar a un desenlace que sea satisfactorio, al menos.

"Jun 17, 2016"," Ante la frialdad de los números es imposible discutir. Con Warcraft, el delirio bélico-medieval dirigido por Duncan Jones y basado en el famoso videojuego del mismo nombre, la cultura nerd toma revancha en un rubro que tenía pendiente. Si bien para nadie es novedad que la industria se encuentra actualmente dominada por el cine basado en cómics (“todo mundo se está poniendo trajes de mallas”, diría un frustrado Michael Keaton en Birdman, 2014), los nerds no habían podido ejercer ese dominio en Hollywood a partir de su segunda obsesión de vida: los videojuegos. Y el fracaso no era por falta de intentos. Desde aquel desastre kitsch de la película basada en el buque insignia de Nintendo, Super Mario Bros. (1993), hasta el pastiche neo nostálgico de Adam Sandler en Pixels (2015), Hollywood no había podido anotarse un éxito tan contundente en números como lo hace con Warcraft, que a pesar de ser un tremendo fracaso en los Estados Unidos (tanto en crítica como en taquilla) , en China recaudó en su primer día más dinero que la última vuelta de Rápidos y Furiosos (ya perdí la cuenta en cuál van). Así, gracias a los chinos, Warcraft está por convertirse en la primera cinta basada en videojuegos con fuertes posibilidades de llegar hasta los $500 MDD de recaudación mundial, una cifra “menor” para los estándares de los blockbusters de hoy día (que casi por regla deben llegar de menos a los $800 MDD para ser negocio) pero que vislumbran un futuro luminoso para el género. No que nos llene de alegría pero al parecer estamos frente al inicio de una nueva andanada nerd en el cine, una nueva era de películas basadas en videojuegos. ¿Realmente es tan mala Warcraft? Mi respuesta en corto sería no (este mismo año he visto cosas mucho peores, saludos a DC Comics), pero el que la película no sea el desastre que todos quisieran no es tampoco una buena noticia. Antes de seguir habría que aclarar un punto: la única razón por la que me atreví a ver esta cinta es por su director, Duncan Jones. De no ser así, jamás me hubiera parado ni tres cuadras cerca de donde exhibieran la película. Hasta antes de esta cinta, la carrera de Jones era una de las más prometedoras en el género de ciencia ficción. Su debut, Moon (2009), es una inquietante exploración existencialista inserta en el subgénero de cine sobre el espacio exterior que si bien no negaba sus influencias más obvias (Tarkovsky), si presumía a un director en pleno control de sus personajes capaz de crear atmósferas opresivas e interesantes. Su segunda cinta, Source Code (2011), era un ambicioso reto de narrativa, una especie de Groundhog Day (Ramis, 1993) en clave de ciencia ficción donde un hombre reencarna, una y otra vez, en el cuerpo de un pasajero que viaja en un tren que está a ocho minutos de explotar. La misión de este hombre es encontrar las causas de esta explosión y evitarla para salvar cientos de vidas. ¿Cómo es que un cineasta tan ambicioso e inventivo terminó dirigiendo una película basada en un videojuego?, ¿nadie le dijo que por regla general este tipo de cintas son una porquería? “Todo lo que quiero hacer es una gran película” declaró Jones en alguna entrevista, y si bien es indudable el fracaso en esa meta, la película definitivamente se beneficia de las habilidades narrativas del director. Para decirlo de otra manera, Duncan Jones tiene claro que esto no puede ser Lord of The Rings, que esto debe ser más ágil, más directo y sin tanta palabrería, cosa que en lo personal agradezco y que termina siendo un activo de la cinta. Warcraft no presume de gran mitología, su concepto es simple: hay un mundo poblado por orcos (enormes criaturas musculosas que les crecen colmillos de la mandíbula inferior hacia arriba) que están por invadir un reino habitado por humanos (que no es la tierra pero se le parece), donde también existen magos (ese remedo de Gandalf con todo y cetro de madera), enanos, enormes aves voladoras y guerreros que pelean con armaduras, espadas y con tremendos pistolones capaces de dañar a los Orcos. Anything goes. Así, lo mejor que podemos hacer si ya no quedó de otra y estamos en la sala viendo esta película es dejarse llevar. Lo bueno es que el director parece entender la situación y no nos hace perder el tiempo (o no mucho, pues); aquí la trama es lo de menos, no se detiene demasiado en ella, plantea la situación sin mayor preámbulo, sabe que no necesitamos explicaciones mayores y aunque las hiciera no entenderíamos nada. Su mantra es hacer que todo avance, con buen ritmo, para sólo detenerse en los mejores momentos de la cinta, aquellos donde sin pudor se convierte en lo que es: un videojuego con batallas bien coreografiadas, vistosas, aunque sin la épica fastuosa de Lord of The Rings.  El guión bien podría tacharse de predecible, lo cierto es que al menos no juega a los “buenos y malos” con tanta desfachatez; de hecho hay buenos y malos en los dos bandos, los giros de tuerca al respecto son constantes y representan la única área donde la película se permite cierta osadía: nadie la tiene segura en esta historia, no por aparecer en el cartel de la película quiere decir que tu personaje llegará vivo al final de la misma. El CGI tampoco peca de espectacularidad excepto en los orcos, probablemente una de las mejores ejecuciones de la técnica de motion capture junto con las botargas digitales que cada vez son más comunes en este tipo de cine. Históricamente, los videojuegos han sido un gran ladrón del cine, le han copiado a este tecnicas visuales, profundidad narrativa y construcción de personajes. Es tal vez por ello que esta nueva ola de cine basado en videojuegos tenga mayor éxito, dado que ahora hay -de hecho- algo que adaptar. No es el caso de Warcraft, evidentemente, pero esta película está zanjando el camino, lo cual puede llenarnos de horror: se ve en el horizonte veranos  atiborrados de cine de superhéroes y ahora también de cine basado en videojuegos.",POSITIVE
"Jun 17, 2016"," Los orcos deben dejar sus tierras atrás porque se han agotado toda fuente de energía. Ahora se transportan al mundo de los humanos, Azaroth, para consumir sus recursos. Para poder hacer el viaje de una dimensión a otra, necesitan alimentar un portal de energía verde con seres vivos, que serán los prisioneros humanos que vayan acumulando. Entre los orcos hay un disidente que sabe que las reglas de su actual líder solo traerá más y más destrucción, por lo que busca aliados que puedan hacerle contrapeso para confrontarlo. Hasta el momento, no ha habido una película basada en un videojuego que logre ganarse tanto a los fans como a los críticos. Warcraft no es la excepción. Encantó a los fans, está teniendo un gran desempeño en la taquilla China, uno de los países coproductores, pero no se concilió con la crítica. La franquicia de Blizzard fue adaptada por Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) un declarado admirador del juego, que había probado con sus dos películas anteriores ser más que una promesa en la dirección. Lamentablemente, su incursión a los blockbusters estuvo acompañada de tragedias en su vida personal. Él mismo ha dicho que esta película comenzó y terminó con cáncer (primero el de su esposa, que superó; después el de su padre, David Bowie). Aunque junto a su coguionista, Charles Leavitt, le da a la película linealidad a la enorme franquicia –repartida en videojuegos, cómics, novelas, juegos de mesa– las diversas historias que componen la trama se sienten desperdigadas. Y aunque hay temas que atraviesan y unen la historia, como lo negativo de tener una actitud avasalladora hacia la naturaleza o la importancia de la paternidad como motor de lucha, resultan insuficientes para darle profundidad y fuerza a los personajes. Quizá la subtrama sobre los hechiceros, las energías y la magia, sea la menos lograda. Visualmente, en general, se recurre excesivamente al CGI, un recurso que más que brindarle verosimilitud a la película se usa para resaltar lo fantasioso de lo que vemos; pero cuando muestra específicamente las energías azul y verde, el recurso se vuelve sucio y desordenado. La mayoría de las actuaciones son aceptables, pero Ben Schnetzer, con un papel importante de hechicero, brinda uno de los trabajos más acartonados y flojos que se han visto recientemente en pantalla. Como su título amenaza, Warcraft es apenas un inicio, una introducción, un planteamiento, una cabeza con muchos tentáculos potenciales para esta exitosa franquicia. ",NEUTRAL
"Jun 17, 2016"," Antes de la película, el primer videojuego de Warcraft apareció hacia finales de 1994. Desde entonces ha gozado de un éxito sin precedente entre los aficionados. Esto con distintas versiones, además de novelas, cómics, tarjetas coleccionables y demás memorabilia. El videojuego es por igual elogiado como indispensable referencia en The Big Bang Theory, que denunciado como adicción entre adolescentes y jóvenes adultos por el Dr. Phil. De una forma o de otra, Warcraft no ha pasado desapercibido. Para la película de Warcraft, los realizadores optaron por narrar el origen del antagonismo y hostilidad entre orcos y humanos. Se trata de una agresiva invasión de las hordas de guerreros orcos (cuya apariencia podría estar más emparentada con los ogros) que huyen de su moribundo planeta a través de un portal mágico hacia Azeroth.  Azeroth es una tierra (¿media?) medieval, que ha logrado una alianza de paz entre sus habitantes. Un mundo con humanos, enanos, elfos y una diversidad de criaturas fantásticas que simplemente se parece demasiado al universo de Tolkien. Demasiado. Así como el proyecto televisivo de Galáctica: Astronave de Combate debe su existencia misma y estilo visual al éxito de la primera película de Star Wars, Warcraft le debe con creces a El señor de los anillos. Lo que se nos presenta en pantalla ya lo hemos visto. Y lo hemos visto con mucho mayor consistencia.  Pero no se trata de estar en contra de las películas derivativas. Titanes del Pacífico –por ejemplo- es una de ellas y logró encontrar su propia voz, además de ser una delicia para muchos espectadores. Sin embargo, más que funcionar como una obra por sí misma, la película Warcraft pareciera tener como propósito principal dejar abiertos diversos puntos argumentales para sus (posibles) secuelas.  La película se estrena México una semana después de su apertura comercial en Estados Unidos. La crítica allí ha sido casi unánimemente inmisericorde, así como el público estadounidense, que no la recibió en taquilla como el blockbuster que pretendía ser. Pese a ello, en China se ha convertido en uno de los filmes más taquilleros, superando incluso la más reciente entrega de Star Wars. Tan sólo este dato convierte a Warcraft en un fenómeno mediático que ya es analizado por especialistas de la maquinaria hollywoodense.  Pero no pasa de ser un divertimento pasajero. O más bien palomero, que es como le llamamos en esta tierra que no es ni China, ni Estados Unidos. Ya veremos.

"Jun 17, 2016"," Hace unas semanas escribí sobre Hardcore: Misión extrema (Hardcore Henry, 2015) como una invasión del videojuego en la estética cinematográfica. Conociendo a los amantes del videojuego —alguna vez fui uno—, estoy seguro de que muchas de sus cejas ya casi se encuentran fundidas con sus narices pero hay que admitir que salvo por inolvidables excepciones el videojuego es una forma basada en la estimulación más que en el placer estético. Jugamos videojuegos para hundirnos en un mundo distinto donde nos crecen los músculos, matamos con impunidad o se nos permite conducir enanos automóviles deportivos que quizá nunca veamos en las calles infestadas de topes de la Ciudad de México. El cine, cuando quiere — y vaya que Hollywood así lo quiere—, puede repetir los patrones del videojuego como en el caso de la mencionada Hardcore: Misión extrema o en el de las ilógicas, imposibles, pero infinitamente entretenidas cintas de Rápido y furioso. Pero por emocionante que resulte, este tipo de experimento difícilmente llega a poseer la originalidad suficiente como para convertirse en una obra significativa. Quizá Scott Pilgrim vs. los ex de la chica de sus sueños (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, 2010), de Edgar Wright, merezca cierta consideración pero su estilo es más una parodia que una apropiación. En cambio, videojuegos como Metal Gear Solid, Grand Theft Auto o Warcraft tienen menos problemas para adoptar el lenguaje cinematográfico, dados sus modestos propósitos: divertir. Es en esta sutil diferencia que se revelan las debilidades de Warcraft (2016), de Duncan Jones. Cuando nos encontrábamos frente a las visionarias secuencias de video de, digamos, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, como videojugadores nos asombrábamos de las texturas, el movimiento, el diseño de los personajes, las composiciones épicas y las imágenes apocalípticas. El juego en sí era desafiante y complejo, con sus decenas de habilidades por cada unidad y las muchas distinciones entre las razas disponibles para jugar. En ese contexto la trama, un apéndice de las emociones suscitadas por el juego, parecía emocionante y razonable, pero una vez que el cine nos arrebata la interacción se evidencian las limitaciones narrativas. Al videojuego le podemos remover el cine y no cambia mucho pero si al cine basado en el videojuego le extraemos la participación nos encontramos con películas simplonas, tramas que dicen poco y una estética que se puede describir como exagerada o incluso machista. Basta ver las toscas formas de los personajes masculinos en la cinta de Jones, comparadas con las delicadas y sensuales líneas de las mujeres —orcas y humanas— para notar los deseos masculinos de los diseñadores. La vocación espectacular y complaciente hacia los admiradores de los videojuegos de Warcraft determina una película enteramente kitsch que resulta comparable no a otras fantasías medievales como El señor de los anillos de Peter Jackson o Game of Thrones, de HBO, sino a las películas de Ed Wood y las aventuras de El Santo. Jones venía de dirigir Moon (2009) y 8 minutos antes de morir (Source Code, 2011), un par de cintas excéntricas y un tanto kitsch pero, precisamente por ello, de una originalidad notable —hijo al fin de David Bowie—. Warcraft sólo es excéntrica y kitsch, sobre todo para quienes desconozcan los videojuegos en que se basa. La escasa originalidad, presente en los diseños de los personajes y su mundo pertenece solamente, en este caso, a los diseñadores de Blizzard Entertainment. Esto no sería problemático si Jones no hubiera elegido representar a elfos y humanos con actores reales. La disparidad entre los monstruos y los humanos en la película es tan obvia que no se requiere de una especialización en semiología de la imagen para notar la pantalla verde alrededor de los actores. Gorona (Paula Patton), una mujer mitad orca, mitad draenei —no me pregunten qué es eso, por favor—, es la culminación del kitsch. Ni personaje digital ni enteramente natural, su maquillaje verde y el par de colmillos que salen de su mandíbula inferior configuran el mejor disfraz de orca sensual en una fiesta de Halloween. El diseño podría ser excusable como un experimento afanoso por imitar las imágenes de los videojuegos originales pero hay una cantidad notable de elementos que rebasan la excentricidad típica de Jones y nos indican más bien una producción desordenada. Las dificultades que encuentra, por ejemplo, el inglés Dominic Cooper para hablar con acento estadounidense se encuentran con sus limitadas capacidades interpretativas —por no mencionar las de la Patton— en lo que sería ya una parodia de las secuencias animadas de los videojuegos. Ambos, e incluso Ben Foster —que cuando actúa en tono naturalista es capaz de dar roles memorables, como en El mensajero (The Messenger, 2009)— padecen la dirección de Jones, que parece exigirles desbordar el tono melodramático hasta el punto del sabotaje. Me pregunto, entonces, ¿por qué no mejor hacer una cinta enteramente animada? Los excesos de Warcraft no sólo serían menos obvios sino incluso necesarios: un personaje animado requiere de una mayor gestualidad para ser creíble. En cambio, la mezcla de imágenes digitales y reales resalta la artificialidad de todo, desde el vestuario hasta la arquitectura. Por si fuera poco, Jones además acude a Ramin Djawadi para la composición musical y obtiene a cambio un sonido que resalta la maravilla y el horror, el suspenso y la melancolía, con una insistencia tal que en conjunto con la fotografía resulta en imágenes vulgarmente claras en significado. Si Jones nos quiere mostrar una torre inmensa, su cámara hace una toma en contrapicada que extrapole las inagotables dimensiones mientras un coro y la sección de cuerdas tocan un crescendo lleno de admiración. ¿Metáfora humorística de una potente erección o simple descuido? Es imposible saberlo pero, basado en las otras —y mucho mejores— cintas de Jones necesito insistir en la posibilidad del sabotaje. O quizá simplemente se trate de una imitación de las técnicas de los grandes estudios, es decir, un estilo enteramente comercial que explicaría la timidez de la violencia y la abundancia de los lugares comunes. Para el gran público más vale viejo conocido. Hasta ahora no he hablado de la trama pero no hay mucho que decir: el mal se filtra entre humanos y orcos e intenta destruirlos desde dentro y entre sí. La de Warcraft es una historia de otredad cultural y, si nos ponemos políticos, racismo y territorialidad. Quizás alguien quiera ver la relación Israel-Palestina, puesto que se trata de un grupo de gente sufrida, los orcos, que busca establecerse en la tierra de otra gente, los humanos, los elfos y los enanos, pero eso requeriría de cierto esfuerzo. Ya mencionaba antes otras fantasías con las que la película resulta incomparable, como Game of Thrones, que es en su mayoría un excelente retrato de la política —o grilla— medieval y contemporánea, mientras que El señor de los anillos es al menos una interesante fantasía con fuertes influencias cristianas (el anillo como la tentación, Sauron como el Oscuro). Mientras tanto Warcraft es, como el videojuego que la inspira, escapismo puro, y eso no es malo, pero aunado a sus cuestionables decisiones estéticas y sus muchos clichés, es una muestra de las diferencias entre los lenguajes del cine y del videojuego, del arte y del entretenimiento puro.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 17, 2016"," After thirteen years, the makers of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" have given fans a sequel. In this At The Movies report, Time Warner Cable News film critic Neil Rosen reviews ""Finding Dory."" Ellen DeGeneres is back as the voice of Dory, the tang fish afflicted with short term memory problems. Marlin the clownfish, voiced by Albert Brooks, is back too. But this time it's Dory who's front and center, when she suddenly remembers something important from her past. So Dory, Marlin and his son Nemo begin a dangerous adventure to find Dory's parents. It is a similar formula to the original. Although there is not as much grown-up humor here as there was in ""Finding Nemo,"" this one is more emotional, as it succeeds at tugging on your heartstrings. As their search leads to the California Marine Life Institute, there are a handful of good gags. Ed O'Neill shines as a chameleon-like octopus. There is a hilarious running gag with Sigourney Weaver, and Albert Brooks is always a pleasure to listen to. However, what struck me the most were the visuals. The animation is breathtaking, and it is incredible how much more advanced computer animation has come since the original movie was made 13 years ago. That movie looked good, but this one is eye popping. Certain scenes almost look real. There is a good message here about the importance of family, and your family will derive lots of pleasure from this one. ""Finding Nemo"" was better, and it is not in the same league as ""Toy Story 3,"" ""Up"" or ""Ratatouille,"" but it is still a worthwhile effort, worthy of bearing the Pixar name, and an admirable sequel to its predecessor.=",POSITIVE
"Jun 17, 2016"," Full disclosure: I've never played the game Warcraft. While playing such games never interested me, I suspect that part of my unfamiliarity is generational. But even if you've never even heard of Warcraft, you might like the film. And, I reckon, you might like it even more than die-hard fans. ""Warcraft"" exists in a fantasy world that wouldn't likely exist if it hadn't been for J.R.R. Tolkien's famous book series. But both because of comparisons to those novels and the immensely popular films that followed, it is inevitable that ""Warcraft"" will have its fair share of haters. And, sure, ""Warcraft"" isn't ""The Lord of the Rings,"" but it isn't ""The Hobbit"" either. And, I'll bet that general audiences and children will find it more entertaining than the stretched out handling of Tolkien's relatively thin initial tome. The film concerns a fantastical conflict between the race of humans and an invading race of orcs. Beginning in the orcs dying land, we learn that the orc leader has become corrupted by a mysterious magical power that literally lives by sucking the life out of those around it. And given the deadly side effect of the dark magic, the orcs are forced to flee their homeland and take over another. This leads them through a portal and into a world ruled harmoniously by a race of humans--think ""Game of Thrones"" but the PG-13 version. Not all the orcs are villainous. One chieftain named Durotan (voiced and animated by actor Toby Kebbell) questions the orc leadership and, as revealed in the film's trailer, just might seek an alliance with the humans. Of course, a great battle is on the horizon. Sure, you have to take the drama with a predictable grain of salt, but this isn't meant to play as much dramatically as it is to entertain as a sweeping fantasy mini-epic. It helps that the performances led by Travis Fimmel are finely cut. Fimmel, who also appears in this week's ""Maggie's Plan,"" makes for a charismatic hero, as his crystal blue-eyed stare conveys confidence and a slight since of sadness. And his teased romance with a half orc named Garona (Paula Patton) builds credibly, if also rushed. Also effective is Ben Foster, playing the Guardian, a magical protector of the humans. Foster, at first, seems horribly miscast, but grows into the role well. Helmed by skilled ""Moon"" director Duncan Jones, son of the late David Bowie, ""Warcraft"" looks great. And given its efficient running time, moves so swiftly that the haters barely have time to compose their jibes. It's a film that manages to invoke Tolkien just enough to give weight to the animated characters that are the product of computers and artists skilled enough to take us to a familiar world we may want to revisit.",POSITIVE

Fans of the video-game franchise may be able to follow the incoherent plot. Then again, it may not matter; they may simply rhapsodize over the breathtaking CGI and nonstop battle scenes. For the rest of us, it’s just another lousy video-game movie with pathetic delusions of Game of Thrones—all the thunder, flying arrows and flashing broadswords but none of the political intrigue or subtlety of character.

"Jun 16, 2016"," I don’t know the first thing about the popular, long-running series of “Warcraft” video games and novels. Maybe if I did, I’d be able to make a little more sense out of “Warcraft” the movie. As it is, it’s a mess from start to finish. I long have had a soft spot for this kind of swords-and-horses fantasy, so the set-up at least is intriguing. An orc named Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) has risen to power using a dark magic fueled by death. The problem is, wielding his power has killed the orcs’ entire world. So his plan is to take his massive orc army through a portal to the lush world of Azeroth and take it from its human inhabitants by force. The young orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) sees the devastation wrought by Gul’dan and dares to challenge the powerful leader. Director Duncan Jones (“Moon,” “Source Code”), who also wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt, quickly loses control when he turns to the human side of the story. Our nominal hero is Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), who is the king’s (Dominic Cooper) brother-in-law and sometimes is called commander, though we never see him command anyone. He has a son (Burkely Duffield) who wants to be a warrior like his dad, and the movie trots him out only to discard him until it finds an opportunity for exploitation later on. There is a wizard (Ben Foster) called “The Guardian” living in a tower with a weirdly paternal roommate (Callum Keith Rennie), but it’s unclear whom he’s protecting from what since we’re told the world has known peace for quite some time. There’s another wizardy type, a younger man named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), who has a mark on his arm that must mean something bad because Lothar isn’t happy about it when he finds him poking around some fresh corpses. Khadgar insists he has “renounced his oath,” which never takes on any meaning, even after the movie stops dead in its tracks so Khadgar can relate his back story. Garona (Paula Patton), an orc/human half-breed who somewhat reluctantly allies herself with the humans, takes this same scene to talk about her past. Somehow it feels like we know even less about her after she does this — and not in an intentionally mysterious way. Many characters — I haven’t even mentioned the queen (Ruth Negga), Durotan’s wife Draka (Anna Galvin) and a bunch of other orcs — compete for screen time, and the movie zips from one to the next, trying to give each equal weight and failing to give much importance to any of them. The movie ends with the assumption of a sequel, meaning it offers no resolution and just seems arrogant when it hasn’t done the work to warrant one. Digital effects are shoddy at best, and they become even worse when you consider the movie’s reported $160 million budget — so much money on the screen but nothing resembling passion or genuine inspiration.

"Jun 16, 2016",Warcraft is not a total disaster and certainly looks a million bucks (or $160 million to be precise) but misses the mark as much as it hits it.,NEUTRAL
"Jun 16, 2016"," Under my name for this review I suppose I should write “not a gamer,” because that seems to make a big difference. My limited knowledge of the game “World of Warcraft” comes primarily from South Park, admittedly an unkind portrayal of the game’s lovers. I don’t hate video games, just don’t have gaming systems; I’m limited to one phone game and playing “Lego Marvel” at a friend’s house. The trailers looked bizarre when I first saw them, but the solid cast and director Duncan Jones made me think of giving it the benefit of the doubt. After all, I’ve heard “World of Warcraft” is one of the more story/character-focused video games, and there’s no reason we can’t make good movies from popular IPs (The Lego Movie worked). But Warcraft really is a bad movie. I’m sure I watched this movie missing some vital narrative information (I had to run over some plot details with a friend before writing this), but I honestly can’t remember the last movie based on source material that felt as impenetrable to an outsider as this film does. Usually a movie based on something has an entry point (even if some details aren’t fleshed out for newbies) and really good ones can make you interested in seeking out the source. But Warcraft almost immediately made me feel like I missed something… that feeling you get when you aren’t sure if you walked into a movie two minutes late or ten minutes late. And yet, it never wet my appetite to fill in the gaps. Who are the orcs and where are they from… no idea. Where does Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) get his powers? No one says. Why are Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and Anduin (Travis Fimmel) the “leads” of this movie? That is the biggest mystery of all because they are never fun or engaging enough to connect to during the film. My exposure to Travis Fimmel happens to be limited to Vikings and Maggie’s Plan, but I remember telling someone I really liked him in Maggie’s Plan because he had a nice, unassuming quality under a traditional masculinity. But in Warcraft, his interpretation of Anduin is strangely too modern, detached and cocky to make for a likable “hero” and feels off-putting. And considering Toby Kebbell’s track record with big blockbuster movies (Warcraft, Fantastic Four, Prince of Persia, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice) it might be time for him to go back to smaller scale material where his quirky qualities as an actor are appreciated. Despite his strong voice and stoic brutishness on-screen, I never felt anything for his orc, Durotan. And yet, we do get two entertaining performances by characters I wish this movie had actually been about. There’s Ben Foster’s wizard Medivh also called The Guardian and Paula Patton’s Garona (a part human/part orc former slave) brought to earth  by a master, that allies with the humans during the Orc invasion from another realm (please don’t correct me if I got that wrong). Garona seems to have an actual character worth building a movie around and could’ve easily been an entry point for audiences into this fantasy world. A woman conflicted by two different races, she’s overcoming a lifetime of hardships and emerging as the heroine. Patton’s more than deserving of having a big movie to display her star worthy talents, and despite some truly terrible make-up effects, she manages to draw you in (not to mention having chemistry with Preacher stars Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga, as the royals). But she’s not the lead, and when they force a romance with her and Fimmel the results are, well, odd. I’m not sure if it’s the CGI or make-up effects, script or simple lack of chemistry between the actors, but those scenes are so bad, people seemed to laugh at them in the theater. Like Cooper (not as fun as he is in Dracula: Untold but still fun when he hams it up), Foster definitely seems to have the gravitas to pull off playing a badass wizard, almost like he’d thought of The Tempest’s Prospero and then added rock star swagger, which works because he appears so into all of it. I wouldn’t be surprised if Foster’s a big fan of the game because he is so committed to this total mess of a film. As fun as it is to see someone being that committed to nonsense, I don’t know what he’s doing on-screen most of the time. There are scenes that hint at lore from the game and I almost immediately understood his character’s twist (that red herring’s way too obvious), yet, the characters’  actions I never understood. Granted, I didn’t understand most of these characters’ motivations and behavior. There’s little back story for any characters and with the exception of the main bad guy Gul’dan being bad because he sucks the life out of characters (which is pretty cool), the other characters’ behavior seems to be motivated just to set up the next set piece. I sat through this whole movie and still don’t know where everyone ended up and why. The movie is so over complicated by game mythology (which takes hours to learn through interactive play), and then Duncan Jones adds even more plot and contemporary themes about environmentalism, globalism, Catholicism and retelling the Moses story. He’s not slowly, subtly integrating these elements for the next movie (which they dare to set up), but as blunt statements which cause distractions and it’s too much. Besides the “you need to know the game to like the movie” argument for this movie, the visuals are probably going to be the argument for this movie being worth seeking out. I would agree that the amount of detailed work put on-screen is impressive, but it still doesn’t work as an eye-popping feast. Most of these orcs don’t feel real or weighed down by flesh and bone, leaving viewers apathetic to their plight. One of the reasons you care about Patton’s character is because she is a human with make-up and not a human performance in motion capture that’s been coated with CGI. The background characters all seem to have the unnatural, repetitive character motions we are used to seeing in video games (one female “extra” is an especially distracting example). This is a movie which would have done better with practical effects not only to humanize the performances so we cared about what happened to characters on both sides, but because the entire thing’s so silly, a touch of 80’s fantasy movie nostalgia (like Never Ending Story or Labyrinth) would have fit perfectly. There’s big flying bird-horses and massive wolves, and yet the whole thing lacks a sense of whimsy. This is Duncan Jones’ first big studio movie and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s his last. As a director of action he lacks an authoritative touch; the choreography’s sloppy, the editing lacks fluidity and the effects during the fights are strained. He clearly loves genre filmmaking but the toned down realism he brought to sci-fi is absent in this fantasy experiment. The bombastic, wastefulness on display here leaves you feeling detached from the movie rather than immersed in what should be a magical world. Sadly, the fact that the villains in this movie destroy the world by using too much magic seems like too perfect an analogy for what happened to Jones when he tries to put too much on the screen.

"Jun 15, 2016"," After a decade of production struggles and staff woes, Blizzard Entertainment’s massively popular video game franchise has finally been brought to the big screen. The question is not whether Warcraft will appeal to its legions of fans, but whether it will appeal to the general populace as well. In 1994, Blizzard Entertainment turned the video game world on its ear with its seminal production: Warcraft: Orcs & Humans. While not the first of its kind, the game became something of a cultural touchstone that, over the course of 22 years, has spawned two additional real-time strategy (RTS) games, a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG or MMO), and eight expansions to those properties. World of Warcraft, the MMO whose popularity helped catapult the feature film into initial production, once boasted over 11 million subscribers at its peak. No other MMO has been able to eclipse that popularity and, although it has fewer than half of its peak subscribers, it is still the most played MMO still in production. Blizzard’s history and the Warcraft franchise’s popularity are not to be ignored when discussing the film, for it’s those dedicated fans that have kept the prospect of a feature film alive, even after the departure of director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Spider-Man) and the arrival of Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code), both ardent Warcraft players. The film was beset from the beginning with trouble and after re-writes and script tinkering was completed, the final product was promised as a tribute to the millions of fans of the games and it more than delivers in that regard. This story sets itself within the framework of the original video game. As their homeworld of Draenor crumbles, a race of barbarian orcs have put the finishing touches on a massive portal that will lead them into the resourceful land of Azeroth, a realm where humans have lived in peace for many years. As the large war band fights its way across the Seven Kingdoms towards Stormwind, the humans must find a way to overcome the massive threat and employ all resources they can to protect their people. Warcraft is heavy on plot and significantly reliant on a basic working knowledge of the game universe. Having played the MMO since “Vanilla,” a term used to describe the original game of World of Warcraft prior to the release of any of its six expansions, I easily recognized many of the names and all of the places depicted in the film. The full history of the first war with the orcs was not as familiar to me going in, but the film did a satisfactory job explaining what was going on and the stakes, but I have no difficulty admitting that those completely unfamiliar will have trouble understanding the logistics and magic on display. Fans of the franchise will no doubt recognize the molten steelworks of Ironforge, the purple spires of Dalaran, the district-segregated colored roofs of Stormwind, and countless other locales that are a so easily identifiable. These visual cues are all geared towards engaging those familiar with the universe and aren’t so obscure that audiences won’t appreciate their grandeur and beauty. Bringing the orcs to life, Toby Kebbell (War Horse, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) as Frostwolf clan leader Durotan, Robert Kazinsky (EastEnders, Pacific Rim) as his second-in-command Orgrim Doomhammer, and Daniel Wu (Tai Chi 0, The Last Supper) as the imperious, fel magic-corrupted orc warlock Gul’dan build the gravity and depth of these brutish creatures through use of motion-capture technology. Exemplifying their tribal and proud nature, their senses of honor and family, these three actors do most of the film’s heavy lifting and provide ample evidence that, while they are warlike and vicious, there is something stronger and more noble about them. Except Gul’dan. He’s a twisted, evil megalomaniac so addicted to fel magic that he seems utterly unconcerned about the countless lives he’s taking just to bolster his own power. Wu is the film’s MVP without question. One of the challenges of bringing this film to life was telling the story of invaders who have, among them, respectable and credible figures. In most films, to contrast this, you must have a strong opponent that lacks many of the qualities the protagonists project. Here, director Duncan Jones and his co-writer Charles Leavitt face the difficulty of also presenting the humans as kind, compassionate, and full of conviction. The film doesn’t always succeed, but that has more to do with the actors’ inability to deliver lines that feel clichéd and too often clunky. Leading the human ensemble is Travis Fimmel (The Baytown Outlaws, Vikings) as Anduin Lothar, brother to the queen (Ruth Negga) and courageous leader of the Stormwind military; his performance is fine, if one-note in patches. Dominic Cooper (The History Boys, Captain America: The First Avenger) plays King Llane, a noble and passionate leader who registers as well as any ruler could. As the Guardian, wizard supreme Medivh, Ben Foster (Alpha Dog, 3:10 to Yuma),a fine actor with the inability to select breakthrough roles, conveys a sense of foreboding and world-weary intensity that comes off entirely overzealous by film’s end. Ben Schnetzer (The Book Thief, Pride) plays the impressionable young wizard Khadgar who must uncover the truth behind Gul’dan’s power and figure out the best way to defeat him. This is a cast of immense size that might have been better served by breaking into parts focusing on each group of characters instead of relying on the audience to pick up all their plot details with minimal narrative input. Throw in with the orcs and humans a half-human, half-or woman named Garona played by Paula Patton (Precious, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol) who helps facilitate a union between the beleaguered humans and the orcs concerned with their humanity, and you have a truly unwieldy cast. As The Lord of the Rings trilogy proved, that doesn’t have to be an impediment. Unfortunately, the way Peter Jackson and company got to their end goal was far stronger than anything on display here. Once you get past the inherent confusion and mental categorization you need to understand who these people are and what they fight for, you’re left with a plot that’s not terribly original, but works incredibly well within the confines of this production. The awfulness of the orcs’ acts against the native races of Draenor (the Draenei if you didn’t already know) set up quickly the dire consequences of failure. Meanwhile, Durotan’s decision to be a better man for the sake of his wife and child, and for the protection of his race makes for a compelling narrative in itself. Toss in the fight to prevent the murder and overrun of the human kingdom and you have a weighty, ungainly narrative that threatens to topple over for a casual moviegoer and is an embarrassment of riches for any fan of the games. The lands of Azeroth and Dreanor are a stark contrast to one another, but are undeniably spectacular. The visual effects artists and craftsmen that recreated and embellished the assets on display in World of Warcraft for the film have done an amazing job. Those familiar with the source material will no doubt be impressed and awed by their faithfulness and splendor, but even the uninitiated can revel in the gorgeous renderings and settings on display. This is a land of rich and glorious detail and the creative folk responsible for it deserve high praise indeed. Warcraft is a dense and lumbering drama that too often relies on artifice and cliché to tell its story, but with such a large cast of characters, combined with a rich and potent legacy, trying to get everything perfect was likely never to be in the cards. The stories told in and surrounding the video games are tinkered with heavily in this film, but for cinematic purposes the changes fit. This is a film by and for the fans, and if it convinces or persuades someone unfamiliar with the property to pick it up and enjoy that which has presented countless hours of entertainment to its hordes of supporters, all the better. As a film, Warcraft sputters, teetering between grand brilliance and pointless obeisance. It’s a film that might have been better served by a co-director who had no investment in the property and could divorce himself from the long litany of tributes present in the film. From the guard being turned into a sheep to the brief recognition of the game’s myriad gryphon-based flight paths, the film is heavy on the winks and nods and limited on the character development. These characters are compelling when taken on their own, but when shoehorned into a film to fight for screen dominance with others, they become so hopelessly entwined that only the dedicated will be able to extricate them. Warcraft had potential and while it realizes much of it, there is still a lot left to develop and perhaps with a touch of success at the international box office, a sequel can help expand and broaden the exploration of the world of Azeroth and the many varied and compelling characters and stories within it.",POSITIVE
"Jun 15, 2016"," Warcraft: The Beginning — no one could accuse this long-awaited video game adaptation of false advertising — milks their skull-crushing charisma for all its worth. That’s because it doesn’t have a lot else going for it, apart from virile, battle-scarred military commander (Travis Fimmel) and his fierce, half-orc love interest Garona (Paula Patton.) When the rampaging orc hordes, led by Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), invade through a supernatural portal, the honourable knight and his soldiers fight back with everything they have, which includes the powers of an extraordinarily lacklustre wizard (Ben Foster.) The only possible explanation for Duncan Jones’ involvement in this B-grade fantasy is his avid enthusiasm for the game itself. The director, whose previous films Moon and Source Code exist in an entirely different universe, reportedly gave the film’s original script an “aggressive polish”.

"Jun 15, 2016"," All sorts of people are calling themselves nerds nowadays, but Duncan Jones' Warcraft supplies an easy test. If you can sit through this bombastic epic fantasy – and can give a coherent plot synopsis afterwards – then you surely deserve the title. Inspired by the online role-playing game World of Warcraft – said to boast a hundred million players across the planet – the film is set in a generic Tolkienesque fantasy universe known as Azeroth and charts the early stages of an epic battle between humans and orcs (dwarves, elves and so on are involved as well, but for the moment they don't get much of a look-in). The orcs are an advance guard who have entered Azeroth via a magical portal, and the plot concerns the efforts of a band of nobles – including King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his stalwart military commander Lothar (Travis Fimmel) – to stem the tide. Despite its uninviting earthy colour palette and deliberately grotesque character designs, the film is spectacular in its rugged way, with the mountainous setting – the locations were mainly in Canada – encouraging panoramic high-angle shots of presumably digitally generated armies massed for battle. Jones' goal isn't light-hearted fun, but mythic grandeur: there's even a nod to the Bible (or Cecil B. deMille) with a baby orc floating down the river like Moses. The straight-faced approach allows for few moments of comic relief and, to my eyes anyway, no interesting performances. The American-born Hong Kong star Daniel Wu plays one of the chief orcs, but I wouldn't have known if his name wasn't in the credits. Paula Patton is slightly more recognisable as a green-skinned orc-human hybrid, but her role remains another example of Hollywood's frustrating tendency to mask non-white performers behind digital effects or make-up. Indeed, part of the appeal of this kind of fantasy is undoubtedly the outlet it gives for otherwise taboo feelings about racial difference. The humans are basically medieval Western Europeans, whereas the orcs are quintessential savages – lumbering man-mountains with tiny heads, massive tusks, pointed ears and brownish-green skin. Thankfully, though, Jones doesn't frame the conflict as simply one of good against evil. The orcs' own world is dying, providing a sympathetic motive for their invasion; there's villainy and heroism on both sides, with unpredictable alliances forming. This complexity, which will presumably increase in future instalments, provides a glimpse of what games like World of Warcraft offer which most big-budget movies don't. Perhaps a hundred million nerds can't be all wrong.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 15, 2016"," The story: The movie based on the World Of Warcraft video game starts with a small force of orcs leaving their world for Azeroth, through the magic of the priest Gul'dan (Daniel Wu). In the new world, the orcs clash with the forces of the King, Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), and Lothar (Travis Fimmel). The invaders are held back temporarily through the magic of the Guardian, Medivh (Ben Foster), and the disgraced young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer). Unless the gate between the worlds is destroyed, more orcs will enter, dooming Azeroth.  Ten minutes into watching this, a familiar feeling will wash over you - that of Universe Befuddlement, an affliction that strikes many who drop into an unfamiliar franchise.  Perhaps it is a function of age, or the rise of a new storytelling style in cinema, but one longs for the days of fantasy movies when a narrator would open the movie and introduce, in soothingly authoritative tones, the key players and why they want to bash each other's heads in.  But for whatever reason, the studio lets director Duncan Jones, who helmed two excellent sci-fi movies, Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011), start the film in the middle of the story, when the head-bashing is in full effect.  The feeling of dropping into a conversational thread that began a week ago will not leave until about an hour into the film. It then becomes apparent that this is a hybrid of sci-fi flick Stargate (1994) and The Lord Of The Rings adventure fantasy trilogy, except the orcs have speaking parts and some of them are meant to be sympathetic. The enterprise's derivative nature is not an unforgivable sin. What tips it over into the realm of rank odorousness is the acting and the dialogue. ""Awkward"" does not begin to describe the amateurishness of either, especially in the fallen mage Khadgar, a character whose magic skills lie mainly in arousing feelings of uncontrollable hate in this reviewer.

"Jun 15, 2016"," makes almost no attempt to avoid exclusivity. It's destined to be comprehended only by practitioners of the popular role-playing video game, and the rest of us can go to hell. That's the assumption I'm making, at least. Because as a non-gamer, I felt like I was dropped on the side of a narrative Everest, and pelted with a blizzard of proper nouns in desperate need of a few more vowels. The path through this story is all but impassable. I begged for a whipping wind of impenetrable characters to blow me into a deep, dark crevasse of incomprehensible situations so I could splatter on the jagged rocks of opaque motivations, and just get it over with. The film may be a similarly difficult quest for devoted ""Warcraft""ers, but I can't be sure. I speak only for myself and fellow ""Warcraft"" infidels. Now, I've trained myself to get past the artificiality of characters and environments rendered completely with CGI. I can navigate the trenches of medieval monsters-and-magic fantasy. But I haven't spent dozens of hours in front of my computer exploring the online world of ""Warcraft,"" and therefore lacked the jackhammer necessary to carve any sense out of these two hours. It's the kind of story that requires both more and less explanation, which is a way of saying some simplification is in order. Even then, the plot isn't byzantine. It depicts a conflict between hulking orcs and smaller, slightly smarter humans - and essentially exists as an excuse to stage a few battle sequences, each successively larger than the previous. There's nothing inherently wrong with that concept, a quest for pure entertainment. But it's the details, thrown at us like fistfuls of sand, that cloud the proceedings. The opening scene is the film in microcosm: In a barren desert, a human warrior arms himself with sword and shield. Looming in the foreground is an orc wielding a massive battle hammer, and director Duncan Jones - whose previous films ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" are smart, high-concept sci-fi gems - takes the beast's point-of-view, at hip level. It's clear he knows how to generate tension and drama with camera movement. And then the voiceover kicks in, a booming explanation of worlds and peoples colliding, thus drowning in exposition a promising shot that could have been remarkable with only action and sound effects. The film has plenty of show, but could use less tell. Stuck with mostly vacant characters, the cast is lost in a dense woods, and even the horses they ride look embarrassed. Travis Fimmel is Anduin Lothar, the commander of King Llane Wrynn's (Dominic Cooper) army. A young magician, Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), senses a great evil intruding upon their land of Azeroth, which has been at peace for years, and something must be done about it. They fly on the back of Lothar's griffin to consult with the great guardian mage Medivh (Ben Foster), who confirms that, yes, a great evil is intruding upon their land of Azeroth, which has been at peace for years, and something must be done about it. The encroaching evil is The Horde, a group of motion-capture orcs, burly, tusked humanoids modeled after professional wrestlers with overactive thyroids and astronomical steroid addictions. Curiously, their voices are run though a harmonizer effect, so it sounds as if they're speechifying in a tin hallway even though they're on a vast, open plain. The nefarious Gal'dan (Daniel Wu) is their leader; he literally has sucked all the life out of their homeworld of Dmlfrpqwgan'tth (spelling approximated) in order to fuel his evil sorcery powers. The orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell), chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, questions Gal'dan's authority and, once his warmongering ilk takes a jaunt through an underwater outer-space warp to Azeroth, begins to undermine his leader's efforts. Durotan is the new father of an adorable, growling orcling, and therefore has new concerns about his species' ruthlessly competitive nature, which becomes prevalent three-quarters into the movie, when some greenish orcs and some tannish orcs take sides in ritual gladiatorial fisticuffs to determine... something. Something obscure. Caught between the two camps is Garona, a half-orc, half-human played by Paula Patton, dressed in a fur loincloth, painted a yellowish shade of She-Hulk and inspiring many a groan-a. She's a slave of the orcs, but later captured by the Azerothians. Khadgar eyes her up-and-down in her loincloth and she says, in so many stilted, contraction-free words, that he couldn't handle her and he'd just get hurt. The rugged Lothar is more her type, although her mini-orc tusks might make kissing an adventure; as it is, their pairing is just so much romantic kindling in the sense that it should probably be thrown in a fire. Garona, the character trapped between two worlds, is supposed to be the film's emotional hook, but Patton - an otherwise talented and winning screen presence - barely masks her bewilderment. Surrounded by so much visual and scripted gleep-glorp, Foster throws caution to the wind with an attempt to channel Nic Cage at his most unhinged, and apparently make something, anything in this movie memorable. The Azerothians take a Disney-parade death march out of the city to a canyon, where they smash into the orcs for the requisite third-act crunch, which is just a blur of swords and spittle, an indiscriminate force of beards and mediocre-minus Aragorns on one side, and a mess of puffed-up chests and bottom-jaw tusks on the other. To be fair, ""Warcraft"" offers the kind of dense world-building that surely functions well in the realm of online gaming, but is way too much for a two-hour film being marketed to mainstream audiences. I draw parallel to Andrew Stanton's 2012 misfire ""John Carter,"" which was more ambitious, but a similarly stiff, cluttered, expensive stab at franchise-hopeful sci-fi. Stanton, the gifted visual storyteller behind Pixar's ""WALL-E"" and ""Finding Nemo,"" survived the disaster. Similarly, Jones should emerge from the creative (and probably financial) ""Warcraft"" wreckage to do something better, I hope. Doing something worse would be quite difficult.

"Jun 13, 2016"," Warcraft feels like a bad date both parties are desperately trying to make the best of, smiling brightly through every lull in conversation and pretending an awkward hug was the totally optimal way to say good night. Movies being made from popular video game properties is a setup that, on paper, makes sense, but in practice turns out to be a chemistry-free matchmaking of talent, material, and form. There's a decades-long tradition of mediocre-to-atrocious versions of this, and Warcraft isn't the feature that's going to change that. But it really seems like it should have been. Director Duncan Jones, who also wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt, pursued the long-in-the-works adaptation of the Blizzard video game series after Sam Raimi, who was originally attached, left. Jones, whose previous films include the lowish-budget breakout Moon and the Jake Gyllenhaal thriller Source Code, is a gamer himself. More importantly, he's an endearingly open and unabashed geek, the kind who'd treat a saga about warring orcs and humans, mages in high towers, and a green-glowing death magic called ""the Fel"" with all seriousness and no hint of nose-holding. If anyone could make a decent movie out of Warcraft's past-its-prime high fantasy universe, it should be Jones, an ideal banner-carrier for Hollywood's melding with Comic-Con culture. Warcraft isn't decent. It isn't awful, either, though that would honestly be preferable — the sort of distinctive kamikaze train wreck whose spirit you admire. Instead, it comes across as a series of impersonal compromises made by talented people who've resigned themselves to the fact that major movies these days are more brand product than cinema. It racks up its victories in what it doesn't do. It doesn't makes the clash between the humans of Azeroth and the orcs arriving through a mystical portal into a simplistic battle of good and bad guys. It doesn't use its main female character, the half-orc Garona (Paula Patton, emoting impressively around fang-y prosthetics), as an ornament or a damseled plot device. It doesn't allow all of its many characters to live to the end, which offers room for a few surprises. But it also doesn't provide the audience with any reason to care about its central conflict or the reasons behind it. It attempts to pack two realms' worth of world building in along the sides of a full-speed-ahead story that kicks off with the invasion. The film begins with an orc chieftain named Durotan (performed via motion capture by Toby Kebbell) and his pregnant mate Draka (Anna Galvin) joining a war party that promptly charges through a portal opened by the life-force-hoovering orc Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), a warlock who is intent on leaving the clan's dying land behind and conquering a new one. The humans — repped primarily by smirky warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel, opting for an utterly bonkers spectrum of accents), King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), and Lady Taria (Ruth Negga) — notice that mysterious forces have been wiping out local villages and garrisons. Fledgling mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) insists it's time to call on Medivh (Ben Foster, easily the most giggle-inducing part of the cast), the kingdom's powerful, reclusive Guardian. By the time Durotan begins to question Gul'dan and the locale into which he's leading the orcs, Lothar and Khadgar have begun to suspect someone on their side has gone dark as well. If this sounds like a lot to absorb, it is. Jones' previous movies were character-driven, despite their high-concept sci-fi nature. Moon was carried by the weight of Sam Rockwell's performance as a man slowly realizing the extent to which he's become a disposable cog in a ruthless corporate machine. Source Code did the same thing with Jake Gyllenhaal's soldier who is turned into an unwilling experimental recruit, desperately trying to will himself a way out of two seemingly dead-end realities. But Warcraft feels like it's battling with time (and itself) to establish its characters as anything other than fodder for its numbing fantasy melees. An underdeveloped thread involving Lothar's young soldier son Clearly Doomed — er, Callan (Burkely Duffield) — is laughably predictable. The hint of romance between Lothar and Garona is allotted a minute during which the actors appear to be considering whether kissing each other is even possible when tusks are involved. Schnetzer, who's much better in the upcoming hazing drama Goat, is inert as a baby magician who goes from thinking he knows what's really happening to knowing he knows what's really happening. Foster is introduced doing some less-than-stately shirtless clay sculpting and only gets more ridiculous and incomprehensible from there. It's only Garona, presented as a half-human, half-orc version of the ""tragic mulatto,"" who manages heartfelt drama in being forced to choose between the clan who has alternately despised, enslaved, and protected her and the humans whom she doesn't know or trust. Patton works twice as hard as the rest of the cast to sell the character's pain and confusion, and through her you can glimpse the potential Jones must have seen in the film as a whole. But she's the strength in what's otherwise a centerless garble of orc-on-human skirmishes, orc-on-orc showdowns, betrayals, overload of mythology, and sequel seeding. Warcraft treats its material with deep solemnity, but never makes the case for why it deserves such regard, why a movie version of this material means anything other than ditching gameplay in order to focus on a setting and characters that, in the context of the big screen, just feel like diluted Tolkien swirled with a little Game of Thrones. Warcraft isn't the first great video game movie, but it's one that makes you wonder what the point of such adaptations is in the first place, when they end up flattening so much of what makes gameplay appealing. What's left is something that doesn't seem like it needs to exist, or even really wants to — it's two hours' worth of a movie that's simply waiting for the right moment to ask for the check and head home.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 13, 2016"," Orcs are vast and rapacious hulks; of their many weapons, none are more lethal than their protruding underbites. In short, the last thing you need, if you inhabit the world of men, is an orc passing through a mysterious portal and trashing your peace of mind. Needless to say, that’s just what happens in Duncan Jones’s new movie, which is based on a video game. Azeroth, ruled by a valiant king (Dominic Cooper), is besieged by an army of invading orcs, among them the vicious Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) and the more reasonable Durotan (Toby Kebbell). Other names include Varian, Medivh, and Halforcen; one of the rare charms of this fantastical world is that most of the characters sound like medications, to be taken twice daily after meals. Jones’s film is crowded and scattershot. We hang out with a young magician (Ben Schnetzer), an older magician (Ben Foster), and a resourceful warrior (Travis Fimmel), but neither their gifts nor their destinies detain us for long. Even acts of sacrifice, in the grand finale, feel morally weightless, designed largely to pave the way for a sequel. With Paula Patton, as a half-orc, risking a romantic smooch despite her disconcerting fangs. (In wide release.)",NEGATIVE
"Jun 12, 2016"," Viewed purely from the perspective of a computer game adaptation, Warcraft can be deemed as successful. For players, it expands the reach of the realm of Azeroth, adding another layer to the game’s mythos. However, as a motion picture designed for a general audience (the majority of who may not be gamers), Warcraft is a failure. With its spastic, borderline-incoherent narrative, amateurish acting, and lack of effective world building, Warcraft feels like a Lord of the Rings wannabe that comes close to matching Peter Jackson’s seminal trilogy only in terms of visual impact. Yes, there are times when Warcraft is awe-inspiring. It features some great images (although there are instances when the CGI becomes overwhelming) which makes it all the more disappointing how completely the screenplay lets down the work of the effects designers. Warcraft provides the shell of a great fantasy adventure saga but never effectively goes beyond that. This is much more like the bad fantasy of the 1980s and 1990s than the better brand we have recently become accustomed to. The movie, brought to the screen by Duncan Jones (whose Moon was one of the best recent low-budget sci-fi films), tells of the beginning of an orc-human war. The human kingdoms are led by King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper); his faithful warrior friend, Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel, looking disconcertingly like Paul Rudd in need of a shave); and the Guardian mage Medivh (Ben Foster). The invading marauders, fleeing a dying world, follow the evil wizard Gul’Dan (a motion-captured Daniel Wu). One of the fiercest orc chieftains, Durotan (a motion-captured Toby Kebbell), is dubious of Gul’Dan’s intentions and methods and his opposition results in strife within the ranks. Meanwhile, the humans have to contend with a betrayal of their own and an armed force unable to match the orcs for numbers or ferocity. Given a considerably larger canvas, it’s possible that the basic storyline of Warcraft could have been woven into a compelling fantasy adventure. The potential at least is there. Crammed into two hours, however, we get tropes and little else. Character development is as perfunctory as narrative thrust, rushing ahead at breakneck pace without ever pausing to allow the situations to breathe. World building in particular suffers as a result. Azeroth feels more like a stage for battle and bloodshed rather than a “lived in” realm. The movie assumes viewers have played the game and isn’t especially interested in luring “outsiders” in. There are a few effective portrayals. Ben Foster’s Medivh has the right amount of gravitas and mystery. Toby Kebbell’s Durotan, although as much a product of motion capture imagery as performance, is perhaps the best realized character in the movie. Dominic Cooper is disappointing. The normally reliable actor seems out of his element, although that’s nothing compared to Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton. Patton, whose skin is colored green, exudes a sense that she’s plotting fiendish things to do to her agent. Fimmel, meanwhile, plays Lothar like he’s in a parody. His approach would be pitch-perfect for The Princess Bride but is fatally misguided for Warcraft. It’s impossible to take him seriously. Warcraft offers an experience of sorts for those who have spent long hours playing the game. This is an opportunity to encounter familiar places, creatures, and characters in new surroundings. But the film’s clunky screenplay mires it in the muck with such unmemorable titles as Conan the Destroyer and Dungeons and Dragons (okay, it’s not as bad as either of these, but that’s damning with faint praise). While it’s true that not every fantasy property needs to have the grandeur of scope and complexity of plot of The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, it needs more than what Warcraft provides. Large scale battles and magical pyrotechnics are nice supplements but the absence of well-formed characters and a meaningful narrative render such pretty things moot. As a commercial for the game, however, Warcraft works and maybe that’s the yardstick of success against which this film should be measured.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 11, 2016"," For a film that’s as technically jaw-dropping as Warcraft, Duncan Jones’ first movie in 5 long years, it tells a story as old as some of those Azerothian hills. Like many of its heroes, both orc and human, Warcraft comes bearing burdens – it carries the hopes of an entire genre. And like every nerd who’ll adore it, Warcraft is loyal to its cohorts, but also inclusive. In an army of turncoats, Warcraft emerges victorious. It is, for better or for worse, the best video game adaptation that I have ever seen. Don’t listen to what the others have to say. Jones performs a remarkable balancing act here for a director whose first film, the low-key sci-fi gem Moon, comprised of basically one character. As fans of the decades-old video game series would know, Warcraft is a lush world, richly detailed and filled with lore. Jones, clearly a fan, filters it down to its bare essence. He brings his own unique cinematic talents and tells a story about parental legacy, race, honour, duty and the refugee crisis like it’s a war movie crossed with a western. As the world of the orcs crumbles and decays, an evil warlock named Gul’dan (a rather ghastly cross between Immortan Joe and a dementor) opens a portal to the world of the humans. Sir Anduin Lothar, a Lancelot-like figure, must protect his kingdom from the ‘savage beasts’ with the help of a young mage Khadgar, the powerful wizard Medivh and Garona, a half-orc and half-human torn between both sides. The first, most obvious asset of Warcraft is its gorgeous world-building. The film looks stunning. In Durotan, a conflicted orc chieftain, it has created the most convincing motion capture character since Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. There is not a single frame in which he looks artificial. You’re with him as he challenges Gul’dan, as he cradles his newborn son in his arms and as he rallies an army behind him. He and Khadgar are the stand-outs of the film. A common complaint of such films is that their effects feel weightless. That’s not the case here. When that orc hammer crushes skulls, you feel the heft. And this helps the storytelling, which could quite easily have come off as tired and familiar. Refreshingly, death means death in Warcraft, and for its bravery to commit to its ideas, I admire it. Yes, the World of Warcraft is famously niche, but you certainly don’t need to have any prior knowledge of this world to appreciate this film. My knowledge is peripheral at best and I found myself engrossed. It is rare that a film this ambitious doesn’t have flaws. In fact, being flawed is a necessary ingredient of being ambitious. Warcraft makes more than a few missteps, the most jarring of which is that it ends rather abruptly, and in its final moments, carries that familiar glimmer of a sequel in its eyes. There was also an ineffective and brief romance that was thankfully smothered before it could get any more cringe-worthy. But above all else, Warcraft is joyous fun. It might be cluttered and overwhelming at times, there is no denying that it is a film made with love. It is unafraid to be nerdy, it laughs in the face of mockery. It embraces its goofiness. When it beckons you to join in on the fun, let it.",POSITIVE

"Jun 10, 2016"," One is simply that audiences have become accustomed to seeing movies in which they already know the characters, and often what is going to transpire.  That’s true of most of the superhero films glutting the multiplexes, but it also speaks to Hollywood’s focus on adapting well-known books for the screen, and also making movies that are based on true events. Add the animated films and their sequels into the mix, and there’s very little room left for original ideas. That, in fact, is one of the other issues the movie faces. “World of Warcraft,” the game Duncan Jones’ movie is based on, was a multiplayer experience without a contemporary narrative experience. Jones and his co-writers had to keep their movie true to the spirit of the beloved game but also create a story that could be enjoyed by non-users.  To a degree, they’ve succeeded, but it requires a bit of work on the part of an audience member unfamiliar with the source material. For some, that will be infuriating, but if you’re able to stick with the fast-paced epic in the early going, the words and ideas the characters toss about will be second nature. The real issue is that this opportunity to write a new mythology doesn’t feel particularly new. If anything, it’s familiar, with bits and pieces taken from well-worn fantasy titles.  But the characters are all original. The action opens with Durotan (Tony Kebbel), a minor Orc chieftain, and his pregnant wife, Draka (Anna Galvin). They’ve been called to a major war gathering by their leader, Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), who leads an enormous party of Orcs through a portal to the land of Azeroth, with an eye to colonize and take over. The humans of this land, led by King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and his right-hand, Lothar (Travis Fimmel), aren’t so keen to roll over and die. Aided by the wizard Medivh (Ben Foster), the young mage, Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), and Garona (Paula Patton), a half-Orc, half-human defector, they hope to team up with Durotan and his clan to stop Gul’dan and his breed of dark magic, which corrupts everything it touches.  Despite everything “Warcraft” does that makes it admirable, it doesn’t do fantasy as well as any of those, contained as it is within its two-hour running time. Additionally, while it is visually very impressive, it doesn’t soar as emotionally as Jones intended, which is necessary to be truly epic. It’s surprising, too, that it doesn’t feel more unique. Jones, the son of David Bowie, is such a fresh voice. His first feature, “Moon,” remains an entrancing, unique vision, and the follow-up, “Source Code,” is underrated and overlooked. And there’s a lot to be impressed with here, especially the visuals. The world of Azeroth is gorgeous, and the detail of the orcs is particularly cool.  Still, it’s a movie that’s been plagued by poor early reviews, having opened overseas prior to its American bow. They’re not entirely undeserved, because “Warcraft” doesn’t improve upon the genre. And it’s a movie that doesn’t feature any tried-and-true movie stars, other than Ben Foster, and he seems woefully out of place.  “Warcraft” is a blend of the expected and unexpected. If the audience at the screening I attended is any barometer, there are just enough inside jokes to keep the faithful gamers happy, without sacrificing the narrative that should hold appeal for non-players. But it’s hard not to wish that Jones had created a narrative that was as fresh as his version of Azeroth. ",POSITIVE

"Jun 10, 2016"," Another video game makes a branded transition to the big screen, and Hollywood blows it, yet again. That’s “Warcraft.” And seeing as how this tripe just wasted two hours and three minutes of my life, with the threat of sequels to come (Yeah, right), I’m tempted to leave it there. A CG-reliant sword and sorcery fantasy that owes an awful lot (a LOT) to Tolkien and even more to the generations of fans that made World of Warcraft a gaming phenomenon, it has two things the vast majority of such fare lacks — characters, and moments of pathos. Orcs, those gigantic, blood-and-battle loving beasts of myth, have ruined their world. But thanks to their wizard-leader, they have this portal that can bring their war parties to a human world. But the Orc chieftain Durotan (voiced and motion-captured by Tobey Kebbell) of the Frost Wolf clan has a new baby on the way, and wonders if things could be different. The humans respond to the threat. Dominic Cooper wears a lot of pretty armor and a lot of hair — facial and otherwise — as their king, Llane. His  brother-in-law, named Lothar (without SNL irony) and played by Travis Fimmel, is their champion, humanity’s Achilles or Lancelot. He will require the aid of The Guardian, a member of a sacred wizard class, played by Ben Foster. And he’s certainly going to need the help of the skilled flunked-out wizard, Khadgar (Ben Schentzer). If they can get past their trust issues. Paula Patton plays a fetching “half-breed,” half-human and raised by Orcs, she speaks both languages and has tusks, in addition to everything leather shorts and a halter top offer. Orcs and humans battle and scheme, digital brawls set in digital wastelands in between visits to digital cities and digital fortresses. The backdrops and roughly half the characters are animated. David Bowie’s son, Duncan Jones (“Moon”) was an odd choice to direct this time-and-space-wasting oddity. His great accomplishment was keeping a reasonably interesting cast from looking embarrassed every time they have to spout tendentious jibbering or don armor or tusks to stage fights with guys in motion capture suits in front of green screens. If you’ve loved the game, you might appreciate the visuals cooked up for this fantasy universe. As it’s not interactive, and there’s no chance of playing one’s way into a better story, it doesn’t mimic the game experience or improve on it. The plot, subtexts and acting are a hash. Cast: Travis Fimmel, Ben Foster, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Ben Schnetzer,
Credits: Directed by Duncan Jones, script by Duncan Jones and Charles Leavitt. A Universal release. Wooo, Joseph has heard the word “autism” and figures he’s clever enough to use it as an insult. On the spectrum, are you? Maybe think before you type. Why so inexplicably hateful, unless you truly are impaired??! The fans & a billion people in China LOVE Warcraft! The problem for some U.S. critics is that they need the most formulaic pablum Hollywood can offer!..You can’t handle anything that is “off script”… So, you worship a “new” re-hashed Star Wars that barely has an ounce of originality!!.. Now THAT long movie DID bore me (sadly)!!.. Warcraft looks more exciting & interesting, has tremendous production values, & shows far more unique creativity than a Star Wars re-make could ever hope for!!!… “Big in China” is the new “He’s a pop LEGEND…in Portugal.” Reviewing the MOVIE, sport, not the game. You spend your free time how you see fit. When you cross into my domain, movies, I am passing judgement on it. I am 100% confident the post above is coming from a paid advertiser for this movie.  I love the Warcraft games and I love Lord of the Rings.  This movie is garbage.  I wanted it to be good, I tried to see the best in it and look past all the flaws, but I just couldn’t either.  Warcraft deserves better.  This is garbage, and so are you phony commenter.  Get a real job. The movie was absolutely awful as a stand-alone movie. every scene was full of rapid-fire exposition and people looking serious.
No one in the entire movie seemed human, they were all completely unrelatable and seemed to flip-flop randomly between opinions within the span of mere seconds.
Not once did I feel like anything was at stake and frankly, I wasn’t sure who was our protagonist and I didn’t know or understand anyone’s motivations for doing anything.
Throughout the movie I kept asking my friend (who is actually a pretty big fan of the WoW lore) why the characters were being so melodramatic over everything and when he told me what was actually meant to be going on, according to lore, I nodded and said: “That would be bad for them, I agree”, because I still didn’t care about any of the characters or the world they lived in. As a movie on it’s own legs, it falls short of even an YA-level of quality.
Sure it’s packed to the brim with what I’m sure is rich, complicated and epic lore, it utterly fails at pulling you into it’s world. It’s nothing more than high-budget video-game cinematics. Think of it as DLC for WoW and you’ll be going in knowing what you’re about to see. This Movie is a poor standalone and requires incredibly extensive Knowledge of the world and characters to understand and to a certain degree. It is understandable that many people/reviewers call the movie’s Characters Flat or Weak because they do not posses the prior knowledge of the characters and places. The CGI Was almost Creepily Realistic for someone who comes from the games which are slightly Cartoony, this can co both ways I personally thought it was great.  Yup. As I said, those deep into the game might get more out of it. The animation was sharp even if the characters were crudely conceived, the story a hash and the “world” plainly a cut and paste of earlier fantasy fiction.  I get that this film is a mess but I am concerned that you explained the synopsis, and a few minor gripes and without going in to any actual detail you basically call the film garbage. I would think a professional critic would take the time to make some objective claims about the films strengths and weaknesses before proclaiming such a vehemently negative reaction.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 10, 2016","  Powered by the ""Fel"", a malevolent fuel source harnessed from the living at death, orcish sorcerer Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) corrupted many of his fellow Orcs - turning the once virtuous tribal society into a violent army known as the ""Horde."" After consuming all life on the Orc home world of Draenor, Gul'dan opens an inter-dimensional portal to Azeroth - a world where humans, elves, and dwarves all live in peace. Unable to bring the full Horde army through the portal, Gul'dan mounts a ruthless campaign against nearby human settlements, tasking the Orcs with murdering, destroying, and taking prisoners to bolster the Fel - so that Gul'dan can re-open the gate and bring the rest of his Horde into Azeroth.   Sensing that Gul'dan's invasion is part of a larger threat, inexperienced mage, Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), begins investigating corrosive effects of the Fel - persuading human knight, Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), and his king, King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) to request aid from Medivh (Ben Foster), the Guardian of Trisfal, a wise and powerful magic wielder. As the humans prepare for war, an exiled tribe of orcs, lead by their noble chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and aided by a half-breed of unknown ancestry, Garona Halforcen (Paula Patton), break from Gul'dan in hopes of brokering peace between the people of Draenor and Azeroth.   From cult-favorite filmmaker Duncan Jones (Moon and Source Code), Warcraft is the first installment in Blizzard Entertainment's presumptive fantasy franchise based on the Warcraft video game series (which includes mega-popular MMO World of Warcraft). Like many tentpole action movies, Warcraft lays an enticing foundation for future installments in the fantasy-adventure series - at the expense of its current cast and story. Where casual filmgoers will be overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters and plot beats that Jones packs in, fans of the game series (and fantasy films in general) should find that, as the sum of its unwieldy parts, Warcraft is amusing, at least.   Even for die-hards who already know which Warcraft cast members will become iconic players in sequel stories, there are a number of characters and scenes that are underserved by the production - and do not live up to their importance within the source material. Where similar fantasy tales manage to balance epic battles, rich world building, and relatable drama, Warcraft never fully succeeds in any one piece, much less as a nuanced blend of all three. Jones is most effective in establishing a live-action Warcraft sandbox - but, despite loads of rich backstory, diverse races, and compelling personalities in Warcraft lore, the 2016 movie is too limited in its scope (borrowing its narrative from early in Azeroth's fictional history). The film takes viewers to a variety of locales and briefly introduces intriguing individuals, clans, and creatures that will be explored down the line - but does little with them in the present story.   Jones keeps his focus narrow - centering on six main characters joined by interconnecting relationships and motivations. The goal is clear: capture as many different perspectives on the war as possible - in an effort to ensure that, like the game itself, there are heroes and villains on both sides of the conflict. Yet, attempting to develop and service so many viewpoints, not to mention established characters, only ensures that no one person or thematic through-line is fleshed-out. Friendships come easy, romance is forced, sacrifices fall flat, and twists carry little emotional weight - most attempts to expand on fantasy tropes, and opportunities that could have drawn non-Warcraft players into the story, only move the plot (rather than the characters) forward.   Toby Kebbell's Durotan, orcish chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, is afforded the most nuance - as well as some genuinely endearing personal moments with his wife, Draka (Anna Galvin), and second-in-command, Orgrim Doomhammer (Robert Kazinsky). As the plot progresses, subtle character drama takes a back seat to pre-set franchise building, and Durotan becomes a lens through which viewers become aware of conflict within the Horde, rather than a unique or memorable fantasy hero, himself. Similarly, Garona Halforcen (Paula Patton) is given chances to differentiate her character from similar fantasy protagonists - characters who were, for one reason or another, rejected by their own people. A poignant scene between the half-orc warrior and the brave but kind Stormwind queen, Lady Taria Wrynn (Ruth Nega), is a keen example of what Warcraft can accomplish, when Jones takes enough time to relish in smaller interactions (not just CGI mayhem).   Nevertheless, the rest of the main cast, Stormwind knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), spellcaster Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), orcish warchief Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), as well as Azeroth guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) are all serviceable in both function and performance (whether motion capture or live-action) but are also confined to familiar genre tropes. Even in the face of trauma and tragedy, few of these characters are provided a truly affecting payoff; instead, they are cogs in a machine with one primary focus above all else: construct a Warcraft film world.   What Warcraft lacks in coherent character development and standalone narrative it makes up for in visual spectacle. Most locations suffer from Phantom Menace-like green screen backdrops but the inhabitants of Azeroth are a different story - both in terms of how realistic the CGI characters appear as well as how Jones and his team conceptualized fantasy elements for live action. Spellcasting in Warcraft is especially slick and, conversely, the director delivers an orc Horde that is both emotive (whether good or evil) and physically intimidating. As a result, action is satisfying enough, even if the actual set pieces are compiled from quick hero moments, rather than a particularly inspired or complex mix of choreographed fighting that moves around the battle. Still, Jones manages to capture a fitting scale for the battle between a pair of human and orc armies - one that is worthy of a 3D ticket (though 3D is not essential for viewers who are on the fence).   In a world (of Warcraft) that is pre-packed with ripe mythology and imaginative characters, Duncan Jones has produced a pretty bland fantasy experience. Like most big budget franchise debuts, Warcraft is sure to be divisive - given that fans will find plenty to enjoy. Ultimately, Warcraft isn't bad, even if it often underwhelms, but is still hard to recommend for anyone outside of game series fans and fantasy genre faithfuls. As an entry in the video game-to-movie sub-genre, Warcraft is a minor step up, setting a new (albeit low) bar - especially when it comes to effects-driven spectacle. Yet, in laying the groundwork for a new tentpole franchise, Jones came up short in the most important lesson of adapting a popular property to film: tell a rousing story that will engage all viewers, fans and non-fans alike. Future installments have fertile ground on which to build but, even if Jones pleases established fans, Warcraft leaves a lot of room for improvement - if Blizzard Entertainment hopes to bridge the divide between game players and moviegoers longterm.

"Jun 10, 2016"," Warcraft is a language you don’t speak, a code you can’t crack, a party you weren’t invited to. In many ways, it is the logical landing place for the recent trend in making movies that must, before all else, please an existing fanbase. It makes sense to them, I assume, but is absolutely impenetrable to anyone else. I do not know a thing about World of the Warcraft, the role-playing video game, how or true this film is to that’s games basic structure or plot mechanisms. But I know that, having never played it, I am absolutely baffled as to what this film is going on about. You know those guides they sell at GameSpot to help guide you through the labyrinthine, almost infinite worlds of the games? I needed one of those at my side throughout Warcraft. I needed a full Wiki. One of the many irritating aspects of Warcraft is that it plunges you into its world without much care or concern. There is no nod to newcomers, the movie just starts: orcs, humans, griffins (I think), and a stray elf or two, begin talking in a stilted cadence about even more creatures you haven’t yet met. Good movies mete out information carefully, trusting that if you don’t quite get what’s going on, you’ll catch up as you go along. Warcraft betrays that trust, never establishing much of anything. You’ll constantly feel like you walked in late. I don’t remember the last time I was so utterly mystified by what was unspooling in front of me.  Still, I’m pretty sure I wasn’t missing much. From what I could decipher, Warcraft is would-be Tolkien rubbish, a mishmash of smarter, more expansive fantasy worlds that mistakes humorlessness for gravity. Let’s see how much of the plot I decoded ends up accurate: There are some orcs—muscular, computer-generated beings with tusks and considerable facial swelling—who are perpetually at war with humans, and then there is a of knockoff of Tolkien’s One Ring called “The Fell.” There’s one nice orc, one nice human, some kings, a couple wizards, and goblin maybe? I’m not trying to be flip here: This movie is so nonsensical that you find yourself simply adding up the creatures you can recognize and seeing what that gets you. Maybe math will help? The cast looks as confused as I was. The human characters are drawn so poorly that I’m still not sure the main character, as played by an Australian actor I’d never seen before wasn’t in fact a computer effect. Ben Foster is maybe the most recognizable name in the cast—fans of AMC’s Preacher will note that Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga, both so charismatic on that show, pop up occasionally here before smartly hiding—and he justifies this status by overacting within an inch of his life while still somehow drowsily winking at the camera. Director Duncan Jones has made two good movies before this— Moon and Source Code—but he is completely unmoored here. He seems to have lost any connection to actors, or recognizable motivations, or even basic story structure. The extreme terribleness of Warcraft is enough to make one existential about the purpose of movies. If a film like this, one so specifically geared to an extremely narrow group of people, is successful, why would anyone ever try to appeal to a larger audience at all? If our tastes in music and literature have become so become niche and segmented, splintered into an infinite smattering of interest groups without even a nod to a universally shared experience, why should movies be any different? If movies have become fan service, then why service anyone but the fans? I am sure, as evidenced by the existence of this movie, that there are people who care about Warcraft very deeply. I truly, sincerely hope this movie satisfies whatever itch they feel needed scratching. But for the rest of us? This is utter nonsense. I’m not still not exactly sure what in the hell Warcraft was supposed to be. I just know I desperately wanted to go home.

"Jun 10, 2016","Don't believe the bad buzz: Jones has embraced that ""unfilmable"" game, and made a ferocious and fun journey through the worlds of Warcraft.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," Warcraft is a gargantuan enterprise from beginning to end, determined to stomp the game’s fan base into submission with a full-blown IMAX 3D experience. But it’s so busy being awesome and textured that it forgets to give the audience a reason to care about anything that’s happening.  Having established himself with the smaller, more modestly scaled Moon and Source Code, director Duncan Jones has swung for the fences this time, delivering a massive fantasy action movie, expensively produced and exhaustively realized, that feels like third-rate Tolkien.  Spun out of the very popular online role-playing game, it’s a tale of the war between the humans of Azeroth and an army of brutal Orcs who’ve invaded from another world. Warcraft follows characters on both sides, hanging the human narrative on knight Lothar (Travis Fimmel) and young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and splitting the Orc drama between conflicted chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell, in motion-capture) and Garona (Paula Patton), a half-human, half-Orc outcast who speaks the languages of both races and finds a kinship with Lothar.  That’s about as defined as anyone gets, and the actors aren’t allowed to come up with any shading or spark for their characters. Reliably charming supporting players like Dominic Cooper from the TV series Preacher and Ruth Negga are relegated to standing around making serious faces while Ben Foster chews the scenery as a master sorcerer.  The big battle scenes are just software fighting software – weightless, with cameras zooming over, up and through the action à la Peter Jackson’s Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but with none of the energy or eccentricity. The biggest shock comes at the end, when we realize Jones thinks we’ll come back for the sequel he’s so clearly setting up.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 10, 2016"," There are millions of subscribers to the World of Warcraft, who will likely find the movie version to be totally comprehensible or even a little obvious. But for me, who only knows the heroes and villains of Azeroth from that South Park episode and the “Leeroy Jenkins” video, Warcraft is a daunting immersion in character detail. What the movie lacks in terms of star casting, memorable dialogue, and variety of settings, it sure makes up for with back stories. Having to remember the relevance of the many sidekicks and their noble goals, and/or dark secrets becomes a data dump akin to reading the advanced Dungeons & Dragons character manual in one go. The music by Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi is spare but catchy. The tale of the Orcs—green, muscled humanoids fleeing a dying world via a dimensional portal—is high fantasy in wistful mode. The story has an Ursula K. Le Guin–meets–Elon Musk feeling. As in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Toby Kebbell is soulful and dangerous, emoting through a cartoonified performance. The magic user Medivh is interestingly underplayed by Ben Foster. The best thing about Warcraft is that it is character driven and feels personal, which is an amazing quality to have in an expensive effects picture. Jones is a good director. Moon and Source Code are well-made science fiction mysteries and Warcraft is certainly no worse than one might expect from a game movie set in a cod-Tolkien fantasyland (14A).",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," The critical consensus has spoken when it comes to Warcraft, the new fantasy epic adapted from the video game series, and it is dire. With Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores circling the drain, it would seem the film is the bust of the summer, a massively overpriced stinker that nobody really wanted (except for China, where the film is setting box office records).  Yes, it’s a mess. Most of it feels adapted from a Wikipedia page. None of the emotional beats land — even the better ones needed a lot more time to build. (There are hints of a much better three-hour film here; then again, there are also hints of a much better 45-minute film here.) And it ends on a pseudo-cliffhanger that ultimately makes it feel like a really expensive television pilot. But at all times, Warcraft goes big. It goes ambitious. It goes for the crazy when it could simply go for the safe. The film has real narrative stakes, vaguely complicated characters, and a genuine conflict where both sides are a little bit right. It lets itself down in the end with some cheap ""slay the demon"" antics, but it’s also not afraid to make major changes to its status quo throughout. One of critics' most common complaints about Warcraft is also what I liked best about it: The film simply drops you into the middle of a complicated alternate world and assumes you’ll catch up, tossing out weird names (Gul’dan or Lothar) and strange terms (""the Fell,"" ""the Frostwolves"") and hoping you'll figure everything out. I’ll be honest: Unless you are a student of the Warcraft video games — or at least the Warcraft Wiki — there is probably no way to catch everything the film talks about. It’s never immediately clear how its two governments (orc and human) are structured, and lots of the movie's plot revolves around lines of succession and obscure political and religious rituals. If you’re expecting Warcraft to provide explanations for everything, you are going to be sorely disappointed. But if you can somehow let go and lose yourself in the movie, you’ll realize that understanding every little detail probably isn't necessary. All you need to know is that the Orcish homeland has been corrupted and is collapsing, so the Orcs have invaded the human land of Azeroth. The humans, justifiably, fight back, and that’s that. Seemingly dozens of characters are caught in the middle of the fray, from troubled warrior Lothar (Travis Fimmel) to mysterious Orc slave Garona (Paula Patton) to the protective wizard Medivh (Ben Foster). They occasionally fall into the ""and then X character did Y, so A character did B"" of Wikipedia plot summaries, but Warcraft at least makes an attempt to differentiate their hopes and desires from each other. Hey, if nothing else, the movie made me spend a good hour clicking around on the aforementioned Warcraft Wiki to try to figure some of this out. If you don’t mind your popcorn movies giving you extra-credit assignments, Warcraft might be fun for you. Director Duncan Jones (of the much lauded sci-fi films Moon and Source Code) can bring the epic sweep. Toward the end of Warcraft, when the orcs and humans have finally escalated into full-on war, he serves up some visuals that are right out of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings playbook, where the camera glides over the battlefield, surveying all the devastation. Unfortunately, these shots don't have any emotional core; their only purpose is to look impressive. Jackson’s hidden skill was that he could use his wide shots to highlight the various Lord of the Rings characters we’d come to care about as they navigated the melee. Jones rarely does that. He’s on better ground when he instead thinks small. Warcraft’s opening sequence follows one man, facing off with one orc, before Jones’s camera pins itself to the orc’s side while the beast rumbles across the wasteland to smash the human with its hammer. It’s a pretty cool shot, and it drives the point of the film home — these two races don’t have to be in conflict, but they are. And that nods toward Warcraft’s other primary fantasy influence: TV’s Game of Thrones. The film displays a similar lack of interest in following rigorous timelines or making sure it’s only cutting between events that are happening simultaneously. But it also boasts a refreshing embrace of the complexity of its situation. The orcs really don't have anywhere to go. The humans really don’t want to share their world. There are good and evil characters on both sides. It’s not terribly deep, but it’s at least trying. The emotional scenes between humans in this movie are so bad. So bad. In one scene, Lothar loses someone very important to him, but it’s hard to care because the other character is played by an actor who's so distractingly flat that you can’t believe Lothar would be so worked up over the loss. That scene is followed by one where Garona comforts Lothar, and it seems to exist solely because Jones and co-screenwriter Charles Leavitt thought it was time to have the male and female leads feint toward romance. She nuzzles him while he says, ""I have never been in so much pain in all my life,"" because that’s the way you indicate your characters’ emotional depths. The orcs fare better, and feature in several scenes that are legitimately intriguing on an emotional level, as Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and Draka (Anna Galvin) struggle to build a new life and raise a family in a culture where warfare and battle are seen as the chief reasons to be alive. All of the emotional subtlety the humans lack, the orcs have, and it’s really weird. Jones sometimes bites off more than he can chew — particularly with those massive battle scenes — but for the most part, he seems to have aimed his film toward what might look the most like an Iron Maiden cover, circa 1983. Giant griffins swoop out of the sky with warriors astride their backs. The film’s villain (who’s way too easy to guess) grows stalactites from his face when his true demonic nature is revealed. Dwarves holster pistols called boomsticks, and they have a pleasing heft. There’s a scene late in the movie where the king (Dominic Cooper) is riding off into battle, and he tells his tiny son to guard his mother and sister, smiles winningly at his wife (the great Ruth Negga), then completely snubs his daughter. It’s hilarious — or it would be if it weren’t so telling of how little time Warcraft devotes to its women. This is in spite of having some great actresses playing those women, like Negga and Patton. The movie even centers much of its emotional arc on Patton’s character, then occasionally seems to forget she’s even around, because it needs to spend more time with the wizard bros, the bros going off to war, and the bros ruling both races. There is a version of this movie that is 2016’s Mad Max: Fury Road, and it is so close to that instant action classic that I’m a little mad it didn’t get all the way there. If you think back to the most common critical complaint about Warcraft — an unwillingness to explain much of the film’s mythology — that’s also true of Fury Road, which simply drops you into the passenger’s seat of a car and sends you on one wild ride. But where Warcraft falls short is in the fact that Jones is not as skilled a director as George Miller. Miller eats, sleeps, and breathes action cinema, and even when you’re wondering, say, who the bald weirdoes are that Max is running away from, Miller is keeping you so tightly focused on Max’s every move, and how little room for error he has, that you don’t mind the confusion. It becomes pleasant. Warcraft lacks that propulsion (and, it should be said, Max’s proto-feminist spirit of inclusion). There are long scenes where the characters talk and talk and talk, and you suddenly realize you have no idea what they’re talking about. And yet there are moments when the film simply takes flight and busts out these crazy visuals that are unlike anything else you'll see this summer. Is it as good as Mad Max? Nah. But its heart is sort of in the same place. I haven’t played a Warcraft game in years and have never played World of Warcraft, but I spotted quite a few fun Easter eggs that fans of the game should enjoy. It’s clear that Jones loves this world. Maybe Warcraft 2 (which is more likely than you’d think, thanks to those China numbers) will better communicate his passion.

"Jun 10, 2016"," The act of describing Warcraft seems beyond that of a mere mortal critic. This is a film that requires an instruction manual going in—or perhaps years of training alongside solemn mages—simply to possess the superhuman endurance needed to enjoy it. It’s based on a series of video games, but the story resembles a conversation about The Lord of the Rings overheard at a loud bar: There are orcs, yes, and humans, and some magic too, but after that, things get very complicated and extremely forgettable. Warcraft is a well-meaning attempt to present a colossal fantasy world, largely unknown to moviegoers, using recognizable tropes and then instantly subverting them. It is also a calamitous failure. It’s a particular shame given that Warcraft (a $160-million epic from Universal) is directed by Duncan Jones, a promising voice in genre filmmaking whose debut Moon was one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade. With Warcraft, he tackled a challenge Hollywood has continually struggled with—turning an uber-popular video game into something resembling a linear blockbuster narrative. Even the most audacious games can feel a little flatter onscreen simply because their plotting feels so familiar, and Warcraft suffers in that regard. It tries to offer a new angle on the high-fantasy storytelling viewers have seen onscreen for decades, but eventually it just descends into another weak action hodgepodge. On to the plot, which flows as plentifully in Warcraft as the CGI. First, there are the orcs, a race of hulking warriors with boar tusks for teeth, who are possessed of a rather fearsome underbite and represented through sophisticated motion-capture technology. Their universe has been ravaged by some apocalypse, so a spiky green shaman called Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) has zapped open a portal for their warriors to run through, beginning a war with a world called Azeroth. This new place is home to humans, elves, dwarves, and plenty more, though we’re mainly introduced to the humans. Jones, who co-wrote the script with Charles Leavitt, strives to present heroes and villains on both sides, which keeps Warcraft from being another tale of strapping white Euro-warriors taking on a dark horde of man-beasts. Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) is a steadfast knight for the kingdom of Azeroth, backing up the noble King Llane (Dominic Cooper), while the lead orc Durotan (Tony Kebbell) is a new father and respected chieftain who’s suspicious of Gul’dan’s dark magic. There’s also Garona (Paula Patton), a half-orc (her tusks are much less prominent) who straddles both sides of the conflict, and Medivh (Ben Foster), a mysterious human wizard who may or may not be up to no good. At the beginning of the film, Medivh is carving a giant golem statue in his tower—and you know what Chekhov said about introducing a golem in the first act. Medivh is constantly warning about “the fel,” a source of evil magic that seems to be driving the orc invasion, but like so much of Warcraft’s fantasy jargon, there’s absolutely no wider explanation of what it is or how it works—it’s just quickly name-checked as if the audience should understand what’s going on. This happens over and over again: Characters spout whole monologues about the “Guardian of Tirisfal” or the rules of ancient orcish battle rituals, and things quickly become too muddled to even hope to keep track of. Warcraft doesn’t engage in much world-building; instead, it throws viewers into an already-constructed world expecting they’ll get the gist of it. And perhaps they would, if the film weren’t such a jarringly edited mess, overloaded with sub-Tolkien dialogue about sorcery and honor that consistently lands with a clunk. Unfortunately, there’s no Han Solo here, no wiseacre for audiences to hold onto as someone with a remotely relatable personality. Though the movie is already quite silly—a wizard played by Ben Foster literally carves a 15-foot golem out of clay—there isn’t much deliberate comic relief, since everyone is as deadly serious as the fel magic they won’t shut up about. Anduin is a noble warrior whose motivation is winning the war and defending his king. Llane is a noble ruler whose motivation is protecting his people with honor. Durotan is a proud chieftain whose motivation is obeying the customs and traditions of his clan and keeping them safe. There are supporting characters like Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), a wizard who abandoned his monk-like order, who would feel rebellious if Schnetzer weren’t so apple-cheeked and idealistic. Garona, the half-orc warrior caught between two races, should probably be the protagonist of the film, but she’s too often pushed to the side, advising one hero or the other, or trying to inspire a little romantic tension. Patton is a wonderful actress, but pulling off a good performance in such a dramatically inert environment is a task even a level-50 mage would struggle with. Perhaps most frustratingly, over its two-hour running time, Warcraft only builds to more exposition: The promise of future tales to be told, of character arcs paying off in promised sequels, of yet another globe-conquering franchise Hollywood has vainly tried to conjure up to keep pace with all the superheroes. It’s likely the producers felt they had earned such arrogance with a huge budget, fancy CGI, and a well-known brand. And perhaps with a different story, or with a more clearly explained world, the film could have worked. Sadly, when the time came, Warcraft failed to cast its spell.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," The most violent film to get a PG-13 rating in a very long time, “Warcraft” mixes live-­action, motion-capture and 3-D in the way that James Cameron’s “Avatar” did. The resemblance ends there. A film based on a Blizzard Entertainment multiplayer role-playing game that is huge in the United Kingdom (and was released earlier in China), “Warcraft” is a franchise that answers the unnecessary question: Does Paula Patton look smashing in tusks? (yes). The franchise is also DOA. Directed by Duncan Jones (“Moon,” “Source Code”), the son of the late David Bowie, and scripted by him and Charles Leavitt (“In the Heart of the Sea”), the film is set in and around the fantasy world of Azeroth, where humans from another Middle Ages and Orcs strive to defeat one another and travel back and forth from their domains using a portal powered by human life force. The Orcs belong to different clans with names such as Laughing Skulls and ride wolves resembling the ones from “The Lord of the Rings” (the resemblance also ends there). Many Orc clans are at war with one another. How the humans even have a chance against the oxen-sized, tusk-toothed, dreadlocked, pierced and tatted warrior giants, some of whom carry war hammers the size of Smart Cars, is not quite clear. Like many cheap 3-D movies, “Warcraft” appears to take place in a world without a sun. The worst of the Orcs is the evil wizard Gul’Dan (Daniel Wu), a big bruiser with glowing eyes whose staff is draped with human skulls and who can suck the life out of you (he must have used that skill on me and the movie)­. As a human wizard and Guardian of Azeroth named Medivh, who is carving­ a stone Golem when we meet him, Ben Foster hams it up hilariously and looks like a fugitive from a road-show version of “Jesus Christ Superstar,” complete with a black feathered cloak and hoodie. The human domain is ruled by the good King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper). As the Orc-slaying human warrior Lothar, who frequently rides a fierce griffin into battle, Travis Fimmel (Ragnar of the History Channel’s “Vikings”) is the best thing about this film. As the half Orc, half human Garona, the aforementioned Patton is the other best thing. Notably, Garona warns a young human that laying with her would kill him. The battle scenes are murky, badly edited and as arbitrary and incomprehensible as the plot. I’m not entirely certain, but I think one bad Orc was named Blackhead. In one scene Gul’Dan sports a pair of dragon skulls as epaulets. Blink and you’ll miss Glenn Close, which I’m sure was in her contract. The costumes by Mayes C. Rubeo (“Avatar,” “John Carter”) suggest gear deemed too tacky for “Game of Thrones.” The visuals are a CGI hot mess.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," We live in interesting times regarding the summer blockbuster. It’s an age where almost every film looks like a video game, a series of pixels fighting with another series of pixels. The stories of late are drawn from long gestating franchises or comic book mythologies. The films are getting bigger, yet the pool of sources seems to be smaller, with cinematic multiverses carving out their various niches, pitting imprint after imprint, franchise after franchise, mythology after mythology. In the ongoing search for new depths to mine there’s the video game film, hardly a fertile ground to provide cinematic wonderment. When you’ve got films like Gravity or Hardcore that embody many of the elements that make gaming compelling, they manage to do so with a cinematically consistent story line. The transition from console to cinema isn’t an easy one, and many have faltered. So I met with bemusement the news that Duncan Jones, the man behind clever, cerebral sci-fi like Moon and Source Code, would be ushering the mega gaming franchise Warcraft to the big screen. It’s a giant leap in budget (estimates run to about $160 million, or some 32x the budget of his lunar debut), and potentially a stepping stone to other more ambitious films in the future. All that needed to happen here was a successful film, one that made some money back for its investors, providing Universal and its partners money back on investment. Luckily as a reviewer I don’t need to care about such things, just as I didn’t care while watching John Carter (another unfairly maligned, ambitious film) about its box office potential. I also can’t speak to the gaming origins – unless it’s Rock Band or a Lego plaything I’m just not spending time marching characters around or blasting at my enemies. No, this thing better work as a movie, full-stop, or it’s doomed.  What I loved about Warcraft is that it takes itself seriously without being dour or pedantic. Narratively we get a mash of all things Tolkeinian, but to see that as redundant is all the more laughable given the Professor’s proclivity for outright theft from Norse and Old English mythology to informs his particular stories.  What the film gets right, really right, is that it’s about character rather than action. Quite simply, this is a film that at its heart spends as much time worried about its characters being three dimensional as it does about it stereographic 3D. There isn’t a dark versus light side, but a whole shade of complex relationships and backgrounds. Yes, superficially it’s about orcs against men, but the film (like the game?) goes out of its way to pay equal shrift to the myriad of sides, crafting allegiances that shift throughout. We’ve got echoes of everything from Lord of the Rings to the book of Exodus at play, with winged Gryphons, sculpted Golems and a (Glenn) Close encounter too boot. There’s a slew of familiar faces here, including Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, and Dylan Schombing, as well as a bunch of Orcish creations brought to life by likes of Toby Kebbell, Robert Kazinksy and Clancy Brown. Stalwart Canadian (and sometime Cylon) Callum Keith Rennie gets a thankless task of hanging out by a mystical hottub, with Ruth Negga (sublime in the upcoming Loving film by Jeff Nichols) makes a queenly appearance. We get Ben Foster, chewing scenes like nobody’s business, as Medivh the Guardian of Tirisfal (!), and Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar, the precocious young mage who sees things a bit more clearly than his masters.  The magical boys seem to have the most fun, while the others battling things out do feel a bit Jacksonian in their look and feel. Again, this isn’t a bad thing, I like having hints of Middle-earth sprinkled through the lens of Azeroth. What makes things chug along is that it’s far more about strategy and character building than just watching things bash one another, and even when it does come to battles big and small the stakes seem to be important and within the scope of the moment. It’s clear there are loads of echoes here only comprehensible to those well versed in this universe, and I’m completely fine with being ignorant of many of the subtleties (it, again, felt far more inviting than yet another Marvel post credit sequence alluding to some other meta-textual nonsense). It’s fair to say that the last chunk of the film really does little more than move the pieces forward, setting up a series that may or may not ever emerge. But as it stands Warcraft does what it needs to – provide a thoughtful, pretty to watch, well-paced character piece about craft alliances, coming to terms with one’s, finding courage with impossible odds and countering powers outside ones control. In another idiom that’s consider a Game of Thrones, shotgunning characters and situations with the illusion that it’s all heading to a culmination. By its very title Warcraft is more interested in process than procedure, it’s about the skill of conducting battle, the gamesmanship and sacrifices that play out rather than the blind appreciation  of the melee.  Look at the names behind some of these credits – it’s cut by Paul Hirsch who made Lucas and DePalma’s best work, and scored by Ramin Djawadi who gives Game of Thrones its epic themes, with Gavin Bocquet who gave production design to many of ILM’s biggest shows and Bill Westenhofer who has done visual effects supervision on everything from Babe to Elf to Life of Pi. There’s no corner’s cut here, no need to dumb down things in order to just smash ‘em up. There’s a sense of care, of pacing, of getting things right as the pieces are put into play. Above all, Warcraft is a lot of fun, giving a sense of the grandiose without falling for its own pretentiousness. Balancing story with action in a way far too few films of this ilk do, it’s a testament to Jones’ craft that he manages to keep all these elements coherent. He balances the need to tell a story of complexity without being hindered by didacticism, provides action and adventure while still making the stakes count. And, yes, it’s all a bit silly, but that’s completely fine – this is summer entertainment that still is nourishing, a storyline drawn from a strategy game that still manages to feel cinematic with a semblance of intellectually nourishing narrative.  It’s an old school epic with new school tech, and at it’s hard it’s a grand old tale that provides a fabulous little fable.  That Shelf sat down with Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver’s director and cast to discuss Netflix’s ambitious sci-fi sequel.

"Jun 10, 2016"," There
was a moment while watching Warcraft
that I simply gave up trying to understand it. There is, undoubtedly, a rich
mythology behind this movie that explains everything happening here. It's based
on a series of video games that have spanned over two decades, spawned books,
and created a massive online community that will dismiss this review outright
with that opening sentence. ""If you didn't even try to understand the
movie,"" a fan might say, ""why are you even reviewing it?"" That's
a good question, hypothetical individual, and trust me, it's one with which I am
currently wrestling. You,
imaginary fan of the games and lover of their worlds, will likely laugh at the
fact that I spent half of the movie believing that the Fell, the mystical
MacGuffin that everyone talks about but no one bothers to explain, is
responsible for the creation of the race of orcs, who are portrayed here as
computer-generated characters that exist in the not-quite-uncanny-enough region
of the Uncanny Valley. The orcs have decided to invade the realm of men,
dwarves, and elves because their own world, which is either across an ocean or
in a different dimension, is dying. The movie never explains the geography,
although it takes a mystical teleportation gate to go between the two worlds. By the
way, I am now, thanks to one of your community's online encyclopedias on the
subject of this franchise, aware that it is not ""the Fell,"" but rather
""the Fel."" I also read that it is a form of destructive
magic""the language of chaos."" This definition does not clarify
anything for a newcomer, by the way. The
screenplay by director Duncan Jones and Charles Leavitt doesn't even go that far
in explaining what the Fel is. In the movie, it's a swirly, green mist that is
controlled by a demon wizard orc named Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), and it's also a
swirly, blue mist that is controlled by Medivh (Ben Foster), the magical
Guardian, in the non-orc realm. There's
a lot of swirly, colored mist in this movie. Another mystical entity is clothed
in a black robe that is surrounded by swirly mist of a similar hue, and the
gateway to this character's lair is through a big, black cube that is powered by
red mist. The Fel is, obviously, magic, and it definitely destroys living
creatures by sucking the souls from their bodies. It also, apparently, creates
super warriors and mages. No one in the movie explains anything about it, so
it's essentially a contradictory catch-all for whatever the movie needs it to
be. The
world has that same random quality, too, as orcs and dwarves and men and elves
and griffins and half-breeds and wizards and unnamed blue creatures and demons
intermingle without any rhyme or reason (Just for fun, there's even an allusion
to the story of Moses). The entire movie feels as if some production head came
up with a bunch of scenes and characters that ""need"" to be in a movie
based on this franchise. The production team put the necessary elements for
those scenes and creatures together, and nobody thought to give those scenes and
the elements of the world a coherent through line. Jones, at least, allows the
brutal battle sequences some breathing room. It's a shame there's no reason to
care about any of them. The
plot, again, involves the orcs trying to take over the realm of men, which, we
find out about halfway through the movie, is called Azeroth. The realm of the
orcs is either left unspoken or mumbled by one of the orcs at some point. An orc
chieftain named Durotan (Toby Kebbell) wants his clan to find a new home but is
suspicious of Gul'dan. In Azeroth, a human warrior named Lothar (Travis Fimmel)
is trying to convince King Llane (Dominic Cooper) that the orcs are a threat.
Garona (Paula Patton, who drew the short straw and had to put on silly makeup
instead of having her character digitally rendered), who is half orc and half
human, takes a liking to humans after being a slave of the orcs. It's
painfully obvious that the actors are dragging their heels through scenes, and
the morose tone of the movie makes the nonsensical affair even more of a slog to
a sequel-pandering non-ending. Warcraft
doesn't make a lick of sense for the uninitiated, and failing to make this
narrative even slightly coherent is the fault of the movie, not those who don't
know this stuff inside and out before seeing it.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," Let’s kick off this review of Warcraft with the disclaimer that it’s written by someone who has never played the game. Before you fire off that hate email, please keep in mind that it should not be necessary to have familiarity with the source material to enjoy a feature film. Moviegoers didn’t need to have read a page of Lord of the Rings to enjoy the film franchise and it wasn’t just existing Tolkien fans who catapulted the movies into mega-blockbuster territory. Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Divergent, every DC and Marvel movie…all of those films are judged on their own merit, separate from the books that inspired them. To say you must have played hours of Warcraft to review a Warcraft movie would be akin to saying you have to be a police officer to review a cop film or a singer/dancer to review a musical. If you want to know how similar the movie is to the video game world, look elsewhere. This is not the review you should be reading for that analysis. Full disclosure complete; moving on to the actual review. Warcraft (the film) is loaded with orcs, dwarves, elves, and humans, some of whom switch allegiances and most of whom you won’t care much about by the end of the film. Set up as the first in a series of Warcraft movies, the world known as Azeroth is established as an Earth-ish environment with different lands, all overseen by someone referred to as the Guardian. Into this peaceful planet plop a bunch of warrior orcs who have left their own dying planet behind to establish a new orc world on Azeroth. This ‘traveling through space, arriving on a new planet’ trick is done via a green portal powered by head orc Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) who’s unusually creepy looking even for an orc and who’s strangely reminiscent of Uncle Deadly from The Muppets (only with green highlights and less flesh). Gul’dan is the master of the gooey green stuff that is produced by dark Fel magic, something I didn’t figure out for quite a while into the film as I kept hearing “Fel” as “Veil.” My misunderstanding of the name is easily explainable as the orcs aren’t exactly into enunciating their words, something which makes following the story at times a tad bit difficult. The orcs immediately begin attacking and destroying anything and everything they encounter once they’ve landed on what they’ll soon declare to be their new homeland. But then one orc decides perhaps this Gul’dan dude is completely crazy and the Fel magic has made him lose touch with what all good orcs should really care about. (Note: the orcs would kill and destroy without Gul’dan, but they would do so by brutal strength, not personality-altering magic.) So, good orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell) – who is also a new father and very protective of his wife and child – believes he can gather a band of like-minded orcs to join with the Azerothians (or Azerothonians) to strip Gul’dan of his leadership now that he’s lost his mind to the dark magic. Meanwhile, the Guardian aka Medivh (Ben Foster) does his best to protect Azeroth using magic, aided by an upstart mage named Khadgar (scene-stealer Ben Schnetzer) who the Guardian thinks is trying to usurp his place as the guy in charge of protecting the world. Also fighting the good fight is Vikings star Travis Fimmel as the heroic Anduin Lothar who doesn’t need magic to kick ass. Anduin is fighting to protect his people and to serve his king and queen, played by real-life couple/Preachers co-stars Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga. Because every action film has to insert a love story to widen its potential audience base, Paula Patton’s on hand as a half-orc who falls for Anduin’s impressive fighting skills. Speaking of fighting, there’s lots of it although who exactly is fighting who is often hard to tell. It’s also difficult to tell one orc from the other, making it easy to lose track of the one who’s supposed to be siding with the humans. The CG action is occasionally impressive, with griffins arriving in the nick of time to save the day and massive wolves (transported from the orc world) providing transportation/battle support. There’s even a Gollum to contend with in this weird Clash of the Titans/Lord of the Rings hybrid. And, just to make things as truly surreal as possible, a six-time Oscar nominated actress shows up for one of the most bizarre (and jarring) cameos ever in a feature film. Look, I don’t play video games but I do enjoy good action films. Writer/director Duncan Jones, tackling his largest budgeted film to date, does actually deliver a few action scenes that are genuinely entertaining and visually striking. The main problem is the characters are simply not all that interesting. Only Schnetzer’s Khadgar and Patton’s Garona express more than one emotion, while Foster’s Medivh is easily the most annoying character to follow. If you don’t catch onto his entire arc by the end of his first scene, then you’re simply not paying any attention. With all the orcs and magic and whatnot to show off, there’s very little time actually devoted to humanizing the main characters. The Warcraft video games apparently have a complex story, but the feature film keeps it all at a surface level and never provides any reason to ever want to catch up with these characters, or this world, again.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 10, 2016"," There are some intriguing tidbits floating around in this movie that manage to keep you engaged, but by the time it is clear this is nothing more than a setup for potential sequels down the road, the lack of resolution squanders any trace of goodwill the movie had built up. What was most promising about this movie was the presence of writer/director Duncan Jones (son of the late, great David Bowie), whose previous credits include the edgy, smart, sci-fi flicks “Moon” and “Source Code.” Here, it feels like Jones may have bit off a little more than he can chew. “Warcraft” is one of those immersive-world video games where you sit down as a somewhat normal person and then when you look up you have no idea what day it is, you find yourself surrounded by pizza boxes and your mother is screaming at you to move out of the basement. In an effort to recreate that deep-dive experience, Jones does deliver on the pomp and bombast required by an “epic” fantasy, but for some reason he left out the brains and heart. But then one day a band of giant, computer-generated warriors called orcs arrive from their dying world through a portal generated by their black-magic dabbling ruler Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). The cast is bland and humorless across the board with each filling out some standard fantasy trope. There is the gallant warrior Lothar (Travis Fimmel, whose character name constantly reminded me of the old Mike Myers “Saturday Night Live” sketch “Lothar of the Hill People”), the rebellious mage (Ben Schnetzer), the noble king (Dominic Cooper), the half-orc, half-human distrusted by both sides (Paula Patton) and a mysterious wizard who serves as guardian of the realm (Ben Foster, an actor I really like, but who seems, if not miscast, at least misunderstood). The most relatable character in the bunch is one of those computer-generated orcs. Durotan (voiced by Toby Kebbell) is an orc chieftain who is conflicted as he wants to do right by his people, but does not approve of the black-magic carnage caused by his leader. Unfortunately, Durotan’s character arc winds up being mostly pointless, which is not something you want to leave an audience with if you expect them to come back for a sequel. Again, the special effects are top-shelf and the musical score thunders along with the action, but in the end it is really hard to care about any of it.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 10, 2016","  I feel conflicted about Duncan Jones’ Warcraft. On the one hand, it’s a movie that comes off as bloated, loaded down with exposition, and constantly trying to service too many characters while ultimately serving almost none of them. And yet it’s also a film that left me wanting more. Jones’ ambition sucks us in with his unabashed high fantasy world building. Warcraft is a film that is loaded with problems, and yet I couldn’t help but admire what it was trying to accomplish.   The world of orcs is dying so the dark mage Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) has opened a portal to the world of Azeroth. The orcs plan to capture as many humans as possible so that Gul’dan can use their souls to power the portal and bring in the remaining hordes. The orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and his friend Orgrim (Robert Kazinsky) see that the dark magic Gul’dan is using, named “The Fel”, is damaging orc kind and believe that in order to save their people, they must unite with the humans. King Llane (Dominic Cooper) leads the humans along with his brother-in-law Lothar (Travis Fimmel), and they are assisted by the half-breed Garona (Paula Patton), the mage Medivh (Ben Foster), and the mage-in-training Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer).   Warcraft greedily wants to have all the plots, but in trying to service everyone, it ends up helping no one. Character motivations become muddled and some characters are described as interesting or have the potential to become interesting, but instead remain basic. For example, Gul’dan is ostensibly the villain, but he ends up saving Durotan’s newborn child when it comes through the portal. That should create conflicted feelings from Durotan about how he should lead his people but if he should also honor the orc who saved his child. But the film never does anything with that, and so a moment of potential conflict is laid by the wayside.   I admire Jones’ attempt to show both sides of the conflict and make us sympathize with the orcs, but because the orcs are underdeveloped, his attempt comes up short. I constantly found myself wanting to go back to Medivh’s storyline, not just because Foster is terrific (as always), but because there’s an interesting dynamic at play between the elder guardian and the neophyte Khadgar. If the story had focused more on this relationship, it could have blossomed into something grander, but it never gets the time to develop because the story is always jumping around between its many characters.   With such scattershot storytelling, it’s difficult to latch on to anyone, and while some actors give better performances than others (along with Foster, Fimmel and Kebbell are the standouts), we still want to know them better. Warcraft is this constant double-edged sword where we’re getting too much and yet not getting enough of anything. It’s like if someone dumped a bunch of thread at your feet and told you it was a shirt.   The only thing that feels fully crafted in Warcraft is the world. I went to see the movie with a fan of the game, and she said that this is a film that definitely errs on the side of the fans, and that in one scene where we see the orcs rampaging through villages, the geography of Azeroth is spot on. That’s great for fans, but it’s lost on those who are unfamiliar with the lore or who have never booted up Blizzard’s popular strategy game.   And yet I could still admire the high fantasy Jones brought into place. Rather than go for “realism” like Game of Thrones or even Lord of the Rings, Jones embraces the weirdness and high fantasy aspect, and it’s absolutely thrilling. Some may find that it’s a bridge too far and that it becomes silly, but I was completely on board with the human-smashing, orc-hammering, bird-flying, spell-casting goodness on display. Warcraft never makes excuses for what it is, and I love that it has the confidence to be as weird as it wants.   I also have to give special attention to the astounding visual effects. The orcs look absolutely incredible, and the only time I was ever taken out of the movie was when I was far away and looking at a CGI horde smash up against another CGI horde. Up close and personal, the orcs are photo-real, and Jones takes the time to let us sit with their emotions. Again, there are going to be some viewers who can’t be on board with orcs acting like people, but if you can embrace the concept, you can marvel at what Industrial Light & Magic has pulled off.   I wouldn’t go so far to call Warcraft a good movie. It’s crushed under its own ambition, and yet that ambition is highly admirable in the same way as films like John Carter where it might not work, but it earns points just for being bold and different in an increasingly homogenized landscape. And while Warcraft suffers from throwing too much at the audience, I would happily return for a sequel, assuming it’s more focused.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007.

"Jun 10, 2016"," The action unfolds in fits and starts against seemingly infinite backdrops crowded with detail, yet only roughly digitized. The point of view shifts rapidly from one character to another while the camera zooms in and out, moving abruptly from vast perspectives to intense close-ups. Does Warcraft remind you of anything? Well, a video game, of course. It is easy to mock Warcraft. After all, it's a movie that wants you to empathize with a bunch of meathead orcs, each one sporting a pair of curling tusks on his lower lip. Plus it is based on a video-game franchise that is also painfully long in the tooth. The American press was predicting a massive flop even before the movie screened for critics this week (while condescending to note that it is already playing very well in China). But to point to the movie's obvious limitations seems to miss what is important here: With Warcraft, British director Duncan Jones, himself an avid gamer and a director building a strong reputation for smart sci-fi (Moon; Source Code), seeks to honour not merely the broad outlines of Warcraft's orcs vs. humans storyline, but also the visual and narrative experience of a video game. Of course, a movie isn't interactive and most game adaptations – it is a smallish field with a poor reputation – attempt to cash in on popular properties by simply trading off the lure of interactivity for the delights of big action on a big screen. Jones's much more intelligent and aesthetic approach to the problem is not entirely new – the Resident Evil franchise has been credited with successfully reflecting the video-game sensibility – but it does make Warcraft visually interesting throughout. As human characters appear against patently computerized backgrounds, or the camera pulls back to reveal impossibly vast canyons, towering cliffs or dazzling cities, the effect is reminiscent of the shimmering vistas of those ghastly Clone Wars episodes in the Star Wars franchise back when filmmakers were drunk on the possibilities of CGI. But, more than a decade later, the effect here is purposeful, reproducing the alluring vertigo of gameplay. Similarly, the abrupt shifts in camera angles, including both dizzying heights and odd depths – one shot is from beneath an orc's chest as she lies on the ground – seem to mimic the perpetual reloading of images as the player navigates the game. The story also takes its inspiration from a central aspect of a multi-character game: You can choose which side you want to play. Here, that means we switch continually between the orc story and the human one, sympathizing with both. As his world shrivels and dies, the orc chieftain, Durotan, must follow an increasingly demented leader through a magic portal into the human world where the orcs can suck life out of humans to replenish their own. On the human side, the warrior Lothar must fight off the orcs to save his king, with help from an erratic magical Guardian, his increasingly confident acolyte, Khadgar, and Garona, the co-operative orc Amazon whom the humans have taken prisoner. (The names are both complicated and silly, but no more so than the Frodos, Gandalfs and Aragorns who populate The Lord of the Rings.) This narrative is strongly constructed with a workaday plot of sacrifices and betrayals, plus a few hints of the environmentalism that animated James Cameron's Avatar. What is less successful is the actual dialogue as Jones and his co-writer, Charles Leavitt, struggle to find a heightened tone that will fit pseudo-medieval royals without sounding merely pompous. They lurch around a lot in that regard. The creators do, however, have a nice solution to the language barrier between the two species. The orcs speak in English among themselves, but that becomes incomprehensible orcish when the humans are around. Attempts at humour, on the other hand, fall painfully flat as the writers reach for the kind of smartass repartee that so enlivened the first Star Wars trilogy, but completely fail to grasp it. The characters are one-dimensional, but this is fantasy fiction not domestic drama. In particular, Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga have no material with which to fashion the wafer-thin king and queen. Negga's character is then badly shortchanged by the movie's conclusion as Jones, who has flirted with the idea that this realm might not be a patriarchy, quickly abandons the idea. Still, the performances of Travis Fimmel, Toby Kebbell and Paula Patton as the warrior Lothar, the orc hero Durotan and the half-orc/half-woman Garona, all awakening to the evil forces around them, are meaty enough to hold attention. Ben Schnetzer's counterintuitive performance as the magician-in-training Khadgar also grew on me as his flat, pedestrian tones eventually seemed to take hold of the magical character. Otherwise, the supernatural and, in particular, the bad wizards are unevenly served up by the special effects team with Ben Foster doing an erratic turn as Jesus Christ, a.k.a. the Guardian Medivh. While the orcs are often engrossing and the manifestations of wizardry more or less mysterious, the final effect is badly spoiled when a giant clay golem that looks laughably like the Thing in Fantastic Four blunders into the picture. Will gamers themselves, steeped in spiralling fantasy worlds enlarged by their own imaginations, find this all too little? They will almost certainly find that the movie, 10 years in the making, comes too late. At the screening I attended, publicists were handing out T-shirts to audience members who could answer skill-testing questions, and it was clear that the crowd had no idea how many versions of Warcraft have been issued by Blizzard Entertainment to date – and didn't really care. Bonus points, though, to the woman who correctly identified the year the first Warcraft game appeared: 1994.

This action fantasy is a mind-numbing (and mind-dumbing) tale of humans and orcs that either knows how ludicrous it is and refuses to admit it or simply has no clue. Either way, it’s hard to imagine a more colossal clunker this summer. Fans of the hugely popular video game series upon which it’s based will find it hard to care about this story of wizards and spells and dimensional portals, which has all the accessibility of a deep web message board discussion about LARPing. Even the actors — especially an in-over-her-head Paula Patton as Garona, a green-skinned half-orc, and Ben Foster as a robe-wearing guardian with shifting loyalties — look like they’d rather be playing video games. Director Duncan Jones, who co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt, does pack some impressive visual oomph into this lead-footed turkey, so it’s not a total washout. But his attempts to bring coherence to the story are met with a deadening thud. The story opens when the orcs, hulking creatures who all look modeled after Ron Perlman, use a glowing gateway to invade the land of Azeroth to escape their dying world of Draenor. Loyalties and motivations are tested as war draws on, and only the most scattered attempts at levity in the script break up the huge blocks of narrative sludge. Jones — director of 2009’s over-praised “Moon” and son of David Bowie — may have been the right man for this job, but that’s assuming anyone was the right man for this job. “Warcraft” isn’t meant for the movies. Sometimes video games are best left as video games.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," Full disclosure: I’ve never played Warcraft. I was going to read the Wikipedia page so I’d have an idea of the characters and gameplay, but eh, life is short. Everyone knows video games peaked with Frogger anyway. As a movie, “Warcraft” is an incomprehensible special-effects sizzle reel — as Shakespeare said, full of sound and fury and stunningly realized orcs, and signifying nothing. It’s about a race of giant-fisted monsters who open a portal to the human realm for purposes of destroying all humans, and the humans who fight back against this proposal. Besides the main conflict between orcs and humans, there are also internecine squabbles on both sides. Not since the cursed “Hobbit” trilogy have I experienced such a bad case of Who are these people and why are they fighting? Loosely, there’s a pretty decent orc chieftain named Durotan (voiced and motion-captured by Toby Kebbell) who needs to move his clan to a new home, and a fairly noble human named Lothar (Travis Fimmel) whose brother-in-law, Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), is the king in the human realm of Azeroth. There’s also a “half-breed” slave, Garona (Paula Patton), who’s part orc and, I thought, part human, except the movie tells us orcs and humans haven’t had contact before now, so I don’t know what the other half of her is. She’s green, though. There is also a doughy-faced magician boy, Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) — and magicians are not welcome in Azeroth, for reasons not explained, but Khadgar swears he’s cool — who discovers that a misty green evil magic called the Fell (?) has been introduced into the land. This makes everyone nervous, so they call for a Guardian (it’s a job title) named Medivh (Ben Foster). Well, Khadgar suggests it, but someone says, “Only a king summons a Guardian!” So the king has to do it. I picture dice being rolled at this point, though I know Warcraft does not involve dice. This chaotic, thundering, dull fantasy mess was directed by Duncan Jones, a talented sci-fi filmmaker (“Moon,” “Source Code”) whose father was David Bowie, so let’s be nice to him. He wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt (“Seventh Son”), evidently unconcerned whether it made sense or had characters we could follow and sympathize with. The film is neither campy nor interesting — but to its credit, it doesn’t seem like it’s based on a video game, either. It seems like it’s based on second-hand descriptions of poorly remembered scenes from “Lord of the Rings” or “Game of Thrones.”",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," Duncan Jones’ Warcraft is the kind of movie that’ll make a person want to pull out their phone as it screens, just to figure out what in the hell is going on. This is not to condone phone use during movies at all, mind you; it’s a real concern. After minutes of studio logos and the kind of trembling bass that could break bones, Warcraft opens on the pensive face of an orc. He’s one of many orcs. Oh, and a father expecting a child. But, orcs? Are they like bigger goblins, or misshapen and steroidal human beings with bad dentistry? It’s hard to hear what they’re saying under the gravelly voices and tooth obstructions. This orc has a name, right? It was really hard to make out. Is the “orc” public domain now? Didn’t Tolkien invent that? Anyway, there’s a whole country full of orcs, it would seem, but what’s with the wall of green light these orcs are preparing to walk through? They’re going to another dimension or world via a wormhole? Do they bring peace? Oh, they’re fighting. And the magic used for the green hole, it’s made up of human souls? And that magic is called “The Fell?” And “The Fell” is controlled by a glowing, Norwegian Viking-looking monster fella by the name of “God-Damn?” Oh, it’s “Gul’dan?” Is this knockoff Stargate supposed to look this painful? It looks like it is. And another thing, those large canines on the orcs’ underbite – do those teeth cut the orcs’ lips a lot? And what poor animator got stuck painting chest hair, and dreadlocks, on these orcs for months? They are computer creatures, yes? Why is so much happening so quickly? This moaning isn’t meant to sound reductive of fantasy, or of any genre filmmaking, but of creating a universe of “stuff” on film and the care typically needed to do so. And Warcraft is almost impossible to follow, unless of course you live and breathe the games. From the very popular MMO series, Universal brings us Warcraft, a would-be franchise starter that misinterprets “wonder” as “endless, nonstop questions.” It would take some serious magic to keep up with the film upon first viewing. Or several. Warcraft’s broadly defined spell: Old-time magic with sprinkles of pseudo-environmentalism and “can’t we all just get along” battle parable. Those aforementioned orcs are being led by a demi-god, Gul’dan (mo-capped by Daniel Wu), into human lands to suck up all the natural resources and build little trailer parks made of bones. And fight. With large, anvil-styled hammers. Through long overhead shots that seem to resemble the source games. The heroic orc is Durotan (Toby Kebbell). He’s the proud, expecting father and chieftain that his clan loves and respects. At least that’s what people keep saying. Durotan is morally rich, the large brute with a heart of gold, who takes pause over the aggressive expansion of orc lands. Then there are human places, with futuristic Detroit car names like “Ironforge” and “Stormwind,” with kings and knights and damsels and griffins and lovingly articulated castle porn. For the sake of ease in characterizing plot, the human hero is Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Long-haired, lightly scarred, and haughty like Thor, the man practically screams “stock hero type.” And now the abbreviated ingredients for this stale, flat, and paradoxically rushed potion: Orcs fight humans. Humans fight orcs. CG battles and trips to mysterious new lands ad nauseum. Wizards. Fireworks shows. Ghosts, maybe? Head chopping. Orc stabbing. Paula Patton with snaggled teeth and green make-up, treated like a Star Trek extra. Consumption of souls. Black cubes. Golems. Hot tubs full of light. Ben Foster playing with magic like it requires internal batteries to be recharged. Armor. Forests. Castles in the sky. And an uncredited cameo from Glenn Close, hiding under a hood. Meaningless losses of life. Abrupt conclusions. A strong sense of over-familiarity, thanks to the genre tropes about fights and clans and what have you. Warcraft 2: Coming Summer TBD Based on Worldwide Profits.  Jones slaves to make something of the material, and to his credit, or rather his profoundly large cast and crew’s credit, the craft is certainly visible in Warcraft. It feels rude not to compliment the hard work of the makeup, costume, production design, and visual effects teams. The orcs in particular, are powered by Industrial Light & Magic, with all the terabytes of imagery and fine-combed details well within Jones’ grasp. From the glistening eyes to the tiny licks of the upper teeth, the orcs feel more human than the real ones dropped in phony places with well-designed props. But shiny trinkets and finely-crafted trolls do not a film make. Warcraft is so aggressive in its accumulation of content and scale that any narrative arc, or emotional output, beneath the shimmer is hard to find. The story only bridges the battles with meaningless double-crosses and revelations, and consists of the kind of vague sword-and-sorcery stuff done better in untold legions of other stories. Lothar sees the world differently after fighting. Durotan sees the world differently after fighting. It’s near-impossible to find any characterization amidst what is yet another elaborate work of chaos worship. Warcraft wants to distinguish itself as genre fare with substance, but this only applies to its production value. Jones searches for depth within the fray, especially in the case of the otherworldly creatures, and yet the film concerns itself with louder, more throbbing action fitting of a summer tentpole. The mob (or horde, as it’s called here) rules. On the endless race to fight scenes, digital lemmings seize the day in the end. There was a great, failed sitcom in the ‘90s with Jay Mohr called Action, about studio-level shenanigans. At one point, Mohr’s executive faces disaster as his $150 million summer film does poorly with critics and audiences after he went to great pains to ramp up the stylized violence. The film’s title: Slow Torture. Mohr had a hit on his hands, but realizes he forgot to care about story or something remotely appealing and distinct within an oversaturated market already full of enough bellowing action. Funny. Warcraft prizes its “breakthrough” digital effects. It has an alleged $160 million budget. And the thunder of visual filmic decoration masks a hollow, hard fantasy, indistinguishable from the rest. Perhaps Jones could put Action on his Amazon Wish List before his next outing.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2016","   If someone had the ambition to interview the subscribers of the World of Warcraft online game, I daresay any one of them — 5.5 million, as of last September — would have come up with a more coherent story than what the Hollywood pros created for the mess that is ""Warcraft."" Set in the land of Azeroth, where knights ride griffins and nerdy boys learn magic, this adventure tale imagines a clash between the locals and the invading Orc hordes who are escaping their ravaged home via a green-magic portal. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) entrusts his noblest knight, Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), and his guardian wizard, Medivh (Ben Foster), to devise a strategy against the Orc armies.  Some of the Orcs, we learn, are good: The half-orc Garona (Paula Patton) earns the King's trust and strikes romantic sparks with Lothar — while the Orc chieftain Durotan (a computer-animated creation performed by Toby Kebbell) plots rebellion against the warlord Gul'dan (performed by Daniel Wu), whose evil magic controls the portal.  Director Duncan Jones (""Moon,"" ""Source Code""), rewriting a screenplay by Charles Leavitt (""In the Heart of the Sea""), aims to be true to the popular multiplayer video game, piling on legions of Orcs, human soldiers and other creatures that strain the computer-graphics imagination and mock the PG-13 rating.  Alas, even with Jones' occasional flashes of visual wonder, the story is a dull hodgepodge of fantasy elements familiar to readers of J.R.R. Tolkien, George R.R. Martin and authors who don't have extraneous middle initials. ",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016",Warcraft has achieved a lofty goal: There hasn't been a movie as unrelentingly bad since Jupiter Ascending managed to surpass the bloated and pitiful Battlefield Earth as the worst big budget science-fiction film of all time.,NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," In an age when movies based on spandex-clad comic book heroes get raves from critics and make major box office bank, it’s strange that films adapted from video games are still viewed with suspicion – even hostility – before the first frame is shot. Then again, video game movies generally fall on a quality spectrum somewhere between thuddingly mediocre and utter crap. You don’t get to roll in piles of dung and then be angry when people say you stink. Warcraft tries hard to break this dark curse, remaining faithful to the spirit and colour of Blizzard Entertainment’s long-running series of strategy and role-playing games while standing on its own as a piece of entertainment. But despite bringing the game world to life with impressive visual effects, it gets impaled by a muddled plot and hammy performances. Directed by Duncan Jones, who did the cerebral sci-fi flicks Moon and Source Code, Warcraft tells the tale of a race of fierce orcs who, having exhausted the resources of their dying world, open a magic portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth. While their invasion is brutal and murderous, it’s motivated by a desperate desire for survival that makes them oddly sympathetic. The orcs, created with sophisticated performance-capture effects, are fantastic. In fact, these entirely computer-generated characters – including Toby Kebbell as the thoughtful orc chieftain Durotan and Daniel Wu as the villainous shaman Gul’dan – outshine the human actors to such a degree that any time the action shifts to smirking warrior Lothar (Vikings’ Travis Fimmel) or inscrutable wizard Medivh (Ben Foster), we long to go back and see what’s happening with the orcs. (Paula Patton does her level best as the sexy, headstrong half-orc Garona, but it’s impossible to take her green makeup and stubby fangs seriously.) Jones, who co-wrote the script, does a good job of elevating the orcs beyond sword-fodder villains, but the story strives for a complexity that gets undermined again and again by cliche-riddled dialogue, pacing problems and performances that sometimes feel like they came out of a high school adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. The movie ends with major conflicts left unresolved, and Universal is clearly hoping to launch an ongoing franchise that will delve into the rich lore of this universe.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Since the debut, success, and culmination of The Sopranos, the American gangster film, the former pillar of the medium, has been stagnant. The weight, scope and unerring detail and quality of David Chase’s seminal HBO series even made The Departed, which finally landed Martin Scorsese an Oscar, seem scant in comparison. The thriving triumph of Game Of Thrones now appears to have done the same to the fantasy genre. I mean, how can we expect Warcraft’s 123-minute running time to compete against the 57 episodes and counting that Game Of Thrones has so far aired? Well, to start with Warcraft could at least have a coherent plot and mythology, both of which are thrown at its audience with a gibberish vociferation that barely register. At times, especially early on, you’re left considering your mental state as the vast, bustling array of characters fighting for screen time quickly discuss events and history that you’re almost certain you’ve never heard about before with the reverence of a priest discussing the last supper in church. Warcraft jitters around like a coffee-addled teen that’s been studying all night. At first we’re introduced to Durotan (Toby Kebbell), a noble Orc who is also the Chieftain of his own Clan. Since the Orc home world is dying, they travel through a major portal powered by the lives of innocents to the Stormwind Kingdom, where the evil Gul’dan sets out to kill all humans. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), the ruler of Stormwind, soon gets wind of this invasion, and alongside his leading knight Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the Guardian of Trisfal, Medivh (Ben Foster), as well as Medivh’s apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) they set out to quash this uprising, even though the Horde of Orcs outnumber them greatly. However, they end up getting a helping hand from Garona Halforcen (Paula Patton) an Orc-draenei survivor that believes she’s half-human, as well as other members of the Horde that are questioning their evil leader. I have to admit, I only really fully got to grips with Warcraft’s zipping, convoluted, and ill-defined narrative and its numerous threads after writing the above. While the film’s resplendent visuals are immediately apparent, all of which marches along to, surprise surprise, Game Of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi’s tub-thumping battle cry of a score, Warcraft quickly realizes that it has too much plot and too little time. You constantly feel like you’re playing catch-up. Everything is too rushed, too condensed - eagle-eyed viewers will even spot where it has been cut down - and you ultimately feel lost as it seems to circle around the same points without any real forward momentum. Warcraft also doesn’t help itself by adding a complicated nuance to its characters, which only hinders its set-up. Rather than simply drawing a line in the middle and saying these are the goodies and these are the baddies, each character is given their own issues and complexion. Obviously this kind of character development is always appreciated, but against the whizzing turbulence of Warcraft’s plot it means that, as a viewer, you never get a sure footing and you’re left wailing as it proceeds. Yet, while at the outset, Warcraft’s sheer amount of characters, their issues, and the film’s brevity, all combine to make it unconscionable, once you become accustomed it starts to pay dividends. In fact, the conclusion fully realizes, heightens, and brings together its characters plights in a well-rounded, truly climatic fashion that makes it resonant and provides a satisfying pay off. Director Duncan Jones takes to his first mega-budget blockbuster (Source Code only cost $32 million to make, while Warcraft clocks in at a reported $160 million) with the composure, emotion, and flair that we’d all hoped for. Not only does he have an eye for spectacle that rivals Zack Snyder and Michael Bay, but he slyly integrates the special effects, never allowing them to overwhelm or sabotage the heart and relatabality of the film, while using an eclectic, gorgeous and arresting color palette that’s truly vivid. Through his multi-faceted role (he also co-wrote the script), Jones is able to allow his own personality to shine, which is embodied by the emotional character development of the characters. Even the motion capture used to bring the Orcs to life doesn’t stop their humanity from shining through. At the same time, Jones embraces the weird and disturbing, and the effects used to show the haunting magical draining of life will cause you to wince with horror. Duncan Jones can’t solve all Warcraft’s problems, though. In fact, he’s partly responsible for its break-neck start and poor juggling of characters that proves so tiresome. But his keen eye and palpable ambition doesn’t only salvage but makes the blockbuster just about worthwhile. So much so that after wading through the mire of its mythology, I’d even be interested in seeing more from the franchise.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2016"," Director Duncan Jones made quite an impression with his first two features, “Moon” (2009) and “Source Code” (2011). They were intelligent, immersive science fiction that made us think and feel, and that delivered an amazing bang for their production buck. (Lunar miniatures!) You could see their imprint all over bigger-budget variations like Tom Cruise’s “Oblivion” and “Edge of Tomorrow.” If it wasn’t quite enough to keep reviewers from mentioning first thing that Jones is David Bowie’s son, it should have been. Which brings us, after a five-year wait, to “Warcraft,” Jones’s adaptation of the long-running video game and standard-setter for the online role-playing crowd. The hope would be that it just opens up the director’s vision — and the fantasy genre — to supply him with the sort of megabudget tools and toys that he had so far managed to do without. The fear is that Jones’s storytelling smarts and aesthetic resourcefulness could wind up sacrificed to the chaos and overblown approach of a generic would-be blockbuster. Unfortunately, fear wins out. The movie sets up the franchise’s central clash between medieval-ish human society and steroidal orcs, eye-catchingly rendered like the Hulk with a tusky underbite and creative battle piercings. (Diehards, please resist the urge to bludgeon this non-gamer with an orc mallet if I don’t do justice to all the gnarly details.) With their own world dying, the orcs open a mystical portal to man’s beatific realm. The human defense is led by inconsistently sardonic knight Lothar (Travis Fimmel, TV’s “Vikings”), with insider support from captured slave Garona (Paula Patton, more ridiculous than resplendent in green orc makeup). The spotlighted orc, meanwhile, is conflicted tribal chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell, doing motion capture on the heels of “Fantastic Four,” poor guy). Ultimately, the fighting is less about might than magic. The orcs follow grizzled, vicious Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), who drains prisoners’ souls to power the portal, while Lothar’s people turn to guardian warlock Medivh (Ben Foster, cast with a pinch of TV-movie Merlin, a dash of longhair Howard Hughes, and several heaping scoops of “What were they thinking?”). There’s an intriguing development in Durotan’s heretical conclusion that only a human alliance can prevent Gul’dan’s dark spells from snuffing out another world. But aside from this, it’s all awfully sub-Tolkien. There’s nary an honorable death that resonates, although we do get some creative visual perspectives on enthusiastically digitized brutality. But wasn’t the game good for that already? Directed by Duncan Jones. Written by Charles Leavitt and Jones. Starring Travis Fimmel, Toby Kebbell, Paula Patton, Ben Foster.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Despite what you may have heard, Warcraft—a movie based on the staggeringly popular series of video games—is neither the worst movie ever made nor the greatest. Its director, Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code), actually knows what he’s doing, and the story hangs together surprisingly well, considering that the movie’s official synopsis opens with “The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders” and ends with “From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home.” You try making a movie out of that while keeping a straight face. Still, there are a few things in Warcraft to enjoy, at least in a pointing-and-grunting sort of way: Women characters flounce around in abbreviated animal-skin outfits almost glammed up enough to look at home Roxy Music album cover. The Azerothians, if that’s what you call them, strut around in silly but not-wholly unattractive medieval-faire garb, while the heavily CGI-enhanced Orcs—those would be the invaders, the most memorable of whom is Toby Kebbell, as the principled warrior Durotan—are bulked-up in a repulsively fascinating way. They stomp around on their heavy, beefy feet, looking perpetually a bit forlorn and perplexed, thanks to the specific dental characteristic they all share: underbite fangs. Still, the Orcs aren’t a wholly uncivilized people. Their big problem is that they’ve come under the rule of a despot, which is why they’re on the rampage in the first place. Left to their own devices, they have some intricate societal rules, and they’re affectionate toward their children. That doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement: They show a fondness for over-accessorizing that would make even Iris Apfel blanch. Fave style accents include multiple facial piercings, necklaces made of bones and animal teeth, and hippie braids threaded through beads. Apparently, they’ve never heard of Coco Chanel’s apocryphal style rule: “Look in the mirror before you leave the house and remove one accessory.” Or even just: “Elegance is refusal.” Anyway, that kind of visual insanity—plus a few crazy battle sequences—are the things that make Warcraft almost worth watching, if you still find yourself at loose ends after you’ve given the dog a bath, organized 10 years’ worth of tax returns and completely moth-proofed your closet. The true horror of Warcraft is that it features a roster of actors who shouldn’t have to resort to this sort of thing. In China, the film made $45 million on its opening day, so anybody who gets a cut of international box office profits will be laughing all the way to the bank. Even so—what is Dominic Cooper, perfectly fine in pictures like The Duchess, An Education and The History Boys, doing shambling about in sub-King Arthur gear? Seeing Ben Foster playing a magickal Merlyn-Gandalf hybrid (who isn’t even, by the way, enough of either) is dispiriting. The Ethiopian-born actress Ruth Negga plays a regal queen here, and she escapes with her dignity intact. Negga is so superb in Jeff Nichols’ Civil Rights drama Loving, to be released later this year, that she may just win an Oscar—unscathed, she will leave Warcraft behind her. But Paula Patton, as a half-human, half-Orc warrior woman Garona, deserves so much better. Patton has one of the biggest roles in Warcraft, and is, hands down, the chief reason to bother with it—she gives a real performance, dusted with subtleties that are pretty much wasted in this otherwise big, dumb, Jethro Bodine-scaled spectacle. Patton has been terrific in some underappreciated pictures, like the 2008 Outkast musical Idlewild (a modern classic that will someday get its due), and she’s given sturdy, appealing performances in movies like Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol and Tony Scott’s Déjà Vu. And she gave the best performance in Lee Daniels’ Precious, as a conscientious teacher. In Warcraft, she can barely deliver her lines—her prosthetic underfangs keep jabbing at her upper lip, giving her a slight lisp. By the end of Warcraft, she’s the only character who makes you wonder: What will she do next? For this, she deserves combat pay.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," Near the end of “Warcraft” — an elaborate, exhausting cinematic collision of humans and Orcs, live actors and digital extras, geek enthusiasms and multiplex dollars — the director Duncan Jones grants us a breather from all the thundering mayhem. A hooded oracle with an uncanny (and unbilled) resemblance to Glenn Close emerges from the shadows to deliver some cryptic words of wisdom: “From light comes darkness, and from darkness, light.” There are a few different ways to read this prophecy. Is it a metaphor for the intimate coupling of good and evil on this epic canvas? An assurance that the end is coming and, with it, the lights that will guide your relieved exit from the theater? A promise that — even without the cheat sheet supplied by the thoughtful folks at Universal Pictures — the story’s impenetrable tangle of names and lineages, far-flung realms and otherworldly species will eventually be made clear to the uninitiated? That promise is kept, up to a point, even if the end result is not enlightenment so much as weary, battered resignation. Having never read the novels or played the games in Blizzard Entertainment’s massively popular “Warcraft” franchise (unless the sound of my college dorm mates pounding their computers next door counts by way of osmosis), I can attest that it’s possible to spend much of this movie’s two-hour running time in a state of blissful incomprehension — carried along less by the cluttered exposition of the script than by Jones’ fervent commitment to his own world building. There are stretches of tedium in this lumpy and derivative mythology, to be sure. But there are also immersive IMAX 3-D backdrops, striking ambiguities and irresistible moments of straight-faced lunacy. The line between hack work and labor of love may be perilously thin, but you can sense the difference in the way Jones earnestly, wholeheartedly embraces the magic that powers this realm: Not since the last “Harry Potter” movie have you seen this many wizards with dazzling CGI lightning bolts crackling at their fingertips. Missteps and all, the movie pulses with a true believer’s conviction. That’s reassuring, as it would otherwise be hard to imagine a more drastic or puzzling leap than the one Jones has made over the course of three movies — from the deft, minimalist science fiction of his 2009 debut, “Moon,” to this frenzied, maximalist sword-and-sorcery circus. (In between came “Source Code,” his divertingly clever brainteaser starring Jake Gyllenhaal.) Yet even within the confines and compromises of this studio-engineered behemoth — the latest high-priced Hollywood attempt to transmute an interactive brand into box-office gold — there are telltale signs of a filmmaker’s vision. Working from a screenplay by Charles Leavitt (the writer of last year’s forgettable fantasy “Seventh Son”), Jones has extended one of his recurring dramatic themes by plunging us once more into a world of uncertain allegiances and dubious systems of power. The world in this case is Azeroth, a realm whose green forests and towering citadels are not too far removed, visually or conceptually, from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, with which it shares a similarly diverse population of humans, elves, dwarfs and Orcs. Those Orcs — a horde of hulking brutes with foul tempers, huge tusks and awesome piercings — actually hail from a kingdom called Draenor (so named, according to legend, for its exceptional plumbing), but have now chosen to invade the peaceful lands of Azeroth through a giant cross-dimensional portal. They are led by the evil Gul’dan (Daniel Wu, not that you can tell beneath the horns), who plans to conquer Azeroth using the Fel, a form of magic so dark and corruptive it runs the risk of destroying everyone and everything before the sequel arrives. Trying to work against Gul’dan and save his people is the wise and well-muscled Durotan (Toby Kebbell), a respected Orc chieftain whose wife, Draka (Anna Galvin), is about to give birth. The eventual fate of their improbably cute, pointy-eared infant suggests the filmmakers are not above plundering the Old Testament, along with “The Lord of the Rings,” “Star Wars” and other seminal pop mythologies. The film owes a particular debt to James Cameron’s “Avatar” — not only in its skillful use of performance-capture technology to bring a fictional race to credible life (Kebbell’s Durotan is an expressive standout), but also in the way it complicates our sympathies where its human characters are concerned. Some of this is strategic. Jones pointedly introduces Durotan and his fellow Orcs first, and we soon grasp that, Gul’dan’s unchecked megalomania notwithstanding, the horde is bent on survival rather than domination. There’s also the unfortunate fact that most of the human characters are far less memorably realized. The biggest disappointment is Anduin Lothar, the formidable commander of Azeroth’s military forces, given a colorless, poor-man’s-Aragorn interpretation by the Australian actor Travis Fimmel (best known for the TV series “Vikings”). Lothar’s chief nemesis is an all-powerful enchanter known as the Guardian, whose own private dabblings with the Fel — basically the Dark Side of the Force, but with fewer syllables — do not bode well for humankind. (The Guardian’s inevitable turn toward treachery is perhaps signaled too early by the fact that he’s played by Ben Foster.) Elsewhere, Dominic Cooper makes a wanly regal king of Azeroth, while Ben Schnetzer is a nicely impetuous Khadgar, a gifted young sorcerer following his own difficult destiny. Straddling the two opposing races is Garona, a half-Orc, half-human who is played, in the flesh and sans performance-capture, by a green-skinned Paula Patton. Forced to align herself with Lothar and his companions, Garona is the most conflicted of the movie’s major characters, initially scornful yet increasingly accepting of her captors’ human vulnerability. Attentive fans may well divine some similarities between Garona and Gamora, the similarly green-hued heroine played by Zoe Saldana in “Guardians of the Galaxy.” They may even be inclined to remark on a dubious trend of talented black actresses having to make like Margaret Hamilton in “The Wizard of Oz.” I’ll leave it to more advanced “Warcraft” scholars to parse the movie’s tricky racial politics, which are offset to some degree by the casting of Ruth Negga as Azeroth’s wise and compassionate queen. Ridiculous as it might seem, Jones actually invites this level of scrutiny: His movie seeks to overturn the familiar humans-good, beasties-bad formula, and to show that no side can claim to be exclusively good or evil. As heads get smashed and limbs get severed during the climactic battle — goosed by the surge and sweep of the score by composer Ramin Djawadi (“Game of Thrones”) — your mind might start casting about, as mine did, for a real-world political subtext. Are we supposed to infer something from the characters’ clashing shades of red and blue war paint? Is Gul’dan, with his callous disregard for his followers, the Orc version of Donald Trump? (Is there even a difference?) The film, which ends mid-battle and with an eye on the franchise horizon, doesn’t say. Maybe Glenn Close already said it all.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Warcraft is yet another flame-out in Hollywood’s unceasingly struggle to turn video games into satisfying movies. And it’s a particularly frustrating one, since writer/director Duncan Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt do their darndest to tell a good story. Warcraft is yet another flame-out in Hollywood’s unceasingly struggle to turn video games into satisfying movies. And it’s a particularly frustrating one, since writer/director Duncan Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt do their darndest to tell a good story. Hollywood’s battlefield is littered with the bones of failed efforts, right back to Super Mario Bros. in 1993. The problem, it seems to me, is that game characters morph and meld with the personalities of individual players while their film counterparts are rigidly defined by screenplays. Warcraft is yet another flame-out, and a particularly frustrating one, since writer/director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) and his co-writer Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) have made a sincere attempt to break the jinx. They labour to set up nuanced characters before smashing skulls, and to bring a smattering of dramatic rigour to a sprawling videogame franchise that dates back to the early ’90s, which my sons fondly recall playing over dial-up modems. The picture looks suitably supernatural, especially in IMAX 3D, despite some dodgy CGI. Sitting through Warcraft is like watching a heavily abridged Lord of the Rings with all the good characters taken out. There are also nods to Avatar, as well as the original Planet of the Apes and its recent rebooting. A magic Dark Portal opens between the orc hellhole of Draenor, dominated by warmongering warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), and the human paradise of Azeroth, ruled by goodish King Llane (Dominic Cooper), his comely queen Lady Taria (Ruth Negga), and their military mainstay Commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Not as dumb as they look, the orcs opt to violently relocate to Azeroth. Opening action suggests the orcs versus humans feud is timeless, yet when a band of the horned beasties attacks a group of Game of Thrones extras, none of the humans seem to have heard of them. The mobbing is further muddied by a parade of players and a stew of subplots: multiple wizards who may be harbouring sinister secrets under their hoods; beautiful half-orc, half-human warrior Garona (Paula Patton) whose bravery is beyond question but whose allegiance certainly isn’t; and a faction of cruel-but-fair orcs, led by new dad Durotan (Tony Kebbell), who don’t so much want to vanquish humans as to raise their own families in peace and better dentistry. It takes nerve to make a paper-thin plot this convoluted, and also some skill — there are a few good action sequences. Ultimately the movie seems more focused on setting up sequels than exploring the abundant source material. The conclusion leaves more questions than answers, brazenly riffing on a famous Bible story, but rest assured that if Warcraft does well at the box-office, the answers will come almost as quickly as you can cry, “Kill all humans!” Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Probably the best way to experience “Warcraft,” a generally amusing and sometimes visually arresting absurdity, is stoned. If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn’t your idea of a good movie time, though, I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow. You may not grasp who the Bluto-like creatures with simian arms and woolly mammoth tusks are or why they seem permanently engorged with rage. But there’s more to movies than narrative coherency, as anyone who has sampled the cinema of Michael Bay or certain art films well knows. There is in this movie, for starters, the visual appeal of those Blutoesque beings, lovingly fabricated and ornamented motion-capture creations who share their name with the creatures that J. R. R. Tolkien called orcs. Tolkien borrowed orc from the Old English, citing “Beowulf,” one of the many tales of blood lust and vengeance, heroes and monsters that are woven into the “Warcraft” DNA. The ruler here is King Llane (Dominic Cooper), a rather progressive monarch who fights the invading orcs with a multihued army, a rakish aide-de-camp (Travis Fimmel), a token chick (Paula Patton) and a magical twosome (Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer). If there’s a mythology here, I missed it, much as I also missed the charm and periodic lightness of Tolkien’s world, with its hobbits and Shire. “Warcraft” by contrast weighs in as a Hobbesian war of all against all, though it does allow for a little romance and campy winks. It also, more surprisingly, offers some gray-shading, notably with Durotan (Toby Kebbell), an orc chieftain with hands as big as Volkswagen Beetles and a pregnant mate, Draka (Anna Galvin). He has qualms as well as enemies, which surface amid battles and exposition. Stuff happens in one part of this world, and other stuff happens elsewhere: Jaws clench, bodies fall, and scenes oscillate — ’twas ever thus, genrewise. Even so, despite the incessant clashing and clanging, you can hear the tremulous pulse of a heartbeat. That faint thrumming belongs to Duncan Jones, the director who, against the odds, has mined a watchable movie out of an entertainment franchise that started with a video game and now includes novels, comics and assorted schlock (toys, costumes, a mah-jongg set). That Mr. Jones even factors into this production counts as some kind of actual achievement given that “Warcraft” is such an obvious bid at brand expansion, which may be why no one bothered with an intelligible story. Apparently, branded content (i.e., the characters, their world) was meant to be enough. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Jun 9, 2016"," The English director Duncan Jones started out his career promisingly, with “Moon” and “Source Code.” To measure the disappointment of his next choice, “Warcraft,” imagine that David Bowie, instead of going off to Berlin to make “Heroes,” had instead become the lead singer of Whitesnake. Jones (who happens to be Bowie’s son) is trying to deliver something like “The Lord of the Rings” minus the boring bits, but without the boring bits what you have is Itchy and Scratchy with maces. “Warcraft” offers wizards, giants, duels, magic tricks, skull crushing, chest pounding and a doomy soundtrack that goes dump-dump-dump. None of it means much of anything, despite quarter-hearted efforts to add depth. At one point, as an amiable encounter between a human and a foxy she-orc is winding up with all the sizzle of someone returning a pair of pants, I said to myself: Wait, was that the big love scene? It’s a time of unease between the massive orcs such as the powerful but open-minded Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and the humans led by the king (Dominic Cooper) and his most trusted knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Hard-liners among the orcs want war, but Durotan isn’t so sure. Despite his hideous face, massive tusks and hands the size of pool tables, he’s a loving husband and daddy. Somehow pouring treacle on iron does not quite convince, though: The guy’s “tender” scenes remind me of the commercials they used to do for the Softer Side of Sears. Thanks to a go-between lady orc (Paula Patton) who has dainty she-fangs instead of tusks and hangs out with the humans, there could be peace between the two races, but only if the most hostile orcs and their snarly trouble-making wizard can be made to see reason. That’s my best guess for what’s going on, anyway, not that it matters to Jones (who I suspect, and hope, was not fully in charge of this incredibly expensive-looking studio monstrosity). What the movie is really about is nonstop special effects deployment: There’s foggy green magic dust being thrown around by one side, glowy blue spheres of magic on the other. Warriors zip and zap through portals, out of one dimension into another and trick each other into switching sides. The wizard on the human side is played by Ben Foster, who has along with him a young ex-apprentice (Ben Schnetzer) you can think of as the wiz kid and who seems to be tossed into the pot in order to lure in a few tween girls. His presence is a sure sign that we’re not going to lurch into the kind of “Conan the Barbarian” depravity that could have made the movie cheesy fun instead of the joyless grind that it is. No, “Warcraft” isn’t a ridiculous mess; it holds together on its own musclebound terms. It neither tries to be jokey nor undercuts itself by being unintentionally funny. And it offers a bit more complexity than some other nonstop action flicks adapted from video games. It’s a real movie, just not a good one.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2016"," I’m not a gamer. My entire experience with “World of Warcraft” consists of knowing that it exists. But you shouldn’t have to be familiar with the source material to enjoy a movie. It has elves, dwarves and hundreds of marauding orcs, massive battles in fantastic realms and clashes between light magic and dark sorcery. There’s even a creature known as a golem, which its creator pronounces “gollum.” Based on the massively popular series of role-playing video games, “Warcraft” follows a group of warrior orcs, searching for a home to replace their dying planet, who travel through a green, goo-filled portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth. I’m not a gamer. My entire experience with “World of Warcraft” consists of knowing that it exists. But you shouldn’t have to be familiar with the source material to enjoy a movie. I’ve never been trapped barefoot in a high-rise while a multinational band of criminals shoots up a Christmas party, but I love me some “Die Hard.” For crucial stretches in the beginning, he and the other orcs, especially the tyrannical Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), are nearly unintelligible thanks to the pumped-up bass of their growls and the movie’s mostly gibberish names. Each orc sounds like varying degrees of Idris Elba, if he were having his voice obscured as part of a “60 Minutes” investigation. Speaking of “Warcraft’s” names, the sheer amount of gobbledygook can be overwhelming. There was a word being bandied about throughout — according to the press notes, it’s Kirin Tor — but I couldn’t tell whether it was referring to a person, a place or a cholesterol drug. Travis Fimmel (TV’s “Vikings”) portrays the heroic human Anduin Lothar. But every time he’s referred to simply as Lothar, which is often, my brain kept filling in “of the Hill People” and wishing it was watching the old Mike Myers “Saturday Night Live” sketches instead. Azeroth’s first couple, King Llane Wrynn and Lady Taria, is portrayed by Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga. The real-life couple co-stars in AMC’s hot new genre show, “Preacher.” It’s far more entertaining than “Warcraft,” and they’re more engaging in it. And, in case you were still somehow engrossed near the movie’s end, Glenn Close turns up in a small, uncredited part to jar you completely out of it. The most distracting player in all of this, though, is the magical Medivh (Ben Foster), aka the Guardian of Azeroth, who’s problematic on many levels. For starters, Foster looks as though he came to the set straight from a touring production of “Jesus Christ Superstar,” stopping just long enough to snag one of Charlize Theron’s feathered “Snow White and the Huntsman” capes on eBay. After his job as Azeroth’s Guardian has been well established — not to mention the fact that his title is pretty self-explanatory — Medivh reminds the king that he exists to protect the realm. “It is my purpose. I am the Guardian.” Left on the cutting room floor: “I come from Stilted in the land of Exposition.” Later, Medivh scolds young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), “I am the Guardian. Me, not you.” With names like Draenor and Draka and Orgrim and Karazhan being hurled every which way, what moviegoer is struggling with the meaning of Guardian? Director Duncan Jones (“Moon”), who wrote the script with Charles Leavitt (“In the Heart of the Sea”), has a flair for “Warcraft’s” visuals. And he mercifully takes a couple of moments here and there to humanize — or whatever — a few of the orcs. Kebbell’s work as Durotan stands out. But, for the most part, the characters barely rise to the level of two-dimensional. As the half-orc Garona, Paula Patton seems to be the only other cast member who realizes she’s in a movie that fans will pay money to see, and she acts accordingly. Enslaved and tormented by the monstrous Gul’dan — her name is orc for “cursed” — Garona provides a depth and gravitas that are sorely lacking throughout “Warcraft.” “Broken bones heal stronger,” she says by way of a backstory. “Mine are very strong.” Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be in place for the start of the rollout on Tuesday, a day that British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II.

The fictional giants of the ""Warcraft"" video game franchise all have mean faces, protruding tusks and muscles so massive, they make The Rock look puny. So it may take a while for non-gamers to figure out who's who in the battle of orcs and humans at the center of the ""Warcraft "" film, which complicates an already dense mythology. Once it becomes clear that there's a civil war within the orc race about whether to eliminate or align with the humans, the big-screen adaptation from director and co-writer Duncan Jones is a little easier to understand. For anyone unfamiliar with the fantasy game's characters and story lines, ""Warcraft"" is little more than eye candy, a visual spectacle with a backbone of well-trod genre tropes. There's just no way to become as invested during a two-hour movie as a gamer who's spent years, maybe even decades, immersed in the rituals and traditions of the worlds of ""Warcraft."" Plus, the humanoid orcs rely on so much digital animation to come alive that at times the whole movie looks like a video game, which obviously suits the material here but can still take a little getting used to visually. (This critic's screening was in IMAX 3-D.) And it is certainly a spectacle, with elaborate castles, armies of angry orcs and a villain who dramatically sucks the life from his victims, leaving them shriveled and deformed. Voiceover at the start of the film explains that humans and orcs have been at war for ages. The orc planet is dying, so they're out to colonize new territory, which they access when their ruler, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), uses his powers to open a magic portal. The escaping orc clans storm in and kill everything. One clan leader, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), is a rebel. He questions Gul'dan's destructive approach and suspects he may be relying on evil forces, which, of course, he is. Orcs are invading the world of Azeroth when the leader of the humans, King Llane (Dominic Cooper), gets word of their imminent arrival. He turns to his top warrior, commander of Azeroth's military forces Lothar (a smoldering Travis Fimmel), and top wizard, Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster), controller of Azeroth's magical powers. They capture an orc-human hybrid, Garona (Paula Patton wearing disturbing prosthetic teeth), who serves as a bridge between the two species — and instantly catches Lothar's romantic eye. Containing this powerful energy is ultimately the theme of film, as it is of so many fantasy, superhero and sci-fi stories. It's like the Force or the Ring or the Infinity Gauntlet or the Allspark. Only the force in ""Warcraft,"" called ""the fell,"" is purely wicked, so evil it can consume the good — perhaps an allusion to Biblical notions of ""the fall."" The ""Warcraft"" mythology is extensive and rich, as it would have to be to sustain five video games and a series of novels. That's a lot of lore to pack into one movie, though this film is clearly set up for a sequel should the audience demand it. Without the franchise backstory, ""Warcraft"" is a big-budget fantasy-action film with lots of large-scale, epic fight scenes between Mr. Olympia-sized aliens and regular humans. When an orc throws a horse at one point, it's almost more painful than when a character dies, since the moviegoer's connection with the characters is so superficial. As escapist summer fare, ""Warcraft"" works because the action is ample and the orcs look cool, with pierced tusks and spiked armor evoking a ""Mad Max"" aesthetic, even if it isn't always easy to tell them apart. ""Warcraft,"" a Legendary Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""extended sequences of intense fantasy violence."" Running time: 123 minutes.

"Jun 9, 2016"," I truly believe that somebody - maybe sometime soon - will crack the Video Game Movie code. A film will one day come along that does for video game movies what the likes of Iron Man and (more recently) Captain America: Civil War have done for comic book movies. Which is a shame. The director has a short-but-stellar track record with the sci-fi films Moon and Source Code, and his love for the source material of his latest movie is evident in every interview he's done. But Warcraft, while a visual feast, is little more than a dumb action blockbuster that has a bit of style but little substance. While the online hit World of Warcraft is the video game that most people, including mainstream audiences, know and love the franchise for, the Warcraft movie actually goes back to the events of the 1994 strategy game classic (more specifically, the events are based on a Warcraft novel, The Last Guardian). It tells the story of the first battles between the humans of Azeroth and the war-minded orc race, who have fled their dying world and hope to make a new home in humanity's domain. The orcs aren't all of the same mind, though, and the dark magic being used by their leader, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), threatens to destroy their race from the inside. Surprisingly, the first instance of disbelief in the events on-screen don't come until the first humans are on screen. The story opens with the orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and his mate, who is pregnant with his child. There's nothing new or earth-shattering about their interactions, but impressive CG visuals make their relationship at least somewhat relatable (and oddly human). When we switch over to the human side of the conflict, though, we're met with clichéd lines, overdone fan service (small nods to the video games that only gamers will catch), actions that make little sense and often stilted acting. Sometimes it feels as if, thanks to the overwhelming amount of CG present in Warcraft, many of the human actors had a hard time believing anything about the world they were supposed to inhabit. Good fantasy films exist (we live in a post-Lord of the Rings world, after all), but some of the line deliveries in Warcraft could have been lifted directly from a C-tier made-for-TV movie. The plot is mostly simple (disappointingly so) and easy to follow, but there is also a problem of seemingly important concepts or characters being referenced with little to no explanation. Take the young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), for example. He says he's part of the Kirin Tor, but that he's run away for, I don't know, reasons. Wait, what even is the Kirin Tor? What do they do? Why do they operate the way they do? And then you've got the Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster), who's like, really good at magic, apparently? But nobody really goes into detail about why he's treated like Gandalf on steroids. If you haven't played World of Warcraft, there are a lot of holes that go unfilled. You also get glimpses of dwarves and Blood Elves (though they're not referred to by name) here and there, but their appearances are few and far between. Which is odd, considering that the orc invasion of Azeroth presumably threatens them just as much as it threatens the humans, yet the humans have to do all the work to defend their homeland. But maybe all you really need to know is that there are orcs, there are humans, and they're fighting. Because at the end of the day, that conflict actually leads to some stuff that's pretty enjoyable to watch on screen. The very first magic spell effects feel a bit corny (and, well, ""video game-y""), but as they escalate in scale, they help Warcraft become a joy to watch as a pure, dumb popcorn flick. When you've got big green orcs tossing horses at human soldiers, humans wielding large swords and shields covered in lion iconography, gryphons flying overhead and spells flying through the air, it's easy to get caught up in how cool it all looks. You probably won't leave the theater thinking that a character's death was particularly sad or that another character's motivations were particularly compelling (because none of them are), but you might remember how awesome that weird lightning barrier looked. That alone could be enough to attract summer moviegoers, especially if they're among the millions of people who already have some attachment to the Warcraft franchise. There's something to going to the IMAX just to experience loud, dumb action, and that's amplified if you're able to say, ""Dude, look, that's totally what the Dark Portal looks like in the game!"" Granted, there's also a problem that World of Warcraft fans specifically might have with the Warcraft movie: It's set long before the character and events that they're most familiar with. The famous orc warchief Thrall is only a baby. There's no tragic tale of Prince Arthas (who's a child at this point in time). There are no night elves, no Burning Crusade and so on.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Twenty minutes into “Warcraft,” viewers will already have been whisked to such fanciful places as Draenor, Azeroth, Stormwind — and a castle in the sky. The good news is there’s no quiz at the end. The bad news? This convoluted mess of an introduction requires more mental effort than any movie this idiotic deserves. Fans of the video game on which “Warcraft” is based presumably already know the complicated history of this mythological world, but for frustrated first-timers, “Warcraft” has some serious ’splaining to do. This might save you a little trouble: Orcs — muscular monsters with huge hands and underbites that would make an orthodontist see dollar signs — have accidentally trashed their own planet. Forced to relocate, they use dark magic — fueled by the souls of other species — to open a portal to the peaceful land of Azeroth. Its king, Llane (Dominic Cooper), is understandably concerned about the giant marauding beasts that have invaded his land, so he enlists the help of his brother-in-law, the warrior Lothar (Travis Fimmel, unintelligibly growling his dialogue), and the kingdom’s magical guardian Medivh (Ben Foster, channeling a less-subtle Gandalf) to send the Orcs packing. They have some other allies, too, including an Orc chieftain named Durotan (a motion-captured Toby Kebbell) who’s disillusioned with his tribe’s evil magic: Side effects include thousands of dead humans, ravaged lands and ’roid rage. There’s also magician-in-training Khadgar — played by Ben Schnetzer, in what amounts to the only standout performance — and Garona (Paula Patton), a green-skinned Orc half-breed and escaped slave. In her first appearance, she’s little more than a Princess Leia knockoff, all skimpy clothes and metal leash. That’s a lot of plot for what is, at heart, an excuse to go crazy with the green screen. While some of the computer animation is impressive, it’s rarely better than what we’ve seen in the “Lord of the Rings” films or even the recent “Planet of the Apes” reboots. Directed by Duncan Jones, “Warcraft”  was in development for years, and its release date has been pushed back numerous time. That’s never a good sign. But delays haven’t helped with generic dialogue, bizarre pacing and thin characters. Not even an awkwardly shoehorned love story lightens the mood set by the film’s bruising battles, with combatants getting flung, twirled and stampeded by bigger, stronger adversaries. It’s all so plodding and grim, echoed by the blandly percussive score by Ramin Djawadi. After a bone-crushing and byzantine buildup, the movie finally peters out. In what passes for resolution, the name of the movie is splashed across the screen, suggesting that a sequel is the only way to tie up this tangle of loose threads.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," Fans of the Warcraft video game series will be geeking out on Friday, June 10, when the fantasy franchise leaps from their PC monitors to the big screen as a live-action/motion-capture spectacular. But if any of the uninitiated somehow stumble into the theater, they’ll see something that looks awfully familiar. I say this not as a hater but as a player. I have lost countless hours battling baddies with my fellow nerds in World of Warcraft, the online role-playing game that launched in 2004. But as much as I have enjoyed zipping around the magical lands of Azeroth on my flying carpet (always stopping to pick flowers along the way), one thing I have never paid attention to is the story. Yeah, yeah, another evil mastermind has opened a portal to another world to unleash havoc on the peace-loving Whatevers of Wherever. Shut up and tell me how many harpy feathers I need to collect already. So even though I have clicked through numerous “conservations” with some of the characters that are (re)introduced in “Warcraft,” it was all pretty new to me. Except that it’s all so old hat. The movie, directed by Duncan Jones — who made the excellent sci-fi indie “Moon” — is an origin story for the franchise that began in 1994 with the strategy game “Warcraft: Orcs & Humans.” Orcs, of course, are an ugly, brutish race of warriors invented by J.R.R. Tolkien nearly 80 years ago in “The Hobbit.” The Warcraft version is even bigger and badder — basically miniature Hulks with green skin, tusks, dirty loin cloths and battle hammers the size of a Mini Cooper. Their chief-of-chiefs is a leering warlock named Gul’dan (Daniel Wu, wrapped in CGI), master of a form of death magic called the Fel. Having rendered the orcs’ home world uninhabitable, he leads a war band to Azeroth, via one of those aforementioned magic portals, where he plans to suck the life force out of his human captives in order to bring the entire Horde through. Charging to the rescue (or flying on hippogriffs, as the case may be) are the shiny-armored soldiers of Stormwind led by Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), with the help of the rebellious young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and a pretty half-orc (if you don’t mind the tusks) named Garona (Paula Patton). Some of these names will be familiar to gamers, but none is much of a character, just a standard type (stern hero, mad genius, etc.). The wooden acting doesn’t help, nor does the hyperbolic dialogue (“In my entire life, I have never felt as much pain as I do now”). Fans will no doubt enjoy the many Easter-egg references to the games, including a cameo by an amphibious “murloc” and Khadgar’s strategic use of a polymorph spell (colloquially referred to as “sheeping”). But one of the best things about World of Warcraft is almost entirely missing here, and that is a sense of humor. The game, in its current, heavily embroidered version, isn’t merely generic, it’s generic on purpose. In addition to Tolkienian high fantasy, it embraces a tongue-in-cheek hodgepodge of geeky tropes from steampunk guns and robots to mystical aliens from outer space. And it’s packed with sly references to pop culture that make it abundantly clear that the writers and designers don’t take themselves too seriously. If only the same were true of “Warcraft.” But instead, it aims to match the mythic gravitas of “The Lord of the Rings” — even throwing in a nod to the Book of Exodus for good measure — and the results fall paint-by-numbers flat.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2016"," Director Duncan Jones, who impressively helmed “Moon” and “Source Code,” reportedly has long been a fan of the “Warcraft” video game series and has long worked hard to bring it to the big screen. Unfortunately, he either worked too hard (he’s also the co-writer), didn’t work hard enough or simply wasn’t paying attention. This loud, bombastic, often incoherent mishmash of magical-themed storytelling simply was not worth whatever effort went into it. While there are some acceptable action sequences, it’s the screenplay — complicated by some less than inspired performances — that dooms “Warcraft” at every point along the way. I think I’d only suggest this film — and then only hesitantly — to the legion of fans of this fantasy, role-playing video game franchise. The essence of the tale is focused on what will happen to the fictitious world of Azeroth as it faces total destruction from the Orcs, a race of creatures who broke through a portal from their own dying world. That dark portal, by the way, is created by the “fuel” that is human prisoners, destroyed to make it all happen. Anduin Lothar (played quite lamely by Travis Fimmel) is our hero here — the liege lord and brother-in-law to his king, Llane (Dominic Cooper, in one of his more forgettable performances). Also key to the story is an uber-wizard (portrayed by Ben Foster) and his ability to ward off the evil spirit known as “The Fel.” Among the Orcs there is a code of honor, and that leads to a bit of a revolt when one of the good Orc chieftains (Durotan, played by Toby Kebbell) comes to realize “The Fel” (controlled by the Orc leader Gul’dan) will eventually lead to the destruction of all living things — both human and Orc. Among the other notable characters is a half-human, half-Orc played by Paula Patton, who like her co-stars seemingly phones in her acting job while playing a tough cookie with eyes for Lothar. As noted above, the best parts of this film are the CGI action sequences, but there’s no new ground broken here. We’ve seen this all many, many, many times before. Yet, without a strong (or even an adequate) script, all the good action scenes in the world are not worth the price of admission. At the end of the film, it is made very clear this “Warcraft” was expected to spawn a new fantasy franchise. If that happens, I would be very surprised, given what I’ve seen in this first offering. But then, I’ve been wrong about things like that before. Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Duncan Jones and written by Jones and Charles Leavitt, based on the Blizzard Entertainment game. Running time: 100 minutes.

"Jun 9, 2016"," First, a confession: I have never played any incarnation of “Warcraft.” I’m just going to put that out there right now—be up front about it. We’re all friends here. We should be honest with each other. So I went in with an open mind to “Warcraft,” the movie based on the video game, and I’m reviewing it purely on its own merits as a stand-alone entity. Many of you out there may read this and cry foul: “She’s never played the game! She has no idea what she’s talking about!” And I’m OK with that. Really, I am. But I’m also hoping that the game is more emotionally engaging—or at least, you know, fun—than the movie I just saw. Because that thing was a dour mess. And it brings me no joy to report that to you because “Warcraft” comes from a filmmaker whose work I’ve been a big fan of: Duncan Jones. With just two features to his credit, Jones has shown a real knack for taking complex, sci-fi stories and telling them in clever, intimate ways. His debut, “Moon,” was my favorite movie of 2009; it was about mind-blowing, existential stuff but it had real verve, immediacy and heart. (Plus: If one Sam Rockwell is good, two Sam Rockwells are great.) Jones’ 2011 follow-up, the time-travel puzzle “Source Code,” felt like a bit of a let-down by comparison but it was thrilling and challenging, and it showed his evolution as a filmmaker with a bigger cast and more expensive toys. So it’s hard to figure out what happened with Jones and “Warcraft.” It’s as if the endeavor swallowed him whole. This was clearly a formidable undertaking filled with sweeping imagery, motion-capture performances and tons of visual effects, all being projected in overwhelming IMAX 3-D. In the midst of all that, it’s difficult to hear his voice—to see his attention to detail. An enormous budget and state-of-the-art technology have resulted in a movie that looks cheesy and cartoonish—a big-screen version of a video game world that more closely resembles the video game commercials you see on TV. But “Warcraft” is difficult to follow from both a visual and a narrative perspective, with massive battle scenes between orcs and humans in which it’s difficult to tell who’s doing what to whom. Similar to luggage at the airport, many orcs look alike. Hulking, tusked, muscular and festooned with fierce accoutrements, they’re like refugees from a GWAR concert. But eventually you don’t know whether you’re looking at a good orc or a bad orc, and the CGI spectacle of it all renders everything with a glossy, detached sameness. Forgive me for wanting a little realism in my orcs. Because yes, that’s what “Warcraft” is about: orcs and humans, and their noisy efforts to enter each other’s realms and destroy each other. But the mythology is much more dense than that; the script from Jones and Charles Leavitt contains reams of expository dialogue, yet the story itself feels mind-bogglingly convoluted. And yet, in between the self-serious, stilted conversations, we get snippets of quippy, anachronistic banter that are meant to provide humor but instead end up being jarring. The film begins with orc warrior chief Durotan (Toby Kebbell), his pregnant wife, Draka (Anna Galvin), and their clan leaving their dying world by passing through a portal that looks like a wall of swirly, minty mouthwash. On the other side is the more peaceful and pastoral Azeroth—although every sparkly, new fantasy realm we enter here calls to mind a place we’ve visited previously at some point in the “Lord of the Rings” saga. There’s a lot of borrowing going on in “Warcraft.” Once they arrive, they attack the humans for control of the land: knights led by Durotan’s counterpart, the noble but personality-free Lothar (Travis Fimmel, the Brooklyn pickle entrepreneur of Rebecca Miller’s “Maggie’s Plan”). But while Lothar dutifully serves his king (Dominic Cooper) and queen (Ruth Negga), Durotan begins to question the motives of the clearly insane and power-hungry orc warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). The fact that Gul’dan has pulsating green eyes and likes to drain people of their life force to fuel his own magical abilities may have something to do with it. The humans have a powerful wizard of their own: Medivh, or “The Guardian,” as he’s known. He’s played by Ben Foster in a bit of casting alone that suggests perhaps he’s not to be trusted. And sure enough, Foster tries to bring glimmers of his trademark menace to the character, but it’s hard to act amid all the noise. Basically, he’s called upon to transport himself and others from place to place by stringing together strands of glowing, blue light and chanting a few spells. In the midst of this struggle is Garona (Paula Patton), who’s half human, half orc. The fact that she’s being held prisoner and is dressed in chains and tatters for maximum sex appeal provides an uncomfortable racial element to the action, but “Warcraft” seems more interested in exploiting her character for titillation rather than exploring her significance from a societal perspective. (Between this and the latest Adam Sandler Netflix debacle, “The Do-Over,” the charismatic Patton is having a rough couple of weeks. She deserves better.) Eventually, alliances must be forged to save humanity and orc-kind alike. But first, young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), an ally of Lothar’s, must learn the secrets hidden inside a purple room that’s meant to be futuristic but looks like a rejected set from “Logan’s Run.” There’s also a giant, evil statue made of clay that comes to life, but it’s more unintentionally hilarious than frightening. And before there can be any peace, there is pummeling—lots and lots of pummeling—as the orcs fight the humans as well as each other under hot, dusty skies. It is brutal. It is repetitive. It is numbing. And just as it’s ending, “Warcraft” leaves all kinds of plot threads dangling for the ambitious possibility of a sequel. But you’ll be likely to cry “Game Over” because this first one is easily a contender for the worst movie of the year.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Every big studio film represents some kind of compromise between commerce and art. Some particularly craven cash-grabs leave art almost entirely out of the picture, but those aren’t the most frustrating films, just as the pure-art prestige pictures are rarely the most fascinating ones. The films that tend to provoke the strongest reactions are the ones that try to force art and commercial sensibilities to meet square in the middle.

Duncan Jones’ Warcraft is a perfect example. As a long-troubled adaptation of an immensely popular video game series, 10 years in development (and in Sam Raimi’s hands before Jones took over in 2013), Warcraft comes to the table with a complicated series of mandates. It’s trying to find a suitable relaunching point for a story that Blizzard’s video games have been telling in different forms for more than 20 years. It’s trying to set up a potentially enormous film franchise for Universal. And it’s trying to please hardcore fans of the game series without completely confusing or alienating non-players who’ve never spammed knights to take out an orc encampment, and don't even know what that means. That alone is a tall order, but Jones' ambitions reach much higher. He's trying to tell a story about people driven equally by duty and personal need. He's trying for something denser and more realistic than the usual fantasy binaries of pure, simple good and evil. He's also finding resonance with his favorite themes, as seen in his previous films, Moon and Source Code: all three of his movies are about people caught up in work they think is critical, until they realize how they're being victimized and lied to by people taking advantage of that work. And at every step along the way, Warcraft is clearly trying to be richer and more sophisticated than the average fantasy blockbuster. Fans of the genre, or the games, are more likely to see the points where Jones succeeds in transcending the usual blockbuster fantasy tropes. Non-fans are just likely to see the failures, and experience the film as an overcrowded mess. Warcraft focuses on Azeroth, a world inhabited by humans, elves, and dwarves, and facing invasion by savage orc warriors. The story draws on settings and ideas from Blizzard's ever-expanding 2004 MMORPG World Of Warcraft, but it's more deeply and specifically rooted in 1994's simpler series-launcher Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, a real-time strategy game where each side had its own story campaign. True to the game, the orcs and humans in Warcraft each have separate stories, and draw separate sympathies. The orcs are beholden to the monstrous orc warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), whose magic consumes entire worlds, pushing the orcish Horde to seek new places to settle and new life to consume. But orc clan leader Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is beginning to understand that Gul'dan's merciless leadership isn't strengthening his people so much as using them to selfish, destructive ends. Gul'dan isn't the only refurbished archetype. The other major players all have odd touches of ferocity or humor, nobility or venality or fear. They have the outlines of familiar fantasy tropes, but the heroism and the failings are distributed equally on both sides. Warcraft's look and tone often falls somewhere between Avatar and John Carter, two other similarly CGI-heavy, narratively overstuffed would-be fantasy-franchise launchers. But both of those films suffered under the painfully broad, obvious character beats that made their stories predictable. Warcraft is reaching for something more nuanced. It's also meant to be more surprising, particularly about who survives and who doesn't. This is a dark story without a tidy happily-ever-after conclusion, and just as it equivocates about painting either side as the villains, it equivocates about who ultimately wins their face-off. But while this isn't a neatly ordered good-conquers-all fantasy, it also isn't an economical fairy tale. It spins its wheels over side stories without finding their relevance. It introduces characters (particularly the dwarves) without justifying their place in the story. And given the two-hour runtime, it can't entirely get where it's trying to go, not with a cast this large and a plot this dense. Warcraft rushes from one locale to another, sometimes so quickly, and with so little purpose, that it just seems to be name-checking game locations. Its charge through a variety of inessential plot details sometimes makes it seem like a deliberately silly parody of epic fantasy stories. Dedicated franchise fans may have an inkling why Khadgar is suddenly talking to a mysterious woman (Glenn Close, uncredited) inside a mysterious magical object at a mysterious sky temple after his mysterious tattoo leads him to a mysterious book. But for everyone else, it's a jumble of elaborate names, garish CGI effects, and opaque, silly-sounding prophecy. The headlong push from one faction to the next leaves many distracting questions, without any sense that the answers would be interesting. There's no compelling plot need, for instance, to delve into why Khadgar abandoned his mage training. But given how often the event comes up, the failure to address it makes it seem like there's a scene missing somewhere. It often feels like Warcraft should have taken more time from its repetitive epic battles to fill in the gaps between its jarring plot lurches. It's an invasion story, and the big fight set pieces are inevitable. But the earliest ones are directed with a thrillingly active camera, some playful first-person shots, and an aggressive attempt to get into the middle of the action. As the film stretches out and the camera pulls back further and further for scope, the details and the sense of immediacy and personal stakes get lost, and one bone-crunching combat blurs into another. The orcs, performed via motion-capture, are similarly distinctive in the early going, but hard to tell apart when battle erases their individuality. Warcraft feels like it's constantly fighting a war for distinctiveness, one it often can't win while still serving the franchise machine. But it does find distinction in the smallest touches, like the smart way it handles the orc / human language difference by sticking with individual characters' points of view, or the way it sometimes takes time for odd and immersive spectacle, like the orcs' experience in falling through the doorway between worlds. And in some cases, it doesn't need distinctiveness at all. Warcraft willingly throws itself into some familiar fantasy tropes, the kind that nakedly appeal to viewers' emotions. For all its attempts to complicate the epic fantasy warfare genre, it often comes down to a simple open-heartedness about the nobility of sacrifice, or the thrill of fighting for a righteous cause. Warcraft won't fully satisfy the game series' most demanding fans, simply because of all the things it omits or glosses over in this opening installment. (Dragons? No. Undead? No. Elves and dwarves? Barely.) Believe it or not, this is an immensely pared-down version of even the most basic Warcraft story, and it leaves many key game factions for possible later installments. At the same time, it won't fully satisfy many newbies: even at its most accessible, it's a blur of names, faces, and places, sometimes stuck together only with solemnity and self-importance. But the film has already largely been painted as an unmitigated disaster, and it's hardly that. It's a knock-down, drag-out fight between storytelling, franchise-making, and fan service, and some casualties were inevitable. But even a messy fight for nuance is better than an apathetic sell-out. Warcraft won't go down in history as a ringing success, but people who see it aren't likely to forget it easily, either. It's much more of a commercial endeavor than Jones' other films, but it doesn't abandon art by the wayside.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," Given the choice between forced re-watchings â Ã  la A Clockwork Orange â of the John Travolta/L. Ron Hubbard lovefest-cum-shitstorm Battlefield Earth and a return to the world of Warcraft, Iâd take the gentlemanly way out and eat my Glock. Duncan Jones, who helmed one of the most unique sci-fi outings in film history with 2009âs Moon, has now delivered unto unsuspecting audiences a stillborn yet squallingly monstrous muddle of swords and sorcery and utter silliness, all of it allegedly drawn from the novels and ""real-time strategy"" games that preceded the planetâs most popular and long-running âmassively multiplayer online role-playing game,â World of Warcraft. (In a nutshell, itâs Dungeons & Dragons gone global.) Warcraft the movie, awash in often awful CGI and taking itself far too seriously is, by filmâs end, an inadvertently hilarious parody of the very fantastical tropes that made the online game/lifestyle so endearingly addictive. This isnât Lord of the Rings, or even, heaven forfend, J.R.R. Tolkienâs as yet unadapted Middle-earth offshoot The Silmarillion, and trying to even think about Game of Thrones and Warcraft simultaneously could likely lead to instant and potentially permanent neurological meltdown. That said, Patton, as the half-human, half-Orc warrior queen-to-be, does an impressive imitation of the Orion slave girl in the original, pre-Kirk Star Trek pilot âThe Cage,â while Foster, light years afield from his bang-on portrayal of psychotropically droll wordsmith William Burroughs in Kill Your Darlings, bites down hard on his role as Medivh, the sorcerer guardian of the peaceful kingdom of Azeroth. He appears to be the only cast member not in on the joke (if there, indeed, is one) and acts as something of a dramatic counterweight to the wackiness around him. (This despite the fact that heâs frequently called upon to shoot blue lightning from his fingertips.) I havenât mentioned the plot of Warcraft yet because by and large it seems entirely incidental to what is, in effect, a lengthy setup to a presumed tentpole franchise. Clannish and muscle-bound Orcs, their home world dying, are led by a wily rogue named Gulâdan (Wu). Infected with the dread black magic âthe Fel,â Gulâdan has decided to relocate the Horde by force to the aforementioned realm of Azeroth. The latter is populated by an alliance of humans, elves, and dwarves with guns and ruled over by good King Llane of Stormwind (Cooper, looking every bit an 8-year-oldâs dream king). Somehow or other, itâs up to bold Sir Anduin Lothar (Fimmel) to rally the Azerothâs scattered troops and bring a halt to the Orc invasion. On the whole, you could posit Warcraft as a metaphor for our contemporary immigration consternation â but only as a drinking game, I think. Kudos for having several strong, independent female leads (of various hues to boot), but the bloated and blinkered Warcraft is officially, in my tally, the single worst film of the year across the genre board. Possibly itâs a genuinely mystical experience given enough hallucinogens and/or bong hits, but longtime World of Warcraft players should and likely will storm the cineplex gates, burn the castle down, and salt the earth (and screenwriters) from whence this abomination sprung. Me, Iâm going to chill out and download 1982âs top-notch The Sword and the Sorcerer.

"Jun 9, 2016"," Hollywood has a pretty awful track record with video game adaptations, so when it was announced that director Duncan Jones would be bringing the mega-popular “Warcraft” franchise to the big screen, many people were hopeful that he would finally break the curse. Sadly, it doesn’t even come close. Although there’s no question that Jones (a self-proclaimed fan of “World of Warcraft,” the massively multiplayer online RPG that boasted 12 million subscribers at the peak of its popularity) is a talented filmmaker, “Warcraft” is a disappointing misfire that swallowed up several years of his career. That’s time he could have spent making more original movies like “Moon” and “Source Code” instead of this sluggish and derivative fantasy flick. The story begins in Draenor, the dying homeworld to a warrior race of orcs. Their leader, the evil sorcerer Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), uses a dangerous magic called the Fel – which feeds on the energy of life – to send a small war party of orcs through a portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth in the hopes of conquering the land and using its inhabitants as fuel to transport the rest of the fleeing Horde. But not everyone agrees with his methods, particularly Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the noble chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, who believes that Gul’dan’s obsession with the Fel is what caused Draenor to wither away. Meanwhile, the human forces of Azeroth – led by King Llane (Dominic Cooper), heroic warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) and powerful magician Medivh (Ben Foster) – scramble to defend their kingdom with the help of Garona (Paula Patton), a human/orc half-breed who must decide where her true loyalty lies: with the orc Horde that raised her or the humans that freed her from a lifetime of slavery. Much like “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Warcraft” is a disjointed mess that’s not nearly as much fun as it seems to think. The script does an admirable job of giving both sides of the conflict equal attention, but many of the scenes feel like they’ve been stitched together from the remnants of longer, more complex sequences. There are no fewer than 10 major characters, all of whom deserve more fleshed out storylines, while a number of promising subplots (including a potential alliance between Durotan and the humans) are discarded without reason. Perhaps most maddening, however, is the speed in which information is hurled at the audience. The movie jumps from location to location like a kid flipping through the pages of a comic book to get to the good stuff, casually introducing important characters and relationships as if it’s common knowledge. You shouldn’t need to be a veteran of the game to appreciate the film, and yet even though fans will have a slight advantage in this regard, it doesn’t help with the larger problems. For starters, the writing is incredibly subpar, dragged down by overwrought clichés and incessant exposition, and the acting isn’t much better. Although Kebbell and Patton deliver fine work in their respective roles, everyone else falls somewhere in the range of mediocre to downright terrible. Ben Schnetzer, in particular, is so wooden as Medivh’s former apprentice that he turns what should have been an exciting character into an annoying sidekick type. Fimmel, who made a name for himself on the History Channel original series “Vikings,” clearly has the charisma to succeed as a leading man, but he’s hampered by cheesy dialogue and a lack of character development. Those issues aren’t limited to Fimmel, either; it’s difficult to identify with any of the characters because none of them rise above the two-dimensionality of their video game counterparts. The one thing that Jones does get right is the visual effects, though even they pose a minor problem, as the orcs somehow look both photorealistic and cartoonish due to their exaggerated, true-to-game design. While certainly impressive on their own, the CG characters never really blend with the human actors, and Patton’s silly appearance (which is created with some very basic makeup effects) only compounds matters by failing to realistically bridge the gap between the two races. With that said, the motion capture technology employed on this film is remarkable, allowing for tiny subtleties in the performances (especially Kebbell’s Durotan) that make the orcs feel more human than the humans themselves. It’s a shame that Kebbell doesn’t get more to do in the role, because he’s easily the best thing about the movie. Any hope that “Warcraft” would be the first great video game adaptation is promptly squashed within the opening 30 minutes, and it only gets worse from there as the audience is forced to suffer through the convoluted plot (including an unearned romance between Lothar and Garona), a clunky finale that’s more interested in setting up future sequels than providing a satisfying conclusion, and a handful of unmemorable action sequences. There are some enjoyable bits scattered throughout, but while that may be enough to please the legion of fans who invested hours upon hours into “World of Warcraft,” average moviegoers unaffected by that sort of fan service will see “Warcraft” exactly for what it is: just another bad video game film. Every week Bob Westal whips up a new drink recipe, from the classics we all love to new recipes to try out when you're out or at home.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 9, 2016"," Science fiction and fantasy have often been lumped together, even conflated, especially in the movies. The movie Warcraft, based on the popular video game series, may be most useful as an illustration of how little sense that makes. Its director and cowriter, Duncan Jones, made two very good science fiction movies: Moon, with Sam Rockwell, and Source Code, with Jake Gyllenhaal. They both have elements of the fantastic, yet Warcraft, with its creatures, dark magic, and portals to other worlds, requires a whole other skill set that it appears Jones may not possess, at least not fully. He gets the lugubrious sincerity right, that’s for sure. Jones’s earlier films were both predicated on aspects of solitude. In Moon, Rockwell mans a lonely moon base, with only a robot (and, eventually literally, himself) to keep him company. In Source Code, Gyllenhaal is on sort of a virtual-reality-time-travel mission that repeats itself, with his actions the only source of variation. Warcraft is an ensemble picture and it groans under its own weight almost immediately. On one end of a trans-world portal are a race of warlike orcs, led by a nasty-looking wizard-y orc with an apparently quite convincing command of the Fel, which is a kind of black magic that is mostly green (as are some, but not all, of the orcs). Having burned through the orcs’ homeworld resources, he harvests souls to open up a portal to another world and send some of his best warriors through. They will invade and capture enough humans to be sacrificed so they can, uh, open the portal again, but for longer this time, so all of the orcs can come through. So yes, a lot of Warcraft‘s story is about opening a portal so that the same portal can be re-opened again later. In response, the humans arrange various meetings at various locations to discuss and re-discuss how to handle this attack. These redundancies are commonplace in the world of Warcraft, right down to the dialogue, which repeats a few key words (Clan! Chieftain! Orc! Hordes! Fel!) incessantly. It’s not that the movie’s roots in gaming show here (although: more on that in a moment) so much as gaming’s roots in boardroom meetings; this is a movie full of buzzwords, and it’s largely about how meetings beget more meetings. As in any organization, some of the orcs have misgivings about their marching orders. Durotan (performed via motion-capture by Toby Kebbell from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), who is chieftain of his clan which is a subset of the massive orc horde, sneaks his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin) through the orc plot. The humans, including Lothar (Travis Fimmel), who is apparently and disappointingly not of the Hill People, and King Llane (Dominic Cooper), are joined by the half-orc Garona (Paula Patton, in green-skinned pin-up mode). Ben Foster is also there, playing some kind of wizard in an unflattering robe. The human material is mostly a bust. Fimmel looks sort of like a sweaty Paul Rudd, but doesn’t summon Ruddian levels of charm; he barely reaches Orlando Bloom country. The orcs, though, have their moments. They have a shiny, detailed texture that doesn’t exactly look real, but has a certain visual expressiveness lacking from so many CG characters (an orc baby gets particularly vivid animation). Patton, a charming performer who often nonetheless looks dazed or flummoxed in her real-world movie roles, comes off best of the non-animated actors; the outlandishness suits her. It suits the movie, too. Warcraft works best when embracing its fantastical dorkiness, which is to say: orcs for days. As eye-filling as some of these sights are, though, they’re too often framed in Lord of the Rings-aping battle charges or videogame-aping overhead shots. Jones puts together a few striking shots emphasizing single images in the foreground and background, but the movie tends to drown out his craftiness with noisy magic. Warcraft is busy, and it’s probably a minor miracle that only about twenty to thirty minutes of its 120ish are outright boring; I’m also still not sure whether I should be impressed or galled by how many of its characters are unceremoniously killed off. I’m less ambiguous, though, about what they die for: a movie that confidently and idiotically assumes that it is a part one, of many. Warcraft doesn’t really end, and not in that Return of the King way; it simply leaves some of its characters in semi-interesting places where it can pause, setting up some changes for part two. I have no idea if Warcraft will garner a part two; China seems to want one, but then again, a bunch of American movie critics might weep softly to themselves. The thing is, this isn’t actually a terrible Battlefield Earth-level miscalculation; it’s just a super CG-heavy and not especially witty orgy of fantasy-movie silliness. Or it would be, if it wanted to commit to the idea of being a movie, rather than expecting audiences to get psyched for two or three years from now, when they can come back to this unfinished material and level up.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," What happens when  a true talent royally screws up an ambitious movie he’s staking his reputation on? It’ll look something like this massively expensive ($160 million) and mostly worthless film version of a role-playing video game that’s been losing steam for half a decade. And yet there is not a minute of Warcraft, featuring a battle between humans and invading, tusk-mouthed orcs, in which you can’t feel director Duncan Jones straining to bring soul to his computer-generated canvas. Close, but no cigar. A word about Jones. His first two films, 2009’s Moon and 2011’s Source Code, are minimalist sci-fi gems. How did he get infected by the gigantism of Warcraft? For starters, Jones is a lifelong gamer who shared his enthusiasm with his late dad, David Bowie. Jones wanted his movie to have heroes and villains on both sides of the war, to turn an escapist fantasy on its silly head and fill it with ferocity and feeling. Not happening. What’s onscreen is a godawful mess, leaving the actors to suck wind while the film collapses around them. If you’ve never played the game, you might as well watch the movie stoned. (At least you won’t feel the pain.) Jones puts his best orc forward. That would be the warrior chief Durotan, energetically acted in  motion capture  by Toby Kebbell. The humongous giant gets an aww moment early on, when his wife, Draka (Anna Galvin), delivers the cutest orc baby. But enough fluff. Durotan tells us in voiceover:  “Our world was dying, and I had to find my clan a new home.” That leads Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), the evil warlock lord of the orcs, to open a portal into Azeroth, where humans live in peace. Durotan wants to make nice. Gul’dan doesn’t. He wants blood. It’s war! Durotan has a human mirror-image in Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of TV’s Vikings), a knight who loyally serves his king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga) and worries that his grown son, Callan (Burkely Duffield), will die in battle. Lothan still finds time to get it on with Garona (Paula Patton), a half-orc, half-human warrior. Patton must play her ridiculous role with green skin and two novelty-store fangs that keep rendering her dialogue unintelligible, which might be a blessing given the mouthfuls of expository dialogue cooked up by Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt. And did I mention Medivh (Ben Foster), the wizard Guardian of Azeroth who also has a son-like protege in Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer, one of the film’s few bright spots), a kid who trusts no one. For good reason. Like Gil’dan, Medivh is siphoning the life force from those he should serve. Who siphoned the life force out of this movie? Did the studio interfere? Was Jones forced to jam a better, much longer movie into a two-hour compromise that appears to have been put together by editors using blunt instruments and wearing blindfolds? The result is an indigestible stew that blends Warcraft with elements of Avatar, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and every escapist fantasy that ever managed to find an audience. Jones is too good to perish in the ash of this big bombola. He’ll live to fight another day. Though the ending begs for a sequel, my guess is that this  film franchise won’t be so lucky. You leave Warcraft with two words ringing in your ear: Game over.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 9, 2016"," The first two films of Duncan Jones, “Moon” and “Source Code,” might have been little more than extended “Twilight Zone” episodes, but they were human stories that, however out there they were, a viewer could relate to.  With “Warcraft,” obviously intended to be the first installment of a projected franchise, he proves that he can handle a big, effects-based extravaganza efficiently enough, but otherwise the picture is pretty much a bust.  An adaptation of a long-running video game, it comes across as an unholy mash-up of “The Lord of the Rings” and “Star Wars,” and Jones’ attempt to add some humanity to the splashy but empty exercise comes across as a fool’s errand: presenting nonsense like this with such seriousness only makes it more ridiculous. If all this sounds insanely complex and more than a little absurd, rest assured it’s only the tip of the iceberg, and there are plenty of other humans and orcs to contend with as the narrative grinds on.  Jones manages to keep most of the goings-on—which include multiple confrontations, betrayals on both sides and many displays of magical prowess that involve the blasts of colored electrical energy that have been all too familiar since “Return of the Jedi,” along with, if you can believe it, a gigantic golem in the final act—as clear as any director could hope to.  But when he attempts to add moments of emotional resonance—one involving the fate of Lothar’s handsome soldier son Callan (Burkely Duffield), another that of Durotan’ and his wife Draka (Anna Galvin), who’s just given birth to his cute-as-a-button son, a third that of King Wrynn and Garona—the attempt to invest the goofy happenings with real feeling is likelier to evoke snickers rather than tears.  And when a Moses-like coda rolls around, they should turn into gales of laughter.  The cast has to be given credit for keeping reasonably straight faces in material that might have encouraged them to show that their tongues were firmly in their cheeks.  Fimmel, who has some previous experience with such period stuff from his TV work, makes a stalwart if frenzied hero, and both Cooper and Schnetzer provide contrastingly soft-grained turns.  On the orc side, all are constrained to a considerable extent by the heavy makeup (which includes something like tusks or reverse fangs that must have inhibited the ability to deliver their lines), but Kebbell and Patton certainly manage heroic poses.  Most disappointing of all is Foster, an actor who ordinarily brings some excitement to even smaller roles but here is so laid back that he’s barely recognizable; with his long hair and beard, you might think he was auditioning for the role of Jesus, and not in moneychangers-at-the-Temple mode. Glenn Close shows up for a single scene in which she attempts to hide her face with a hood, like the emperor in “Jedi.”  One can sympathize with her effort to grab a paycheck while remaining anonymous.  All of them, in any event, are playing second fiddle to the special effects, which with some exceptions are quite good.  There are a great many scenes of crowded battle, and the team supervised by Bill Westenhofer, Jeff White and Jason Smith don’t fumble too often.  (It must be said, though, that the sequence toward the close in which Medivh activates his golem is no better than that in which the monster was animated in the recent “Victor Frankenstein.”)  The more conventional visual work—Simon Duggan’s cinematography, Gavin Bocquet’s production design, the art direction supervised by Elizabeth Wilcox, Mayes C. Rubeo’s costumes—is also solid, though the aural aspects, including Ramin Djawadi’s bombastic score, reach ear-splitting levels, particularly when heard in IMAX format, where the 3D also blurs some of the busier images. Presumably there’s a built-in audience for “Warcraft” from the millions of gamers familiar with the property, who are perhaps still interested in it.  For anyone else, though, the attraction of this overblown exercise in derivative fantasy would seem to be minimal.  Certainly it represents a stumble for Jones, a promising young director who has fallen into the same trap that seduced Josh Trank, the helmer of last year’s abysmal “Fantastic Four” reboot—the chance to prove that you can handle a Hollywood behemoth that might spawn a lucrative franchise.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 9, 2016"," Definitively establishing that “state-of-the-art” and “chintzy” are not mutually exclusive qualities, Warcraft is a perplexing multiplex boondoggle: Rarely is so much time, money, and cutting-edge technology expended on a spectacle so devoid of wonder. Instead of immersing viewers in its magical realm, as most great fantasies do, this adaptation of Blizzard’s wildly popular game series keeps them at an alienating remove. Great effort has been taken to assure that we can see every vertebrate of a dead animal worn like body armor, but none seems to have been applied to making the characters come alive, the environments seem defined, or the special effects look convincing. The film borrows names, concepts, and even specific locations from its source material, all while managing to shrink a limitless multiplayer sandbox—the online kingdom subscribers have been exploring for a dozen years now—into a kind of generic, unplayable story mode. It’s massive only in budget and miscalculation. True to its roots, and in line with the pick-a-side trend in this year’s blockbuster class, Warcraft divides its sympathies. Half the cast of characters—a term to be used loosely when referring to these glowering NPCs—belongs to a species of world-jumping conquerors, searching for a new home to replace their dying one. Sporting fashionably braided hair and pierced tusks, the hulking orcs are basically Klingons on steroids—they have codes of honor, raise their young to be warriors, etc. Of course, they’re really just unconvincing masses of ones and zeroes; even the magic of motion-capture can’t make these macho beasts look real, exactly. This becomes a problem when we’re meant to be bonding with blandly brooding orc chieftain—and nervous new father—Durotan (Toby Kebbell), who suspects that the power-hungry shaman he answers to may be poisoning every land they claim with his black magic. The humans, playing defense against these invaders, are more distinguishable but no more interesting than their marauding counterparts. One-dimensional archetypes abound, from the rakish commander (Travis Fimmel) to the noble king (Dominic Cooper) to a nerdy, bookish mage in training (Ben Schnetzer). Ben Foster, cast in the Merlin role (but dressed and groomed more like Jesus), spends most of the film pretending to summon and hurl clouds of gaseous green energy. (His magic mojo comes from some intangible fuel cell called The Fell, which is basically The Force if it corrupted as surely as the one true ring.) It’s not the most dignified use of a terrific actor, though Foster fares much better than Paula Patton, taking the Zoe Saldana career path of slathering herself in a primary color to play an inhuman warrior princess—in this case, the probable offspring of an orc and human fling. The film can’t even make her fanged underbite look natural, let alone settle on a consistent forced-perspective scale. To watch Warcraft is never to be transported, but to wade through a thick morass of mythology, exposition, gaudy light-show effects, half-assed character development, and formulaic franchise groundwork. It’s bad news for fans of the game, much worse news for director/cowriter Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code), a talented sci-fi fabulist who’s fallen screaming into the same CGI abyss that consumed Peter Jackson during his unfortunate Hobbit cycle. The film builds, perhaps inevitably, to one of those tiresome clashes of digital armies, as two waves of fuzzy soldiers crash into each other. In a way, though, it feels like we’re always watching expendable computer-generated avatars, even when they’re captured in close-up or having tedious conversations about a potential truce between man and monster. Nothing in Jones’ green-screen kingdom looks tactile, not even the flesh-and-blood performers. It makes you long for the dirt and mud and tangible stuff of an analog-era Lord Of The Rings ripoff like Willow. Yet to snidely dismiss all of this as the soulless epitome of “video-game cinema” would be to insult not just video games, but also the more relentlessly disposable entertainments that usually earn that description: For all its swinging swords and mallets, Warcraft is less an action movie than a dour medieval soap opera built from the spare parts of older, better fantasias. The games—not just the flagship World Of Warcraft, but also its real-time strategy predecessors—were no less indebted to other sources, from steampunk to Tolkien to Dungeons & Dragons. It’s the players who give these tropes distinctive life, using derivative building blocks to create custom characters, adventures, and experiences. By its very nature, Warcraft the movie can’t replicate that participatory element. But with apologies to Jones—fingers crossed that he bounces back from this folly—you can’t help but wish someone with a bolder, grander vision was manning the mouse. All anyone here saw in the raw material was an untapped franchise: less a world of Warcraft then a biannual summer appointment.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 9, 2016"," Movie review of “Warcraft”: The film, based on the popular fantasy video game, is an incoherent mess, a riot of cheesy-looking CG and a desert in terms of character development. Rating: 1 star out of 4. ‘Warcraft,’ with Dominic Cooper, Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell. Directed by Duncan Jones, from a screenplay by Jones and Charles Leavitt. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence. Several theaters. Ugly, with a mouthful of tusks, jutting protuberantly. Ugly, with massive muscles, flexing impressively. And glowering eyes, staring angrily forth from a very large head. We’re talking orcs, here. Demonic monsters of the “Lord of the Rings” world, appropriated and repurposed by the makers of the vastly popular “Warcraft” fantasy video game. They’re central characters in the game, now the source material of a Major Motion Picture — which is an incoherent mess, a riot of cheesy-looking CG and a desert in terms of character development. In it, the inhabitants of orc world, a place of dust and brutishness, pour through a glowing green portal into the world of humankind, a place of walled cities and castles and knights in shining armor. The monsters’ goal: domination and decimation of the easily squishable humans. Let the CG battles, courtesy of director Duncan Jones and an army of keyboard warriors, begin. Prominently in play are what I’ll call Dueling Force Fields: light-show creations of blue and green zaps zapping from characters’ hands and eyes, hurling various characters hither and yon like rag dolls as they bounce off the electricity. The prime zappers are a couple of hooded wizardlike villains, parallel paragons of treachery. One is an orc (Daniel Wu) and one a human (Ben Foster), whose eyes literally glow with malevolence. Paula Patton, playing a half-orc, half-human female warrior, is the most sympathetic character and actually gives something approaching a fully fledged performance, but for the rest of it … ugliness as far as the eye can see.

"Jun 8, 2016"," The first thing you have to forgive about the Warcraft movie is the orc teeth. Imagine a playground of bullies with underbites. The orc women have dainty lower jaw-fangs designed to snag their top lip. Their male mates swing around thumb-size tusks heavy with rings and pierced hoops. When a fighter dies, his tooth is snapped off and strung on a necklace. Alive and in 3-D, their plaque-fuzzed incisors stab at the audience. It'd be scarier if we weren't wondering how they brush. From the neck down, it gets worse. The orcs wear dirty warthog skulls for shoulder pads, line their backs with skeleton spines, sprout thick fingernails, and carry a coating of grimy crust that sticks to their skin like dried peanut butter. As human Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) grimaces, if orcs are around, you can tell by the smell. And yet, orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) has kind, green eyes. And yet, when he's in bed with his pregnant orc wife (Anna Galvin), they cuddle and crack jokes and punch each other in the shoulder like teenagers. And yet, you suddenly care about their marriage even though she and Durotan are literally capturing and killing human beings to fuel a magical portal built, cyclically, for the purpose of capturing and killing more human beings. And yet, though we were happy to skip orc wars after the last three Hobbit movies, though every cell in our body is rolling its eyes, we're in. And yet, and yet, and yet. There's every reason to snigger at Warcraft, or avoid it altogether. I can't blame you. People who don't play the hugely popular video game have no hunger for yet another fantasy land populated with wizards and kings, where every proper name was either invented by refrigerator poetry — Frostwolf, Bronzebeard, Stormwind, Doomhammer — or by scattering Scrabble tiles and shrugging, ""Yeah, Medivh works."" Fans of Warcraft love it because they control their own plots. But every few minutes, director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code), who cowrote the script with Charles Leavitt, thinks to put in strange, fresh beats — a character out of breath, a tiny stumble, an unexpected line delivery — that, combined, do the impossible. They make this standard, shopworn, CG-plated epic feel like its own monster. That's all Jones. When he took over the script, it was the same old ""man good, orcs bad"" smash-’em-up. The theaters are full of flicks where the heroes are perfect (or adorkably perfect) and the villains are evil just because. Warcraft adds a wrinkle. It spends as much time with the orcs as it does with the humans, long enough to empathize with their culture's devotion to honor and loyalty. We see orcs begin to question their warlord Blackhand (Clancy Brown), especially when magician Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) casually vapes slaves for an energy buzz. And when the film cuts back to the humans, they're doing the same thing: wondering if they're trusting the right leaders, and struggling with hollow patriotic deaths. In the climactic battle scenes, we know everyone's conflicted motivations, even the grunts in the back who live only to be smashed. We understand their actions as if we were holding the joystick. Yet the camera makes it clear that Jones is in control. Instead of the top-down view of player-gods, the movie cuts us down to size. The characters tower over the lens, stomping past us as we cower at their knees and smashing fists in our faces to cut to black. My ears rang. I liked it. Still, the screen is so alive it's unnerving. There are a few shots that spend four whole seconds soaking in a vista — mostly the orcs' village, a tent city under a wooden roller coaster — but otherwise the movie won't stop moving as the camera dodges hammers, ducks horses, and grabs onto a griffin's tailfeathers. Warcraft's fidgetiness almost distracts from the mediocre animation. For the love of god, I don't want to see another glowing eyeball until I rewatch The NeverEnding Story. (Goofy finger electricity, you can stay.) If it kept us more flustered, we could even forgive the miscast performances, like Ben Foster's twerpy wizard and his chubby-cheeked understudy (Ben Schnetzer), who looks more like an overwhelmed law student. Few actors can handle the green screen. Two big moments get drained by flat reactions, and, even buried under pixels, Kebbell's orc hunk out-emotes every other human face. At least Fimmel's fierce human fighter is a worthy Tom Hardy knockoff. As a bonus, you can actually understand his dialogue. Still, the main problem for this daffy blockbuster is that orcs aren't cool. It happens. Genre flicks go through trends: Wizards cede power to vampires, who get overrun by zombies, who get schooled by superheroes. No wonder Warcraft wanted to make this movie a decade ago. Post-Hobbit, it's passé. Audiences are fickle, but at least we're consistently so. (Hot chicks in body paint like Paula Patton's Garona never go out of style, though it'd be great if they did.) If the franchise survives to shoot a sequel — and there are plot twists here that genuinely make me wish it would — perhaps the mood will be friendlier. And even if not, here's hoping Warcraft continues being its own odd beast.",POSITIVE

"Jun 8, 2016"," Can you really hate something born of naked sincerity? This is an era of soulless money-gobblers like “Alice Through the Looking Glass” and the second “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which luckily haven’t made much money. “Warcraft” exists to make cash, too — it is, after all, a video game movie. But it’s also a talented fan’s passion project, its every inch brimming with unfiltered dorkiness.There are mages and library ghosts (played by Glenn Close!) and rampaging golems. There are places with names like Ironforge (where iron is forged). Orcs and roided-out humans, and sometimes even dwarves, stomp about knockoff Tolkien landscapes and expansive rooms barking things like, “I am Durotan, son of Garrosh!” and “Where is the protector of Azeroth?” If you can’t follow any of this, you — unlike director and co-writer Duncan Jones (“Moon,” “Source Code,” also David Bowie’s son) — probably aren’t a “World of Warcraft” player. And there’s the rub: Jones’ love runs too deep. He stumbles about trying to pound a cherished game into a two-hour spectacular. This is pure boondoggle, the kind of impenetrable morass that would usually get a confusing opening with a head floating in space vomiting up exposition, a la “Zardoz” or David Lynch’s “Dune.” During the latter’s disastrous theatrical run in 1984, unsuspecting multiplex audiences were handed leaflets with a list of jargon, forcing them to quickly memorize terms like “gom jabbar,” “melange” and “mentat.” “Warcraft” could use one of those, too; every third word out of everyone’s mouth is concentrated gobbledygook. It’s not easy to keep up with “Warcraft,” which can be harder on the brain than sitting in the middle of two molecular scientists talking shop. But its plot is pretty basic, just disorganized. At base it’s a simple origin story, setting up how two species — the marauding orcs and the peaceful but powerful humans — began what we’re told is a war lasting generations. The orcs — he-man homunculi with pierced chompers and speaker-rumbling growls — have been misled by their evil, green-eyed despot to transport from realm to realm, reaping the land and its denizens and absorbing their powers. When they arrive in dreamy Azeroth, they find puny but ripped humans who can put up a fight, if not by sword (or gun) then with the blindingly bright superpowers of their magicians, one of whom (Ben Foster) looks like Jesus (or Jared Leto). Our Movie Franchise Industrial Complex necessitates this all end with a desperate plea for a sequel. “Warcraft” doesn’t even have a real ending, just the promise/threat of more mumbo-jumbo, alternating with juiceless war orgies. (Jones might be too brainy to be good with action. The melees are flurries of green and tannish bodies smashing each other in neutered PG-13.) It’s not even a particularly novel world. Just as “World of Warcraft” is a mash-up of all things fantasy, so too is Jones’ movie — everything is hand-me-down, usually from “Lord of the Rings.” It doesn’t feel like a painstakingly crafted world, just a mash-up of what came before. But back to the initial question: Can you really hate “Warcraft”? It certainly makes that easy. Few of the characters stand out, and good actors — like Paula Patton, as a half-human half-orc warrior whose lineage is weirdly never explained — appear stranded. Travis Fimmel’s mighty human Lothar (not of the Hill People) is a bland McHero who makes Jon Snow look like Liberace. And yet ignoring the muddled story, ignoring the avalanche of nerd words that will never stick in the mind, one can still groove on its sincerity. It plays like a kid spending the afternoon mashing together his action figures, pitting one toy line against several others. It’s about as coherent as that, too, but it’s the rare debacle that feels like it came from a good place.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 8, 2016","  Ay yi yi. Where to even begin? How about here: Sitting through Warcraft is like being bludgeoned on the head with a Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual for 123 minutes. The big hardcover one. Terrible even by the low standard of videogame-to-movie adaptations, Duncan Jones’ 3-D action-fantasy endurance test is a cautionary tale of what can happen when Hollywood blindly chases after popular properties in the hopes of minting the next blockbuster franchise. When it works, the studio gets rich and the fans are respected and rewarded. When it doesn’t, you get the next Speed Racer or Jonah Hex or Lone Ranger — which is exactly what Warcraft will end up becoming. It’s soulless, incoherent, Renaissance Faire hooey. And since the latest iteration of game series that inspired it, World of Warcraft, already peaked years ago, even the timing is off.
  For the uninitiated, the story chronicles the origins of a bloody interspecies clash between humans and orcs—a hulking, he-man race of warriors with pointy gremlin ears, tusk-like bicuspids, and ropy Predator braids. They look like Klingons who swallowed Conan the Barbarian and Hellboy. While the orcs are ruled by an evil leader named Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), they’re not all savages. One, in particular, a big-hearted brute called Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is quickly established as a devoted husband and father after his orc wife Draka (Anna Galvin) gives birth to a baby orc, who coos like a shorn Furby. Needless to say, Durotan’s not down with Gul’dan and is conflicted by his plan to unleash his orc horde through a shimmering portal and attack the puny humans, who are even less defined as characters than their orc tormentors. Vikings‘ Travis Fimmel plays the wisecracking hero Lothar (I kept waiting for Rick Moranis to show up to say whether he was the Gatekeeper or the Key Master), Dominic Cooper is the bland King Llayne, and poor Ben Foster pops up as the magical Medivh. (Is there a better actor choosing worse roles right now?) They all stand around stiffly mumbling Tolkien-esque jibberish about boomsticks, spellthrowers, Golems, and something called “The Fel”, which seems to be really important, but I couldn’t tell you why. Caught in between these two warring tribes is Paula Patton’s Garona, a green-skinned human-orc “half-breed” who’s almost unintelligible since she seems to have a pair of plastic novelty Halloween fangs in her mouth. Maybe she explained what The Fel was.

"Jun 8, 2016"," In 2001 a friend, a grown-up, saw The Fellowship of the Ring more than a dozen times in the theater. Sometimes she’d leave with a half-hour left. “I just needed to get to Galadriel and Lothlorien,” she told me. She didn’t need all the climactic fighting.  In 2012 I took my mother to see the baggy, dithering first installment of the Hobbit trilogy. Afterwards, she scoffed at the critics, proclaiming, “I was happy to spend so much time in that world without all the beat-’em-ups.”  For many of the millions who love it, fantasy can be a refuge — not a quick escape from this world but the opportunity to luxuriate in another. Sadly, they won’t find much world to sink into in Warcraft, the 3-D adaptation of the computer-game series whose online role-playing edition marked the greatest monetization yet of the addictive game concepts Gary Gygax and David Arneson invented with Dungeons & Dragons: kill monsters, get loot, grow more powerful, kill bigger monsters. The movie makes you yearn for real life, even as its camera swoops you through spectacular dwarf forges, ivory cities, throne rooms, and wizards’ towers.  Warcraft dashes through its HD renderings so fast that details merely slough the eye. Other than one shot of a wizard naïf gaping at a circular staircase, the filmmakers expect you to pause Warcraft at home if you want to see what its army of artists actually designed. (And, seriously, the capital is called Stormwind City? Who names their town after an A+ reason not to live there?)  Fans of the beat-’em-ups will be even more miserable. Warcraft plods toward its climactic battle like Sisyphus shoving that stone up Hell’s hill — you’ll abandon hope of it ever getting there. It’s the kind of day-killer of a movie that, just before the third act, shackles its heroes in prison cells. Is there any viewer who doesn’t know they’ll eventually escape, and that the lockup scenes are the best possible time to go to the bathroom? The Warcraft games emphasize, in different iterations, both strategic city-sacking and the jolly, dungeon-delving, party-based adventuring of D&D. The movie can’t even get those basics right, confining its battles to a forest, a campground by a portal, and the patio area of a wizard’s indoor pool.  In short, Warcraft is the most wearying kind of bad movie, a dull and sad one that’s less engaging a watch than just seeing the studio’s millions run bill by bill through a shredder for two hours. Ten more reels of Bilbo Baggins’s singing-dancing dwarf dinner party would play like Raiders of the Lost Ark by comparison. It’s pompous and grim and confusing, set in an imperiled fantasy land — Azeroth — that may as well be named Generica. Key scenes seem to have been sliced away or never filmed. An hour had passed before I felt confident I could tell, in a lineup, which bearded fellow was king, which was wizard, and which was warrior. Their common trait, besides general indistinguishability: They’re all awfully quick to give speeches to chain-bound half-orc slave Garona about how hard their lives have been.  But Paula Patton, as that half-orc, has quite a high charisma score. Garona’s torn between two worlds, as the back cover of the novelization might say, but Patton finds feeling and humor in the ridiculous role. She scores the film’s only honest laughs when she bluntly tells that wizard naïf that he would be an ineffective lover. In the final scenes, Garona even gets to make a tense, difficult decision, and Warcraft briefly seems to have hot blood in its veins.  There are a few other elements that might interest devotees of fantasy cheese. First, the filmmakers honor the games’ multivarious perspectives by casting an orc (Toby Kebbell) as Warcraft’s first onscreen hero — and depicting orc marriage with big-lug tenderness. These scenes aren’t good, exactly, but they’re the only ones in the film that suggest that anyone in Azeroth (or the orc world invading it) has ever felt anything besides go-here/fight-that. The mo-cap work is expressive and convincing, with more care spent on each brutish orc nipple than on the entirety of the script. Kebbell rumbles dutifully in the role, but the performance and the technical achievement are defeated by the creature design: Why do the orcs have such huge and ill-proportioned Hamburger Helper hands?  More pleasing, for fans of this kind of thing, is Warcraft‘s spirited and inventive (for a movie) depiction of magic. It’s here that you might see why a director as promising as Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) signed on for this — in the margins, he finds room to play. There’s shivery horror in the way an orc shaman sucks the white-light life out of his chattel, and bad-guy magery is always marked with plumes of necromantic green. A wizard hero, meanwhile, rains lightning down on a small squad of enemies, and the sequence is more scary and satisfying than anything Thor’s ever done onscreen — the forces unleashed seem just barely controlled.  Finally, I have to give Warcraft this: It inspired the most impassioned profane heckle I’ve heard at a movie screening since the time a young man hollered out as War Horse climaxed, “It’s just a fucking horse!” This time, the shout came forty minutes in, after the excitable preview audience had settled into fitful silence. As characters whose names I couldn’t keep straight jawed at each other through their beards, a real person yelled, “Fuck this boring white shit!” and barreled right out of the theater. His escape: 2016 America.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 8, 2016"," Director Duncan Jones’ adventurous adaptation (*** out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) of the popular role-playing game doesn’t have the expansive nature or deep mythology — at least not yet — of Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings series, but Warcraft wins by not trying to be the second coming of a 10-hour cinematic trip through Mordor with Hobbits and jewelry. Rather, it’s a simpler, yet still wholly entertaining tale of magic and larger-than-life soldiers in a battle for survival. Thanks to the black magic wielded by their wicked leader Gul’dan (played through motion capture by Daniel Wu), the world populated by war-loving barbarian orcs is dying. As a result, they travel through a interdimensional gate to the human realm of Azeroth to take over. Young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) gets a whiff of trouble, and warns King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and his military guru Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). The heavy armaments are broken out, Lothar scrambles his men — including his son (Burkely Duffield) — and Medivh (Ben Foster), the local wizard guardian, is called in to negate the effects of Gul'dan's green oozing magic called the Fel. Swords clang, orcs roar, wondrous creatures take flight, etc. With any other filmmaker at the helm, this might have been as uninteresting and flat as another Dungeons & Dragons movie. But like his iconic dad David Bowie, Jones has an impressive knack for elevating material, as the director did with his man-in-space picture Moon and sci-fi mystery Source Code. Jones infuses Warcraft with themes of tolerance and identity but also a similar sense of fun and wonder as Krull, The NeverEnding Story and others did in the campy '80s fantasy boom. Lothar is an earnest individual but Fimmel gives him a snarky side that plays well against the inherent clumsiness of Khadgar and the fish-out-of-water nature of Garona (Paula Patton), a half-orc warrior with whom he’s tied in a potential romantic dynamic. However, Jones upends even that cliché in insightful fashion. The computer-generated landscape of Azeroth is mighty fine, yet it is tough to get your bearings on whether you’re in the city of Stormwind or the magical city of Dalaran as folks scoot between them frequently on the road to foiling Gul’dan’s treacherous plans. And many of the CGI orcs, while well crafted, tend to look the same in attacking packs. A standout in that lineup — and of the movie in general — is Durotan, one of the orc chieftains given life through Toby Kebbell’s motion-capture work. With a heart almost as big as his barrel chest, Durotan is an unlikely hero who rebels against Gul’dan in order to protect his fellow warrior wife (Anna Galvin) and their newborn baby. Kebbell’s performance showcases the nuances of a father gripped by the no-win situation of having no home and his family in constant danger.",POSITIVE
"Jun 8, 2016"," With its vast tapestry of knights, orcs, and mages, the World of Warcraft franchise was always going to be a tricky one to adapt. As fans of the MMORPG (I can’t claim to be one of them, though I did some research before heading into the pic) know well, there’s so much packed into the series’ lore that it inarguably lends itself better to encyclopedias than films. And so director Duncan Jones, who makes a lot of very smart choices behind the camera of Warcraft, makes one of his wisest in choosing to tell an origin story for this world, working from the stories of the original strategy game that predated any online video-game take. In doing so, he’s able to focus the movie exponentially, making heroes and villains out of the individuals involved in World of Warcraft‘s catalyzing moment – the first encounter between humans and orcs. For those totally new to the franchise, humans live in the very Tolkien-esque land of Azeroth, enjoying a long-kept peace under the benevolent reign of King Llane (Dominic Cooper). Orcs, on the other hand, hail from the dying world of Draenor, a planet that has been consumed by a dark magic known as the Fel. The orcs are a tribal people, but they’ve been united under the gnarled fist of evil warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu, though unrecognizable), who uses the Fel to open a portal into Azeroth in hopes of sending the Orc Horde through to conquer it. Orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is one of the first through, although he’s far from a war-monger. With a loving wife (Anna Galvin) and newborn child, Durotan feels more than ever desperate to protect his tribe, and he can see plainly what Gul’dan’s more ardent followers cannot – that the Fel is a poison, one that can only ensure the destruction of everything around it. It’s an impossible situation for him to be in – Gul’dan is far too powerful to confront, and no amount of trepidation about his methods can change the fact that the orcs’ homeworld is in its death throes. But Dorutan, much as he knows war is a way of life for orcs, agrees with Llane’s sentiment that, “War with us will solve nothing.” And Kebbell, utilizing a progression of the same motion-capture performance approach that defined Avatar and the last two Planet of the Apes movies, lets us see the agony of indecision in Durotan’s eyes. There’s something otherworldly about just how emotive some of the orcs are in Warcraft, and that character is its most richly realized, displaying more humanity beneath protruding tusks and thick brows than any actual human in the film. Another smart decision Jones makes is to throw us into Warcraft‘s mythology head first. He opens with a bruising, brutal orc-human fight straight out of the MMORPG, then cuts to Durotan in bed with his wife, discussing baby names. It’s bizarre, yes, but such juxtaposition spotlights the two main characteristics of the orcs upfront – their lust for battle, and their overriding sense of honor. None of it would work without Kebbell’s nuanced, confident portrayal of an orc caught between the two. He’s this film’s appropriately musclebound anchor. Once Jones kicks over to the human side of things though, Warcraft starts to lose steam at an alarming rate. There are a host of stolid, Lord of the Rings-style heroes, from the valiant Lothar (Travis Fimmel) to the brash young mage Khadghar (Ben Schnetzer), but all of them are so typical of this kind of swords-and-sorcery fantasy that they entirely fail to leave an impression. Cooper in particular seems to sleepwalk through the part of Llane, bringing nothing to it save a regal gravity in his voice. And Paula Patton, playing a half-human/half-orc hybrid wanted by neither world, fails to find much life in her hard-worn survivor character, which means her part in the movie serves only to undercut the grand illusion Jones is trying so hard to pull off. That’s to say nothing of Ben Foster, who’s on a different page than just about everyone else in the cast, playing mage Medivh with consummate theatricality while still trying to find some dramatic heft to a character whose dialogue leaves him with painfully little. Given how much time Jones spends with these characters, that turns into a pretty major headache for Warcraft, one exacerbated by how his stiff and unwieldy script (co-written with Charles Leavitt) stuffs exposition into each of their mouths without regard for sounding completely ridiculous. Maybe Warcraft was always going to be campy, and that’s fine, but it’s still overcrowded with tidbits of information about its universe. The amount of story Jones has to compress into a two-hour movie means that some potentially interesting characters get to show up, drop some intel about their role in the film, then die – there’s simply no room for anything more than that. Condensing the story as much as Jones and Leavitt do creates a whole bunch of problems, from a tone that zigzags all over the place and unsuccessfully stretches for comedy more than it should, to a profoundly depressing sense that after all Jones’ toiling, his film is just a lot of tablesetting for a sequel that will (based on the box office prognosis) never come. It also means that some of the absolutely fascinating themes Jones is brave enough to wrestle with here get short shrift. With Medivh and Gul’dan both holding incredible sway over the fates of their respective worlds, there’s an interesting undercurrent about the inherent dangers of trusting in unchecked power structures, and the corruption that can seep into institutions unnoticed even while permeating their every activity. And the orcs’ plight, fleeing a dangerous world in hopes of a better one, mirrors that of millions of immigrants around the world today. There’s no clear right and wrong in the movie’s central conflict, and for a film as expensive and commercial-minded as this, that’s a bold statement. All in all, Jones has made a Warcraft that the franchise’s fans will love – it’s ferociously true to its fantasy roots, even when such devotion renders it silly at times when it’s trying to be serious, and it’s dauntless about setting up tough, tricky moral conflicts that it has no hope of (or interest in) resolving neatly. There’s incredibly admirable, hell-for-leather ambition to the entire picture, and that carries it through the clunkiest dialogue and most wooden performances, even if it can’t quite cover up the stunning messiness of the plot and pace. There’s a legitimate wonder to becoming submerged in the world Jones has clearly poured his heart and soul into creating, and for that reason, Warcraft may not be a quote-unquote good movie, but it is an intriguing, worthwhile experience.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 8, 2016","  Warcraft is not a disaster or deserving of the pre-release negativity. I can honestly say that if you like fantasy, then you're going to like this film. And if you're a fan of the game, then you'll probably love the movie. To be clear, I have never played Warcraft. I walked in fairly cold, knowing the scantest plot details. I did see the initial trailer, but found it spectacularly underwhelming. This is why you have to see the actual movie. Warcraft doesn't spoon feed you. It leaps into the story full throttle. It's a hard fantasy that you have to pay attention to understand. If you do, then you'll be rewarded. The Warcraft movie is entertaining and immersive.   The kingdom of Azeroth is being invaded by fearsome orcs. They are coming from their dying world through a portal. The orc leader, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), has opened the gate using dark magic - The Fel. The human king (Dominic Cooper) sends his warrior brother, Lothar (Travis Fimmel), to face the threat. But the orcs are not what they seem. The mighty, but kind orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell); sees what The Fel has done to his people. He knows that Gul'dan must be stopped to truly survive. Bitter enemies must find common ground and new allies to stop evil.   Warcraft cannot be judged purely on the visual effects. They run from borderline video game CGI to impressive theatrical quality. It's not entirely consistent throughout, but that doesn't take you out of the story. Azeroth is fully realized as the setting. I liken it to watching old episodes of Star Trek. Yes, some things look unrealistic, but you still believe they are in space. That's an apt analogy. Director Duncan Jones, who's taking way too much heat from the haters, successfully creates Azeroth. He took a stab at adapting a vast world and succeeds in his efforts.   The plot and characters in Legendary's Warcraft are very detailed. It would be an understatement to say there's a lot going on. Casual watchers will get lost if they're not fully committed. I found the story to be engrossing. It was not a strain to follow the characters and comprehend what they were doing. In fact, the actors do a pretty good job of selling the drama. Some parts lead to obvious resolves, but I was quite taken by the ending. It's a satisfying conclusion to the story.   There isn't a boring second in Warcraft. The dialogue gets silly at time, but not enough to derail the pacing. It's also wall to wall action. Then you have the mystical element that I thought was pretty cool. Once again, Warcraft doesn't stop to explain every point about the magic being used. You have to watch, listen to the characters interact, and infer what they're trying to do. It takes a bit of imagination to be on the Warcraft ride.   Warcraft needs to be seen. Judge it for yourself. I was captivated for the entire runtime and would see a sequel in a heartbeat. It's a rollicking fantasy adventure that's getting a bad rap. Duncan Jones went big and is being pilloried unfairly for it. Warcraft isn't stupid or hard to follow. It's a skydive into a fantasy world. Warcraft is definitely worth shelling out for the IMAX 3D.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. For Ms. Marvel star Iman Vellani, it seems to be a question of when she will return to the MCU rather than a question of if. ",NEUTRAL
"Jun 8, 2016"," Masterpieces are damn difficult to pull off, but in their own way, absolute howlers are just as rare an achievement. You have to stand back and marvel when so many talented people come together to make a disaster like Warcraft, one of those perfect storms of terrible creative decisions and misjudged execution. This adaptation of Blizzard Entertainment's massively popular videogame series is part war film, part old-school fantasy extravaganza, and part cinematic catastrophe. No doubt the people who worked on this doomed ship will make good movies again in the future. But Warcraft's ineptitude leaves a bruise, and the film should serve as a warning about what can happen when modern blockbusters' worst tendencies collide. The film tells of the initial encounter between humans and orcs—the central struggle in the Warcraft games—and stars Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar, a noble warrior who fights for the equally noble King Llane (Dominic Cooper). We know these characters are noble because they always hold their chin slightly aloft and never, ever reveal a sense of humor. At first, the actors' knowingly square portrayals feel like a fun throwback to the cheesy, enjoyably wooden fantasy movies of yesteryear like Clash of the Titans. But soon, it becomes clear that Warcraft is absolutely not kidding. Director and cowriter Duncan Jones is draping the proceedings in heavy significance, which was a bad choice. Early on, the orcs invade the humans' tranquil land, traveling through a portal from their dying planet to colonize another. The orcs are unsmiling beasts of brute-force destruction, especially Durotan (Toby Kebbell), who just so happens to be pretty noble warrior himself. But the orcs' ruler, a potent shaman named Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), makes Durotan uneasy: Are his impressive powers, which include draining the life force of others to make himself stronger, actually the reason the orcs' planet is now uninhabitable? Using motion-capture technology to render the hulking orcs with expressive faces, Warcraft does have some nifty effects work. Indeed, in 3D IMAX the film immerses us in this ancient fairy-tale environment of chivalrous knights, dastardly monsters, and amped-up magic. But then there's the story, which is easily predictable and utterly charmless. There are always shiny things to look at on the screen, but you still want to look away because the film is so utterly dull. Director Duncan Jones made his name with 2009's Moon, a smart, low-budget sci-fi indie that suggested he knew how to wring an emotional, engaging narrative out of a deceptively simple premise (Spoiler Alert!): a man (Sam Rockwell) learns that he's actually a clone. That film's handmade charm got him noticed and, as happens so often in Hollywood these days, it immediately landed him bigger projects that lacked the very qualities that made his first outing so special. His followup, 2011's Source Code, was clever but also a little hollow—Moon without the soulfulness. With Warcraft, we watch a filmmaker swallowed up by his movie's lumbering design. There's no question Jones brings a distinctive eye to Warcraft: He's envisioned this imaginary realm to be a darker, more anguished version of Peter Jackson's Tolkien sagas. On occasion, you get a glimpse of the swaggering, brutal epic he's trying to fashion. But more often, Warcraft is a pale echo of Lord of the Rings paired with recycled bits of Avatar, brought to life by characters who are either drab or outright cringe-worthy. In the latter category, unfortunately, is the usually delightful Paula Patton. So great in Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, she is stuck here playing Garona, a half-orc/half-human who's captured by Lothar and, in essence, domesticated by the humans. This puts Patton in the unenviable position of having to portray her character as a sort-of savage initially, which triggers all kinds of uncomfortable racist associations, one that a piece of mass entertainment this witless isn't smart enough to use as commentary. Warcraft ensures that plenty of its other actors look pretty embarrassed, too. Kebbell has done terrific work in another series that goes heavy on motion capture tech, appearing as the ferocious ape Koba in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. (There's actually a faint thematic similarity between those movies and Warcraft, as both are about rival species whose most thoughtful members wonder if war is really the answer.) Playing Durotan, Kebbell gives this vicious warrior a quiet dignity that quickly signals to the audience that he's not such a bad orc after all. But the filmmakers cloaked the character in such a wet blanket of dreary decency that there's no audience investment in his inner conflict with the malicious Gul'dan. Likewise, Fimmel, Cooper, Ben Foster (as a magical Guardian protecting Llane's kingdom) and Ben Schnetzer (as a restless young man with his own magical powers) are snoozers as the brave defenders of the human race. Foster in particular is waster here. From 3:10 to Yuma to Ain't Them Bodies Saints, he is the sort of actor who always gives intriguingly askew, intense performances, but in Warcraft he's just silly, telegraphing his character's dark destiny almost from the start. (He does get the campiest makeover in the film, though, transforming into a hideous ghoul who, even then, is no fun at all.) Gamers wonder why Hollywood rarely does right by any of their beloved properties. In the case of Warcraft, it appears that every decision was geared toward maximizing the film's blockbuster-ness. You know the signs by now: Throw in a smidgeon of social relevance; Warcraft has vague pleas to respect the environment and other peoples. Slather everything with special effects that stop feeling special because there's no real magic or wonder underneath. Copy the look and feel of popular movies. Be sure to leave room for sequels by creating an unresolved ending that makes the two-hour film the audience just endured feel like a mere setup for what's to come. Plenty of big summer movies have ridden this done-to-death formula to box-office riches, so you can understand why filmmakers keep milking it. But if Warcraft's commercial failure in some small way stirs studios to rethink their derivative tendencies, then by that measure—and by that measure only—this abysmal stinker will have been a success.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 8, 2016","This fantasy epic is made with love. If only it were made with quality, too.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 8, 2016"," The mortal sin of any movie adaptation based on an intellectual property with a sufficient amount of weirdness or oddity is to be ashamed of its origins. Often times a film will, out of fear of alienating a wider audience, choose to blunt or soften some of the more esoteric aspects of its story. All an attempt to reach out to a broader cross-section of the potential audience usually accomplishes is angering fans and baffling and boring strangers. For all the negative things that could be said about Warcraft, the newest film from director Duncan Jones, the one thing that it unabashedly has in its favor is being wholly true to itself. A grand, goofy, colorful epic with an almost impenetrably convoluted mythology, Warcraft never breaks its stone-faced earnest investment in its own story and world. In an era of committee-crafted mass entertainment that does its best to serve all possible masters at once, this straight-faced parade of ostentatious production design and unapologetically cheesy and labyrinthine plot should be given its due share of applause. That sort of earnest intention can only go so far, though. As a piece of actual cinema, with characters and a plot and a story, Warcraft is a sincerely crafted mess — a breathless string of incident tied together with incomprehensible lore and terminology. It is two hours of grand spectacle and arch character work with hardly an interstitial beat in-between. While this will draw ire and mockery from most, it is almost certain that, somewhere, a 9-year-old will see this film and it will become his or her whole world. The story seeks to explain the origins of the apparently unending war between Man and Orc, a conflict which is taken as writ from the get-go. The Orcs, who exist in a Horde comprised of smaller Tribes, live in a blighted world, led a cartoonishly evil-looking wizard named Gul’dan (David Wu). Among this Horde the most thoughtful and pensive of the tribal leaders is Durotan (Toby Kebbell), who has a moral awakening thanks to the birth of his son. He is among the first and only Orc to realize that the magic that Gul’dan is using to aid in their conquests and move them to a new world is the reason for their world’s demise in the first place. Unfortunately, this awakening only takes place once he has become part of the advanced party which has crossed a magical portal into the land of Azeroth. Azeroth is a vaguely utopia Euro-fantasy land populated by men, dwarves, elves, and other unnamed or unpronounceable races. Their king is Llane (Dominic Cooper), their champion is Lothar (Travis Fimmel), and their Guardian is Medivh (Ben Foster). When the Orcs come for their land and their people – which are needed to fuel their life-powered magic – these men team with the half-Orc Garona (Paula Patton) and the apostate mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) to fight the invasion and save Azeroth. These characters and their relationships and titles and what those titles mean are introduced with a swiftness rivaling one’s own ability to recount. Charitably, this could be called economy of storytelling. More accurately, it could be called the inevitable result of trying to tell three hours worth of story in just over two hours, credits included. Terms and ideas and rules are thrown off the screen with the natural cadence of people who live with those very things day to day, but the audience is left grasping feverishly for straws. At a certain point it becomes expedient and necessary to take a zen approach to the story — admit that you know nothing, and give yourself in to the experience. Giving into the experience is actually pretty easy given the briskness of the story’s pace, which makes the best of its ecstatic velocity by never allowing itself to become boring. This manic form of entertainment is buoyed by the performances, which are never anything less than fully-committed. Travis Fimmel in particular seems to relish his roles as a formidable human warrior, his eyes and his voice teetering constantly on the edge of rakish madness. Toby Kebbell as the Orc chieftain Durotan creates a vast ocean of honorable empathy for his be-tusked character, which is brought to shockingly convincing life by some of the best CGI in modern film. Ben Foster as the high wizard Guardian is a campy, bizarre mess of tics and insecurities, and Dominic Cooper portrays one of the most wise and benevolent kings in recent memory. Paula Patton is saddled with two of the film’s most unconvincing aspects, and yet still manages to be a compelling presence. As a half-Orc, she is almost wholly human except for her green skin and strange, speech-distorting tiny teeth that jut up from her lower lip. She also has to sell a budding romance with Fimmel’s Lothar, which might have landed better if there had been a moment to spare in this sprinting narrative for them to bond. Even characters whose names I have forgotten and whose allegiance or particular title I never quite understood — like Schnetzer’s Khadgar, who was once a part of a guild of magic-users whose name I could never catch — make a strong impression. There’s a very clear sense of character on display here, but the shallowness of their development makes it hard to praise beyond merely stating that everyone seems to know what they are doing in the moment. There is no development, only definition. The intricacies of the plot and the ways by which friendships are forged and broken are so dense and so fleeting that the whole thing comes off as more of a dream than a story. For all of its technical prowess and its clear action, there remains after viewing a lingering sense of having been caught in the center of a zoetrope. In spite of these deficiencies — the narrative wildness, the static characters, the impenetrable lore — Warcraft is still not entirely a failure, most of all because of its charming, almost admirable level of goofy conviction. The people who created this film clearly believed they were doing the right thing, and wanted to do right by it. They don’t shy from the darkness inherent in a tale of epic war, creating some of the most shockingly violent and brutal moments of recent blockbuster memory. They don’t mug for the audience, they don’t roll their eyes in cynical admission of the plot’s over-seriousness. They play the movie straight out of respect for whatever audience there might be for this type of thing. Sometimes a person can begin excitedly talking about a subject that you find beyond your capacity for interest, and yet their energy and their passion keeps you from being able to mock or deride them for their childish concerns. Warcraft is the film version of that person, and, try as you might, you can’t hate them just for loving something you simply don’t get, in a way you can’t comprehend.",POSITIVE
"Jun 7, 2016","For a movie that isn't 'good,' Warcraft simply works, and as the credits came up I found myself juggling my criticisms of the film with the desire to see just what happens next on Azeroth.",POSITIVE
"Jun 7, 2016"," The alleged year of the video game movie continues with Duncan Jones’ Warcraft. Distributed by Universal/Comcast Corp. and produced by Legendary, Atlas, and Blizzard Entertainment (the company behind the game), the film has been in international release for nearly two weeks. The $160 million adventure spectacular has earned $69 million in 28 markets with plenty more to come. But its domestic debut is on Friday, just two days after its potentially huge opening in China. While it’s not tracking well in America, it has already sold $20 million worth of pre-sale tickets in China. But it will be Legendary, not Universal, handling the film in that single potent market. The movie stands out for a couple of reasons. First of all, it’s been in some active production/development for several years. Hence, this is director Duncan Jones’ first movie in five years and only his third in the seven years since he popped up onto the scene with the Sam Rockwell outer-space drama Moon. Oh, and it’s yet another attempt to snag a winning A-level franchise from a video game. The other thing of note, and this is a drum I’ve been beating for a while, is that it’s one of the only big-budget would-be franchise starters that's a “new to cinema” brand. Along with the wholly original Gods of Egypt (R.I.P.) and Fox’s Christmas release of Assassin’s Creed (also a video game adaptation), this is the only remotely big-budget “original” in the sense that it’s not a sequel, prequel, remake, or reboot of a property that has been seen in cinemas before. For that reason alone, I hope it ends up working out for all parties. But if audiences react to the film the way most critics have thus far, it may also be the newest member of the “Okay, so the original made money, but the sequel won’t.” club. So, umm, good luck. Warcraft is a rather shocking misfire, a jumbled and narratively wonky bit of would-be fantasy world-building that is darn near impenetrable to anyone not deeply entrenched in its source material. It's like the Nightwatch of video game adaptations. The film is a visual marvel to be sure, with vividly realized creatures and periodic moments of spectacular battle. But the characters are thin while the plot bounces around seemingly at random. There is very little forward momentum and much of the 123-minute running time is spent on establishing the world in which it exists. Well, to be fair, the last thirty minutes is almost entirely dedicated to setting up the sequels that we will likely never get. No, I have not played the video game on which this film is based. No, I shouldn’t have to in order to appreciate or even understand this filmed version. The movie takes nearly an hour to get to a point where you are relatively sure of who the principal players are and how they relate to everyone else. But, since they aren't terribly interesting, you won't care. The plot itself never stops bouncing to and fro.  You may understand what is happening most of the time, but you'll rarely know ""why"" because the rules change almost shot-by-shot. While the moments of action, fewer in number and shorter in running time than you’d expect, are grand and occasionally ambitious, they fail to engage our emotions because they are rooted in the same arbitrary plotting that crushes the film as a whole. And they are mostly elementary ""big dudes with swords swing at each other"" face-offs. Boiled down to its basest elements, Warcraft concerns the realm of men who are attacked by gigantic orcs from another world. There are some notions of a wise human ruler (Travis Fimmel) teaming with a respected Orc clan leader (Toby Kebbell) to prevent mutually assured destruction. You would think that this story strand would form the core backbone of the movie. Yet, it is barely a ripple amid the random moments of strategizing, moments of various wizards on both sides doing random wizard things (you can make the case that the film is a parable about the dangers of following fanatical leaders), and discussions about how to stop the portal of doom from allowing more orcs to enter and conquer humanity. If anything, the orcs are more interesting as characters than the humans are, so it’s unfortunate that the men (and they are mostly men) dominate the film. There are moments of grace, and I will admit that the movie doesn’t necessarily end as you’d expect it to. Paula Patton is terrific as a half-human half-Draenei/half-orc, struggling with parentage that leaves her an outcast in both worlds. By default, she is the most developed character in the film. Ruth Negga gets little to do, although she is set up for a larger role in the non-existent sequel. The Industrial Light and Magic effects work is spectacular, offering fully believable creatures that blend seamlessly with their human co-stars as well as their real and fabricated settings. And yes, the film looked gorgeous in glorious IMAX 3D. It  certainly works better as a visual achievement in theaters than it does when watching the trailers on a laptop. It’s just a shame that the story itself alternates between overly generic and outright confusing. I cannot speak as to how fans of the game will respond, but the motion picture certainly does the source material few favors. Warcraft is the kind of unapologetic deep-dive fantasy filmmaking that should be applauded in today’s comparatively “hold your hand” cinematic culture. But it is a cobbled mess of a story that offers little present tense engagement and relies on its visuals and periodic action beats for its impact. I wish the film were more disciplined and less concerned about setting up the sequels. I wish the action had more variety beyond “opponents stand their ground and hack at each other with swords.”  I wish the characters were richer, and that (broken record) the female characters were both more plentiful and more relevant to the story. It is not ""so bad it's good,"" but rather it's just really bad. Considering the time, talent, hard work, and money that went into this clearly lavish production, the result is nothing short of a tragedy. In terms of providing a balance of unabashed fantasy, engaging characters, inventive action, and narrative coherency, Warcraft is the kind of movie we all feared The Fellowship of the Ring would be once upon a time. Heck, Warcraft's failures are significant enough to make me retroactively apologize for every unkind thing I've ever said about the Hobbit prequels or even John Carter.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 6, 2016"," Shane Black has been knocking around Hollywood for decades and has delivered some of the biggest successes and biggest failures in the action-comedy genre. It was Black who delivered goldmines like his first two Lethal Weapon films and Iron Man 3, and failures like The Long Kiss Goodnight. The chances are high that you have seen his work at some point and this, his latest offering, is an enjoyable, often funny pastiche of film noir that reflects his long time in Hollywood. The movie contains lots of film-nerd jokes - the plot synopsis itself contains quite a few. It's 1977, a pornstar called Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) dies in dramatic circumstances. Two men of the private detective variety - Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), who is more of a thug for hire variety, and Holland March (Ryan Gosling), of the old-lady swindling variety - end up working together looking for a young woman who looks remarkably like the dead pornstar. There is a missing film with a political message and a mother (Kim Basinger) who hires the bumbling idiots to find her daughter. March's own daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) plays their conscience. Ugly, chaotic and operating at an intellectual level marginally higher than that of a well-used punch bag, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was critically panned when it belly-flopped into cinemas in 2014. Naturally, it went on to make half-a-billion dollars, lighting the way for this sequel which remains bafflingly faithful to the ethos of its predecessor. Has director Dave Green (Earth To Echo) brought anything fresh to the softened, cartoon version of Eastman & Laird's edgy and violent mid-eighties graphic novels? Not on your life. The swirling, bounding CGI, straight from the playbook of producer Michael Bay, is still as hard as ever to keep up with. It ends up, like Bay's own big-screen transforming robots, being a major obstacle to enjoying the many action scenes. Yes, this is a horrid-looking film that has all the charisma of an arcade game beat-'em-up voiced by dim surfers. Human actors - Megan Fox (returning as gutsy and unashamedly eye-catching April O'Neil), Stephen Amell (as Casey Jones), Dublin-born wrestling star Stephen 'Sheamus' Farrelly - are squished into the background to make room for gloopy humanoid creatures that, while expressive on a basic animation level, are entirely uninvolving to behold. The difficulty with telling historical tales lies is the fact  that we know the ending, which makes it very hard to create suspense or dramatic tension. It is to their credit then that director Stephen Hopkins and writing team Anna Waterhouse and Joel Shrapnel do manage to create some tension in this otherwise dutiful and workmanlike biopic of African American olympian Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals, and who was the subject of a racist snub by Adolf Hitler, at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. We first meet Owens (Stephan James) in 1933 about to leave his family home in Cleveland to go to university where he has a scholarship due to his track and field ability. He leaves behind a family shaped by racism and poverty and a girlfriend, Ruth (Shanice Banton) and young daughter. In the university, he is taken under the wing of coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis) whose typically gruff but well-intentioned movie coach style works with Owens, defies the widespread racism and helps him to achieve the extraordinary feats in track and field. Their big goal is the 1936 Olympics in Germany but the American Olympic Association are debating whether their participation would condone the increasingly evil-looking Nazi regime. Avery Brundage (Jeremy 'career resurgence' Irons) is dispatched to investigate and recommends participation. Jeremiah Mahoney (William Hurt) resigns when the vote is taken to go to Germany. But the pressure on Owens is only beginning. This UK disability romance sees Clarke capably ditch the stentorian speeches and togas for pigtails and garish fashion sense as Louisa. Quirky and kind, she takes on a job as a caregiver for one Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will is in a wheelchair following a road accident and has had his high-flying London career and outdoorsy lifestyle destroyed. It falls to Louisa to cheer him up with her working class charm and help him look beyond his disability. Another month, another humongous gaming franchise gets an omniplex makeover. This time, it's Warcraft, a ""real-time strategy"" fantasy game loved by the type of people who live in basements and don't get much sunlight. It's unfortunate that the $160m outing is directed by Duncan Jones who helmed indie sci-fi gem Moon (2009) and time-jumping frolic Source Code. He surely had another couple of more earthy offerings in him before being fed to the big-league Hollywood moneymen.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 6, 2016"," Está claro: a los estudios de Hollywood les encanta tirar el dinero. Sólo así cabe explicar un filme como este Warcraft, donde los talentos de un director con recursos (Duncan Jones) y de un equipo virtuoso de técnicos y diseñadores de producción son conducidos hacia un desenlace que bien podría haber costado la mitad, o menos, de haber permanecido en los parámetros de la serie B. Y, mucho ojo, esto no lo decimos porque se trate de la adaptación de un videojuego, sino precisamente debido a ello. Partiendo de un material obligado por naturaleza a ser inmersivo, esta película no consigue implicar al espectador ni una sola vez en su mundo o en su relato. Menuda ironía. ¿A qué se debe esto? Pues para empezar, tal vez, a que Duncan Jones no escribe bien: en sus dos películas hasta la fecha, el cineasta había, bien aportado sólo el argumento (Moon), bien trabajado sobre material ajeno (Código fuente). Y, visto lo visto en la cinta que nos ocupa, parece anda justo de habilidades como la de hilar buenos diálogos o trazar personajes verosímiles. Claro que, si esos personajes acaban cayendo en manos de actores como Travis Fimmel (hablando en términos matemáticos, el talento interpretativo de este señor es un número imaginario) o esa Paula Patton que hace lo que puede con sus escenas y sus colmillos, pues tampoco puede esperarse mucho más. Asimismo, también es bueno recordar que esta película no es la Warcraft que concibió su director, ni tampoco aquella en la que trabajó su equipo. Según se ha publicado, cerca de una hora del filme desapareció en la sala de montaje, y eso se nota mucho. Muchísimo, de hecho: algunas transiciones entre plano y plano, o entre escena y escena, están llevadas a cabo con menos sutileza que los cortes a publicidad en TV, y delatan unas ganas de ahorrar tiempo que lindan con la mera chapuza. Semejantes prisas no sólo nos impiden disfrutar del paisaje (gran crimen para una película como esta, donde el paisaje es casi lo más importante), sino que nos dan la impresión de ser azuzados con rumbo a un destino que, en realidad, no es para tanto. Si se hubiera librado de esos tijeretazos, es posible que Warcraft siguiera siendo una película del montón. Visualmente no acaba de ser la repanocha, pese a que se le nota el esfuerzo invertido, y sus héroes (y heroína) resultan bastante planos, con la excepción del orco Toby Kebbell. Ahora bien: ese montaje carnicero acaba por hacer pedazos sus momentos de humor, sus paseos por una realidad paralela e incluso sus instantes de brillantez, que los tiene. De este modo, uno se pregunta a santo de qué vino tanto alarde, cuando los responsables financieros de la cinta aspiraban (o eso parece) a entregar un telefilme con más efectos digitales de lo habitual. La cinta se centrará en la lucha entre el héroe humano Anduin Lothar versus el héroe orco Durotan, ubicándose en gran medida en los reinos del este de Azeroth.

"Jun 6, 2016",A film that if I had to describe in one word would be: boring. [Full review in Spanish],NEGATIVE
"Jun 6, 2016"," Warcraft is a masterpiece of cinema that truly speaks to me and my interests. It’s like all the Frank Frazetta fantasy posters on my bedroom walls came to life like all of them all at once with like orcs and human warriors and flying beasts and mages and interplanetary portals and there’s even elves and dwarves here though not that much. It’s like someone made a Lord of the Rings movie but left out all the boring stuff about what hobbits like to eat for breakfast and elves sitting around talking about politics and definitely all the stupid stuff about why evil is so bad. Like duh we know why evil is bad, it’s evil. And instead the guy who made the movie just filmed all the battles not just the war-type ones but the wizards throwing magical lightning and stuff around. It’s great that Warcraft doesn’t waste any time either with like telling you who people are. Like we can tell the King is the King because he’s wearing a crown, but it doesn’t matter with everybody else. This movie doesn’t even really have like a main character so you don’t get bogged down with his stupid life story or anything like this. Like who cares if Frodo is tempted by the One Ring? What does that even mean? Yawn. I mean what is more important, that you know who everybody is and what they want out of life when they’re only going to get killed later anyway or is it better to spend time listening to people saying “Iron Forge” and “Stormwind” and “the Guardian is summoned” and “the magic is death to all things”? Which rocks more? I think you already know. Who cares what the Guardian is or what he does for a job or why the magic is death. It just is. You can tell because the movie is very serious about everything. Like no one makes any jokes. Except when they call guns “boomsticks” that sounds like it’s not even part of this movie like maybe it came from somewhere else that doesn’t quite match up with the serious feeling that Warcraft has. But that’s okay I guess. The synopsis: Orcs are invading human lands because the orc place is dying because of magic or something. And the humans have to stop them. Also magicians are mostly bad. I like that Warcraft knows that even in a fantasy realm the world is run by white guys, so this gives me hope for the future. I may not be a jock or a brain but as long as I’m a white guy, I’ll be okay. I like when movies make me feel good like that. There’s this one scene where the King who is of course played by a white dude called Dominic Cooper and his army leader guy who is played by another white dude called Travis Fimmel are arguing about military tactics and there’s like a black guy and an Asian guy and maybe another not-white guy standing around listening, but they don’t get to talk. It’s like Yes you are men, you guys, but you’re not white, so you don’t get to be in charge or make decisions. That’s just the way it is. I mean let’s be realistic about this. Who would you trust to fight invading orcs from another dimension who are using magic against us? I think we all know the answer to that. Naturally because this is a movie there’s pretty ladies here to look at, but they’re not like major characters or anything because they are mostly just there to support the men like in the real world. There’s the beautiful Queen who inspires soldiers and an orc wife who has a baby and gives the main orc guy something to fight for. This is important because men need something to fight for and also to know that someone will fuck him when he comes home. Of course there has to be one badass warrior babe, and she’s kinda hot cuz she’s green like that slave girl on Star Trek, and even though she’s half orc she’s still hot. Like her orc tusks aren’t gross or anything and you could still kiss her. It’s kinda weird though because mostly the orcs aren’t green, they have normal white skin, only a few orcs are green. But the hot orc chick is played by a black actress called Paula Patton so I think maybe this is like a racial commentary. Like even orcs have racism. Think about it. There’s also a thing where a baby orc is put in a river like Moses which really makes you think. Also a lot of people have bare feet a lot of time which I think is meaningful but I’m not sure how yet. It’s symbolism. I will probably have to see Warcraft at least 10 times to figure it out. In conclusion, Warcraft is so totally freakin’ mint that I give it 19.5 sides of a 20-sided dice. The only thing that might have made this movie even better is if Rush did the soundtrack. Though really Rush might be too deep for this so they might not be a good match. But it would awesome to try. I think when Warcraft comes out on VHS I will borrow it from the library and play it with the volume turned down and crank like “Distant Early Warning” and see how that works. It could be cool. You had me at 1987, but lost me at no female major characters.  In the few moments we have before the WOW horde breaks through the gates, I would like to ask a serious question.  Would you prefer if the movie only had white actors?  By that I mean, I enjoyed two of the Lord of the Ring movies, and strangely the lack of nonwhite extras/side characters didn’t really bother me (you could say they were being faithful to the books, but it would have been easy to toss in a nonwhite actor or two in a minor role).  In some ways, a movie like this one that has nonwhite characters who are relegated to the sidelines is more annoying because it reinforces a kind of racial hierarchy.  I know that makes no logical sense, because obviously it is better for nonwhites to be represented if only in some small way and for those actors to get work.  However, it somehow feels worse to see someone ignored or marginalized than it does to never see them at all.  Clearly this is not a good movie in many many ways, but would making all of the characters white have made you less aware of and/or annoyed by the fact that this world was run by white guys? would making all of the characters white have made you less aware of and/or annoyed by the fact that this world was run by white guys? Do you really need to ask that? Or is what you’re really asking is this: Why don’t I complain about the lack of white people onscreen more? Yes, that is what I’m getting at.  It’s interesting that the intermediate steps seem to cause more mental friction than the initial status quo state of all white dudes, for me at least.  The comparison is not apt, because of course the LotR movies have so much more going for them when it comes to storytelling and acting that it’s easy to forgive the all white cast, or at least to point out that it’s problematic but not to the point that it ruins the film. I guess my question is, was the marginalization of the nonwhite characters more apparent because this was such a terrible movie?  This review made me realize that there are lots of movies with all white casts that don’t really bother me because I am entertained and just plain used to it at this point.  That’s disturbing because I feel as though I should be more aware of that kind of imbalance. On a lighter note, it took ovaries of steel to post this review.  Video games (for a lot of people, THE video game), nerds, feminism, LotR, racism, the only internet combustible missing is religion.  This is about to get super crazy – I’m talkin’ every Bingo box on the board checked multiple times crazy.  Have fun! The specific scene I mentioned in the review is particularly egregious in its marginalization. It’s like Duncan Jones realized that his film was blazingly white but didn’t really know how to fix the problem. So in this instance, the terribleness and the marginalization are bound up together. Yeah, it’s fun for us on the sidelines to watch trolls flail impotently, but I imagine it’s less enjoyable when you’re the one they’re attacking. And so much less enjoyable to have to think of some way to respond, at least to some, when they allow for it. I’m sure it got excruciating long ago. At least this is a nice chance to compare the average amount and type of negative attention female reviewers get with the average amount/type of negative attention their male counterparts receive.  This movie in particular is an ideal test case because the flaws are so obvious that the complaints and critiques in the negative reviews I’ve read so far have been fairly similar. At least this is a nice chance to compare the average amount and type of negative attention female reviewers get with the average amount/type of negative attention their male counterparts receive.  Oh definitely – everyone here knows what the results will be.  But this will provide another concrete example that is easily verifiable.  Sometimes, anti-feminists challenge me to provide examples of unequal treatment, but the best examples are movies with a lot of negative reviews (sadly, you need a ton of negative reviews to get a decent sample size of female critics) which I don’t typically remember or watch in the first place.  I will eventually watch this one (for free) if only to see the scene you mentioned above.  Hopefully, it is MST3K worthy and not just bland bad.  My least favorite part of playing modern video games is sitting through unskippable cutscenes (which is why I skipped all of Hardcore Henry) so this one will probably feel like torture. After skimming all the reviews and their corresponding comments sections, my predictions appear to have been overblown.  There’s a lot less ad hominem and fewer personal attacks than I was expecting.  Perhaps it’s because many of the diehard fans of WOW/Warcraft are middle aged?  Maybe this is so bad that even the most  hotheaded nerds don’t feel like wasting the energy to defend it?  Unlike Deadpool, Warcraft lost its cool cred a long, long, long time ago.
The strangest comment I’ve seen so far is one angrily reproaching Sheri Linden at The Hollywood Reporter for not knowing enough lore, the twist being that she gave the movie one of its few positive recommendations.  Overall though not too bad.  I’m surprised but happy to have been wrong (we’ll see if things change on Friday) – I’m super curious to find out what will happen in a month when Ghostbusters 3 releases.   If it’s as widely panned as this, there won’t be much beyond a brief period of gloating, but if it’s mediocre or better, there’s a good chance for some interesting discussions. I have read many of your reviews, but this is my first time commenting. You have described yourself many times in your reviews as a “geek” or a “nerd” – you claim to love fantasy, superheroes, and everything else. Well, madame, you are neither.
Your painting of teenage boys who love fantasy as monosyllabic, droning morons who don’t have any interest in anything beyond “what’s cool” demonstrates that you have absolutely no understanding of, or respect for, geek cultures. The teenage boys who grew up in the 80s with Frank Frazetta posters in their rooms were the kind of people who had imaginations, stayed up all night reading the fantasy novels, and actually DID care about storytelling. These teenage boys, who you mock with such obnoxious, condescending fervor, ARE the people who sat around discussing the type of food that hobbits liked for breakfast and went off into tangents about the nature of evil in fiction. When I was in highschool, I had more complex discussions about storytelling and the nature of fantasy with them than I could ever have with a pretentious nob who looks down on younger people and claims that they don’t have the intellectual capacity to understand Lord of the Rings. These are the people who keep fantasy/geek culture alive – they’re the ones creating the new Star Wars films, the Marvel films, Scott Pilgrim, and any other great piece of nerd culture that’s come out in the last decade. So congratulations – these boys you mock are the ones who are keeping a genre you claim to love going. There’s nothing inherently wrong with liking something just because it’s awesome (something you don’t seem to understand), but you don’t even begin to give lovers of fantasy enough credit. Oh, excuse me…you don’t give BOYS enough credit. I’m sure you think teenage girls who read Lord of the Rings one time are the pinnacle of human intelligence. For someone who seems so concerned with how women are portrayed in fiction, you have a disgustingly sexist view of real-world men. Also, by the way, Frank Frazetta is one of the greatest fantasy artists of all time. So your comparison of this film to his art, clearly meant as an insult, is something that most people would consider a compliment. Way to go.
I also love the fact that you dragged racial/sexual politics into a review of a film that clearly has nothing to do with either. Here’s a news flash for you: if you adapt a fantasy film created by white people with a heavy basis in European mythology, IT’S GOING TO HAVE WHITE PEOPLE IN IT. You use Lord of the Rings as a comparison. Guess what? There aren’t any black or Asian leaders in those stories in any sense. And here’s another news flash: geeks don’t care about race or gender. They care about mythology. They care about story. Is your entire judgement of fantasy based on whether or not it ticks certain social justice warrior boxes? You seem like the type of person who has an orgasm every time you see a trailer for the new (awful) Ghostbusters film.
And your assumption that only white teenage boys could like something such as Warcraft also betrays yet another misunderstanding of geek culture: most of the women in my life – brilliant, creative people – love this type of fantasy just as much as, if not more so, than the men in my life. I have female friends who love Warcraft, and love Lord of the Rings, because the mythology of both is immersive and imaginative. Most of the creative/artistic/story-centric people that I know are women. And unlike you, they actually have an appreciation for geek culture and don’t slap the label on themselves because they think it will make them popular.
So, to sum up, because I’ve probably lost you: You claim to love geeks and understand fantasy yet have no respect for the group of people most responsible for keeping geek culture alive. You, as a feminist, are extremely dismissive and disgustingly sexist toward teenage boys, but that’s ok because they’re boys. You drag racial/gender politics into films that have nothing to do with either, and make awful assumptions about what boys think of these issues when you do so. You mock one of the great fantasy artists as some fetishistic idiot, despite his influence on a culture that you claim to love. So, with all of this information, there are only two possible outcomes:
1. You are a troll, and you spew stupid, ignorant nonsense because you hate fantasy and want to perpetuate negative stereotypes about it.
2. You are so monumentally, catastrophically stupid that your ability to type coherent sentences is nothing short of a miracle.
Either way, you are an absolute disgrace to a culture that you claim to represent. And since you’re clearly too stupid to understand this, I’ll spell it out slowly: if you call me a “troll” or call me a “misogynist,” or any other such term that you love to throw around like confetti, you’re essentially proving that I’m right. And the fact that you call yourself a “flick filosopher” and pretend that you know ANYTHING about philosophical discourse is laughable. So I’ll leave you with a quote from “A Fish Called Wanda” that I think sums you up perfectly:
“You think you’re an intellectual, don’t you, ape?”
“Apes don’t read philosophy.”
“Yes they do, Otto. They just don’t understand it.” That response would be more warranted if your condescension toward male fantasy fans/tendency toward pretentious, self-important ranting about race and gender weren’t so heavily recurring in so many of your “reviews.” If you’re angry about what you see as condescension in my review, then you need to be angry at the movie, because that sort of caricature of male nerd-dom is who the movie is aimed at. If you do care about what hobbits eat for breakfast, you’re probably going to hate this movie, because it completely misunderstands what fantasy fans like. Spoken like someone for whom race and gender issues are not a problem. Congrats on your privilege. You don’t like what I have to say about movies, there are hundreds of other critics to choose from. And most of them are white and male. No, actually, I don’t, because that is not who this movie is aimed at. It’s aimed at fans of the game’s mythology. Many of whom are women. And if you were actually a geek, you would understand that. The fact that you assume that of this movie, and of its fans, lies in you projecting your own prejudices. I’m not here to debate whether or not the movie is good – it’s probably not. But that’s not the point. Ah, the moldy “privilege” chestnut. In fact, I do care about race and gender issues, thank you. The problem is that YOU see these problems where they don’t exist. For instance, your review of the “Angry Birds Movie” magically transformed a children’s film about exploding avians into a demonstration of male superiority and an attack on feminism. How does a person even connect those two dots? How delusional and out-of-touch do you have to be in order to read that message into a freaking Angry Birds movie? Between this review and that, I also noticed how many of your articles are sarcastically written from the perspective of straw-man idiots…just so you know, over-reliance on sarcasm is another indicator that you’re not nearly as smart as you think you are. Who’s the one acting like a teenager now?
And again – “There are hundreds of other critics to choose from. And most of them are white and male.” – Very nice. You harp in endless self-righteousness about how women and people of color are treated unfairly, and many of them are, yet here you are making assumptions about my attitude toward others because I’m a white man (the horror!), because I had the AUDACITY to point out the fact that you’re a pretentious hypocrite. I don’t give a shit what race or gender a person or character is. You, on the other hand, seem to care very much. My god you people are obnoxious. Yes, both of you. jason, I agreed with you up until like the last sixth or so of your original comment, that was just blatantly baiting the author and you came off as really bitter and troll-like. Like, fucking ad hominem dude. Jesus. And then MaryAnn is at once winning and losing this, which I lowkey admire. I legitemately laughed out loud at the whole notallgeeks thing, that was very good. And then props for referencing colbert, colbert is the shit. But in terms of like actual points, the only one you really made was “If you’re angry about what you see as condescension in my review, then you need to be angry at the movie, because that sort of caricature of male nerd-dom is who the movie is aimed at. “, which is sort of a derailment. You also in that same response said “Congrats on your privilege”, which is an equally obnoxious, if a bit more subtle, ad hominem attack intended to bait your opponent. And this article, my god was it infuriating. Imagine a MRA doing his own caricature of what a SJW would like, say as a review of the new ghostbusters movie, and then acting as if something you’re very interested in is an integral part of that stereotype. It would be a really shitty thing to do, and it would honestly make more legitemate points than this article. The only thing you’ve done here is satisfy your own shitty stereotype. But like this whole contentious encounter, not even worthy of being called an argument, is like a perfect microcosm for how the debate between your two sides generally goes on the internet, in that it doesn’t go at all. Can we please all just stop with the stereotyping and the straw manning and the “the other side is actually sexist/privileged”, with the goddamn outrage, whether at people blaming rape victims or shit on r/tumblrinaction. None of this is ever going to be straightened out if you guys keep demonizing each other and talking past each other and seeing each other as deluded or sexist or somehow less intelligent because they happen to subscribe to a different goddamn view! Just imagine a world in which everybody is like equal, and people who disagree with you do so because of perfectly rational reasons. Or even better, imagine a world in which the only way to ever know that you’re right is to honestly, politely, and considerately debate the opposing side, honestly trying your hardest to see their view. Oh wait, that’s the world we actually live in, something which the majority of the internet just doesn’t seem to be able to fucking grasp! Apologies if that last part was obnoxious and baity, Noah. I did go too far there. But frankly, I think that there are some occasions where people deserve to be called out on their bullshit as bluntly as possible. I mean, I’m arguing with a person whose best response to criticism is to ignore every statement made and post a fucking gif of Colbert instead. You in fact did NOT go to far. You pointed out her hypocrisy, and you did not resort to ad hominems. Heck ad hominems are not even fallacious so long as the accusation is true – which in this case, it would be. Great respect for speaking out. I just wish MaryAnn actually tried to listen to opposing arguments without dismissing them for “angry privileged white men”. This is ridiculous. Good on you man, good on you. It’s always nice to have a neutral party step in and speak a bit rationally to put things in perspective. Though I honestly think these trite labels that the internet loves to throw apply onto people are one of the biggest causes of issue. Discussion online and in the real world would be so much more rational if they didn’t exist. That’s why I don’t subscribe to labels and communities myself. Apparently there’s such a thing now as an “Anti-SJW.” Why? Why must having a certain viewpoint always be diluted into cheap titles? It completely devalues the complexity of the human mind and lumps individuals into generalizations with which they may or may not entirely agree with. It limits rational discussion. You actually used the “check your privilege” defense unironically. Congrats. And you used it on someone who’s personal life and upbringing you haven’t the slightest knowledge of, making it completely baseless and accusatory. “You don’t like what I have to say about movies, there are hundreds of other critics to choose from. And most of them are white and male.” I’d like to actually see a source for such a bold claim, and not simply anecdotal evidence. Even if that were the case, most of these “white and male” reviewers hated this film that’s supposedly appealing to them anyway. I have been rather bothered by this whole thread (and this is not only the first time I have read your critiques, but also my first time commenting).  I may be white, male, and born in the 1980’s (well, actually, 1980- and while I played Warcraft 2, I never really went beyond it and honestly was a part of a roleplaying community on MMORPGs that looked down on World of Warcraft) – but my wife is 19, Dutch, and a ‘geek’ herself not by self-proclamation but simply because of the things she enjoys.  She has a very neutral perspective and tries to be fair- and she is as much bothered by feminists who seem to want not equality but superiority over men, as she is by men who are the same way.  I also have a friend who is a tried and true ‘geek’ who is African-American and into things like Warcraft.  I will be bringing him to see the movie- on my dime- just so I can get his legitimate, African-American Geek response to your opinions about ‘racism’ in this movie. I will also be taking my wife this weekend.  I read your entire discussion, beyond this point, to her- and she was quite bothered by what you had to say.  We saw “Angry Birds” together- it was a boring and definitely sub-par film- but hearing that you tied it into gender… that shocked her to the point of laughing.  Keep in mind that my wife is again from a culture that is generally past many of those issues we still ‘grapple with’ here- she was raised by a mother who cut her daughter’s hair short and encouraged them not to be bound by stereotypes, she was put into boy’s PE in school and beat many of them in sports.  Her family, and in many ways culture, is VERY supportive of gender equality- and she herself had to run from her mother’s scissors (to grow her hair long) and decided that while she loves climbing trees and sports, and geeky guy talk, she also loves wearing dresses and being feminine.  I think she more than qualifies to speak to the female side of all this. So just upon hearing your criticisms of Warcraft’s movie, she did not seem to find a lot of basis in them just from what you said alone- though she is looking forwards to the movie herself and plans to see it, and herself enjoyed Lord of the Rings, discusses quantum physics for fun with me, speaks four languages, reads hieroglyphics, and can recite from memory details about American, European, and ancient Egyptian history and culture (not because that is her area of training- just because she grew up loving archeology). I grew up ashamed of my gender, in a cultural associating masculinity with negative emotions and actions and femininity with the postive- it took me decades to finally realise that some very hurtful, negative things were very true of women as well (not to mention loosing my son to one I loved dearly, who once insulted me as being ‘disgustingly weak’ because of my gentleness) and that there were very positive ways to be masculine as well.  I also grew up feeling shame for my skin colour- white- and constantly apologising, because of my genetics alone, to African Americans.  For the fact I was born into a middle class family- one my father worked to build from a poor coal mining family, all the way through medical school by hard work and brains alone, when he used to eat old bananas from trash cans as a kid for a treat in the 1940’s South.  He became a Colonel in the medical corps of the US Army, and helped many children heal from abusive parents and families as a child psychiatrist.  His ex wife left him, committing adultery and leaving him at the edge of suicide- before he rebuilt his life, blamed by many simply for being a man as at fault.  His ex, whatever she said, was believed- and he refused to shame her. So listen- I know there are people out there from both sides who are idiots, and jerks.  But that doesn’t give us an excuse to be one back, or to shift tables not just towards equality, but towards superiority.  I know, for a fact, there are women out there who use the common perception of men and women to their advantage to hurt men… I know, because I was in a power-and-control abuse relationship where my fear of ever being controlling myself, was used to dominate and manipulate me.  It took me years to heal and recover, and an amazing and loving wife from outside my own culture to help me finish doing so. I don’t want my son growing up thinking he is less because he is a man, or because he is white.  I don’t think ANYTHING justifies making people think they are less simply for their genetics- their gender, their race, etc.  A group of women can be in a restaurant and make horrible jokes about how men are pigs and deserve to be put in their place- and people nearby might even laugh.  Yet if men said in a restaurant here  that women were stupid and needed to be taught lessons- they’d not only make people upset, someone just might walk over and yell at them for it. That’s not equality.  That’s reverse-prejudice.  Just be careful that in ‘fighting’ for women you don’t end up seeing ghosts in every shadow, and destroying innocent people in the process. My wife and I are fantasy lovers- I don’t expect great things out of Warcraft, though I look forwards to some interesting effects.  However, I also seriously doubt that it will be any more offensive than most of the Hollywood movies that come out constantly.  In a world where any movie now will be attacked for being mostly white, or mostly male… yet the opposite is just fine… well, I see a bleak future ahead.  Human beings have so much trouble finding balance. It’s sad that in the midst of a revolution of inclusivity in media, we apparently aren’t allowed to like anything that “white male nerds” would traditionally like, because I guess that’s just not allowed. Criticize poor filmmaking, poor characterization, bad cinematography, etc, but there’s really no reason to denigrate audiences because you’ve decided their combination of sex and race isn’t okay (nevermind the fact that that audience is a lot more diverse than you are giving it credit for). Have you ever complained that a film is formulaic or based on clichés? Stereotypes about women and minorities are a type of cliché—although they’re also connected to heated social issues, of course—so it’s possible to get irritated by them just on basic aesthetic grounds. Does anyone else not tell people about their geeky interests anymore because of the unsavory crowd it tends to attract? Does everybody else lie about their personal tastes on their online dating profiles so they don’t get matched with geeks? Or is that just me? I think you mean “not MOST geeks.” As a long-time fantasy fan I wanted to say most of what Jacob said as I was reading. Thanks for saving me the trouble Jacob. Regardless of whether or not your disdain for this film is warranted, your portrayal of a geek is way off the mark. I consider myself as a geek, but I didn’t read this as MaryAnn saying that all geeks — or even a majority of them — think this way. This was more aimed at the extreme examples like those involved with Gamergate or the Rabid Puppies who hang around with one another in online forums and complain bitterly how girl stuff or liberal stuff is ruining their games/SF/fantasy or ruining their childhoods. (sigh) Let me rephrase. Geeks care about whether or not source material that they love is adapted properly. They don’t care what race or gender original characters are. Have you noticed how thoroughly the geek community embraced Mad Max: Fury Road and Star Wars Episode VII? How much love both of those have gotten over the past year? The Marvel fanboys who complained last year that Johnny Storm was black in Fant4stic are the exact same people complaining now that The Ancient One is white in Dr. Strange. And remember how much love Black Panther got after Civil War was released? People were talking about how awesome he was almost as much as Spider-Man. Or how excited everyone was about Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman? Geeks don’t sit around thinking “Oh man, I hope this movie only has white dudes in it,” which the author of this article seems to imply. Geeks freak out when filmmakers make changes to something that we grew up with (which is understandable), but we don’t give a shit what a character is when they are introduced for the first time or adapted faithfully. An eye for an eye, and you guys clearly aren’t interested in returning the favor, so no. I COULD reply with a sarcastic tumblr meme though, since you guys seem to consider that genuine argumentation around these parts. Projection thy name is Lenina Crowne. Just because YOU care so much about race and gender – because you’re a racist and sexist – doesn’t mean you have to project your immoral views onto other people, and certainly not people you have never, nor will ever meet. You are literally so racist and sexist, that you assume everyone else is. So just because there is NO Mary Sue’s in this movie and possibly NO Bro-mance, the FemiNazi’s are ALL up in arms? phhhst :P
It must have failed the Bechdel Test? Do you think that, just perhaps, some people simply have an issue with the toxic community that has slowly surrounded a just cause? And not the cause itself? It’s an honest question, though, and there are plenty of fair and well-spoken youtubers that I could recommend that discuss their disdain towards the current SJW culture. Human ideologies aren’t split conveniently by a clear line and arbitrary labels. She’s assuming that Jacob Redmon is a white man because he said, “I’m a white man.” There are also many examples of angry white men out in the world, and it’s reasonable for her to mention them here, especially when the film is filled with stereotypes about race and gender. If you have examples of substantive, well-reasoned arguments in favor of this film, or intelligent critiques of the “SJW” movement, you’re welcome to provide them here. There certainly haven’t been any on this thread so far. Congratulations for being so perceptive, Daniel. Lots of angry people livin’ out there in the world. Not like its a natural human trait or anything. The film looks like garbage, I’m not intending to defend it. Also, there certainly have been intelligent critiques here. In fact, Noah Goble’s comment just a few convos above us was very reasonable and constructive. The correction is there aren’t any that you agree with, you are the creator of the extremely inclusive bingo card after all. I’m not going to try to convince you of the state of over-compensative progressive culture. Not just because I don’t think you would genuinely consider it, but also because a bunch of Youtubers have already done it for me. So I’d rather point you towards some channels that deconstruct this stuff. I’d personally recommend Shoe0nHead, tl;dr, Blaire White, Vernaculis. Armoured Skeptic is also good for his modern feminism and social justice videos. Check some of them out, completely dismiss their positions, continue to ignore similar mindsets, but at least you’ll have an understanding of the issues. Thoughtful reading, prior to typing up a reply, isn’t really Josh’s strong suit. That, more than the abundant awfulness of his replies, is why I finally put him on my kill list. When he first started posting comments on this site, he’d start out with one halfway-reasonable point and then follow it with two or three arguments that made no sense at all. I now miss those days. He had this sort of pseudo-intellectual thing going, even if it was based on other people’s bad ideas. Now he’s going full wharblgarbl, and getting testy when other people don’t respect his precious precious words. Adorbs. When George W. Bush left office, I thought, “At least we know presidential candidates can’t get any worse. We’ve hit rock bottom.” I should have known. I felt the same way about this thread, and then I was accused of being a KKK sympathizer. And that was before “Mark” started posting this morning. (His comments were deleted, but they’ll probably show up on the “gendered abuse” thread.) Mark was “natural habit” dude, yeah? I trust he’s packed his bags for his masculinist utopia, and wish only for the screen door not to hit him in the ass on the way out. I don’t think it was Marc Esadrian. I only got a quick glance at the comments before they were deleted, but this guy seemed to be ten times angrier, and ten times more sexist, than any of the MRAs who usually post here. We’ll find out if the comments ever make it over to the “gendered abuse” thread. I was going to suggest that we start a drinking game based on this thread, but that would require that the comments make some sort of basic sense, and most of them don’t. I don’t even have a Twitter account. That’s not me. That’s pretty excessive to go out of your way to prove it though, as if it somehow devalues all of my points that you refuse to even acknowledge. Also, the reason I singled out the race/gender accusation wasn’t because it was untrue, but because you felt it was a relevant counter-argument in the first place. Do you attempt to discover the race and gender of every person who dissents as a way to determine if their opinions merit respect? What if it’s a white male but they were once a female? Do they have inherited privilege, or do they retain their feminine oppression? Where is the line drawn? Then I stand corrected. But you’re still using a man’s name as your handle, so I’ll stand by my contention that you are either a man or you are pretending to be. Your question about trans people is a good one, and a complicated one. And completely irrelevant to how some white men gets pissed off when their privilege is pointed out. And since when is it a good way to judge people based off of their skin? To “pretend” like a white man. As if this is supposed to mean something. Was it not MLK who said “I dream that one day we will live in a nation where they will NOT be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”
You are completely neglecting this, whilst being what I’m sure you’re so very much against. I don’t think you actually listened to that speech, let alone anything else King aver said about anything. (Except the things that sound kinda racist against white people. Be you got that shit memorized.) You’re a white female, the most privileged group in the western world. Everyone kowtows to your feelings and coddles you every which way and that. All you do is jump in on the bandwagon of minorities and try to ride the victimhood gravy train. But who’s going to challenge the privilege of white ginger females who make a living critiquing movies? Never mind, I’m sure your life has been so, so tough. It makes sense that you turned out to be such a c***. Didn’t have a choice. Alternatively it’s just a crappy review.  Warcraft is created by the type of people who would have a Frazetta poster which are pretty darn amazing pieces of art.  Somehow you consider being compared to beautiful fantasy art to be an insult.  I’m going to give you the benefit of doubt and guess you have at least played wow if not the original warcraft.  If so you should know the story is pretty much set in stone.  Frankly you seem to be the kind of person who many people escaped to fantasy realms to avoid; however now geek is cool so you have to at least pretend to like it.  TBH it’s rather disgusting. It does belong to men, we just allow you to live among us. If you want to know what it would be like if men wanted to treat you like animals, look to the middle-east – women in their natural state. Get a better spokesperson that actually represents what they claim to and isn’t a total fraud. Post one of those insanely progressive tumblr memes of pricks drinking “male tears” while you’re at it. Will still check this out and get some entertainment that’s specifically designed to hit my Warcraft-player brain. But it’s what I’m afraid of already.  Jones and Co. made a fan movie that’s got all the stuff that your average gamer wants, but lacks in just about every other department. I think there are other stories in WoW’s long history that may have been more worth telling than this one, but I guess these things are always made with visions of franchise-building.  My big fear is what MaryAnn said earlier and that the film takes itself very seriously, which I feel is a miscalculation from the filmmakers.  The tone, game-wise, has always been fun despite some of its aspects being somewhat brutal and dire.  Again, to try and tell an epic-scale story like this is such a tall order I almost wish they chose to focus more on the orc story.  I know they want a balance between factions, but to tell a smaller story better… I would have liked that.  But it may have felt more like something the new Planet of the Apes movies are already doing better. There are examples out there of games that push narrative.  It’s still being argued over as an art form and gaming is definitely going through some sea changes in that department.  WoW is honestly pretty much a Skinner box anyway, with aspects cribbed from just about every classic fantasy story.  Thrall (the baby orc) has a pretty interesting story, as does Arthas and his fall from grace… But I think it all suffers from games being a relatively young art form still getting its narrative footing.  Things that are forgivable when you’re controlling an avatar in the game world are missing something when their stories are translated to another medium. Writers are failing though, if they can’t fill those gaps. But I guess to answer your question, particularly in WoW’s case… I’m not really sure. :)  Like I said, so much cribbing going on in the game that it feels like snippets, and that bare-minimum of material can be enough to make a gamer go “Yeah, Gul’dan, I saw that guy in my game and there he is in the movie”… I’m sure the filmmakers’ aspirations are higher, but that may be all we’ve really got with this film. But the established story in the game is the base they’re working with.  Once they’re in the movie world, they need to fill the gaps in storytelling that the game doesn’t bother with. What is sufficient in a videogame narrative completely flops when it’s a movie.  It’s the failure to translate and flesh-out what’s essentially a skin-and-bones narrative skeleton. That’s why I’m expecting to see some cool locales on film that I’ve been virtually romping around in for the last decade, but also feeling disappointed that there’s not much there to make a compelling movie. Here’s the thing I don’t really get. We’ve been romping through these locals for, literally, decades. Why does anyone need a bad movie translation? It’s not even like a book-to-film adaptation, where you could argue artistic merit in the visualization. Video games are already a visual medium. Pretty much. I’ve often wondered why it’s considered so important to make the movie based on the whatever, when that whatever is satisfying in its original medium.  MONEY is probably the obvious answer.  I guess in the end all the artistic misfires are worth it when you do get something truly inspired. That’s why I would have liked the idea of a story inspired by the game, rather than just a retelling of the lore which is not that exciting.  But I imagine that’s more difficult than adaptation. These really are questions that speak to why movies based on video games generally fail.  I think gamers do want real character and story, or at least think they do.  Games deliver  their narrative in different ways than a film does, and that may mask deficiencies in the way they tell stories.  Then again, the games that have real narrative are outnumbered by those that are just shoot-em-ups. We know a movie like DOOM is going to have only the bare minimum of components to get it off the ground.  Do we want to know the back story of the space marine in DOOM or do we just want to watch him kill demons? With something like Warcraft, there’s a little more conventionally there and it’s more disappointing when it fails to execute. If it’s light and treated as such, it’s forgivable, but Warcraft aspires to loftiness which may exceed its grasp. Blizzard’s new game universe, Overwatch, should be interesting to watch over the next few years.  It’s positioned as a very Marvel-esque world with 20+ “heroes”.  They’ve created five animated Pixar-like shorts that have fans clamoring for a full-length feature. But, even with these cinematics, the characters are still mere sketches and it’s a writer’s job to find that tale worth telling.  It’s promising, but I’m not holding my breath. It definitely has potential but the pitfalls that hamstring Warcraft are there too. Maybe the solution is to not adapt a game’s narrative, which is pretty flimsy to begin with, but make a new story in that game’s universe that has depth and explores modern issues.  You know, like really good fantasy/scifi does. MaryAnn, what did you make of Garona’s character? Myself and my SO felt she was actually the main character of the story (a complete arc, fish-out-of-water protagonist in the second act). It was also a pleasant surprise too see her give the film a Bechdel-test passing conversation with Ruth Negga’s character. Not something we expect from this kind of movie. That’s where I think it may have been a better idea to focus on Durotan’s story and flesh that out.  I understand the original script was more human-centric. But the orcs really seem to be the only thing of note that could help the film stand apart from others of its type. I can definitely see that working as well, if not better, than the final film’s plot. I think ultimately this film is hamstrung by having to stay largely faithful to the incredibly utilitarian plot of a game from 1994. It’s not an awful plot but it does force the film to have a Lothar-Khadgar buddycop adventure to uncover Medivh’s true nature. There’s just not enough time in 2 hours to address that, Durotan’s rebellion, and leave enough room to fully flesh-out the roster of characters. Duncan Jones has talked of 40 minutes of cut footage and his desire to release a director’s cut. I think it’s a safe bet that that’s where all the character development went. I never said it came even close to that goal. But there’s a very wide gulf between that and a film being the sexist schlock you are calling it. I just don’t see the point in constructing a really ignorant strawman (‘Warcraft is so totally freakin’ mint that I give it 19.5 sides of a 20-sided dice’… Ugh, really? Who says that?) for the purposes of your review just so you can pretend that this is some kind of hateful, basement dweller movie. I mean come on, the film at least *tries* to avoid the tropes (no battle-bras, no male-gaze camera angles, earnest attempt to pass the Bechdel test.) You can hate the film for the failings that are there but I see no point in inventing new failings. E.g ‘…there’s pretty ladies here to look at…’ is clearly supposed to make the film sound like the female characters are just there for titillation. Except it doesn’t add up: there’s an orc, a half-orc slave who wears more clothes than her captors (and is completely covered by the second act) and a queen in a very modest dress. My bar isn’t that low. Sorry. The mere lack of naked women is far from enough for me to give a movie a pass. And a very few women in mostly very cliched roles is far from the only problem with this movie. It’s kinda the exact opposite of white privilege that leads me to complain that the female character played by a black woman is completely undeveloped as a character. I hope you don’t mind me pointing out some things that make me question your writing regarding this particular movie?
Mainly with the following parts.  “Naturally because this is a movie there’s pretty ladies here to look at, but they’re not like major characters or anything because they are mostly just there to support the men like in the real world.” Moral is actually very important in these kind of settings where soldiers actually need to get pretty close to their opponent at the risk of getting their head smashed in. Also she bonds with the female half orc slave as to help her get accustomed to the new environment. I believe that this cannot be underestimated give the female half orc was a valuable asset during the final battle. Then you state the following a bit later:
“and an orc wife who has a baby and gives the main orc guy something to fight for. This is important because men need something to fight for and also to know that someone will fuck him when he comes home.”
You did see that she went to battle with him, right? Of course, since she was pregnant she wasn’t much use but it must have been apparant in the movie that female orcs fight just as good (if not better) than their male brethren? Let’s continue:
“Of course there has to be one badass warrior babe, and she’s kinda hot cuz she’s green like that slave girl on Star Trek, and even though she’s half orc she’s still hot. Like her orc tusks aren’t gross or anything and you could still kiss her.”
Damn true, can’t argue with that. Next up:
“It’s kinda weird though because mostly the orcs aren’t green, they have normal white skin, only a few orcs are green. But the hot orc chick is played by a black actress called Paula Patton so I think maybe this is like a racial commentary. Like even orcs have racism. Think about it.”
You did actually watch the movie right? I mean it’s actually explained in the movie why MOST (not a few, again, you did watch it, did you?) are green and only a FEW are not green but the natural light brown color. Regarding the following paragraph:
“There’s also a thing where a baby orc is put in a river like Moses which really makes you think.”
I guess the director really went that cliche route but we’ll have to see in the next installment if he really is the “Moses” but I believe you are assuming a bit too much with this.
I do not see a reason why borrowing this from a plethora of other movies is such a bad thing either, not really original but it’s not like it’s strange, is it? About this paragraph then:
“Also a lot of people have bare feet a lot of time which I think is meaningful but I’m not sure how yet. It’s symbolism.”
You did watch the movie, right? I mean, you do realize they are orcs? right? Or am I missing some other barefooted persons? Maybe our MC that was drunk? Have you ever see drunk people? You do realize some drunk people do stupid things while they are drunk? Moral is actually very important in these kind of settings where soldiers actually need to get pretty close to their opponent at the risk of getting their head smashed in.  And you did see where the only reason there is any focus on her in that scene is so she can give birth, and then after that she does nothing but literally sit around in their tent and Be Supportive? Well she’s just given birth. What’s she going to do, abandon her only child? She does also put a knife to the throat of a leading male character and later competently protects her child and herself (sort of, lol) without anyone’s assistance. Sure, she doesn’t have a lot to do in this movie, she is after all a minor character, but it’s laughably disingenuous to claim that all she does is give birth and be supportive to her husband. I don’t know about all that, but I’m 50 and Latino and I found this review to be sexist and racist.  Imagine if it read “Latino female middle aged nerd” or the like. You’re missing the point.  The point is that the title and the review itself were racist and sexist.  I’m 50, Latino, and I enjoy movies of all kinds, including movies about video games.  The title and review make it sound that just because I’m Latino, I can’t possibly like movies that white people like.  I hate that kind of racist segregationist garbage. The review is making fun of a very particular type of person, someone who’s so delusional he thinks the world—and the entertainment industry—revolves around him. And because he’s white and male, he thinks it’s perfectly normal for the major characters in the movie to be white men, and for the women to be stereotypes and eye candy. He also has terrible taste in movies, and hates films with any sort of subtlety or complexity. If you like the same sorts of movies he does, you should probably worry. Unfortunately, people like him really do exist in the world, even though it’s not 1987. You can find them on the Internet, complaining about SJWs, and about this review. And you can find those who write reviews like this, and agree with such reviews at KKK rallies and in all-white trailer parks.    If you like and agree with this review, you just might be as white and as racist as the writer. I’m sorry that you’re not as deeply indulged in the lore surrounding the actual reasons for green and “white” orcs (I have seen them more commonly referred to as brown). Perhaps I’ve lost myself in your unending depths of sarcasm, which I hope you’ll forgive me for, but I’d like to clarify that the origin of orcs is that they are all brown (or white, as you say). The only reason they are green is because they are corrupted by fel magic.
Now I’m not sure if you just blatantly decided to ignore the OP’s mentioning that the movie explained all this. The green orcs literally have demon blood flowing in their veins, and yet were once brown orcs before. I’ll have to admit, I’m going to be severely disappointed if you claim this to be racism. I fail to see any racism or bigotry in a few heroic orcs trying to return their kin back to their sustainable, peaceful ways, and away from the addictive, bloodlust-inducing demon blood that happens to make their skin green. The very essence of the endeavor is purely compassionate. The story is not of a domineering oppressor or a race claiming to be superior inherently; in many ways, it documents a desperate attempt to provide a road to rehabilitation. Furthermore, I think you must respect to a certain degree the reality Warcraft must face when creating the movie regarding humans. In a game lore immutably intertwined with primarily Norse mythology, the developers of the game Warcraft did not betray the true reflections of how these mythologies were portrayed originally. Meaning white males, white females. Would it not be condescending to throw in a token black or asian character into a mythology where the race has no basis? And because this movie is the adaption of said Warcraft 1, is it not the responsibility of the filmmaker to at least stay true to the grounding mythologies that dictate what kind of race would be present? Now perhaps he could’ve thrown some in, but changing a main character’s race that has endured for over 20 years for the arbitrary purpose of appealing to certain movements, once again, seems more condescending then genuine. In the end it would have been met with complete outrage and stomped the movie out before it began due the betrayal felt by fans.
 I suppose in some twisted attempt you could try to claim that the green orcs aren’t doing anything bad, and in fact it’s an ethnocentric plot that is a reflection of racism today. But I really hope you won’t, as I think you know that wouldn’t hold any merit. As for the humans, its a practice of mythology where certain races simply weren’t a role. And please, don’t respond with a short tagline with a semi-witty hashtag. If you’re going to claim something’s racist, at least have the resolve to realize the weight that accusation carries. Actually they were closest in coloration to native american which would make sense due the influence of the shamanistic culture of certain tribes on the creation of the horde culture.  Warcraft is specifically mean to be shades of grey except for the big bads.  If anything there is are large parallel drawn between the Native Americans and orcs, not Native Africans. If you want to really enjoy the Warcraft movie, pretend you’re a Hobbit and this is your world’s version of the Avengers. Pretend the theater is inside a hole in the ground. That sort of worked for me. I have read almost all of the negative reviews on this movie, and this one is just the worst. I have never seen a reviewer pat themselves on the back this much. The entire review is Maryann laughing at her own jokes. The movie may be bad, but c’mon, have a little respect and give it an honest review about what you did and didn’t like. The author of this review must have absolutely hated “All is Lost” – the cast there was 100% white and 100% male.
Also, I’m not sure if it’s right to write a professional review without doing at least some “homework” on the source material. Just watching a film once is enough to form a private opinion. It’s not enough to write a good review though. Reviews in my opinion are more like mini research papers, not stream-of-consciousness essays. But then, my standards are my problem…
Even a tiny attempt at research would have shown the author, that the movie only shows a tiny piece of Warcraft universe. Just the same way Fellowship of the Ring exposed only a tiny part of Tolkien universe. If Warcraft franchise makes it to the third installment, you will witness dark-skinned elves, dark-skinned dwarves, dark-skinned humans and at least as many leading female protagonists as male ones. It represents human diversity much, much better than Lord of the Rings does. Or any of those trendy “superhero” flicks, for that matter. Perhaps still not perfectly, but better.
Of course it’s easy to hide behind “I’m reviewing this particular movie I saw and therefore could care less about the background and what to expect (or not) next in the franchise”. It’s like saying that “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” is a horrible idea after watching that disaster of a movie and then refusing to even start watching the brilliant TV series that followed.
I’m also wondering whether “PS: I Love You” was criticized by this reviewer for its grotesque, bordering offensive caricatures of Irish people (inexplicably portrayed by Scottish, English and American actors) and Ireland? It’s like saying that “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” is a horrible idea after watching that disaster of a movie and then refusing to even start watching the brilliant TV series that followed.  I think it is. You (as well as many other critics) refuse to see “Warcraft” as a part of trilogy, with two much better parts yet to be made. For unknown reasons though, “Fellowship of the Ring” didn’t seem to have such problem with professional reviewers, whose consensus was “it’s not perfect, but we’ll give it a shot to right the wrongs – there are two more parts to come, after all!” “Fellowship of the Ring” would’ve been perceived as rather mediocre if people didn’t know what to expect in the following installments. “Warcraft” is exactly the same thing. And “Buffy” had a very similar situation – it took five long years for the TV series to get made after critics trashed the movie (quite deservedly, but way overkill in most reviews), not recognizing the potential of its idea itself.
Maybe I’m wrong, but this review of yours gave me an impression that you believe that this movie intentionally caters to the tastes of a stereotypical young white male gaming nerd. Wouldn’t it have been self-destructive for a film, whose target audience are players of “World of Warcraft” – more than one third of them female and more than half of them Asian? You (as well as many other critics) refuse to see “Warcraft” as a part of trilogy, with two much better parts yet to be made.  That’s not how this works. If the next movie is better, I’ll say so. But this movie — any movie — needs to stand on its own. “Unknown reasons”? Here are two: Beautifully portrayed characters — actual characters — and a story — an actual story — with deep resonance. Neither of which this movie has. Wouldn’t it have been self-destructive for a film, whose target audience are players of “World of Warcraft” – more than one third of them female and more than half of them Asian? Guess what? The general movie audience is made up of a helluva lot more than white guys, and we don’t get pandered to by Hollywood. So yes, it’s self-destructive. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen all the time, or that is didn’t happen here too. If a movie needs to stand on its own, why does the Fellowship of the Ring do? It has no ending whatsoever, the same way as Warcraft. Or Empire Strikes Back, for that matter.
Again, correct me if I’m wrong, but your review of the Fellowship reads like you watched it having already been somewhat acquainted with the entire Lord of the Rings story. And should we go with the “movie must stand on its own” idea, it surely distorts the perception.
It also seems that you and many others mistook charismatic portrayal of the characters in LOTR movies for the complexity of the characters themselves. Maybe I was watching it inattentively, but I just couldn’t see Lawrence of Arabia in Aragorn or Dolores Claiborne in Arwen. The characters were mono-dimensional. And that is not necessarily a bad thing for a fairy tale. Then why is it bad in Warcraft? Yes, unlike LOTR, Warcraft suffers from some poor casting choices, which taint the impression. But there’s a vast difference between a shallow character in itself and a bland portrayal of a good, serviceable to the story character.
As for the actual story with deep resonance – I couldn’t disagree more. When Stormwind is attacked by the orcs, other kingdoms refuse to help initially. And why would they? They are safe and well-fed. Stormwind used to be one of them, safe and well-fed itself, but now it’s in trouble. It’s not one of them anymore because of it, they fear it will “infect” their well-being with its troubles, they choose to shun away. It’s a bystander effect in all its ugliness. What sacrifices will it take to shake them from this apathy? Among other obvious themes are allusions to environmental woes caused by greed (“pollution” of the worlds by Fel magic in the name of power), literally soul-sucking lust for power that inevitably corrupts any leader if left unchecked (hello to LOTR), self-destructive addiction (yes, to magic – hello to “Buffy”). Also, warmongering and militaristic orc society wasn’t stereotypically strictly patriarchal (sorry, Maria Gimbutas, but with all due respect you were likely wrong). All these themes were packed into a rather intelligible and coherent, albeit simple and not particularly original plot, executed by serviceable yet not caricaturist characters. Well, first of all, Fellowship isn’t really a self contained story. In fact, it’s only became a separate book because of the publisher, not Tolkien. This movie is largely based on Warcraft 1, which is. Second, when the film of FotR was released,the other two parts had already been (mostly) filmed, with release dates set. It would have had to tanked beyond Eregon levels, or maybe The Golden Compass, for the rest of the films to not get released. It was a bold move on New Line’s part. Legendary and Universal haven’t committed to anything beyond this film. Even the “The Beginning” appellation isn’t being applied in all regions. Third, FotR is the first part of Goddamn Lord of the Motherfucking Rings. I mean, I loves me some Warcraft lore, but come the fuck on. Wow…yes…they should seek some fun or something. Learn to look past or examine why something eats them up so bad that it spills out like that.. Life’s hard when there’s more bitter than sweet. Wow…seek some fun or something. Learn to look past at whatever eats you up so bad that it spills out like that.. Life’s hard when there’s more bitter than sweet. Mick LaSalle, renowned movie critic, had a basic list of 6 characteristics found in great movies:
-The movie is topical when new.
-It embodies timeless human values.
-It contains a great performance.
-It has an overarching consciousness or personality that brings the movie into balance.
-It contains at least one memorable scene.
-It ends on a note of complexity, not just ambiguity. From what I read in your review, sans all the causes you are crusading for, only trying to tie what you wrote to the 6 LaSalle points, this movie is turd. That is all we are interested in to be honest.
Thanks. This entire review is an absolute joke. Making race such a huge point in this is laughable, quite frankly hilarious. This movie as you clearly state in your “biast” thing is based on a video game. A video game which has a massive established lore and history. Minute details are often already spelled out, and altering them to please people who play the race card on every little thing would just upset the die-hard fans of the series… Their main target audience.  Yes, the king and his advisor are white in the movie. That is most likely because they were in the lore of the Warcraft universe as well. In the warcraft universe humans are most frequently white, as are most other humanoid characters. That doesn’t mean the movie is ‘racist’ in any sense of the word, as in the Warcraft universe the races aren’t seperated by the color of their skin but rather by their very ‘species’ (probably a better word for it but i can’t think of it). Trolls, Orcs, Elves, Humans, Dwarves etc. These are the ‘races’ in Warcraft just like Black, White,  and Asian are to our world.  This movie was in no way racist, it just has its own history.  Trying to compare a fictional world with a very well established history with our own worlds history is just plain foolish. As I wrote below, this reviewer is clearly racist (and white).  He or she assumes that we minorities (I’m a Latino) couldn’t possibly like movies like this (or any other type of movie), and pretends to speak for us. Yeah, and I’m  going ahead and call you a racist– now I have no reading comprehension because I’m Latino.  As if I could care less what your gender is. Truly, your powers of ignorance astound me. If you do not understand the complexity and depth of the Warcraft universe’ lore and history, don’t pretend to, or worse yet, simply apply the real worlds history to it.  He’s white because that happens to be the color of his skin that he was born with and no other reason. The House of Wrynn, the ruling family of Stormind have held that position for generations not because they rule with an iron fist, but because they are renowned and so respected and loved by their subjects. King Llane Wrynn, the leader depicted in the Warcraft movie, was so fiercely attached to his people that he took the throne up when his father, Adamant Wrynn the third died, and without hesitation lead his nation in to battle, and fought right along side his nations troops to protect all of those he ruled over.  Not only did he fight to protect his own citizens, (if you were watching the movie, you would have noticed this) He even fought and argued over the idea that all orcs should be slaughtered like the ‘beasts’ they are. He fought to treat them with sympathy and respect, as actual living, feeling beings, in the face of others in his nation saying that they are savage cruel animals who need to be put down. He was one of the VERY FEW who even considered accepting Garona Halforcen, the half-orc who was shunned by both her own kind and the rest of the world save for a compassionate few.  King Llane, the ‘white king’, argued that even the so called ‘brutes and savages’ attacking them at that very moment deserved some form of sympathy. He fought for equality for even his sworn enemies.  Fun fact: The current king, King Varian Wrynn, upholds those very same values. He fights not only for his own people, but to protect ALL life no matter who it belongs to. While he will defend himself and his nation first, he accepted his father, King Llane’s views, and shows sympathy, even to orcs. From the perspective of my young 14 year old (in 1987), D&D addicted (with shout-outs to Fighting Fantasy), comic book collecting, Dungeon Master re-re-re-playing, socially awkward white teen boy self: It does indeed sound like this movie could speak to me.  Seems to be getting bad reviews across the board, but I may still have to check it out if for no other reason then to give that inner 2d6+2 kid a chance to soak up some nostalgic feels. Kind of felt the same way about Battle of Five Armies actually. I didn’t get much of a ‘Tolkien’ vibe from it. Or even a ‘Tolkien filtered through Jackson and Co. on a good day’ vibe. Felt much closer to being that elusive ‘good’ D&D movie that, frankly, a bunch of us (privileged white males or otherwise) are still waiting patiently for. On a more serious note, yeah it would be nice for a bombastic “magic users and Orcs” type movie to still have decent characters and juicy plot. Everyone’s tastes will vary there, but if it’s all just a hodge-podge of aimless CGI sequences…meh. So far, I’ve muted a basic racist, a dudebro, and some guy who’s just pissing me off. And all three have responded, even though I won’t see it. That gives me some joy. Hilarious! Well done. It’s also hilarious that the ads are citing the blurb “Masterpiece!,” maybe from your review. No good deed goes unpunished, it seems. Fits your review that you believe this to be nonsenically redundant. If I understand you correctly.
And also, that you are only looking for the weakness in what I’m writing than actually replying “constructively”. Quite unsympathetic. Thanks, I appreciate it. I’ll try to take more time to write my comments. I didn’t talk about an unbiased review, but about having no bias towards a particular gender. It is impossible that any of us are without bias, including towards or against gender. You don’t recognise how it would feel to be of a gender that is sidelined, infantilised or otherwise limited in the majority of pop culture representation. Ergo, you are biased in favor of the gender who is permitted a broader representation. I have only vicarious experience of being of a gender that doesn’t have that problem, so I have a bias of assuming that men will not see my point of view — this extends to initially not trusting individual men. If they are evolved, trust can build on my side. Without knowing me, how can you assume what I (do not) recognize? And also, I find it quite arrogant to demand of men to “evolve”.  However I agree, women, in certain art forms (for example in video games), are not as well represented  as men. This limited representation can lead to a certain type of exclusion. I imagine, this can be frustrating for women and it should
be subject to change.  If you have no preference, and that works for you, roll with it. But, why do you need to castigate those of us who might lament the lack of broader representation? Why do you — in effect — say ‘I’ve got no preference and you are small-minded for not just sucking up whatever is handed to you?” I wouldnt say that. However, what I might say is that not every movie can fullfil everybody’s expectations. And you cannot expect from a movie to include everything you want, but maybe take it as what it is, without thinking that it only tries to offend you by it’s (lack of desired) content. But trying to enjoy it as what it is; and if you don’t, you don’t. That obviously doesn’t mean that one should forget the general issue we were discussing before. I’m pissed that certain “critics” abuse Warcraft: The Beginning as a battleground for their own agenda and social injustices, for what this movie doesn’t stand and is not responsible for …
As a huge fantasy fan that has read most Warcraft books and is fairly familiar with the story, I hope you can understand how I am just really annoyed what primary message the reviewer takes out of this movie … Well, in any case, i think it doesn’t make sense to continue this discussion, we’re just going to talk past each other. Just this: I’m sorry that you guys feel so betrayed and underappreciated by society; I truly hope it is going to change for the better for you. When an artist (singular or collective) toils away in a garret (metaphorical or otherwise), only living with the art in progress, the artist is working from a vision that sprung from the loins of that artist’s inspiration and lives in a special, isolated world. BUT, there comes a day when that art has to be set free. It must be hung on a gallery wall, placed on a pedestal in some marble arcade, erected by construction workers, cast in a foundry and put in a public square, shown in a movie theater, spoke or sung through a microphone, published on leaves of dead trees, released on the web, wheat-pasted to a plywood siding, or painted with spray cans on a wall (probably in my neighborhood).  The audience brings its experiences, its exposures to some of the same things that inspired the artist, its likes and dislikes, and its prejudices. In fact, the art now is gazed upon and becomes ART and it no longer belongs to the artist and, in fact, becomes one with the soup of the culture(s) of the audience.  It will be interpreted in a multitude of ways. It will cause emotions that are not guaranteed to be the same between members of the audience nor even emotions that the artist imagined firing in people. There will be intellectual connections made by strangers that the artist never thought of. There will be myriad opinions.  You like the movie, go ahead and watch it. Whatever. I, for instance, like pretty much everything by Peter Greenaway, even the things I have thought actually needed extra editing. Other people finding them abstruse, or communist (yes, that was once used to denigrate a film), or dull has no effect on my pleasure. I don’t expect everyone to like the same things. You do. But, depending on how you frame your disagreement, I might feel that I want to exercise my  freedom to tell you to go fuck yourself.  Hmm, I’m not a big fan of this kind of discourse. Doesn’t lead to anything but divergence. But oh well, so be it. Or not. Bye. exactly what do you think the definition of “critic” is?  some are movie reviewers, which means they’re satisfied with a “thumbs up/thumbs down” quick and simple overview of the movie.  a “critic” on the other hand, attempts to analyze a creative endeavor with a view towards putting it into a larger context or examining the creative endeavor’s expression of the culture in which it is viewed.  so if all you want is a simplistic, “i loved/hated it”  there are plenty of reviewers out there, but that is not criticism. Well, this gem certain garners a nod for the No Shit, Sherlock Award for 2016.
And I like how you segue into what amounts to an unironic call to like everything. Well, I felt like I have to be overly clear because it seems people want to misunderstand me in this comment section… Proof of this is the false conclusion in your next sentence. It’s not so much a “false” conclusion as you not really realizing what you’re saying. Try this, if I say “I hated this movie, the music was horrible” and you respond “I don’t really listen to the music, and you should enjoy the film without paying attention to the music”, that would be a silly argument, and certainly would make me like the movie any more. Nah. I’d appreciate that you actually paid attention to what the movie itself is about (at least you TRIED to enjoy the movie as what it is), and if you hate the music and therefore the movie, so be it. In other words, other people’s actual opions, and their reasons for them, vex you, when they don’t conform to your own.
Seems like LaSargenta already covered that, though. Yes dear sir/madam, I’m annoyed by opinions and their reasons, that don’t conform with my own in a drastic way, like every other human being. Just from this comments section you can notice that a lot of people become agitated, annoyed, or combative when the term “white privilege” is used. If you want to know why, the answer is that, generally speaking, most people don’t like being told that they should feel guilty and ashamed because of the color of their skin. If you’re feeling guilty over your privileges, that’s on you. I don’t feel guilty for being born a SWM, but I do recognize that that puts me a a certain advantage over the majority of the population right now, and, at the very least puts me in a mind to not be a complete raging asshole about those advantages. ETA: for the record, I try to more than not be a raging asshole. But that seems like a good start, even if it is hard to do for a lot of SWMs, especially on the internet. The answer is that, generally speaking, most people don’t like being told that they have blinders on, even when (and especially when) they have blinders on. People with blinders on. Telling other people they have blinders on. It’s working out wonderfully! Now no one can enjoy a movie without someone’s butt getting sore! Of course you can enjoy whatever movie you want. If reviews that criticize the movie make you upset, you could always, you know, not read them. Could people actually name me one institution or law that is racist or sexist in intent? Can people point out to me which systems systematically privilege men? If you can find any, then we need to correct them, or stop them if need be.  But so long as people are not capable of doing so, shouting “institutionalized racism” and “white male privilege” really fails to prove anything.
The ONLY laws that do actively discriminate or privilege certain groups of people, are ALWAYS in favor of women and poc. It’s called affirmative action. As a white male nerd from 1987, and also a successful white male engineer from 2016, you can take YOUR stereotypes and shove them.  How about not worrying who may or may not be represented in a film and just review the movie for its story, cinematography, soundtrack, and other actually relevant details? The last half of your review is just complaining about lack of minority and female representation. Doesn’t seem much use as if you are going to the movies for that reason, why? I mean I hardly think many go to the movies thinking ‘aw man I can’t wait to watch something with a black female lead’ they go hoping to watch something. Even to the point of scratching at air saying racism in the orcs? This has just gotten silly.  Over sexualization of females or something like a movie hold the premise that when the males died off the world fell apart because ‘woman amiright’ IS a valid point, but getting caught up in the whole no women MC or a non perfect racially mixed cast or mixed at all is flawed for reviewing to an extent. If the all female ghostbusters is actual garbage in its directing, cgi, dialogue execution, etc should ‘but hey it has female leads’ really be the talking point of the review?  Though as you said further down “The specific scene I mentioned in the review is particularly egregious in its marginalization.” Which is fair criticism as forcing characters where it doesn’t belong shows poor decision making, but if the issue is that they are colored, not the fact that the characters didn’t really belong in the scene at all I have a hard time agreeing. Though tbf I feel the whole ‘needs more slave leia’ take on movies is annoying where unlike it being part of the plot, its just a need for tits. Unnecessary additions to pander to a certain group in after thought is just poor directing. The movie should be made with the vision and free from representation quotas to pander. If the actors he wanted ended up white, fine whatever, they may fit his vision the best. If it happens to pander then w/e racial diversity shouldn’t be the measure of how good a movie is. i think the first half had much better points. A clusterfuck of a movie that leaves you confused with no explanation, at least thats what It sounds like you where going for. Is the Rush bit just a gag, or is there matchup potential here, like how the first fight in The Matrix syncs to Particle Man by They Might be Giants? Sigh…Warcraft has purple skinned ancient night elves with all female army led by a female general and a female supreme leader. A white skinned human sets this world on fire. A green skinned Orc is considered “Jesus” in this world but author is correct. Most powerful mage in known history is a female.  An undead female leads an entire “race” of undead people. So yes, white males can’t escape their superiority! I am going to ask Peter Jackson to apologize. Hell, I am going to boycott Game of Thrones, all marvel and DC movies. Never going to watch original star wars again! Warcraft has purple skinned ancient night elves with all female army led by a female general and a female supreme leader. A white skinned human sets this world on fire. A green skinned Orc is considered “Jesus” in this world but author is correct. Most powerful mage in known history is a female. An undead female leads an entire “race” of undead people. I hope you are not playing dumb for a reason because we all know that part of “world” doesn’t exist because it is not shown! Such logic! Atleast you can show respect to the guy in your avatar and not talk dumb.. None of those events occur until Warcraft 3. This is fact. (Though I could be wrong about the “white skinned human” because I’m not 100% sure who you’re referring to here.) Very few of the events or characters appear, nor to my knowledge, are mentioned in the film. Therefore, for all intents and purposes, they don’t exist in this film. They don’t even ever have to exist in the film version(s) of Warcraft lore. So bringing them up to defend this film is a non sequitur. Also, “we” is a much smaller group than you think. In my experience, the majority of WoW players aren’t really all that familiar with the lore of the game, beyond the current xpac. (Just wait for all the complaints about the total lack of Nelfs. In a story based on Warcraft 1.) You have little or no logic. Who cares what this movie shows! Movie is very much an introduction to a broader world, a concept that is lost on you and you are trying to bury it behind a wall of text. This of-course is internet and everyone is a rocket-scientist. I am sure if movie started with all female night elfs, idiots like you will complain about how the movie is pandering to PC crowd. FWIW, I’m not a “real geek” because I have never played World of Warcraft and never plan to. But I spent many Friday nights in 1987 playing Dungeons and Dragons in friends’ basements, sometimes while listening to Rush, and I recognize myself in this review, and it made me laugh out loud. Although I wasn’t playing with all white guys, and there were people there who cared a lot about what the Hobbits were eating. . . But still, “Distant Early Warning” FTW! Azeroth is essentially a Tolkien-like universe, based in Scandinavian myth and aesthetic. The other races in the WoW games draw upon Asian and African culture, but the humans are primarily white. You should be blaming Blizzard more than this film. The director clearly went out of his way to assemble a diverse cast and tell an impartial story. But the industry has no choice but to accept the world for what it is when trying to introduce a brand new franchise with a risky investment of $160 million. People are superficial and would much rather see sexy, lighter-skinned actors on screen. By people, I don’t just mean average white, racist Americans. Look at China. Star Wars did rather poorly in China, even after Disney consciously made John Boyega’s picture on the Chinese poster smaller. And Warcraft is poised to do extremely well in China, the huge market that’ll probably allow the series to continue and recoup its money. Only an existing juggernaut property like Star Wars could afford to cast unknown talent as its leads because that universe is bigger than the actors. When talking about whitewashing and racism in Hollywood, you can’t really blame one person, one department, or one film. It’s a cultural issue with a lot of greys. Well, Blizzard Entertainment is listed one of the production companies, Chris Metzen is credited as “Story by”, and Metzen and Nick Carpenter got Co-Producer credits, so they do catch blame. On the other hand, Jones is one of the credited screenwriters, and all of the credited producers are Hollywood studio types and/or friends of Jones, any of whom could have fixed what needed fixing, so they get to catch their own ration of shit. Not if they want to make back their money. Filmmaking is a business… Warcraft is a successful game property with players of all races and genders who don’t have an issue with the world’s aesthetic. Just as Lord of the Rings fans don’t take issue with English Shakespearean thespians like Ian McKellen playing Gandalf the White, etc. Why ‘fix’ what ain’t broke? The only color that matters here is green $$. A movie of this scale cannot get made without hot, recognizable actors. And honestly, the fans don’t want to see their favorite characters get diversified. We’d rather see brand new diverse characters created from scratch. That’s a notion that doesn’t really hold up to scrutiny. For one thing (and this is somewhat anecdotal but is based on years of observation) WoW players aren’t even mostly lore-nerds. Most really don’t care. For another, nerds have never really opened a movie (Serenity remains the gold standard on fandom’s inability in this regard.) So there’s no reason not to mess with a property like this for fear of damaging the bottom line. If anything, change whatever you need to attract a wider audience. I think, apart from maybe casting a household name, Warcraft was casted rather well in terms of attracting a wide audience. From Travis Fimmel, to Paula Patton, to Daniel Wu, there you’ve got three hot, talented, and diverse leads. You have to give the producers credit. Yet somehow the SJWs will always find something to complain about. That’s why they’re not worth indulging. Diversity doesn’t always spell wider audiences. Sometimes, as I alluded to with my Star Wars example, it detracts bc people are predisposed toward light-skinned actors on a superficial level. Especially China, as evidenced with Star Wars. Flimmel is whiter than me. But 2 out of 3 ain’t bad I guess.
You’re shifting the goalpost. Your argument was that changing things would alienate the game fans, and hurt the film. Whether increased diversity is advantageous (and you provide evidence that the producers thought so on at least some level) is a separate argument. One at a time. You’re right. I’ll amend my thought here. What I want to say is that SJWs should not be complaining because the cast is quite diverse, particularly for a fantasy blockbuster. I do not believe the diversity will help or hinder the width of its audience. Stats show that diversity has little to no bearing on whether average moviegoers will see a movie. Some evidence aforementioned shows that people would prefer an all-white cast, but I’m not necessarily advocating that. But I’m against diversity for diversity’s sake and I’m against changing character’s skin color to fill a diversity quota. And I oppose this “reviewer”‘s metrics of measuring the quality of a movie based on how many minorities are in it. That is reasonable. In my defense, it is a game stacked heavily against me. Most rational people don’t give people like this reviewer the time of day, so hardly anyone will be here to upvote or agree with me when I say that the amount of non-whites in a movie is an invalid metric of quality. Duncan Jones put in a valiant effort in assembling a diverse cast and telling an impartial story about humans vs. orcs, humanizing the latter. For that he deserves praise, not petulant criticism. Apologies, it was a tangential conversation as I hadn’t had much chance to get an answer as to why someone would do that. I’ve occasionally seen it before and always wondered.  Typical. Oh well, I encourage you to check out the film for yourself and form your own opinion. You seem intelligent enough to not blindly embrace this woman’s word just because she taps into some of the issues you seem to care about. Life is short. I frequent this reviewer’s site because I found with the movies we both had seen, she was a generally reliable barometer as to whether or not I’d feel like my time watching something was well spent. Over time I realized where this wasn’t reliable and I now have adjusted the calibration.  This film does not look interesting and my time is too valuable to push myself to see something in the hopes I’ll have fodder for an argument. Exactly, this movie isn’t made for the likes of you or this reviewer. It’s made for people who like a fun action movie. Those people aren’t as petty in their needs for diversity and they don’t let that ruin their experience. My feeling is that the filmmakers shouldn’t even try to pander, because there will always be some perceived problem. But you can just look at IMDb and see that there are a lot of minorities in the cast (three of them are leads) and you can read any article or watch literally any interview with Duncan Jones (who’s married to an Asian woman), and he’ll talk about how he wished to portray the orcs in a fair light, and not as monsters. I even heard they made some of the ELVES Asian, which outraged a lot of purist fans. It’s a pretty ridiculous claim to say that this film is geared solely towards white males and does not represent minorities. I’m done. Yeah. Actually, I *do* like fun action movies. Between the trailer and this review, this seems like it would be leaden to me. I’d rather rewatch something actually fun.  Nerdy fantasy film then? Unless you’re a Ringer or a member of the DnD club. Probably not your cup of tea. Idk you, but this kind of movie is an acquired taste, obv not for everyone. That’s all I was saying. No, I’m saying this movie is for hardcore fantasy fans. Idk you, but I’m guessing you’re not a Ringer (lord of the rings fan). If I reviewed a metal album and I don’t like metal music, that review is rather meaningless. So I take this review with a grain of salt. This is a website of a film reviewer. Reviewing films is the job of a film reviewer. Real reviewers don’t limit themselves to one pigeonholed genre of films.  Being a reviewer is not about being a fan. Also, even a fan ought to have some discernment and be able to judge whether something is good or just hitting the high notes of that particular ‘fandom’. Right. As much as I would have liked for them to make a finer, more accessible, sort of cinematic film adaptation of Warcraft, they really went out of their way to retain the cartoonish-ness of the game’s aesthetic with lots of CGI and critics as well as audiences are rather predisposed to the gritty, realistic quality of Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings and have come to expect that in any sort of fantasy filmmaking. This film, being more than fantasy (uber high fantasy), enters murky territory, which makes it a harder sell, because so much of it is animated and blended together with real actors. Critics of film generally recuse themselves of having to review anime, because it’s a very specific, acquired taste kind of thing. This film, I believe, has a similar dynamic. But I think more people will open up to it because they love the game or they love fantasy a la Avatar and Rings, which is closer to what this film is. Wrong. The problem with this movie is not that it is “high fantasy” or mixed CGI with live actors. (The new *Jungle Book* does that, and it’s marvelous.) The problem is that the story is all over the place, there’s no protagonist, the dialogue is crap, the characters are not developed, and it’s all a pile of soulless shit. Most critics recuse themselves of reviewing anime. It’s such a specific, acquired taste thing. Warcraft, being so heavily animated (in order to retain the game’s cartoonish aesthetic) and blended together with real actors, enters murky territory, being more than your average fantasy picture, where we have come to expect gritty, realistic visuals a la Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings. It’s now uber high fantasy, which is a tougher sell. It becomes part of a more niche, cult market, like anime. But bigger since many people see this as a cool blending of Avatar and Lord of the Rings and are on board for the popcorn fantasy fare it promises. Others see it the way many see anime. Something other, that’s too nerdy for their time. Also, if you’re under the impression that there are no WoW players with issues with the “world’s aethetic”… then I’ve got a bridge to sell you. Movies with diverse casts make more money than those without. The “Hollywood is a business” excuse has been demonstrated time and again to be nonsense. If Hollywood truly cared about making as much money as possible, we would see different sorts of movies with different sorts of casts. In my humble opinion as an illustrator and fantasy enthusiast, you should have looked more at Frazetta’s body of work before using him as a reference point here.  If he’s your only idea of a fantasy artist (and I understand the ease of using his name instead of doing research), maybe pick up a few books and do some more research before throwing a respected and loved artist under the bus.  He didn’t really do orcs and magic often (or at all in reference to the visuals of the warcraft franchise).  He was an illustrator that had his hands in a lot of different worlds, but the brand of fantasy that Warcraft is a part wasn’t one of them.  John Blanche, David Gallagher, Adrian Smith, Karl Kopinski, Geoff Taylor, Alex Boyd, and Paul Dainton are just a few names I can think of that had their hands in creating the different Warhammer settings that Warcraft has pulled from visually since the beginning. It’s just my humble opinion – of course I know Frazetta will survive this, and I do understand allusion – I’m merely offering a (in my opinion) more accurate artistic reference point.  I simply appreciate reviews that have done research and offer well informed opinions as result. It’s ironic you harp on the lack of non-white non-female leads while comparing the film unfavorably to Lord of the Rings, which was rather lacking in both departments as well. The inclusion or lack of non-white characters has nothing to do with the quality of the film. A film can have all non-white, all female casts and be terrible, an all white male film can be great, and everywhere in between. Including this in a movie review seems very political and has nothing to do with the quality of the film. It’s sad to see a handful of reviewers now use politics as a crutch when writing reviews.",NEGATIVE

"Jun 5, 2016"," With millions of online subscribers, the role-playing fantasy game World of Warcraft has a massive following. But whether that translates into a loyal cinema audience is another matter. Directed by Duncan Jones, Warcraft: The Beginning is less a complex immersive digital experience than a simplified sub-Lord of the Rings tale, pitching humans against a race of Orcs. “There has been a war between Orcs and humans for as long as can be remembered,” we’re told, but this flat, laboured film rarely makes us care why. Unlike the cannon fodder from Rings, we’re meant to feel for these green-skinned, tusk-sprouting Orcs. But it’s almost impossible in a world full of spells, incantations and other magical mumbo-jumbo that even hardcore gamers will struggle to comprehend. The plot sees the Orcs open up a portal to the human world of Azeroth with the express intention of invading. Led by Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), ruler of one of seven kingdoms, a rag-tag bunch of warriors and wizards must repel these forces. Vikings star Travis Fimmel leads the way as Lothar, though Ben Foster, looking like Jesus Christ in his robe, beard and long hair, makes the biggest impression as the mage Medivh. The motion-capture and computer-generated elements of Warcraft are fine, without being mind-blowing; the landscapes in particular don’t really contain the awe-inspiring aspect that Rings managed. Likewise, the dialogue feels pedestrian with lines like: “From light comes darkness and from darkness comes light.” The Moses-in-a-basket-like finale, not to mention the film’s subtitle, suggests future chapters are in the works. But there isn’t enough here to merit a return to this world. Warcraft: The Beginning really should be the end.",NEUTRAL

"Jun 5, 2016"," Turning a video game into a sophisticated movie is like pulling a sword out of a stone. One of these days someone is going to make it look easy. In the meantime let’s talk about Duncan Jones. In adapting Blizzard’s sword ’n’ sorcery games for the big screen, what the esteemed director of Moon and Source Code has created is a fantasy world where ugly orcs, as well as beautiful humans, have the right to survive. The orcs have primitive values and could all do with a trip to the orthodontist. Rather refreshingly, Jones embraces these oiks. I mean, orcs. He wants us to cheer on the great unwashed. But so many things make it hard to go with the flow. For starters, practically all the male orcs look like our hero, decent chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell, in a motion capture suit).  I spent much of the movie in a panic, thinking, “Why is Durotan suddenly being so mean/stupid?” only to realise the orc before me was a different fellow, Scrotum Breath, say, or Fungus the Foot. (I jest. But not much). Then there’s the fact that Durotan’s allies — a human and a half-orc called Sir Anduin Lothar and Garona — are played by D-list actors Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton. These cuties overact and underwhelm. They also look permanently pre-coital (even when Lothar is talking to his sister he seems ready to hump). Ironically, this renders them completely unsexy.  Meanwhile, excellent thesps (Dominic Cooper, Ruth Negga and Ben Foster) are brought low by costumes and props that make you want to blow raspberries at the screen. The rings, crowns and helmets are particularly shonky. It’s as if the real props got lost in a fire and someone dashed out to Poundland and screamed “Give me everything you’ve got that’s shiny!” Cooper has a mischievous mouth that twitches when he has to spout nonsense like “take one of my birds” or “find me at the portal”. Poor Foster, as top magic dude Medivh, tries to brazen out the fact that he is essentially flip-flopping between an impersonation of Alec Guinness in Star Wars and Christopher Lee in Lord of the Rings.  Talking of which, early on, Medivh says that he’s trying to create a golem. Bad move. Andy Serkis’s Gollum! Forced to remember the latter’s glittering and lonely eyes, you realise what’s missing from Warcraft. Jones commands the SFX but (for now) he’s lost the power to move.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 5, 2016"," Directed by Stephen Hopkins (The Life And Death Of Peter Sellers), Race never quite rouses as you might expect but it’s quietly compelling as it tells Owens’ story from star athlete at Ohio State University to Olympic champion, facing down extreme prejudice at home and abroad, as well as his own doubts about participating. At its heart is the relationship between Owens (Stephan James)and sharp-tongued coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis) whose own promising athletic career was derailed years earlier, from which the bitter Snyder has never quite recovered.  Sudeikis, best known for comedy roles in the likes of Horrible Bosses, gives a good performance but the character was too sour for my taste and the pair’s relationship doesn’t engage as much as it should.  More memorable, although occupying less screen time, is Owens’ bond with German champion athlete Carl “Luz” Long (David Kross) with whom he competes at the Games; a friendship that defies the forces of hate. We also see the otherwise pretty saintly Owens’ dalliance with an attractive socialite, Quincella Nickerson (Chantel Riley), briefly threatening his relationship with girlfriend Ruth Solomon (Shanice Banton), with whom he has a daughter. It’s not so much the on-track exploits that fascinate (Owens is pretty much unbeatable) but the political intrigue behind the Olympics, particularly in Germany where they are intended as a carefully choreographed display of Aryan superiority orchestrated by Josef Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat) with spirited filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (Carice Van Houten) on hand to record the triumph. Urging the American Olympic Committee not to boycott the Games is hard-nosed industrialist Avery Bundage (Jeremy Irons) while Owens is petitioned by leading members of the African-American community to stay away. James is good as Owens but lacks a certain magnetism.  It may not be Oscar-worthy but the picture tells Owens’ remarkable story effectively and with increasing tension, especially once the action shifts to the Games themselves. The prejudice Owens continued to face as an African American back home after his triumph is shocking. Something often goes awry when two big stars buddy up: think of 1980s duds City Heat (Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds) and Best Defence (Dudley Moore and Eddie Murphy) or, more recently, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy in Showtime (I know, I barely remember it either). It’s as if the filmmakers think that after luring two major stars and negotiating the delicacies of whose name goes first on the credits their job is done.  Still, if anyone can pull it off it should be Shane Black who invented the modern buddy cop movie with his screenplay for Lethal Weapon and went on to craft other admired examples of the genre, including Kiss Kiss Bang Bang starring a pre-Iron Man Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer.  Weirdly and disappointingly, The Nice Guys with Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, written and directed by Black, is a bewildering misfire that conjures up few sparks between the characters and even less with the meandering plot. It’s best enjoyed for the locale: the seamy, smoggy politically incorrect Los Angeles of 1977 that promises fun, naughtiness and bad attitudes. The picture only really delivers the latter. Crowe and Gosling have nothing substantial to work with. The latter is hapless, boozed-up, private detective Holland March while a very lardy Crowe is aggressive private detective Jackson Healy, with whom March is compelled to pair up. The case revolves around the disappearance of a young woman involved in porn, Amelia, whose mother (a lifeless Kim Basinger) is a senior legal figure in town.  It manages to be preposterous, boring and inconsequential, while attempts at “daring” politically incorrect humour – mostly involving March’s 13-year-old daughter – simply come across as creepy. These Nice Guys finish last.  Death as dreamy romantic fantasy! That’s the slightly icky premise behind Me Before You, a tear-jerker for teenage girls adapted by Jojo Moyes from her bestseller. Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is a former London high flyer who yearns to end his days after being paralysed in a road accident – he has Dignitas on speed dial and has promised his parents (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance) a six month stay of execution before he goes to Switzerland. Lou Clark (Emilia Clarke) is the bubbly local girl hired by his mother as a friendly companion whose cheeriness and effervescence may just persuade Will to keep from pulling the plug. Filmed around Pembroke in Wales – the castle doubles as Will’s family home – the picture is beautifully shot and the easy-on-the-eye cast are a pleasure to watch. Claflin is moodily gorgeous in his wheelchair and Clarke’s Lou is delightfully sunny and wholesome, if too good to be true. There are no surprises in the drawn-out plotting as the characters grow close, culminating in a holiday to Mauritius; Lou’s heart and vivacity combining perfectly with Will’s worldliness and financial means.  Warcraft: The Beginning may make sense to fans of the video game it’s based on, but everyone else will be baffled by this sub-Tolkien twaddle, writes Nicholas Barber. When an army of musclebound CGI trolls invades the human realm, the daftly named but forgettable characters hop all over the place via teleportation spells and giant lion-eagles, so it’s impossible to keep track of any of them. What’s worse is that after two long hours, the film stops without having anything like a proper ending.Warcraft, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing.",NEGATIVE

Com: Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Ruth Negga, Ben Schnetzer, Toby Kebbell, Clancy Brown, Daniel Wu, Anna Galvin. O histórico de filmes adaptados de games não é dos melhores, já começando com Super Mario Bros. e passando por Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Hitman e Doom, entre outros (nem vou mencionar os de Uwe Boll). Não é difícil compreender por que estas adaptações fracassam com tanta frequência, já que, além de precisarem condensar uma história que rende horas de jogo, devem fazê-la se sustentar sem depender de conhecimentos extra-filme mesmo que tragam referências (inclusive visuais) que os fãs dos jogos reconhecerão e aplaudirão – e talvez seja por isto que, mesmo quando um projeto se destaca de alguma maneira (Final Fantasy, Silent Hill), acaba sendo massacrado por aqueles que se veem frustrados com as mudanças feitas para que se mostrassem eficazes como uma obra coesa e independente. Escrito por Charles Leavitt e revisado pelo diretor Duncan Jones, o roteiro se passa em um universo no qual os orcs estão prestes a invadir o mundo dos humanos, atravessando, para isso, um portal mágico invocado pelo maligno Gul’dan (Wu) – e cuja “energia” surge apropriadamente no verde-esmeralda que, ao lado do roxo, é classicamente associado à ideia de morte e destruição. Para conter a ameaça, o rei Llane (Cooper) solicita a ajuda do guerreiro Lothar (Fimmel), que, ao lado do jovem aprendiz de mago Khadgar (Schnetzer), recorre ao Guardião (Foster) por proteção. Enquanto isso, o orc Durotan (Kebbell) questiona a liderança destrutiva de Gul’dan, usando a mestiça “orquisa” Garona (Patton) como ponte para tentar estabelecer um pacto com os humanos. Só ao ler os nomes dos personagens acima já é possível perceber que estamos lidando com um exemplar do gênero “fantasia” e, assim, não é surpresa que logo conheçamos lugares como Vento Bravo, Alta Forja e Vila d’Ouro – espaços que oferecem ao designer de produção Gavin Bocquet (que tem experiência na área por ter trabalhado nas prequels de Star Wars e em Stardust) a oportunidade de criar visuais bastante distintos para cada um (e gosto particularmente do imenso castelo branco que se destaca entre as casinhas de Vento Bravo e das barracas dos orcs, que trazem grandes presas em sua estrutura que remetem às de seus ocupantes). Igualmente competentes são os designs das criaturas que habitam a história – embora algumas tenham sua natureza digital mais óbvia do que outras. Os orcs, em particular, se beneficiam dos avanços no performance capture (e que vai além do motion capture ao realmente usar a atuação dos intérpretes): Durotan, por exemplo, já é visto na abertura da projeção com uma expressão preocupada que nos coloca imediatamente do seu lado, evitando que seja apenas um daqueles orcs bestiais vistos em tantos projetos similares. Aliás, é interessante observar como sua espécie apresenta variações no tom de pele que remetem a diferentes raças, apontando para uma sociedade tão diversa quanto a nossa (e é possível também concluir que há preconceitos operando ali a partir destas diferenças). Além disso, o cuidado na concepção das criaturas pode ser constatado nos dentes amarelados de alguns e nas presas partidas de outros, merecendo também aplausos a animação em si – e, em certo momento, enquanto Durotan conversa com o amigo Blackhand (Brown), podemos notar pequenas contrações quase involuntárias nos músculos de seu braço. Esta diversidade na representação dos orcs é também encontrada na maneira com que os humanos são abordados e que refletem uma sociedade pós-racial que não opera com nenhum tipo de separação ditada por aparência – e até mesmo um relacionamento interespécie entre um humano e uma orquisa é visto com naturalidade. Da mesma maneira, o roteiro se preocupa em não permitir que a escala grandiosa da trama anule o desenvolvimento dos personagens, que, assim, ganham pequenos momentos para que possamos conhecer um pouco melhor seus passados e motivações – como o preconceito sofrido por Garona entre os orcs por ser mestiça, a melancolia de Khadgar por ter sido separado dos pais ainda criança ou o lamento do Guardião por ter desistido de um amor em função de suas obrigações. Por outro lado, por mais que o longa invista nestas passagens, o elenco na maior parte do tempo é obrigado a se limitar a interagir com o vazio que posteriormente será preenchido com criaturas e cenários digitais, o que expõe as dificuldades maiores de um ou outro: Ben Foster, por exemplo, consegue trazer certa multidimensionalidade ao Guardião, que se vê dividido por impulsos diferentes, ao passo que Dominic Cooper (um ator do qual não costumo gostar) traz surpreendente dignidade ao rei Llane; em contrapartida, Paula Patton (depois do embaraço de Zerando a Vida) volta a desapontar com uma performance artificial que ao menos tem alguma expressividade, já que nem isso o pavoroso Travis Fimmel consegue exibir – e quando seu herói passa por um momento de tristeza, o filme é obrigado a recorrer ao diálogo para que compreendamos o que o ator não conseguiu evocar (“Em toda minha vida, nunca senti tanta dor como agora”. Ah, bom saber.). Comandado por Duncan Jones, Warcraft traz cenas que flertam com o pesadelo (Gul’dal sugando a vida de um humano aos poucos, casualmente, enquanto conversa com um subalterno) e com a tragédia (uma barreira de energia separa pai e filho durante uma batalha, obrigando o primeiro a assistir, impotente, à luta do segundo com vários inimigos poderosos) – e a habilidade em evocar estas fortes atmosferas comprova o talento do cineasta, que já havia dirigido o excelente Lunar e o ótimo Contra o Tempo. Além disso, Jones leva o público a compreender também o drama de orcs como Dorutan, sendo interessante notar como ele nos leva a assumir o ponto de vista deste ao subitamente transformar o inglês falado por humanos em uma língua incompreensível, enquanto o dialeto da criatura se torna compreensível para o espectador. Óbvio apenas em sua referência bíblica à história de Moisés, Warcraft é uma obra que traz vários arcos narrativos ambiciosos, permitindo que comparemos as situações contrastantes de diversos personagens em pontos diversos da projeção e que, ao fim, exigem sacrifícios notáveis por parte de praticamente todos eles, ressoando dramaticamente de uma forma que talvez não esperássemos na adaptação de um game centrado em criaturas fantásticas em constantes batalhas.",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2016"," The Warcraft series of ""massively multiplayer online role-playing games"" (or MMORPG if you must) has apparently amassed over 100 million users since it all began with Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994. Ergo, turning it into a 3D multiplex-buster is a no-brainer. Surely? I could foresee a couple of potential pitfalls. Firstly, passively watching a movie is quite a different proposition from playing an interactive game. Secondly, it's not as if we've been deprived of this kind of sword-and sorcery, dungeons-and-dragons, mystical kingdom stuff lately, with Game of Thrones, the Hobbit / Lord of the Rings canon, Sinbad, Jack the Giant Slayer and on and on. You could throw in Star Wars and X-Men for good measure. So can Warcraft stand out from the crowd? With Duncan Jones – creator of the smart and characterful Moon and Source Code – aboard as director and co-writer (with Charles Leavitt) you would expect to find a few fresh twists, but working within this kind of formula there's not a lot you can do beyond amping up the technology. Certainly the 3D motion capture state-of-the art continues to gallop ahead at breakneck speed, and the battle scenes featuring assorted exotic beasts and the fearsome orcs who make up The Horde are handled with the awesome smoothness that only multi-mega-gigahertz of computing power can provide. My favourite sequences in the whole flick were the soaring in-flight episodes starring the splendid gryphon used by King Llane (Dominic Cooper, pictured above) as his personal transport. The way its feathers ruffled in the wind as it soared over mountains and valleys was wondrous to behold. The plot of Warcraft follows that of the original Orcs & Humans. Nutshell-wise, the tyrannical shaman Gul'dan, leader of the orcs, must find a new home for his people because Draenor – which sounds like a fabric conditioner, but is their home-world – is dying (eco-message alert!). Using the evil magic called The Fel, he has found a way to open a portal to the verdant and luxuriant Azeroth, where benevolent King Llane rules over his human subjects along with various elves and so forth. Llane, assisted by a Merlin-like fellow known as The Guardian (an unhealthy-looking Ben Foster) and his top warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel, who might as well have just stuck to his real name), has to stop the advance guard of orcs from building new portals which will to enable the main orc swarm to overwhelm Azeroth (below, orcs with pet). It's a serviceable enough framework which leaves space for splashing on some big emotional characteristics like love, loyalty, courage, betrayal and self-sacrifice as the epic struggle plays itself out, but you may need the pumps going full blast to suspend enormous quantities of disbelief. Jones didn't make it easy on non-aficionados of the Warcraft universe by pitching us straight into the world of the orcs, which are, with the best will in the world, a repulsive-looking bunch of freaks. As if being eight feet tall and lens-shatteringly unphotogenic wasn't bad enough, they're all afflicted with hideous, craggy fangs poking out from their lower jaw, which must make certain forms of social interaction (let alone eating) all but impossible. This reaches a pinnacle of absurdity in the case of Garona (Paula Patton), a svelte and glamorous half-orc who looks like a supermodel, except for the ludicrous little white fangs poking out of her lower lip. There are some fun bits along the way. Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), a sorcerer's apprentice to Medhiv (that's The Guardian's real name), brings comic bumbliness to his efforts at mastering the secrets of wizardry, while Fimmel does the rugged battle-born thing with panache. Dalaran, an exotic citadel floating miles up in the clouds, is a thing of digitised wonder. At the end of the day though, it's what it is – a big-budget commercial franchise spun off from a computer game. After two hours it doesn't really end, it just sets up the next instalment. The last sentence says it all  you dont get the lore behind warcraft  its a still continuing story line with a new expansion to the story this september.  At the end of the day though, it's what it is – a big-budget commercial franchise spun off from a computer game. After two hours it doesn't really end, it just sets up the next instalment. If the ended it in this movie it would make no sence because there is so much more lore that is impossible to put in 1 movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2016"," Warcraft comes to the screen loaded with baggage: not just the weight of a 22-year-old video game empire (and the vast canon associated with it), but the long, bloody trail of failed attempts to bring such games to mainstream movie audiences. On paper, the hiring of Duncan Jones as director seemed to be the missing ingredient lacking from all those previous disappointments; not only an avid gamer with a deep passion for this particular series, Jones also showed a flair for bringing character and intelligence to his previous films, Moon and Source Code. But Warcraft is a much bigger and less unique proposition than either of those, with the games themselves a mash-up of decades of fantasy tropes. Consequently, any personality that Jones might have infused in this massive ($160 million) big screen adaptation gets hopelessly lost in translation. Warcraft is not the worst example of its genre, but it is a tedious and forgettable one: it reeks of corporate branding, its story and characters are intermittently entertaining but largely flat, and its visuals run the gamut from impressive to cheap-looking. In other words, it’s a wash, a generic would-be blockbuster that already seems dated the minute you leave your seat. The plot, adapted from the first game Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, finds hordes of the former creatures – monstrous, shaggy, with arms the size of tree trunks and tusks protruding from their lower jaws – preparing to leave their dying world of Draenor and pass through a portal to the much more idyllic planet Azeroth, which the orcs intend to colonize under the leadership of the evil sorcerer Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). The orcs themselves are divided into several tribes, not all friendly to each other, and the leader of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), has his doubts about the invasion but joins Gul’dan’s advance party nonetheless. Once on Azeroth, however, the orcs must contend with the humans, elves, and dwarves who live there, led by the courageous knight Lothar (Travis Fimmel), King Llane (Dominic Cooper), his wife Lady Taria (Ruth Negga), and the mysterious Medivh (Ben Foster), a mage sworn to protect Azeroth at all costs. War breaks out pretty quickly, as the humans attempt to hold off the orcs long enough to close the portal before the rest of them come through. Add some sinister magic into the mix known as the Fel, a half-orc/half-human woman with shifting allegiances named Garona (Paula Patton), and the usual web of betrayals, battles, spells and powers, and you have the makings of a fantasy story pretty much like every one you’ve seen before, if somewhat less comprehensible. The tale is not helped much by the cast or characters, although remarkably the better effort comes from the orc side. Toby Kebbell’s Durotan is the most complex character in the picture, a creature with real feelings and empathy who is perhaps the conscience of the entire piece. While unrecognizable in his thick CG skin, Kebbell does give a genuine performance underneath all the ones and zeroes, and the much-heralded facial capture work on Durotan yields some dazzling shots. Paula Patton also generates some compelling moments as Garona, but while I could buy her green skin, her tusks prove too much of an unwelcome distraction, not to mention they get in the way of her saying her damn lines. The human team, however, does not hold up its end at all. Travis Fimmel is a void as Lothar, a walking action figure with no inner life, and a half-hearted attempt at a subplot involving his son can’t save him. I tend to like Dominic Cooper, but his bland king here doesn’t do him any favors, a fate that also befalls his poor Preacher castmate Ruth Negga. Junior wizard Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) seems imported from another, perhaps funnier movie, while Ben Foster brings his usual glowering intensity to Medivh – only to have to sustain that for two hours with no variation. We might give the inch-deep characters and leftover Middle-earth settings a pass if the story gripped us from start to finish, but Warcraft proceeds at an enervated pace, with the script throwing just about every well-worn fantasy device it can into the stew and stirring lazily. The battle scenes are more formulaic than fantastic, and while the orcs have some weight and bulk in smaller numbers, the larger scenes turn their numbers into a soup of CG. There’s a real absence of wonder, humor or excitement – it’s like everyone involved knows the paces they’re being put through and gets by at a level of competent mediocrity until they can go home. That’s ultimately what Warcraft is: a competent mediocrity, with more thrills and heart coming from the efforts of the Industrial Light & Magic technicians to make Durotan’s eyes light up than any twist of plot or revelation of character. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is the sense of entitlement it develops when it becomes apparent that this gigantic yet small-minded movie is actually all just a throat-clearing: the movie doesn’t end so much as just stop, with the clear implication that we will all be returning for a sequel. That almost made me hate the picture outright; it’s one thing to imply that another movie is coming when you’re two or three or 13 films into a series, but to not even give viewers a relatively complete experience the first time around – and expecting them to resign themselves to coming back – is both insulting and arrogant. If you’re going to make a movie, make one with a beginning, a middle, and an end, even if they’re just like many others that have come before. But game publisher Blizzard Entertainment, Universal Pictures, and, it seems, Duncan Jones don’t care about that. All anyone seems concerned with regarding this listless, hollow film is brand extension. Warcraft once again proves that video games, with their wholly artificial environments and never-ending, repetitive narratives, don’t translate to cinematic storytelling very well. And it’s ironic that a true feeling of craftsmanship – that some sort of higher aspiration was poured into this — is the biggest thing absent from a movie called Warcraft. ",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2016","Already seriously in the running to take the prize for Worst Movie of 2016, Warcraft may prove that the fabled video game adaption ""curse"" is so strong that it can bring even the most talented of young filmmakers to their knees.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 3, 2016"," You know those videos where some enterprising YouTuber takes all the cutscenes from a game and edits them together into a movie, except theres massive gaps where the gameplay would be, so everything's reliant on in-the-moment-randomness and ultimately makes no sense? A lets play without the play, essentially? Well thats what Warcraft is. It's a confusing, empty film and, while it may not be quite as damnable as some are making out (it's no 2016 companion to Fant4stic or anything), it's a pretty resounding disappointment whatever your thoughts going into it. The advertising didn't do much to instil faith, but I really wanted this one to be good. Its Duncan Jones. High-fantasy deserves better than all the Rings rip-offs since 2003. This year has already had its fair share of duds. But most of all, we need that break-out video game movie that doesnt suck and, while this tried hard, its flopped. Lets not get to the end of year and have Angry Birds (which is totally serviceable, even if its plot is garbage btw) be the best we could do. Its all up to you Fassbender. But while we wait for Assassin's Creed, let's take a look back over Warcraft and look at the four ups and six downs from the much belated WoW movie.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2016"," Needless to add, many millions more people play it without any impulse to go on shooting rampages. Nonetheless, this film version, which carries a 12A certificate despite some highly disturbing imagery, should be approached with great caution. As for the story, it’s a thoroughly derivative clash-of-the-species affair with enough orcs, portals, messenger-owls and wizardry to make both Harry Potter and Gandalf the Grey feel entirely at home. All credit to the director, (the late David Bowie’s son) Duncan Jones, for whipping up some spectacular action sequences, but that didn’t stop me worrying as the final credits rolled that, to paraphrase one of the great practitioners of actual warcraft, Winston Churchill, this video-game spin-off had not reached the end, nor even the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning. Another franchise film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows, follows on, neatly and quite enjoyably at first, from the last outing 18 months ago. But the wit soon gets overwhelmed by a plot twice as preposterous as last time — which is like doubling infinity — ending up in a showdown on a spaceship with Commander Krang, an evil pink alien in the vague form of a really angry squid. And in among it all is a kind of love letter to New York City, which in its own corny way is quite sweet. But these ninja warriors must be approaching the end of their teens now, which surely means the end of the road.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2016"," There are few things certain in the film world. However, up to this point it's been almost universally agreed that video games tend not to translate to the big screen. There are disastrous examples such as Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter in the early 90s, but even the better-received video-game adaptations have generally fell short of their pixelated source material. The first task of any film based on a pre­-existing title is to capture the feel of it, and in that sense Jones has succeeded. The visuals are breathtaking, creating a world that feels legitimately torn from the game, rather than Hollywood's adaptation of it. It's also an interesting take on the fantasy genre in general, with the blunt, honour-driven Orcs given as much of a point of view as the ornate, swaggering humans. There are few films that ever achieve that kind of narrative balance. It's not often that a film suffers from taking too little time to tell its story, but two hours just doesn't seem enough to establish the vastness of Jones's vision and still deliver something with an emotional impact. Durotan has a few quiet, character­-building moments with his pregnant wife before being thrust into the film's main plot, while the rest of the cast are too swamped by action and exposition to create any kind of connection. The result is the moments meant to draw a gasp don't quite deliver, no matter how well rendered the images on the screen are. Then there's the burning question – whom is this meant for? Newcomers will struggle to keep up with the names, powers, cities and twists that are hastily being thrown at them. Those familiar with the game will respect the reverence with which their passion has been treated, but can this kind of narrative really compete with the original version, where the adventure is theirs to choose and experience? If there's such a thing as too much respect for the source material, Warcraft may be guilty of it. Cast members jostle for screen time, but with little building beyond a few brief monologues there's not much chance for them to make an impression. Arguably the most fun is Ben Foster, strutting and elegant as a wizard known as the Guardian. Toby Kebbell, like his Dawn of the Planet of the Apes co­-star Andy Serkis, is an actor who really understands motion capture, as you can see from the way his Durotan has nuance and depth in between the grunts. Other characters are not so lucky. Dominic Cooper looks desperately in need of more lines as the human King, while Travis Fimmel feels like a lead that’s lost his way as chief of the Azeroth army. He’s arguably the biggest disappointment, unnecessarily acting cocky and ultimately a bit unlikeable because he has little to do other than clash swords and quip. If looks could make a movie, then this hoped-for this franchise-starter would be one of the hits of the summer. But that's only half the battle in transporting a popular game from the computer to the multiplex. If the characters are given time to breathe, the inevitable sequel could be promising, but on its own Warcraft: the Beginning doesn't quite hit the mark.",NEUTRAL
"Jun 3, 2016"," Based on the iconic strategy game, this fantasy battle epic will appeal mainly to either the gamers themselves or audiences that love wildly detailed fantasy worlds. Everyone else will probably feel a bit lost when faced with the stream of confusing names, spells and magical phenomena that fill every scene. It looks terrific, and is directed with plenty of energy and personality. But it feels both overcrowded and superficial. With their home world Draenor dying, the orcs need to travel through a portal to the human realm Azeroth to find more life force to steal. One orc chieftan, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), is having doubts about this murderous plan, and thinks peace with humans might be a better option. His rival chief Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and the cackling orc shaman Gul-dan (Daniel Wu) disagree, and set a massacre in motion. Preparing for the attack, human King Llane (Dominic Cooper) turns for help to his top knight Lothar (Travis Fimmel), sorcerer Medivh (Ben Foster) and apprentice wizard Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer). Then they meet outcast half-caste Garona (Paula Patton), and she offers another way to take on the invaders. For the uninitiated, the elaborate mythology is so detailed that it blurs together into something rather incomprehensible. Director Duncan Jones doesn't have time to explain everything, so he charges ahead and just lets the dialogue overflow with references that may or may not be needed to work out what's happening. The film leaps from one strikingly staged battle to another, all cleverly designed to mix digital animation with gothic costumes. It looks pretty amazing in 3D, but the only characters who emerge with any depth are Durotan and Garona, nicely played by Kebbell and Patton under mounds of effects, makeup, fur and teeth. The problem is that all of this action seems to have little real relevance outside the world of a videogame. And the final collision between the two sides is bizarrely overcomplicated by its enormous scale. All of which will leave the film feeling like a mash-up of elements from Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings. What this movie needed was a script that told a clear story with characters the audience could identify with. But these people are like playing cards, placed here and there to deploy their specific skills when needed. There's nothing that pulls the viewer into the conflict; we just sit on the sidelines watching. It looks great, but it's difficult to get excited when the ending hints that this is only, as the tagline says, the beginning.",NEUTRAL

At a time when films of this scale are defined by safety and defenestrated by compromise — at a time when blockbusters are rigorously engineered to appeal to the broadest possible audience — Universal went all-in on a summer movie so niche and nerdy that it makes “Willow” look like “Lord of the Rings,” and “Lord of the Rings” look like “Masterpiece Theatre.” Adapted from Blizzard Entertainment’s massively popular computer game series of the same name and resulting from a visionary deal that Universal forged with the software giant more than a decade ago (long before “Avatar” confirmed the potential upside of such a gamble), the film once seemed poised to bridge the seemingly uncrossable gap between movies and video games. Years passed without any evidence that the project was actually pushing forward, but a steady drip of exciting production news helped sustain interest. When director Sam Raimi dropped out, he was replaced with Duncan Jones (“Moon”) a talented young director with real credibility and a deep-seated passion for the material. When “The Force Awakens” crowded the film’s release date, Universal confidently repositioned “Warcraft” as an early summer tentpole. Now, 10 years and several directors after it was first announced, “Warcraft” is finally here, and not only does it fail to bridge the gap between movies and video games, it self-immolates and swan-dives into the void, illuminating a dark rift that’s even deeper than it is wide. A grotesque, funhouse reflection of modern blockbuster cinema, the film is truly a staggering failure, and there’s no joy to be found in its profound awfulness — an exciting director has burned off several of his best years, a major Hollywood studio has been punished for their ambition and two disparate mediums have exposed the worst in each other. Presented in garish 3D so vivid that viewers can practically feel the movie losing money in real time, “Warcraft” unfolds as though a Dungeon Master were narrating a very expensive episode of “Drunk History.” Essentially a feature-length prequel save for its first two minutes, the film opens with growly narration about how humans and orcs have always been at war, and then jumps back in time to illustrate how the two species first came into contact. Orcs, for those unfamiliar with the videogame franchise, are a species of steroidal homunculi warriors who live by a savage code that seems incongruous with their posh British accents. A nomadic people who rove between worlds as a collective “horde,” these motion-captured monstrosities have braided hair, giant hammers and protruding molars (which they pierce with rings). The ones who have lines are white, and the ones who exist as fodder for the action scenes are green — while this dichotomy almost certainly causes some kind of racial discord in the orc community, it’s also our only means of telling these things apart. The orcs are supposedly a smart species, but they have yet to invent t-shirts, nor can they seem to figure out why every world they inhabit seems to start dying after their obviously evil wizard leader (Daniel Wu as the power-mad Gul’dan) drains the land for fuel. On one hand, it’s hard to respect the intelligence of the orcs when they fail to see that Gul’dan — who has glowing green eyes and feeds his magic portal by literally siphoning the souls of his slaves — is pure evil. On the other hand, the orcs’ blind allegiance to power is one of their most recognizably human qualities. And Jones’ script, which he co-wrote with Charles Leavitt, is nothing if not focused on the orcs’ underlying humanity. Our first proper introduction to their way of life is an appreciably tender moment in which a bland warrior named Durotan (“Fantastic Four” star Toby Kebbell) is goofing around with his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin) in the privacy of their war hut. There’s nothing like watching a weightless, humanoid CG wildebeest use his massive hand to caress his mate’s swollen belly. Of course, a scene like this one only exists to heighten the stakes of the set piece that follows, and Gul’dan has quite a spectacle in store for us: The hunchbacked mystic, having exhausted the horde’s current planet, plans to open a massive portal through which he will lead his army to the realm of Azeroth (a verdant place full of humans who can be used as kindling for whatever dark shenanigans Gul’dan gets up to next). And so Gul’dan leads Durotan, Draka and some other indistinguishable digital cretins into Azeroth, inciting a needlessly convoluted war between orcs and humans. The film’s human hero is somehow even less interesting than his orc counterpart. Like someone took a still photo of Aragorn and faxed it to another franchise, Lothar (Travis Fimmel) is a military man with rangy hair and a glinty smile that says “I’m the least ridiculous-looking person here, so I guess I’m the protagonist?” Compared to the empty and uninspired Lothar, “Avatar” protagonist Jake Scully feels like he fell out of a Dickens novel. When a dorky young mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) warns Lothar that the orcs have spilled into Azeroth, the two men race to consult the reclusive wizard Medivh (Ben Foster, delivering a performance so big that it can probably be seen from space). He divines what we already know: War is coming. Bridging the gap between the two factions is a half-orc, half-human woman named Garona (Paula Patton), who Lothar frees from Gul’dan’s grasp. Painted green and sporting a set of plastic Halloween fangs on the wrong half of her teeth, Patton consistently looks like she’s about to lose a cos-play contest for her own character. But the most troubling thing about Garona isn’t her cheap aesthetic, or her flat affect, or even the fact that the film’s plot would be almost completely unchanged if she were erased from it entirely. No, the most troubling thing about Garona is that a human man had sex with a female orc in order to bring her into this world (even the “Warcraft” community is confused about her lineage, and yet the film bafflingly assumes that it won’t be a problem for newcomers). Garona’s inexplicable parentage — which is fun to mock, but impossible to ignore — epitomizes the incoherent nature of the film’s fantasy world. Jones and co. assumed the unenviable task of chiseling a coherent adventure film from a dizzyingly dense mythology, but the degree of difficulty can’t excuse the degree of failure. Whereas “The Fellowship of the Ring” baked the myths of Middle Earth into every frame and — following Tolkien’s expert lead — allowed viewers to discover its secrets along with its sheltered characters, “Warcraft” unfolds like a feature-length version of a “Previously, on ‘Game of Thrones'” package, blitzing through the plot as though the movie’s only task was to remind viewers of a story they already knew. There’s no denying that fans of the franchise will find more to enjoy here than newcomers, but while familiarity may help lessen the confusion of some plot details, no degree of goodwill for the games will compensate for the sloppiness of the storytelling. For a movie that mostly takes place in three generic locations, it’s almost impressive how poorly each scene connects to the next, as character motivations (and character identities) soon smudge into nonsense. For a film that had the time and resources to pave over any potholes, the only logical explanation for a disaster of this magnitude is that everyone involved lost sight of what they were making. Perhaps “Warcraft” is an argument against the idea that fans are the best people to help shepherd their beloved properties to the screen; whereas many of the most incompetent recent blockbusters have been directed by untested special effects gurus, Jones has proven his bonafides. “Moon” and “Source Code” are the work of an intelligent filmmaker who has an innate gift for mining rich characters from high-concept premises. For someone so skilled to create something this bad, either he was overwhelmed by the scale of the project, or he was too invested in the lore to understand how it needed to be reimagined for an audience who may not share his knowledge or enthusiasm. This is truly a depressing experience. It’s rare to feel such pity for a major studio movie, but watching “Warcraft” bend over backwards to set up a sequel is like watching a desperate paramedic apply CPR to someone who’s clearly been dead for hours. He’s gone. He’s gone. Let it go. Let the battle between orcs and humans end in a stalemate. Call off the fighting and implore both sides to return to their loved ones. Bad movies come and go — “Warcraft” is a tragedy. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Jun 2, 2016","The film surprises in many ways but comes down to big warriors atop fantastical beasts, lobbing big arse weapons at each other's toothy, green-skinned and dreadlock-headed mugs... so what's not to like.",POSITIVE
"Jun 2, 2016"," With the cheapest-looking CGI and crummiest sets ever to have reached the screen, it's up to the plot to save Warcraft: The Beginning. . . 
	The science-fiction chamber piece Moon was so good that it seemed its director, Duncan Jones, might become known for something other than being David Bowie’s son. Warcraft: the Beginning, based on the online role-playing phenomenon that had up to 12 million players at its height, makes one altogether less hopeful. Until there is a film of Tetris or KerPlunk, no big-screen game adaptation will be able to count me among its target audience. Even so, a movie version of anything, be it a book, play or video game, should be comprehensible to viewers with no knowledge of the original entity. The Pirates of the Caribbean series was adapted from a theme-park ride and that still managed to make sense. Warcraft: the Beginning – don’t you just love that optimistic subtitle? – is likely to be unintelligible to anyone who hasn’t spent their lives tenderly caressing a console. 
	The action takes place in two worlds, human and orc, both of which are rendered with the cheapest-looking CGI and crummiest sets ever to have reached the screen. (When someone says, “It’s good to see trees again,” you’re tempted to laugh. Only in an infant-school Nativity might those pass for trees.) The humans are divided into those with RSC accents, such as the King (Dominic Cooper) and his Queen (Ruth Negga), and the rest, including the warrior Anduin (Travis Fimmel). “That was cheery,” Anduin will say after a bleak anecdote. Or: “That went well,” after something didn’t. There’s no beginning to his wisecracks. 
	Then there are the orcs. No, not the Lord of the Rings orcs. These ones have teeny-weeny heads and overdeveloped bodies, as though they’ve disastrously misjudged their weight-training regime, while their jutting lower incisors indicate that orc dentistry is at the rudimentary stage. Some of the orcs are good natured, such as Duratan (Toby Kibbell), whose wife is expecting. When the baby arrives stillborn, the life force is sucked out of a nearby fawn and used to revive the infant. Bad luck, Bambi. 
	Other orcs are proper mardy. Take Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), who is leading his savage army through a portal into the human world. Who will protect mankind? The “Guardian”, Medivh (Ben Foster) – a staff-carrying wizard who has crackling balls of electricity. Well, it takes all sorts. 
	There’s also a young pretender in town: Khadgar (the likeable Ben Schnetzer), an upstart magician who challenges Medivh on the subject of the Fel, a force that has the power to corrupt entire worlds. “Leave the Fel to me,” says Medivh, setting fire to all of Khadgar’s research on the matter. Possibly Medivh is a double agent. Green lasers zap from his eyes and he keeps taking a dip in his font of electricity, which swirls and fizzes with psychedelic colours that suggest he has overdone it with the
	bath bombs from Lush. 
	This genre enjoyed its peak in the 1980s with gory, raucous trash such as Conan the Barbarian and The Sword and the Sorcerer. Those films had outbursts of loopy fun – men turning into snakes, walls built of writhing faces, triple-bladed swords. Yet the mood in Warcraft is gloomy, the colour palette muddy and the aesthetic a bit Pan’s People. I swear I saw dry ice wafting across the set at one point. 
	There are hints here and there of an admirable diplomatic sensibility. Hope is represented by those characters who belong to two worlds or races. The Queen, who is black, and Anduin, who is white, are siblings. Khadgar is torn between alchemy and a normal life. And the climactic battle, as well as the future of peace, hinges on Garona (Paula Patton), who is half-orc, half-human. But these ideas aren’t finessed. They just sit there amid the Christmas-cracker philosophy: “From light comes darkness. From darkness light.” Profound, eh? 
	The film starts out being narrated by Duratan but by the end it’s difficult to know whose perspective we’re following. Jones can’t even find a point of visual interest in the frame. His compositions are all over the place, so the viewer never knows where to look. I spent most of the movie wondering what the opposite was of eye-catching. Whatever it is, that’s Warcraft.",NEGATIVE
"May 31, 2016"," Film adaptations of computer games have tended to be failures. Too often, filmmakers have adapted well known franchises but failed to help them transition from one medium to the other. This year, there are two noteworthy computer game adaptations helmed by noteworthy directors. 2016, it seems, could be the year that Hollywood finally gets computer game adaptations right. At the end of the year we have Justin Kurzel’s Assassin’s Creed to look forward to, but for now we have Duncan Jones’ adaptation of the Warcraft series, which began life as a real-time strategy game and later morphed into World of Warcraft, the biggest and most popular MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) yet released. As a fan of Jones’ two previous films – Moon and Source Code – and as someone who has logged a decent amount of play time with the Warcraft games, I had higher hopes for this film than I might have done otherwise. The result, I’m both relieved and afraid to say, is a mixed bag. Relieved, because there are things in Warcraft (subtitled ‘The Beginning’ in some regions) that are promising; and afraid, because it also falls into many of the traditional traps of this kind of adaptation. The story is set in Azeroth, a peaceful world into which is brought an army of warmongering orcs led by the villainous Gul’dan (Duncan Wu), who has harnessed the power of Fel magic (which draws its power from the taking of life). Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), as commander of the armies of Stormwind, must help King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), protect the humans’ lands and find the source of the evil magic. Duncan Jones and his design team have done a pretty good job translating the look of the games onto the big screen – the orcs are appropriately massive and smashy (but also with the potential for nobility and calm) and the armour and landscapes look the part, even if the whole thing is very CGI-heavy. To some extent, I also felt that the feel of the games was there, although that may simply be down to my familiarity with some of the characters. I can see, however, that a complete newcomer might be bamboozled by some of the fantasy vocabulary. That is not a criticism of the story itself, but more the script and the way it delivers it. The film does its best to be accessible to a mainstream audience, but is repeatedly undercut by thinly explained lore and, in some cases, characters without proper introductions. The structure doesn’t help either. The beginning of the film introduces a whirlwind of new locations, characters and concepts, not all of which are adequately explained. So while the film tries to be approachable, it simultaneously holds its audience at a distance with its sometimes jumbled storytelling. The performances are a similarly mixed bag. Travis Fimmel, leading his first film of this scope, does a pretty good job as Lothar, although his performance, which is pitched between dashing, heroic and slightly unhinged, feels a little like it could’ve used a bit more explanation. Dominic Cooper, as the king, hardly gets enough dialogue to make any kind of impact, and isn’t given any meaningful scenes with his family or friends to make his role really take hold. As the much talked about ‘guardian’, Ben Foster is also sold short by the script, making an important character feel muddled, while Ben Schnetzer, to his credit, develops the initially annoying character of Khadgar, a young and talented mage, into a decent screen presence. The orcish side of things benefits from two of the strongest characters: Paula Patton, as a “half-breed” orc named Garona, is effective, overcoming the character’s lack of real backstory to make an impact, and Toby Kebbel gives an excellent motion-captured performance as noble Durotan, who is at odds with Gul’dan’s schemes. In the end, despite the flaws, this is one of the better computer game adaptations, even if that may be damning with faint praise. Jones holds all the parts together, just about, and the things that work are strong enough to leave an impression. The action is hefty and well done, and there is a pleasing respect for characters on both sides of the conflict, which mirrors the story in the games. The plot, which has changed a little from the source material, is told in an overly muddled way, but enough of it comes through to make for a watchable, if uneven, action film.

"May 30, 2016"," Around seven years ago, I signed on to the online role-playing game World of Warcraft. The notion was to dabble for a week or so and then write a few sarcastic words at the expense of people stupid enough to become addicted to this nonsense. Around five years ago, I finally suspended my account. (I was too busy playing World of Warcraft to write the feature.) At no stage in the intervening two years did I develop any urge to see a film based on the creation. Why would I? You may as well adapt a bicycle or a power tool. Duncan Jones's tragically stultifying film owes its existence only partially to the popularity of Warcraft (the most successful entertainment entity nobody seems to have heard of). What finally got this project creaking into existence was the rise of Game of Thrones. Any old fantasy brain rot will now do, even something as useless as this. Based on the Warcraft games that preceded WOW (get that wrong, critics, and risk being declared an ""epic fail""), the script sticks grindingly closely to the franchise's off-the-peg mythology. This means that, for fans, there are endless opportunities to nod knowingly when Bathrobe of Entar alludes fleetingly to the third Hearthrug War and that, for the uninitiated, there are endless opportunities to catch a little snooze as the dialogue drifts deeper into High Codpiece baloney. Only the most diligent of disinterested viewers will make anything remotely lucid of the indifferently ordered plot. Among other issues, they will be forced to contend with computer-generated imagery that renders at least half the characters (the orcs that is) boringly indistinguishable. Imagine a film in which most of the antagonists wear buckets on their heads and you’re halfway there. Come to think of it, my avant-garde bucket film – I got there first, Lars Von Trier – sounds notably more attractive than the generic, soulless screensaver visuals we get here. Anyway, there is a plot. It seems that, a few years before ubiquitous broadband, a party of orcs burst through a portal from their doomed world and took refuge in the hitherto easygoing realm of Azeroth. If I’m getting this right, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), an orc who looks like all the others orcs, is minded to compromise and believes that, rather than eating the humans alive, his brethren should come to an agreement. He’s very much the Tom Hagen of the operation. Every other orc is Sonny Corleone. Over in the human camp, Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a brave warrior, devotes all energies to honouring the king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga). Paula Patton tries hard as a half-human, half-orc pleb who, we assume, will eventually bring the tribes together. Huge battles interrupt the boring conversation with noisier, even less coherent tedium. It generates no great pleasure to reveal the wretchedness of this grand enterprise. Hundreds of very talented technicians have laboured hard to produce the largely horrible images. More than a few decent actors debase themselves bravely in costumes that would not seem out of place in a Gaiety pantomime. Most depressingly, Duncan Jones, director of the brilliant Moon and the equally strong Source Code, has contributed years to a project that will fully satisfy only the already devoted. Warcraft is a very modern sort of timeless myth. Its unnecessary faithfulness engages a relatively small demographic as it alienates the much vaster mainstream. It is, in that sense, the Ukip of fantasy movies. Let’s end on a positive note. Fans of the consistently excellent Ruth Negga will be relieved to hear that she barely speaks in this lumbering disaster.",NEGATIVE
"May 29, 2016"," The first major misfire of the summer blockbuster season lumbers into view in the form of Warcraft, Duncan Jones’s graceless adaptation of Blizzard Entertainment’s gargantuan video-game franchise. Watching this bloated mélange of derivative fantasy tropes unfold is akin to being forced to follow the efforts of a particularly ham-fisted gamer, with the viewer being jerked back and forth across countless busy CGI landscapes by a plot that’s utterly predictable when it isn’t confusing. As various incoherently shot battles are waged, volleys of glowing energy fired, and shameless sequel-establishing shenanigans indulged, there’s at least ample time to ponder the one interesting question the film posits: Given the modesty of his previous work, what exactly might have lured Jones to this project in the first place? The conspicuous lack of explanation in Warcraft’s opening stretch assumes fan-level knowledge of the material, which for the uninitiated means that names and concepts are bandied around and key locations visited with such speed that keeping up is impossible. Following a good half-hour of head-scratching confusion, two main plot threads finally come into focus, a process aided considerably by the ultimate superficiality of their construction. An orc army presided over by evil sorcerer Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) is making incursions into the world of humans to lay the groundwork for a future orc colonization, with a portal powered by human life force that enables passage between realms, a dangerous reliance on black magic that noble orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) frowns upon. A young human mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) duly gets wind of this plan and informs both knight Anduin Lother (Travis Fimmel) and King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), who exchange troubled looks before seeking out the assistance of magician Medivh (Ben Foster), a mysterious, ambivalent figure tasked with protecting the kingdom. Attempted alliances, infighting and betrayal on both sides, and numerous listless discussions about honor and strategy pave the way to the inevitable big battle between humans and orcs, with extra frisson meant to be imparted by the nascent romance between Lothar and Garona (Paula Patton), a feisty orc-human crossbreed obviously predestined to mediate between the sides. Yet the cursory attention given to these tediously simplistic finale-delaying subplots prevents any of them from feeling consequential, a problem compounded by the fact most of them will only find payoff in the sequel anyway, should there be one. It also doesn’t help that the dialogue is laughably functional, consisting of various modern-sounding platitudes irregularly couched in ye olde worlde inflections, whereby character shading or nuance are superfluous. The actors flail at being asked to deliver such utilitarian utterances, with declamatory woodenness across a range of accents, aside from Foster’s half-hearted attempts to chew the scenery. Given that fantasy is hardly a genre renowned for the depth of its conversation, the stilted dialogue wouldn’t be such a handicap if the world it references were portrayed in more inspired fashion. Yet Jones’s take on the Warcraft universe is little more than a bargain-basement rehash of Peter Jackson’s Middle-earth, with wall-to-wall, often cheap-looking CGI serving as an unhappy substitute for the New Zealand landscape. The result is a realm at once overstuffed with space-filling flourishes and strangely empty, a world so relentlessly synthetic it’s hard to get a grasp on and thus even harder to care about. The arbitrary way in which this world has been pieced together is only enhanced by the shoddy editing both within scenes and between them, as the rapid, random cuts during battle sequences induce nothing but a confusing lack of spatial continuity. The only governing principle for cutting between locations seems to be that a character has finished declaiming their lines. With recent blockbuster benchmark Mad Max: Fury Road having demonstrated that keeping dialogue to a minimum, crafting a convincingly fantastical, yet still tangible world, and paying heed to basic spatial considerations can be profitable virtues, it remains to be seen whether Warcraft’s wearying commitment to inarticulate, half-baked artificiality will also prove a money-spinner; perhaps the fact that the film still often feels like its video-game antecedents is the point. Yet even if Warcraft does indeed turn a profit, it will function as a depressing cautionary tale about what Hollywood does to its newcomers regardless: the paycheck aside, is moving from modest science-fiction fare to anonymous franchise fodder really an enviable trajectory?

"May 29, 2016"," After this, I’d even give Derek Acorah a pop. I’m now convinced the curse of the video game movie is an actual thing and someone in Hollywood needs to act fast. If the dreadful run of gaming movies were just down to bad luck, it would have ended here. With Peter Jackson fresh out of Tolkien and the masses hooked on Game of Thrones, this is the perfect time for a big-budget franchise based on online fantasy game World of Warcraft. But the gaming spirits, perhaps still reeling from Bob Hoskins’ Super Mario Bros, haven’t been ­placated. Grim, over-stuffed and barely comprehensible, the ambitiously titled Warcraft: The Beginning could be bad enough to double up as Warcraft: The Ending. At least Jones, the son of David Bowie, may get some credit for his loyalty to fellow fans. I’m guessing his film is pretty faithful to the game. Sadly, as I’ve never played it, I also had to do a lot of guessing during the film. What I did glean, with some help from the hefty ­production notes, is that the CGI-heavy setting is the world of Azeroth. This appears to be the human realm, although it does offer a few non-speaking roles for dwarves and funny looking chaps with flappy ears. Dominic Cooper rocks a bouffant barnet to play King Llane Wyrnn. His main warrior is a dull action man called Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) who spends most of the film moping around in an ill-fitting suit of armour. Then there’s an equally moody magician, helpfully called both Medivh and The Guardian (Ben Foster), who is like an entirely serious version of the camp warlock from fantasy spoof Your Highness. There’s also a younger wizard, Khadgar (Pride star Ben Schnetzer), who has dropped out of magic school and senses a great evil on the rise. That evil comes through a magic portal. These are the brutish orcs who, despite expensive CGI, look like they were teleported from the 2006 Eurovision song contest where they successfully represented Finland. They’ve fallen under the spell of a mad warlock called Gul’dan who wants to enslave the Azerothians. But there are dissenters in the ranks. Durotan (a motion-captured Toby Kebbell) is a tribal warrior who has grown tired of massacring puny humans. Then there is Garona (Paula Patton) who as an orc/man hybrid (hence the green skin and the joke shop fangs) has split loyalties and a soft spot for human hunk Anduin. But the humans are far less ­interesting. There’s no character development and very little humour – omissions that will be felt by GoT and Lord Of The Rings fans. All it has going for it are the battle scenes, a couple of which are impressively staged. But this could and really should have been so much better.",NEUTRAL
"May 27, 2016"," While I can't say much about the first two Warcraft games -- released in the mid-90s -- Warcraft 3 is perhaps one of the most influential video games of the 21st century, giving birth to the MOBA genre of video games and the multi-billion-dollar e-sports industry that followed it. It was also the foundation of perhaps the most successful online game in history, World Of Warcraft, which -- at its peak -- had over 12 million players paying monthly subscriptions to play it. If any video game franchise could break the trend of the horrible video game adaptation films, it should be Warcraft. But no. Despite being directed by Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code; he's also the son of David Bowie) and having a CGI budget seemingly the size of a small country's GDP, Warcraft the movie never quite manages to come together as enjoyable. While fans of the franchise can most likely derive some satisfaction out of seeing the faithfully recreated video game settings, the wooden acting, breakneck pacing and excessive amounts of fantasy jibber-jabber mostly renders the film nonsensical to everyone else. Without a preamble of any kind, the audience is dropped right into the action as the Orc Horde -- led by the warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) -- prepares to step through the Dark Portal to escape from their dying world. Without enough live-sacrifices on their desolate planet to keep the Portal open long enough for all of them to pass through, the Orc vanguard immediately begins attacking human settlements, taking the people as live-sacrifices to allow the rest of their war-band to follow. This draws the attention of Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the commander of the human army, who must now muster the forces of Azeroth to stop the Orcs from bringing over their reinforcements and taking over the world. The film's aesthetics is perhaps one of the most faithful adaptations of a video game I have ever seen. From the motion-captured Orcs to the prop and costume designs, Warcraft definitely looks the part. However, casual viewers who're not into the original source of Warcraft (or just fantasy in general) may find the costumes excessive, what with the ornate weapons and armour donned by the humans of this world, not to mention the over-the-top magic effects (yes, somebody gets turned into a sheep). Sadly, that's pretty much all there is to enjoy in the movie. Warcraft feels very distinctly like a second film in a well-established trilogy, when it is in fact the first. That is to say it explains pretty much nothing, taking us to new fantasy locations at a dizzying pace, where we meet an ever-growing list of characters with abstract names spouting poorly explained fantasy concepts. Words like ""the Fel"" and ""Kirin Tor"" are thrown around liberally, without any good explanation from any of the characters as to what they actually mean. The film takes a very ""tell, don't show"" approach to all of its plot points and characters, making the whole film just feel empty of any real tension or emotion. Characters like the guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) or the noble-hearted Orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell), both of which are central characters in the plot, are simply described to us by other characters, while the film doesn't really do anything to make us see those character traits. For example, Durotan is described as a noble and capable leader who is concerned with the degradation of his people at the hands of Gul'dan. Yet, we never really see any real comparison between those Orcs that ""have the Fel"" and those who don't. We never see him address his men, or lead them in heroic combat, inspiring them with his battle-cries. Instead, we have those things told to us by characters like his wife (Anna Galvin) or his right-hand man, Orgrim (Robert Kazinsky), pretty much the only two Orcs he has any kind of meaningful interactions with. The film's rather erratic pacing and dispassionate approach to storytelling made me feel detached from everything on-screen, feeling like I've missed a movie or two before this one, missing out on lots of pre-established plot points, even though it should be the first movie in what I assume is (at least) a trilogy of films. Strangely enough, this film feels to me like a series of video game-cut scenes stitched together, cutting out all the gameplay parts that actually give everything meaning and context. Perhaps the next film will be better, now that we've had this one to build upon. We know it's going to feature everyone's favourite human-raised Orc after all.",NEGATIVE
"May 26, 2016"," After years in development, the problems of staging Warcraft become clear. Epic world-building aside, Jones’s ambitious but cumbersome game-play needs more wonder, wit and thrills. Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Rather than leaping straight from a feted debut to the gryphon-in-flight heights of a studio tentpole, Duncan Jones took the cannier, Chris Nolan-esque route of following his minimalist Moon with Source Code’s head-spinning branch-out. But that slow path wouldn’t necessarily prepare anyone for this franchise-seeding RTS/videogame adaptation’s challenges. Tasked with brokering a peace between event-sized thrills, gaming lore and high fantasy, Jones embraces Warcraft’s world with laudable commitment: but when it comes to charging it with life, sheer bulk gets the better of him. The road to Azeroth begins distinctly enough, with Jones and Bill Westenhofer’s FX army forging a complex orc society. Where Middle-earth’s hordes merely drooled, great warrior Durotan (Toby Kebbell, eyes emoting through the CGI) engages in bedtime bantz with his pregnant wife. These hefty and heartily characterised performance-capture orcs stand tall among many mighty and mightily detailed CG achievements, particularly in the cases of Durotan and Gul’dan (Daniel Wu), a warlock using soul-sucking magic to punch open a portal into the human world of Azeroth. But plot problems kick in early, as the orcs’ reasons for invading Azeroth (their own world is dying) are skipped over and their human counterparts struggle to make orc-sized impressions. Despite Travis Fimmel’s restrained twinkle, the knightly Lothar is a bit Aragorn-lite; Ben Foster, meanwhile, tosses off all restraints as a magician dabbling in some dark ham. Paula Patton impresses as the half-human, half-orc Garona, though her panto fangs play havoc with the talking bits and her history remains frustratingly opaque.  All three at least try to imbue the familiar fantasy stuff of spells and speech-y blurb (about loyalty, honour, family) with character, but the need to build Warcraft’s world stifles certain vitals: drive, levity, audience investment. While Ramin Djawadi’s buff score and Jones’ gryphon’s-eye shots of swarming battle sequences stir the blood, the brutish fights themselves are done’n’dusted rather swiftly, sometimes effectively (one swishy disembowelment scores), sometimes with fun-sapping brevity. Hammer, head, game over. Some shock deaths show narrative daring, but it’s hard to get that involved when the two-hour runtime is too crammed to let in emotional air. Lacking the longer-form luxuries of Game of Thrones, Warcraft occasionally manages to feel both rushed and dull, impressively staged and disengaged. True, a few quips in the abyss help to alleviate the lumbering piece. But there aren’t enough leavening influences on show, beyond Ben Schnetzer’s endearingly flummoxed trainee wizard, a few fan-pleasing Easter eggs and a nifty, snarling end-tease for a sequel. If the likelihood of Warcraft netting the returns for that second bout is debatable, what’s more certain is that it feels incomplete in itself.

"May 26, 2016"," With millions of people having played Warcraft, there is likely a wealth of nostalgia-seeking players looking to relive their teenage adventures. Yet, it’s not just this select audience Universal are appealing to; Warcraft: The Beginning has a $160 million budget, suggesting the studio hopes families and other fantasy fans will venture out to see the film. Unfortunately, Warcraft will do little to ensnare those not already enamoured by Azeroth’s long and complicated history. While visually spectacular - the CGI is phenomenal - attempting to understand this world and relate to these characters is something of a challenge. First, an admission. At its peak, World of Warcraft had over 12 million online players. I was one of them. For six months, I was a Night Elf, killing boars, completing fetch quests, and admiring the beautifully rendered world Blizzard had created. Yet, even with this experience under my belt, attempting to follow Duncan Jones’ adaptation was a struggle.  The film opens with members of the Orcish Horde, led by the evil Gul’Dan (Daniel Wu), travelling through a large green portal to the aforementioned world of Azeroth. Soon after, a young mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) incidentally discovers that a dark magic has manifested itself in the world, and with the help of a reluctant Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) informs King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper).  Eventually, we are introduced to Medivh (Ben Foster), the Guardian of Azeroth, who teams up with Anduin and Khadgar; their plan is to capture one of the monsters and find out where 'the Horde' came from. On their journey, the trio - along with some other canon fodder warriors - are quickly ambushed by Orcs in a wonderful set piece, eventually capturing the half-Orc, half-human, Garona (Paula Patton). She persuades the humans to meet Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the lead orc protagonist, who has hatched a plan to defeat Gul’Dan and usher in peace between humans and Orcs. Of course, things don’t go as planned; characters die, two CGI battle takes place, and the audience is left wondering “Wait, who is that again? Was their name Luther or Aragon?” This is the main overarching plot, yet, somehow - in amongst the boardroom meetings and battles - a dire romantic subplot takes place, Medivh’s intentions are questioned, and Khadgar becoming the next “Guardian of the Realm” is hinted at countless times.  It becomes almost impossible to keep up, not helped by the lack of individual character development. A quick example, concerning our lead human protagonist, Anduin. Both his relationship with his plot-device son and with Garona are rushed, underdeveloped, lacking nearly all emotional oomph (his apparent longstanding friendship with Medivh is non-existent).  Even with conversations attempting to give the film some emotional gravitas, there’s constantly a lack of personal conviction, leading to further stale meetings concerning unpronounceable locations and war strategies. This isn’t helped by some lacking performances; many of the actors portraying humans are phoning it in. Conversely, it is those underneath the CGI who are most enjoyable; Kebbell’s Durotan expresses fantastic amounts of emotion through his Orc’s face while Wu’s Gul’Dan is genuinely menacing. Undoubtedly, comparisons will be made to Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, three films that gloriously show off a fantasy land (Middle Earth/New Zealand) while developing loving relationships between characters. What makes my heart sink is that Warcraft could do this - instead of wide shots of Shire-like locations, Warcraft is forever trapped inside castles, only giving the viewer glimpses of this magnificent world. This is particularly evident when we travel to Dalaran, a city floating in the sky, inhabited by the great magi. It’s a fun, fantastical moment that contrasts with the serious tone of the film. Meanwhile, at a different meeting, we are briefly introduced to some Night Elves, who look both ridiculous and fun.  It’s these fantastical elements that are the highlights, yet they are fleeting and bogged down by the film’s more serious elements; it’s easy to forget Elves were such an integral part of the video game. Perhaps, with someone like Guillermo del Toro, we would have seen more of these creatures, but as it stands they are sidelined for the central conflict. After all the plot building, it’s frustrating the film ends with no real conclusion. Warcraft so obviously wants a sequel (thus The Beginning tagline), you can’t help but feel a little shortchanged. After two brilliant films (Moon, Source Code), it feels like the fanboy within Duncan Jones got carried away with Azeroth's minute mythology, leading to a film filled with tonnes of references to the wider world but no real soul of its own.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2016"," Where does one even start in turning the world of World Of Warcraft into a movie? The game, played by millions but a mystery to millions more, has countless characters of all sorts of fantastical races – dwarves, elves, werewolves, ghouls. It has no specific plot and no end point. That Duncan Jones, who penned complex narratives in Moon and Source Code, has managed to herd all its random elements into a story that, just about, coheres is impressive and it’s clear that every frame has been passionately crafted. It’s unfortunate that, like the ugly green baby that becomes central to its plot, the result is a hard thing for anyone but its creators to love. Condensing this sprawling universe into a few words is tough, and the movie struggles to squeeze it into two hours. Via a giant stone doorway, a tribe of Orcs comes to the land of Azeroth, looking to claim it as their new home. One Orc, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), a new father, rebels against his power-hungry leader Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) and tries to establish a truce with the king (Dominic Cooper). It doesn’t go to plan and there is much battling. There are far too many lead characters, the result being that none is given time to expand beyond an archetype. This becomes a particular problem when Jones starts killing them off, because it’s hard to join in with his grief for people who feel like passing acquaintances. So much effort is expended keeping every sub-plot heading in the same direction that Jones has no time to breathe. For a film in which a sizeable proportion of its cast is green, it takes itself fairly seriously. If this is the beginning, hopefully the next chapter will remember to deliver the fun too.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2016"," At some point somebody’s going to make a great videogame movie that will break the curse. While Duncan Jones’ Warcraft certainly isn’t the worst videogame movie ever made, it’s sadly not the champion we were hoping for. With the orc world Draenor on the brink of becoming a barren wasteland, a war party is sent through a portal by their sorcerer leader Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) to claim the human realm of Azeroth for The Horde. As the humans scramble to deal with this threat, orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) realises that Gul’dan’s dark magic will destroy this green world too. Can he find a way to forge peace, and can human knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) keep his king (Dominic Cooper) and kingdom safe? Warcraft has a lot of material for us to get through (species, institutions, terminology), and it’s clear how much love Jones has for this world. At its best, Warcraft feels like a heartfelt epic fantasy throwback, but with the budget and effects to deliver amazing battle eagles, mountaintop citadels, magical face-offs and orcs beating the crap out of each other. At its worst, it feels like a clunky Dungeons & Dragons session. So, the good: first off, the effects are pretty excellent. It’s a beautifully realised world; the manifestation of the mages’ magic is great, and above all, the mo-cap orcs look stunning. Durotan is fantastically detailed and emotive, and Kebbell’s performance shines through, creating a character that feels strong enough to carry a film on his own. However, it’s a very busy movie, and the focus is constantly fluttering around Azeroth as characters fly, teleport and ride from one location to another. The humans’ Durotan equivalent is twinkly eyed badass Lothar, but there’s also rebellious young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), noble king Llane (Cooper), his equally noble queen Taria (Ruth Negga), and incredibly powerful mage/Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster), while half-orc Garona (Paula Patton) is torn between her human captors and the orcs who enslaved her. There’s not a huge amount of time for Durotan, or whichever character sparks your interest, and characters’ physical journeys are kept too separate for any kind of group dynamic to form. At some point there was obviously a real effort made to give each of them a proper backstory, but what we get in the movie is fragments of character as each one expresses regret over a connection missed or lost. The intended goal seems to be showing us that they all have more in common than they think, which plays nicely into the film’s themes of immigration and climate change, but the result is that most of these characters feel frustratingly underwritten. There’s real promise here, particularly when the actors (notably Fimmel and Patton, the latter of whom thankfully ditches the slave rags for armour and a sword relatively quickly) get to enjoy themselves, but everyone involved, cast and filmmakers, takes things so seriously that there’s a weird lack of joy to it. Foster does well with his aloof Guardian, but everything Medivh does signposts a later plot development. Schnetzer’s Khadgar is occasionally fun but his journey is all too frequently sidelined. There’s no room for anything to breathe and it’s lacking the necessary momentum to make that problem irrelevant. Fans of the games may find a treasure trove of Easter eggs and the visuals are undoubtedly impressive, but it’s far too choppy to keep any sense of momentum or to ever really get us invested in any one storyline, which is a shame given Jones’ admirable willingness to kill off characters. When Warcraft is weird, it’s fun (portal travel-induced labour, anyone?), and there are moments when it comes alive (the orc combat sequences are pretty good). However, it’s messy, overstuffed and clunky, the dialogue frequently becomes functional or ponderous, and our love of battle animals and scrapping orcs can only carry us so far. A director’s cut might run more smoothly and offer some of the characters time to actually develop, but what we’ve got for now is an ambitious disappointment with its heart in the right place.

"May 26, 2016"," When  dealing with a whole new universe and unique set of rules to abide by and adhere to, as an audience member it’s imperative we are treated, initially, as an idiot. We need a comprehensive understanding of the landscape we inhabit, and yet in Duncan Jones’ Warcraft: The Beginning, we are thrown in without any palpable knowledge, as though it’s expected we’ve played, conquered, and studied the popular video game this title is based upon. You give the talented filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, assuming everything will fall into place and eventually make sense, but it doesn’t – it gets worse. While the King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) maintains a peaceful civilisation in Azeroth, any such serenity is threatened by the impending arrival of a fearsome, intimidating race; as orc warriors and their families seek in invading and colonising the land, as they flee their former, uninhabitable home. Though prepared for war and a savage attack on mankind, the authoritarian orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell) has different ideas, and wants a peaceful outcome – but with a hesitancy to trust their new enemy, the likes of the courageous and loyal Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) and the spiritually gifted duo Medivh (Ben Foster) and Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), ready themselves for the forthcoming, intense coming together that is likely to leave one race triumphant, and the other extinct. The conflict leaves Garona (Paula Patton), a human/orc hybrid, caught somewhere in the middle, unable to identify herself with either side. Though naturally siding with the humans given our rather inevitable resonation with that one particular side, it’s intriguing that we meet Durotan first, painting him out to be the protagonist, and ensuring a potential connection is formed with the role, as we see intimate, relatable moments take place between himself and his pregnant wife, endearing us to their cause, and making sure we can identify them so when they are depicted as savage, inhumane beasts, we know they’re much more like us that we think. But, as is the case throughout this underwhelming affair, even the aforementioned positive becomes detrimental to proceedings, for the blurring of the line between good and evil is too strong, and it becomes a challenge to determine who you’re rooting for at any one point – which is not ideal during a movie where a war is on the horizon. Of course this is in line with the video game, whereby you can play as either a human or an orc, but in a cinematic endeavour that sense of impartiality is simply counter-productive. Any attempt to connect to our emotions is short-lived and unsuccessful too, as while there is a potential sub-narrative concerning Garona, with the ability to tap into human themes by having a mixed race character who doesn’t feel as though she quite belongs to either side of her ancestry, we deviate so carelessly away, as though afraid to ever get too deep. The lack of emotion is jarring too, as you never once care if any of the characters live or die, and as we’re dealing with a conflict scenario, to not have any investment in their survival makes for a distinctly cold experience. What doesn’t help in this regard is the lack of any true protagonist, with no focal point of any kind. In The Lord of the Rings we enter into this new, fantastical world through the eyes of an underdog in Frodo. Warcraft is crying out for a Frodo, a character we can embody and adopt the perspective of, to see this world through their eyes to help us understand it, and feel engaged with it. There is the occasional funny moment of light relief, but they remain so few and far between, which is a shame because had Jones been inclined to be more self-deprecating and have the film affectionately ridicule itself, to be hammy and play up to the more kitsch elements, it could have been beneficial to proceedings, but instead this title takes itself far too seriously. This production may be titled ‘The Beginning’, but on this showing it would be a spectacular surprise if we ever saw the middle, or the end.",NEGATIVE

The role-playing video game ‘World of Warcraft’ was a clunky Frankenstein thing, cobbled together from the most obvious parts of countless fantasy franchises. So a certain level of respect is due to ‘Moon’ director Duncan Jones for attempting to inject new life – and a hint of relevance – into this tired, so-last-decade concern. Sadly, his best intentions aren’t enough: like its ten-foot anti-heroes the orcs, ‘Warcraft’ is noisy, lumbering and not terribly bright. Much of the problem lies with the cast – Travis Fimmel is a walking charisma void as strapping warrior Anduin, a sort of Aragorn without the personal charm (Aragormless?). He’s the land of Azeroth’s best hope against those murderous, dimension-hopping orcs, and he’s backed by a plucky band of equally forgettable white dudes with bad hair: Dominic Cooper as well-meaning dullard King Llayne, Ben Schnetzer from ‘Pride’ as trainee wizard Khadgar and Ben Foster, totally misused as the magical Guardian. Their snaggle-toothed orc foes have a touch more personality: despite being buried under layers of CGI, Toby Kebbell gives real warmth to Durotan, the chieftain for whom randomly massacring humans doesn’t always guarantee a good time. He also embodies Jones’s most interesting and tricky conceit – that newcomers to your land might not all be there to wreck the place (though, the film implies, most of them probably are). The total absence of originality here is notable, but it needn’t have been a problem: with a tighter plot, a touch of humour and some peppier, less slab-fisted action scenes this might actually have worked – a kind of ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ meets ‘Lord of the Rings’. But ‘Warcraft’ is content just to trundle along at its own, ponderous pace, chucking in dwarves, spells, love scenes, giant eagles, clay monsters, silly names and battle scenes seemingly at random. Fantastical, perhaps, but far from fantastic.

"May 26, 2016"," It’s easy to predict whether Duncan Jones’s take on the world-conquering online role-playing game World Of Warcraft is for you. If you take delight in names like ""Orgrim Doomhammer"" and have a high tolerance for randomly scattered apostrophes and superfluous ""h""’s, it could be your film of the summer. If not, you should avoid it at all costs. Our setting is in the world of high fantasy, a genre based on Tolkien but largely stripped of his poetry and mythological depth. It’s marked generally by elves, cod-medieval societies and more magic than Gandalf ever employed. Terrys Goodkind and Brooks, Dungeons & Dragons and Robert Jordan are its mainstays; George RR Martin’s Song Of Ice & Fire is a nastier offshoot. But for World Of Warcraft, it is the background where millions of gamers save the world every month. The theme is lebensraum. The hulking orc inhabitants of a dying world are led by Dominic Wu's sinister sorcerer Gul’dan - there’s that apostrophe – to the world of Azeroth, arriving in a remote corner of the kingdom of Stormwind. Among the performance-captured Horde is Durotan (Toby Kebbell), an honourable brawler and family orc who comes to doubt Gul’dan’s motives. Meanwhile on the human side, Stormwind’s King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and his right-hand man Sir Anduin Lothar (Vikings’ Travis Fimmel) must find a way to stop this incursion, enlisting their old friend, the magician ‘guardian’ Medivh (Ben Foster). The half-orc Garona (Paula Patton) provides vital translation services between the two sides, while beings of goodwill struggle to find common ground and others plot betrayal. This is all ancient history in the game, brought to life almost too vividly. If The Lord Of The Rings aesthetic was a restrained, almost elegiac depiction of a decaying world, this is a civilisation in full flower, bathed in sunshine broken only by the shadow of the odd passing griffin. Our human heroes wear wildly impractical plate armour and Technicolor tunics straight out of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, while the orcs are overly familiar tusked apes, though at least given impressive weight and bulk by the effects experts at Industrial Light and Magic.  But the pristine setting never meshes with Jones’s efforts to give emotional reality to his army of characters, who cannot escape their tropes: leader, hero, warrior woman, mystic. Durotan and the orcs of the Horde fare best, because little exposition is needed to establish their primitive society. But the human characters keep solemnly alluding to (presumably) game business far outside the scope of this film. Fimmel’s barefoot knight, who displays hints of impish charisma and an uncanny talent for almost crying, and Patton’s conflicted Garona manage to carve a little space temporarily, but they too are derailed by endless scenes of magic being waved about. Where Jones deserves most credit is in daring to kill named characters in a summer blockbuster. Admittedly, two of those might as well have ""Dead Meat"" tattooed on their foreheads, but most come as a surprise (at least to those of us unfamiliar with the history of Azeroth) and some are genuinely upsetting. Still, it’s a far cry from Jones’s elegant debut Moon or the time-travel cleverness of Source Code. While there are pleasures here for fantasy fans and game players, for everyone else this fantasy is likely to prove so high it’s dizzying.",NEUTRAL
"May 26, 2016"," Let’s go back to the beginning. In 1994, Blizzard Entertainment released its real-time strategy game Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, in which orcs from the world of Draenor used a magical trans-dimensional portal to invade the human world of Azeroth. Its success led to two sequels – but it was not until a full decade later, with the emergence in 2004 of ‘massively multiplayer online role-playing game’ World of Warcraft, that the game would become a global phenomenon. Two years later, Blizzard partnered up with Legendary Pictures to work on the inevitable film version. Notorious video games adapter Uwe Boll put himself forward as director, but was swiftly rejected. Blizzard wanted to go back to the world(s) of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, building a potential movie franchise from the origin story for what has become an expansive gaming multiverse – but production was delayed over concerns that viewers might find this saga of not just humans and orcs, but also dwarves, elves and wizards, too close to the mythos of Peter Jackson’s then recent Lord of the Rings trilogy. Eventually Duncan Jones – best known as the director of cerebral SF flicks Moon and Source Code, but also himself an avid longterm player of the game – was brought on board, and the result is a sprawling, effects heavy fantasy epic. As power-hungry orc warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) leads an advance party through a Dark Portal from the depleted lands of Draenor to fertile Azeroth, clan chieftain and new father Durotan (Toby Kebbell) begins to wonder whether Gul’dan and his destructive ‘Fel’ magic might in fact be the cause of all the Orcs’ woes, rather than their salvation. Meanwhile on the human side, Commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), brother-in-law to the unifying King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), sees a threat to Azeroth’s very existence, and joins forces with young renegade magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and tough-loving orc-human halfbreed Garona (Paula Patton), even as Medivh (Ben Foster), the magic-wielding high protector of Azeroth, seems off his Guardian game. Much as Llane rules a kingdom of tolerance and equality (and is himself in a mixed-race marriage with Ruth Negga’s Lady Taria), the screenplay from Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) affords a balanced view of both sides in the conflict, each with their own heroes, rebels, traitors and megalomaniacs. The basic story (colourfully immersive fantasy idyll invaded for its resources) is essentially Avatar without the SF – a debt that is acknowledged with Lothar’s aerial swoopings on a winged gryphon, and with the blue tones that characterise Azeroth magic. There are also obvious debts to Lord of the Rings, although this time around, instead of Gollum we get a golem. Last but not least, the monstrous medievalism of Army of Darkness (whose director, Sam Raimi, was for a time attached to helm Warcraft: The Beginning) is evoked by an early reference to a ‘boomstick’, and by a deep seam of fun running through all the surface earnestness. It is all too easy to mock a film like Warcraft: The Beginning for its silly names, its arcane background lore and its cheesy nerdism (as though Star Wars or superhero flicks are so different). Yet while Jones’ film is certainly not for everyone (what film is?), it should also be remembered that, besides the legions of tween escapists, fantasy freaks, Tolkien zealots and Dungeons & Dragons devotees for whom this material may prove a perfect fit, there are also over 100 million registered users on World of Warcraft. So the film seems likely to recruit a substantial army of viewers in sympathy with what it has to offer – and they will be amply rewarded with the grand spectacle of the film’s design work, the immensity of its world building, and the relentless mobility of its storytelling (where characters always seem to be in motion, whether carried by horse, wolf, gryphon or teleportation spell). And if the ensemble roles here feel rather stock, at least they are humanised – or orcised – with the occasional funny, idiosyncratic line. Best of all, the mo-capped, computer-generated orcs come with a real sense of bulk to match their bravado. The first time they are seen fighting, in Elwynn Forest, they are genuinely terrifying – and while Warcraft: The Beginning is far from a horror film, nonetheless it shows countless extras and even the odd principal getting hammered, sliced and crushed to their doom in brutal combat sequences. This is also, as the film’s title suggests, only the start of things, ending with one key battle, rather than the war, being won (and lost), and with a lot of gestures towards the next generation and a complicated future (more miscegeny and mayhem!) in store.

"May 25, 2016"," Epic in scale, but overly-familiar in shape, Legendary Pictures’ “Warcraft,” is so easily identifiable it begs the question: will fantasy films ever break free from the ruling influence of “The Lord of the Rings“? Genres typically proliferate in directions far beyond their seminal works; sci-fi films like “Metropolis,” “2001: A Space Odyssey” or “Star Wars” all have their own vision. Yet the high fantasy fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien, which soared to popularity in the 1960s, still retains a tight hold on most sword-and-sorcery imaginations. “Warcraft” may be a loose adaptation of video games with sci-fi leanings, which theoretically should break it out of the mold, but its collision of men and orcs, with a few dwarves and elves in the mix, ultimately feels like yet another disciple of Tolkien’s fantasy commandments. Impressive and pedestrian in equal measure, “Warcraft” goes to great expense to translate Blizzard Entertainment‘s sprawling video game fantasy environments to the big screen. Ironically, it is most successful at bringing more far-fetched ideas like Orcs and magic to life than it is regular people. Human characters are thin and plastic, leaving most of the story’s big emotional beats to fall flat. Driven by the directorial hand of Duncan Jones (“Moon,” “Source Code“), an avowed fan of the games, “Warcraft” has its own distinct vibe at times, but the struggle of appearing broad enough for general audiences and deep enough for hardcore fans results in a stalemate wherein neither demands are satisfied. Blizzard’s game world has been detailed in dozens of releases, and elements from the first game, “Warcraft: Orcs and Humans,” form the spine of the film’s scenario, while inspiration from other installments fill out a fairly contained story. However, in streamlining the plethora of games down to feature-film size, Jones and writers Charles Leavitt and Chris Metzen end up inadvertently crafting a nearly generic tale. With their homeland of Draenor having been plundered into dust, a race of warrior Orcs harness dark magic power to open a gate to Azeroth, a human-inhabited world they can despoil at their leisure. Not every Orc is given to unthinking violence, however. Durotan (Toby Kebbell), leader of the light-skinned Orc clan, is skeptical of blind commitment to this course of action. After all, their last world was stripped bare. Will the horde learn from its mistakes or just march on once again repeat past ravages in their new home? In terms of VFX, “Warcraft” is largely a triumph and Industrial Light & Magic‘s work on the Orc horde is the film’s chief asset, coming off more convincing than their human counterparts. The massive characters, scarred and wrapped in straps of leather and spiky armor, with great tusks thrust from their lower jaws, pass inspection even in lingering close-up. Kinetic battles do not fail them either; in the first skirmish especially, the Orcs are imposingly dangerous. And the mo-cap actors who play the primary characters are barely detectible in each visage. Daniel Wu, playing the dark shaman Gul’dan who leads the Orcs’ aggressive migration, is so perfectly submerged in the character’s digital costume he’s completely unrecognizable. Even when an actor does appear more obvious, the sheath of pixels is utterly transformative. The human forces however, fare far worse than their green-skinned antagonists both emotionally and visually. Led by a stiff Dominic Cooper as King Wrynn and represented primarily by the knight Lothar (Travis Fimmel, carrying his first major lead role to decent results), their accoutrements are so overly polished they appear phony and cheap. The humans’ rote, overriding guideline is Stop The Orcs, but neither the introduction of an old mage, Medivh (Ben Foster), who has his own agenda, or young magic-user Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), helps rejuvenate the narrative. Jones and cinematographer Simon Duggan frequently employ a ground-level camera that recalls the recent work of Emmanuel Lubezki with cosmic and occasionally gorgeous flourishes. However, the application of style is inconsistent. Worse, the rhythm of movement from scene to scene is strange and awkward. ”Warcraft” always seems like it might be just about to find its footing, a feeling that never resolves itself, even two hours in. As the action flits from one location to another, “Warcraft” struggles to establish a sense of place, contributing to the impression that Azeroth is a patchwork quilt of rote fantasy stage settings. Ruth Negga stands out, in a far-too brief role as the Queen, but most major characters are distinctly chiseled out of stony fantasy conventions. Caught between warring forces is human/Orc half-breed Garona (Paula Patton), an outcast from both factions. Her conflict becomes the film’s most captivating and emotional by far, yet Patton has the unenviable task of playing the role through a distracting set of little tusks. She receives no shower of ILM‘s mo-cap fairy dust, but instead, just a spray of green skin paint. Garona may have the best arc in the film, but she rarely feels as if she belongs in the world — a cruel irony for the outsider, and a further example of why “Warcraft” fails to connect.",NEGATIVE

"May 25, 2016"," The World of Warcraft online game apparently had 12 million players at its peak, and every single one of them is going to need to turn up to see this – with their extended families – if it’s ever going to get past its first instalment. It’s an expensive, high-fantasy epic reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. And there’s much to admire in its ambition, its design, even its politics. But there’s also a whiff of the John Carter about it. Like the 2012 Martian flop, it’s a complex, jargon-heavy, deadly earnest battle epic, short on star power and with more than a touch of 1970s fantasy art about it. Its greatest battle could be against widespread indifference. Newcomers have a lot to get up to speed with here. Our home world is Azeroth, a Middle-earth-like realm along the lines of medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarves, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes. Azeroth’s stability is rocked by a sudden influx of orcs, who pour in from another world through a magic portal. These orcs aren’t the anonymous monsters of Tolkien lore; they’re more like intelligent ogres, with tiny heads, tusk-like lower canines, and giant hands with fingers the size of human arms. When it comes to orc style, the art directors have really gone to town – or at least to the abattoir. Accessories include dreadlocks, piercings, hides, pelts and not just bones but entire animal skeletons. One badass has rhino skulls as shoulder pads, another has piercings through his tusks. “We must summon the Guardian!” say the good folk of Azeroth at the sight of these invading orcs, referring not to a leading liberal newspaper but a wizard in a tower, humourlessly played by Ben Foster. We first find this long-haired mage working on his sculpture, wearing leather trousers and no shirt – never a good sign. Together with the young king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga), her brother (Travis Fimmel – think Aragorn without the charisma) and a young apprentice wizard (Ben Schnetzer), they must mount a resistance. The prospect of a predominantly white, European realm being invaded by foreign, primitive, darker skinned hordes (they are actually called the Horde) might set alarm bells ringing in our current climate of immigration anxiety. Is this a veiled Ukip broadcast? Or a pro-Trump one? Nobody suggests the orcs are there to steal Azeroth’s jobs or exploit its benefits system, thankfully, though they are intent on overrunning their adoptive country and sucking the souls out of all its living creatures. To its credit, Warcraft does blur the us v them battle lines. The first character we meet is Durotan, a principled orc chieftan and new father, played in expressive performance capture by Toby Kebbell (he’s lighter skinned than other, more evil orcs but let’s not dwell on that). Durotan has his doubts about the soul-sucking orc leader and attempts to broker a deal with the humans. There’s also Garona, a green-skinned half-orc, half-human with divided loyalties. Played by Paula Patton, she’s one of the story’s most intriguing characters, a tough-talking warrior concealing a traumatic past. We want to find out more about her, but between plot demands and the speech impediment caused by her prosthetic dentistry, we don’t really get to. That’s part of the problem with Warcraft: there’s a lot going on and yet we’re never quite engaged with it. In The Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbits’ idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for – one that 20th-century Europeans could easily relate to. Here, we barely see Azeroth outside the royal castles and wizards’ towers and epic battlegrounds. The heavy use of CGI, and its occasionally awkward interactions with the live-action elements, only serves to distance us even more. Much processing power has been put in the service of spectacular, bludgeoning combat, but the images are somehow insubstantial, and we rarely feel the heat of the battle. Perhaps both problems are down to the film’s computer game origins. Director Duncan Jones, a self-professed Warcraft fan, has clearly put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story, but it’s questionable whether it was ever really merited. There’s a terminal flimsiness, as if this virtually-derived world hasn’t quite assumed three dimensions.",NEUTRAL

"May 24, 2016"," The orcs, wizards and warriors of Warcraft clomp determinedly onto the big screen in Legendary Pictures’ live-action take on the 20-year-old video game series. The result is a 3D sword-and-sorcery adventure whose CG-heavy look and cartoonish action should work for gamers and hardcore genre fans, even if the flat-footed drama may put off mainstream audiences and limits the chances of the property – already turned into novels and comic books - becoming a long-running movie franchise. Box office prospects are best in the international arena and Universal Pictures is launching the film in a number of territories over the last weekend in May, two weeks ahead of the June 10 North American release. Opening after a string of similarly targeted comic book movies could limit its reach, though sharing some genre buzz with TV smash Game of Thrones might prove a marketing plus. Focusing on the beginnings of the Warcraft saga, the film echoes the structure of the game - which really took off in 2004 as a ‘massively multiplayer online role-playing game’ in which players choose an avatar from one side of the conflict or the other – by telling its story from both human and orc viewpoints. Looking like early ancestors of the Incredible Hulk, the orcs are eight-foot tall monsters with tusks and a nasty attitude. When a power-hungry wizard uses magic to open a portal on the orcs’ dying home planet, clan chieftain and family man Durotan (played, with plenty of CG enhancement, by the UK’s Toby Kebbell, from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) joins hundreds of his muscle-bound mates in the invasion of Azeroth, an Earth-like world with all the trappings of medieval Europe. Azeroth’s human defenders are led by gryphon-riding warrior commander Lothar (Australian Travis Fimmel, from TV’s Vikings), a rather wimpy king (Dominic Cooper), an apparently good magician (The Finest Hours’ Ben Foster) and a sparky apprentice wizard (Ben Schnetzer). In the hands of director and co-writer Duncan Jones (who previously earned plaudits for sci-fi outings Source Code and Moon), the film takes a long time to build dramatic momentum and gets interrupted by what seem like unnecessary plot points; some of them, perhaps, geared towards potential sequels. The CG and motion capture work that goes into the orc characters and most of the sets is impressive - Life of Pi Oscar winner Bill Westenhofer leads the visual effects team – but it doesn’t always meld easily with the live action. The film (rated PG-13 in the US) ends up feeling unconvincing and generic, with nothing to compare to either the dramatic heft of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy or the raunch and gore of Game of Thrones.

"May 24, 2016"," The epic battle at the center of “Warcraft” isn’t the clash between humans and orcs. That’s just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the commodity they’re working with. It shouldn’t take a mage to foresee that this pricey and preposterous adaptation of an online gaming phenomenon was preordained for artistic mediocrity. With little concern for all those already perplexed at the mention of orcs and mages, “Warcraft” plunges headfirst into a fantasy realm teeming with mythical creatures, magical spells and exotically named characters and locations. It’s a take-it-or-leave-it approach likely to have most audience members opting for the latter, though devotees of the immersive role-playing source material may have an entirely different experience. If so, Universal will have to hope they storm the box office early and often. Otherwise the studio could be looking at one of the biggest duds of the summer. That’s despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones, who helmed the lower-budget sci-fi wonders “Moon” and “Source Code” and labors mightily here to craft a solid emotional foundation in his script with Charles Leavitt. The “Warcraft” games — which have radically declined in popularity from a high of 12 million regular users in 2010 to a recent low of close to 5 million (so low the company behind it no longer releases subscriber counts to the public) — were never meant to have the narrative depth of “The Lord of the Rings,” or even “Game of Thrones.” But the film cribs freely from both of those sources anyway, as well as “Star Wars,” “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,” “Avatar” and numerous other recent blockbusters. The orcs, a race of giant warrior beasts, flee their dying homeland of Draenor through a portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth, where they wage a full-scale attack on unsuspecting humans for control of the land. Orc soldier Durotan (Toby Kebbell, like all orc players, working in performance capture) questions the brutal ways of his clansmen — led by warchief Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and power-hungry warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) — and believes a compromise without bloodshed is possible. His counterpart on the human side is Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of TV’s “Vikings”), a knight devoted to serving his benevolent king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga). Durotan’s fierce mate Draka (Anna Galvin) delivers an adorable orc baby early on, and Lothar’s son Callan (Burkely Duffield) is determined to impress his father on the battlefield. Those family ties are duly exploited for maximum melodramatic impact, as the dual protagonists rage and question and mourn and soulfully ponder the complexity that exists on two sides of any conflict. Ditto Garona (Paula Patton), a slave claiming to be half-orc, half-human, who makes her way through the portal and finds herself torn between the two sides. She quickly gets cozy with Lothar, but it’s hard to take Patton or the character seriously with her “Star Trek”-alien-esque green skin and the oversized fangs jutting out from her jaw, looking like a last minute find in the Halloween store bargain bin, and making her sound like she has a mouth full of magic beans. And that goes to the root of the problems with “Warcraft”: it’s an unwaveringly earnest film that never owns up to exactly how campy every character, every conflict and every new realm truly is. Ben Foster has another central role as reclusive wizard Medivh, a “Guardian” of Azeroth who has been not so subtly dabbling in dark magic. He’s introduced sculpting a golem (surely you’ll recall the old chestnut about Chekhov’s golem), shirtless and wild-eyed, but it takes Lothar quite some time to piece together the warning signs. Medivh should be fun, but Foster’s deadpan turn is, like the movie around him, a drag. With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production, “Warcraft” aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. It fits into a long line of visually audacious Hollywood gambles: In success you wind up with a sleeper that few see coming, like “300” (or, if you strike the bull’s-eye, a phenomenon like “Avatar”), but the ones that miss — “The Spirit,” “Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,” “Sucker Punch” — tend to tank hard. Boasting more than 2,000 visual effects shots, it’s dispiriting to think about the time, energy, planning and precision that went into “Warcraft” when the final product brings to mind those animated advertisements for iPhone app games. So good at making the most outlandish elements of his first two films seem completely credible, Jones can’t find a way to get this cartoony spectacle to soar. His heartfelt approach to the material only underlines the silliness. Production designer Gavin Bocquet, costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo and visual effects supervisors Bill Westenhofer, Jeff White and Jason Smith lead the heavy lifting on the artisans side, since what the producers essentially purchased with the source material is a collection of locations, wardrobe, weapons, and spells. “Warcraft” ends with a set-up for a sequel, but also the feeling that if this is what combat looks like, it’s time to give peace a chance.",NEGATIVE
"May 24, 2016"," Ten years after game maker Blizzard Entertainment announced its intention to take the megahit multimedia property Warcraft to the big screen, it arrives in a striking blend of pricey practical and digital effects. As with many “high fantasy” epics, once you get past the costumes and lingo, the abracadabra and inevitable elves, the movie’s story is as simple as its visuals are elaborate. Beneath the richly textured layers of motion capture, animation and 3D modeling lie the basics: conflict, survival, family, loyalty. While the enormity of the undertaking is evident in every frame of the sci-fi medieval-ish action saga, director Duncan Jones manages, for the most part, to keep it from lumbering. With an emphasis on craft over war, the characters are front and center, and those that are partly digital creations are among its most memorable. They have heart. But if you’ve never played Warcraft the game, can you care about Warcraft the movie? Given the ardent global following of the franchise, will it matter? For non-aficionados, the two-hour experience could be more concise, but it’s no ordeal. Neither, though, is it consistently involving. If you haven’t already invested in the self-serious mythology, it can feel borderline camp, if not downright dull — or both, as when an uncredited Glenn Close intones platitudes from on high about darkness and light. Yet there’s no question that it’s a breakthrough in both storytelling and artistry for features based on video games. And compared with another medieval-ish tale, the soporific Hobbit trilogy, this international production is a fleet and nimble ride, likely to conquer overseas box offices and make a solid stand stateside. With three films on Jones’ résumé, the exponential growth of the budgets and fictional universes at his command is notable. The built-in muchness of the new material, along with its body-slamming battles (what the MPAA calls “extended sequences of intense fantasy violence”), makes it a far cry from his minimalist Moon. In that film and Source Code, the trippy intersection of technology and human identity was Jones’ subject. Here it’s his method, with leaps in CGI and motion capture on the order of Avatar’s seven years ago, and just as dazzling in their artifice. The screenplay, credited to Jones and Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond), tells the origin story of the war between humans and orcs, a race of green-blooded giants. The orcs have invaded Azeroth, a planet where humans, dwarves and other humanoids live in peace but with standing armies at the ready, led by the brave Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), scarred in body and soul. As the bass rumble of voiceover by the orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) explains, “Our world was dying, and I had to find my clan a new home.” Durotan is a fair and revered leader with exceptionally expressive eyes. Soon after the orcs arrive on Azeroth — through an otherworldly birth canal of sorts that prefigures the birth of Durotan’s son — the chieftain becomes an insurgent against the orcs’ de facto leader, the warlock Gul’dan (Daniel Wu). Gul-dan practices a malignant brand of magic that spares no one, not even his loyal war chief, Blackhand (Clancy Brown), and wreaks havoc throughout the story. But the nature of his powers is made hauntingly clear when he casually extracts the life force from one of his many prisoners, a masterfully realized bit of horror imagery. Along with his dauntless wife, Draka (Anna Galvin), and steadfast second-in-command, Orgrim (Rob Kazinsky), Durotan seeks an alliance with humans. Besides the warrior Lothar, Azeroth’s main players are the gallant King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper, wisely underplaying); his dignified wife, Lady Taria (Ruth Negga, likewise); and the ultimate mage, Medivh (Ben Foster, definitely not underplaying). Like many a gifted channeller of powerful forces, Medivh is paying the price, and in the process providing the movie’s most extravagantly hammy moments. The humongous golem he’s sculpting in his isolated tower is the first red flag that he’s several glyphs around the dark bend. A reluctant but curious young apprentice mage, Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), stirs things up, to Medivh’s deep dismay, and offers a touch of comic-sidekick relief. But it’s the half-orc, half-human Garona (Paula Patton) who plays a pivotal role, and not just as a crucial go-between in the negotiations between Durotan and Lothar, who understandably falls for her. The movie’s female characters are few, but they’re all formidable, and none more full-blooded than Patton’s turn as the tough Garona. Human-proportioned (her orc tusks are petite), she’s a survivor — of imprisonment and abuse born of intolerance for interspecies miscegenation. Rather than turn that into a lesson, the screenplay turns it into drama. In a story whose key strength is its interest in both sides of the human-orc war, Jones and cinematographer Simon Duggan strip things down in a few scenes that have the primal eloquence of classic Westerns: A trip on horseback over mountains becomes an occasion for campsite confessions; a secret meeting in a desolate canyon brings mutual suspicions and unilateral betrayals into the open. The balance between those sequences and the battles, with their brutal swordplay and thwacks of flesh and bone, won’t suit everyone, and the sections where you might zone out will depend on your taste. But the movie is character-driven every step of the way. That’s why, even if the world created by Jones and his talented design collaborators, both old-school physical and cutting-edge digital, isn’t seamlessly believable so much as staggeringly crafted, it casts a spell. Combining primitive textures (hides and sun-bleached bones) with the glowing whoosh of magical elements, Warcraft is a big-screen, 3D game that the viewer enters, to the martial beats of the elegantly ominous score by Ramin Djawadi (composer of the Game of Thrones theme). Its use of multiple cameras to film the motion capture performers in the same take as those playing human characters is one of the ways that it’s new. And then there’s Durotan’s eyes, and Garona’s grit. Dramatically and technically, Warcraft gives the concept of “hybrid” new punch.",POSITIVE
"May 24, 2016"," Critics throw the term “soulless corporate filmmaking” around with abandon, but movies like “Warcraft” really manage to redefine the term. A film adaptation of the hugely popular MMORPG (that’s Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game), this latest video game adaptation ranks near the bottom of the deadly genre. Imagine “Battlefield Earth” without the verve, or the unintentional comedy, and you’ve got “Warcraft.” With his first two films, “Moon” and “Source Code,” director Duncan Jones took high-concept science-fiction stories and spun them into taut tales that never lost sight of their characters or the toll of the extraordinary circumstances in which they’d been placed. This time around, sharing screenplay credit with Charles Leavitt (“In the Heart of the Sea”) — based on story and characters by Chris Metzen — he’s trying to wrestle with too many characters and locations and motivations and subplots, all in a movie that’s clearly intended to be but the first of many. The result is a monument to excess, both narratively and in the ubiquity of the visual effects. Unlike, say, “The Jungle Book,” which was entirely artificial yet came off as completely organic, it’s hard to lose sight of the green-screens here, especially when the warlike Orc characters, who boast some of the least expressive character design since the aliens in “John Carter,” stand next to the film’s human beings. Those two species wind up side-by-side when the Orc wizard Gul’dan (voiced by Daniel Wu, “Into the Badlands”) opens up a portal between their world and the magical kingdom of Azeroth, ruled over by King Llane and Lady Taria (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga, coincidentally also co-starring in “Preacher”). Lady Taria’s brother Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel, “Maggie’s Plan”) is one of Azeroth’s great warriors, although he wishes his young son weren’t following in his footsteps. And then there’s Medivh (Ben Foster), a powerful wizard who is the Guardian of Azeroth, although young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer, “Pride”) suspects that something is amiss amidst the Jedi … or rather, the Kirin Tor, the secret society of magic that protects the kingdom. On the other side, we have the mighty Durotan (voiced by Toby Kebbell, “Fantastic Four”), a deadly Orc warrior who is nonetheless a creature of principle, making his way through the portal with his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin, “Smallville”), as well as human-Orc half-breed Garona (Paula Patton), whose alliances aren’t necessarily fixed. There’s a lot of running around and yelling and scheming and go-to-the-place-and-get-the-thing-ing, but none of it is particularly entertaining; like most movie versions of games, it will no doubt leave fans of the original wishing they were in charge. For the rest of us, there’s not even that sense of fun that comes from the sort of film that plays like a small child dumping all his action figures out on the living room carpet to battle each other. A good chunk of the disconnect can be attributed to cinematographer Simon Duggan (“The Great Gatsby”), who makes every location in “Warcraft” — from the king’s stately castle to the Orc forests to Medivh’s magical lair — look fairly artificial. Even if this was an attempt to emulate the online game, the big-screen results offer no visual pleasure. And the generically percussive action score composed by Ramin Djawadi (“Game of Thrones”) doesn’t help much either. The cast seems mostly adrift, with only Schnetzer giving what might be considered an actual performance. The usually reliable Foster is reduced to gadding about like a prog-rock Jesus in a series of robes that make him look like he’s posing for the side of someone’s van, and poor Paula Patton gets saddled with a sad pair of novelty-store fangs. (To her credit, she makes the green body makeup work; if the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever expands to include superhero-with-a-law-degree She-Hulk, we’re looking at a real contender here.) “Warcraft” promises, or threatens, sequels, but then so did “Super Mario Bros.” And come to think of it, if forced to watch either of these video-game movies a second time, I’d probably vote for the plumbers.",NEGATIVE
