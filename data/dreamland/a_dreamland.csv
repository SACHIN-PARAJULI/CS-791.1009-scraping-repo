"Dec 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Robbie is always a dream, but Dreamland seemed to fumble around in how it was told. Narrated by Finn Cole's sister, it follows the story of a young man in pain from his absent father trying to help a fugitive (Robbie)."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Weirdest thing about this film is that virtually no one in this american dust bowl drama is American. Most interesting thing as well.... bit boring. Oh I nearly forgot, longest shower scene ever. Can I suggest watching Badlands instead, its really good, Dreamland is not."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entretenida historia dramática, una historia simple pero muy bien contada. Buenas actuaciones, con poquito hace que los personajes te importen (y no solo los protagonistas, los padres y la hermana también logran generar simpatía y entender sus motivaciones en el poco tiempo que aparecen en pantalla)."
"Jan 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A truly bland unimaginative film with a plot worthy of a TV soap. One of those films where you can spot the plot line from a mile away, no surprises. A couple of hours of my life I will never get back."
"Aug 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This film turned out to be one of the surprises of the year, offering some rare style from moviemakers I'd not heard of before. Production values, visual design, and performances are first class with strong naturalistic use of dramatic locations, transporting the thinking viewer into some bleak, dust-battered landscapes. First time feature writer Nicolaas Zwart creates an interesting variety of characters to propel this study of a wounded, escaping female bank robber (Marot Robbie) holed up in the barn of a struggling 1930s dustbowl farm – in turn, being assisted by the owner's downtrodden young step-son (Finn Cole)  

Co-writer, director and score composer Miles Joris Payrafite works well with Award-winning cinematographer Lyle Vincent, creating a moody atmosphere with eye-popping shots of massive dust storms blanketing barren farmlands.  For some, this could be familiar ground, but the cast of above-average performers and strong visual treatment should keep the patient viewer fully engaged. There's a winning star turn by young Darby Camp, as the son's adoring young sister.

A largely unnecessary scene featuring a seduction in a shower is overlong and somewhat detracts from the general flow of the story, along with some F-bombs that filter through. As in most movies, there are the odd details that don't always work, but these are minor compared to many - and with all the modern innovations for sound, some of the post production voice over narration was a little muffled and hard to hear – otherwise a slick and thoughtfully enjoyable entertainment."
"Jun 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Set in the dust bowl of 1930s Texas, young Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) is looking for a way out.  When he finds an attractive and manipulative bank robber (Margot Robbie) on the run hiding on his family's property, he is torn between turning her in for the reward or running off with her to Mexico.  Dreamland is a surprisingly well-crafted film, filled with nicely framed and blocked shots, some effective camerawork (including some great tracking shots), and sound performances from Cole and the seemingly always reliable Robbie.  Sadly, the narration feels out of place and unnecessary and there are a bunch of jarring shots of the ocean cut into scenes, but the film's merits outweigh its shortcomings."
"Feb 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Pretty boring and very simple plot. But at least Margot Robbie gets nekkid. And I like Finn Cole as an actor. Travis Himmel was kinda weird not wearing his usual viking costume. Kidding.
"Jun 28, 2021",NEUTRAL,Robbie as always worth the price of admision. Dreamland is no exception. She is definately one of the most talented women in showbiz.
"Jun 9, 2021",POSITIVE,Amazing movie from Margot Robbie it was so good and at the end was shocking to me but it was amazing
"May 16, 2021",NEGATIVE,"It was painful to watch a movie try so hard to become ‘one of those' films. The kind that takes you into the past, pulls on your heart strings, sits you on the fence between melancholy and yearning. 

Dreamland tried to pull a Gatsby / Notebook/ Tonya etc etc but failed miserably. It pulled out all the stops as if on a checklist ; 1) artistic still frames-check 2) verbally poetic voiceover -check 4) slow motion frames-check 5) mid century Wild West-check …. But the story took way too long to develop, in so much that there was no time left for any real bond to form between the characters. 

The film, to me, truly echoed its hollowness when after confessions of love and forever, and a lifetime of waiting to go see his dad in Mexico, it took one bank robbery (and a random persons death) to freak Eugene to bits. 

The edge of desperation that should have existed within each of the characters when living through such difficult times, was altogether absent. 

Every actor has their own brand of something, something they bring to every role; Brad Pitt has his easy humour, Leonardo has his intensity, Meryl Streep has her cheeky eyes, And Margo Robbie has her tough nut exterior hiding a girly vulnerable core…however, unfortunately, there was a counter balancing softness needed for the character of Allison Wells that Margo Robbie doesn't intrinsically have. 

Perhaps had someone else played the character, For example - Blake Lively, Carey Mulligan or even Alicia Vikander … it might have been a bit more palatable. 

Robbie is like a unicorn at a gas station, she stands out and is unable to not be Margo Robbie and become Allison- it's not her fault though, I strongly believe she wasn't cast right for this role. 

And that's why it's impossible to relate to her, impossible to find any authenticity between the characters. She totally devours every frame she is in, it is impossible to believe that someone as strong as her Allison could hold anything but contempt for the character of Eugene.

Cole plays an okay Eugene, mainly because Eugene didn't really have much of a role. He (Eugene) vaguely reminds me at times of Orlando Blooms ‘Paris'…no, not that cole played Eugene as well as Orlando played Paris, but that Eugene the character is as pathetic, dreamy and disappointing as Paris was, played so perfectly by Bloom. 

It's weird, the movie leaves you wanting more, but not more of this movie, more of something else. 

I suppose in that respect the title is adequate."
