"Apr 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis is a master... 

If they had of kicked off Star Wars with him at the helm it would have been better than anything Lucas did"
"Apr 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unwatchable. Go watch Tremors instead.
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie and Dune 2 are some of the best films to come out in a very long time. A must-see
"Apr 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I watch a lot of good sci-fi. All the Terminators, Predators, Aliens, AvPs, Stargate, Startrek, etc. The original Dune was horrible in everyway possible. This dune was even worse and more boring than the original. The second Dune is just as bad. Probably the worse movies of any genre I've ever seen."
"Apr 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's just the start for this whole new world, so wouldn't want to hate it, until seeing part two... However I loved it! The characters are building up to they're potential form."
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"slow, kinda inconsistent, hoping part 2 and others will be better"
"Apr 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"AMAZING MOVIE, AMAZING ACTORS, WRITING, PLOT, AND ACTION! I HIGHLY RECOMMENED WATCHING IT!"
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,My first attempt at watching this failed due to it being very slow and just plain boring.. the good reviews did not match up! Saw the reviews for part 2 so decided to suffer through. Hope it was worth it!
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,pretty good adaptation of the book. wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great special effects, acting, action, and overall execution of many of the ideas of Frank Herbert's Dune. 9.2/10"
"Apr 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Pacing is a bit slow at certain scenes but the exploration of the lore and the characterization of the main characters were excellent. Soundtrack was spot on with the tense atmosphere.
"Apr 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great cast, great special effects, great story. Love the movie."
"Apr 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,The 1984 Movie was the best even compared to this! Paul is so much more in the original movie. The new Paul is just a pampered aristocrat and the actor can't emote he is lacking and dead faced. Modern actors are all dead pan looks and no emotion just graphically airbrushed stand-ins. I love the story so much I have watched the new movie about 3 times. The original I have watched at least 50 times.
"Apr 5, 2024",POSITIVE,This film was absolutely excellent and finally adapted a difficult story into a sensical film unlike the previous Hollywood attempts. Exactly the refreshing movie that jaded theater goers needed when it came out. I'm very excited for the sequel.
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,2nd one makes this better
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Lets hope it's building for something great in part 2.
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Until this film people thought dune was unadaptable to the big screen but Denis Villeneuve proved them wrong!
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dune is overrated for me personally. The story is nothing special, the acting is lukewarm, and the explanation of what is happening is rather weak. The only good thing about Dune is the effects/production"
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it, it's beautiful, slow but not boring."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,i don't find the movie to be great i felt it was too slow it was hard to get into these characters the main character did like nothing whole movie which bugged me but when dune part 2 it should be better but this movie just was fine i like the cinematography and the score but everything else was ok 76%
"Apr 2, 2024",POSITIVE,not bad much better than the original for once
"Apr 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best Sci Fi epic of the last 30+ years. There isn't a negative aspect to this film. Denis Villenueve does it once again, just like with Blade Runner 2049, creates an immersful, deep, & rich world. One I can't wait to go deeper into."
"Apr 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,A little boring. It can't stand on its own at all because it's just world-building for the second part and doesn't really have any payoff. But really good acting and cinematography prop this movie up.
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excellent storytelling, stunning visuals."
"Mar 31, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A little slow? Yes. A little plain? Yes. A magnificent technical achievement? Absolutely. An awesome cinematic experience? Of course. Many people tend to forget that this is just an introduction; the first part of something bigger, the preparation of the table for the big banquet..."
"Mar 31, 2024",NEUTRAL,"""Dune"" (2021) garners praise for its cinematic scale, visual and auditory magnificence, though some critics find its pacing and tone challenging. The performances, especially Timoth√©e Chalamet's, are lauded, but the film's seriousness and lack of humor have drawn mixed reactions. Its narrative feels like a prologue, leaving audiences eager yet unsatisfied, awaiting a sequel for closure‚Äã."
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,Overrated. I don't get the fuss about the movie beside the esthetics.
"Mar 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"üçÖ 7.0/10


2h 35m long L'Oreal Paris commercial. Grade B+"
"Mar 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The story line and the acting are very good, however it does not need to be that long. It could be half the time if all the scenes of staring into the distance and panning the scenery was cut down significantly. It made the story drag needlessly."
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Hands down one of the best films ive seen since my mother took me to see Fellowship of the ring in 2001 in the cinema.
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"Caveat; In order to fully appreciate the plot and not be lost initially, it helps greatly to have read the book or have seen the 1984 David lynch version first. If you already understand the ""Dune ""universe"" you're in for a stunning visuals and epic updated version!"
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"Epic. In every aspect, just epic.."
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,That was a huge waste of 2+ hours of my life. Nothing about this movie called my attention besides the good actors that it had. It was slow and boring and we had to pause it 3 times to take a break so that we didn't fall asleep out of boredom. I don't really understand how this got so many great reviews.
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,Could barely stay awake!
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I liked it until I realized it was to be a multiple-part series.  Adapting a book to the big screen takes time and obviously requires a longer movie run-time, but waiting years between releases is a major turn-off.  Haven't seen Part 2 and likely won't."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing in every way except for the fact the movie had an unsatisfactory ending.
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune: Part 1 is a film that I pay of respect towards rather than I enjoy watching it. This is because it is extremely difficult to follow if you haven't read the books.
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,A bit slow but still built on the characters and loved it overall
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Extremely well done.  The music and cinematography in particular are outstanding!
"Mar 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Haven't finished watching it yet ‚Ä¶ just over halfway through‚Ä¶sometimes it's a bit slow going and I lose interest, but I have to say, the worst part of this movie is Rebecca Ferguson's acting‚Ä¶.omg!!! Her constant whispering and forced dramatic faces is the main reason I can't focus on this movie. How the heck did she ever get this part???? She needs to go back to Acting school or find another career‚Ä¶."
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! Watched 4 times already
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Only thing holding it back from a 5/5 is the slower pacing.
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie just gorgeous, would watch again!"
"Mar 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,Solid film. A little too slow in the beginning.
"Mar 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,Me u viera gustado que le dieran mas tiempo en pantalla adem√°s es muy violenta
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Great start!! It sets the story for something bigger.
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring. üò¥ 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was dogsh*t. Clearly, noone read the book. So much was altered and/or left out. Some acting was atrocious.  Some actors shouldn't have even gotten their roles. Chani wasnt an annoying little b. Dogsh*t"
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"5/5. Hits all the marks and does so with great casting and exceptional visuals and sound. Was it faithful to the books? No, but realistically since he stated from the beginning, he intended to only do the book in two movies, that wasn't realistic. I think it hit the marks it needed to tell the story. If you want a more faithful telling, I'd suggest the Sci-Fi channel's mini-series, because while lacking in visuals and sound, did a much better job on that end."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"An immersive and impressive portrayal of the novel, letting the viewer bask in the stunning imagery and world-building.  Puts every other adaptation of this work to absolute shame."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing!!! Best sci-fi movie in literal years
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"never read the book but i LOVED the movie, both one and two. Beautiful cinematography, interesting characters and really cool costume design. My favorite part about it was the world building. Super unique and creative."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Great ....a saga is born
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,I literally made an account so I could rate this movie. I think about this movie daily - it's my Roman empire.
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"1984s Dune is so full of David Lynch's somber atmosphere, so intriguing... Villeneuve's watered down version is some kind of Star Wars, but boring"
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,I love that I watched it about four times now.
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think they put way to much money and time in that movie for it to turn out like it did. I was very very disappointed with Part 1 and now disappointed with Pt 2, esp the fact that it seems ti imply a PT 3- I hope not.  The 1984 version was so much better, and the actors did a far better job with alot less money. I stretched to give it a 3....."
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best movies i've seen. It doesn't compare to anything.Such great actors and all praise to Denis!
"Mar 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,it was a pretty good movie
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nothing about it is good. Skipped through the entire thing. The story isn't any good. The acting is wooden. The dialog is atrocious. Just not for me.
"Mar 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,Movie started out very slow but got better as it went on. Plot was confusing at times. Overs well done movie just needed to be shorter.
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have no words. This is cinema at its greatest. The acting is great, it is the perfect mix of action and dialogue, and the plot is amazing. The only sci-fi thing I can think is better is the original Star Wars or the book version of Dune. (So much for no words)."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,I love to kick back and relax to a three-hour transhumanist space opera with elements of social science fiction. Helps me unwind in the evening.
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"La primera parte de Dune combina muy bien la pol√≠tica, la narrativa de ciencia ficci√≥n y una variedad de personajes cautivadores y de nueva generaci√≥n (en el caso del cast). Adem√°s, se destaca bastante por su calidad visual (espectacular fotograf√≠a) y un dise√±o de sonido excepcional que complementa a la perfecci√≥n la narrativa (si uno se fija, una de las mayores tendencias en rrss, corresponde a contenido con la m√∫sica del metraje, realizada por el maestro Zimmer).
"
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I have seen in a long time. I've watched it 3 times. I usually do not rewatch movies.
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Slow but beautifully shot with interesting world building. The movie takes time to take off but the overall experience is quite spectacular. Acting, cinematography, direction all top notch. A worthy adaptation that even non book readers can follow and enjoy."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was a long, drawn out, boring film."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A film that was at once wonderful and mediocreüîÜ

When it comes to the technical and visual aspects, it's hard to find a better technical execution and special effects in recent years. A film whose sound was in wonderful synergy with what was on screen. In this respect, at least, Hans Zimmer was at the top of his game. The visuals were also very spectacular and evoked powerful emotions. I believe that emotions might have been even more powerful in the cinema in 2021 than they are now on TV.

However, as for the story itself, as someone who has not read the books, it was too drawn out and slow to watch. The most exciting part of the over two-hour film was the last 15 minutes. It does, however, give hope that the second part will be more interesting and with more action. Perhaps after watching the second part, I will understand why the first part was portrayed rather slowly.

Nothing bad can be said about the acting. Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was an extremely believable and interesting character. He conveyed the serious side that Skarsg√•rd has managed to do in the Chernobyl series for example, but in addition, there was a deeper mystery to this film that made you believe that this was an individual with maniacal tendencies."
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"A fantastic rendition on the first half of the Dune book, and beautifully shot and acted too."
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,One of my favorite movies of all time. A great movie with a great cast.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very nice story.. but very slow and boring to watch
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Interesting story, if you look into it a little beforehand. Very nice pictures and good characters, even if a little sterile in places."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,The force armor and welding way was off. See the original. Instead.
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Watched first 20 minutes when it came out and stopped because I thought it was terrible I couldn't be more wrong about this movie it's starts slow but wow did the end get way better great movie .
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The intricate world-building, stunning visuals, and gripping storyline left me in awe."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was a masterpiece I loved the CGI and sci-fi it was so awesome experiencing it at home. Tim did so good I haven't seen number 2 but I will totally watch it soon!
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Audio mixing was truly awful. Why must we crank speakers to 100 to hear speech, and then have our ears blown out when a ship flies in?"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A lot of flair but no heart.

Male lead is mediocre."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, Timotheee Chalamet was great, and the effects were amazing."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"First the good things about the movie, i really love the worldbuilding and the atmosphiere, it really acompilshed it. But whit this movie there are some flaws, first of all the main character, it looks like it happend nothing whit this character, no learn from mistakes or any development of it, it was compleatly blank. And secondly the movie quiet missed the goals for the story, well at the middle and the end just finaly FOUND WHAT THE GOAL IS GOING TO BE, and even soo it havent reached it, soo i have some hopes that the goal will be more specific and i guesss it will reach it."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune is phenomenal. It is a visual and audible treat that demands a full movie experience of IMAX or at least an impressive screen and surround sound in the home. 

Villeneuve teaches a masterclass in visual storytelling - letting the images on the screen tell the story, leaving heavy exposition to the side. For something as lore heavy as the Dune universe, it's a bold choice. Yet it works brilliantly, the story being played out beautifully with all of its intricacies.

Other adaptations could take notes. Books have to use words, films do not. 

One final note - this film ends on a cliffhanger, but even then Villeneuve has managed to make it an end that would have stood should he not have got a sequel. There is much to learn from this adaptation - one can only hope the media giants learn the right lessons."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Late to the party.  Had been a fan of the original book and somewhat let down by the original film.  As is often the case film adaptations don't meet the high expectations of the 'fan' reader.  However a love of Timothee Chalamet's work since 'Call Me By Your Name' (and yes, even in 'Wonka') had me weakened to planning to go see Dune 2.  But thanks to good marketing a new run of Dune pushed me into the theatre to see Chalamet's first outing.  Perfect, kept very true to the book and Timothee was a perfect fit as Paul Atreides.  If like me you missed this first time around, see it ahead of the sequel."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"it was alright. I liked the David Lynch version better. This version was slow and really didnt get into it as well as Lynch even though Lynch strayed from the novel more.  I think it spent too much time and effort in being ""inclusive"" The acting in Lynch's version was far superior with the amount of well-seasoned actors it had.  The acting in this version made the characters feel hollow and you really couldnt get invested in them"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"My history with Dune is that I read the books a long time ago, watched Dune 1984 several times, and also enjoyed the 2000 miniseries (especially the Children of Dune sequel).  My primary feeling after finishing Dune 2023 is I'd like to go back to any of those.  I don't quite understand how Dune 2023 managed to be so long with so little actually happening, and I also doubt how much I would have understood it without subconsciously filling in the story details I knew from other sources.  I was especially disappointed by the absence of any meaningful screentime for the Spacing Guild and any demonstration of how they use spice for space travel.  I feel like this would have been better served as a single 3 hour movie.  Hopefully part 2 will pay off, but even that would leave part 1 just feeling like a labored introduction."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is genius but I will say when I see a Science Fiction movie I see more action this does not pass the test but the movie overall is amazingly done
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The foundations of this epic story echo the same grand feeling found in Fellowship of the Ring.
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Really great movie if you like the genre.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bagpipes, whispering, and just all round confusing situations. A story nobody can follow."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Villeneuve folds spacetime and you're 25,000 years in the future for 3 hours in a different galaxy - enjoy the ride."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolute masterpiece
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,What I needed to see? Check. What I needed to hear? Check. How the talents emotionally affected me? Check. How well I appreciated the little details? Check. How the music made me feel? Check. Near perfect.
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,A great film! I wait the next episode.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,It a good start to the Dune Series and some action scenes. Just takes it's time to get going.
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"A thrilling, incredibly cinematic experience and a beautifully done adaptation of the first half of the original Dune novel by Frank Herbert. The visuals and story feel immensely grand in scale while being paired with an emotional and powerful musical score by Hans Zimmer. Truly captivating in every way and along with Part 2, sets a new standard for how sci-fi films should be made from now on. For sure one of my all-time favorite movies!"
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic, one of the best movies of the 21st century. The acting was so amazing you could see their thoughts even when it wasn't voiced. The characters are so complex and intriguing. It doesn't have much action but the action it does have is wonderful."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Incomprehensible nonsense and ridiculous fight scenes. Who are the bad guys? Worst thing  I've seen in years
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, but not as good as the 2000 mini series."
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a very slow movie but I enjoyed it. Great story!
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is A Beautiful pictured Movie.

A long Beautiful and amazing  Journey.


Warriors that come from one place to help others with war that was amazing to watch.

I can't wait to watch Dune 2!"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I like 80s Dune better
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"An amazing adaptation of Frank Herbert's visionary classic. Awesome in scope and scale, this movie makes understanding the complicated plot much simpler."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve sets a stage for a sci-fi epic, while not alienating the audience unfamiliar with the source material."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great story and executed amazingly. The music and setting and cinematography blend in beautifully. The pace was a little slow, but a unique and action packed story. This WILL go down in history as a classic movie."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. It's better than the first live adaptation of the Dune books.
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"With some spectacular storyline, but drama build up is quite a disappointment."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune does not disappoint.   I liked it.  Looking forward to part 2.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,this movie is Tik Tok e-boy with no muscle mass with other more famous celebrities the movie. The guy in the trailer just looks like every single guy on Tik Tok singing without singing all in all it's a good movie  but it's not better than the old Dune I prefer that one far more
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sound is amazing. There isn't much too look at. If you like grey & grainy footage, this may be for you. Does it follow the book? No, it doesn't even try. It only gets worse in part II."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing film didn't see it in the theater unfortunately but it's still a great film own the DVD and I watched it almost everyday and I love it
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,It¬¥s a really good movie and an excellent adaptation of the book
"Mar 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A decent attempt hurt by an agonizingly slow place deliberately intended to stretch the film into multiple installments, and missing the delicious weirdness of the original (and unfairly derided) original -- required viewing for any hope of understanding this film. Splitting the film into two pieces was sold as allowing the filmmaker to tell the complete story, but instead we get filler of long exterior scenes, conversations with little meaning to the plot and hints at ideas still come later, in another film, but lacking any payoff within this installment. In the end, we are treated to an expensive film at a fine French restaurant, leaving hungry and wondering if we should bother returning."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very good film, can feel slow at times but it has a lot of world-building to do!"
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's so obvious that everyone involved is doing their best and every technical aspect goes crazy hard on all fronts, which helps carry a very comlicated story and makes it work. I feel like this is going to age like wine"
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film Dune 2 practically begins where the first one ended. Therefore, before watching the second part, it's worth refreshing our memory with Dune 1.

The creators of the film tried to stay as faithful to the original material as possible, but due to the limitations of the cinematic format, they had to omit some important parts of the book and even certain characters. We will only see Jessica and Leto Atreides daughter as an embryo in her mother's womb. Consequently, we won't witness the crucial conversation between Alia, the Baron, and the Emperor. Additionally, the Mentat Hawat is absent in the second part, and Piter De Vries makes only a brief appearance. The time span from Duke Leto Atreides' death to the final scene in the book has also been shortened. While in the novel, it spans 4-5 years, in the film, it's less than 9 months. It's unlikely that such a short period could transform a 17-year-old boy into a leader of rebels.
The screenplay's shortcomings are fully compensated by the cinematography and artistic techniques. Each frame is a professional work of art. The wide shots of House Harkonnen's military might, the architecture of Arrakis, the eight-legged military vehicles, desert landscapes, and the Fremen riding on sandworms‚Äîall unfold on the screen accompanied by Hans Zimmer's hypnotic music.
Expressive techniques were also generously employed to enhance the visual context: Feyd-Rautha's battle with the captive warriors of House Atreides, the cannibals, the intimate scene in Lady De Vries' chamber, and more. It's precisely these non-verbal visual techniques that make viewers appreciate Villeneuve's films.""

The characters in Denis Villeneuve's film Dune have been meticulously crafted with attention to detail and aesthetics, even when it comes to the most unpleasant portrayals. Viewers don't need to search for hidden meanings behind the characters because the visual component makes them highly comprehensible.
Regarding the acting, we haven't seen anything fundamentally new compared to Dune 1. However, there are some notable aspects worth mentioning. 

Director Villeneuve gave Paul Atreides less than 9 months for his transformation into Muad'Dib. Did Timoth√©e Chalamet manage this ‚Äòquantum leap'? In the final part of the film, Chalamet carries the emotional weight of almost all scenes, while other characters, including Jessica and Stilgar, take a backseat, serving as the backdrop for Muad'Dib. Whether the actor justified the director's trust is not a straightforward answer. Paul Atreides's internal ambivalence as a character is complex‚Äîon one hand, there's contradiction, vision, reflection, and doubt; on the other hand, there's determination, responsibility, and firmness. Perhaps due to the limited time, convincing execution of challenging scenes fell short. The director's mistake is that Muad'Dib may be the messiah, but not the executioner.  Whether the actor had real chances for success with such a complex task remains an open question.

In Dune 1, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was the primary antagonist, but in Dune 2, we witness the rivalry between uncle and nephew, which turns into a true acting battle. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, although performing his role well, ultimately takes a backseat.""
Low-set eyes on a pale, cold face, and the black palate of a half-open mouth with plump, almost childlike lips magnetically draw attention. Austin Butler kept the focus of the audience on his character with a kind of cheeky ease while Timothee Chalamet went crazy with who he now has to show people: Paul Atreides, Muad'Dib, Usul, Kwisatz Haderach, Lisan al-Gaib. Butler doesn't have a lot of experience as a leading actor in box office films. The main role of Elvis Presley is rather an exception. However, Feyd-Rautha provides the best acting contribution in the second part of Dune. It's one of those cases where you want to witness character development, but the script doesn't afford that opportunity.

The film also sheds light on important contemporary themes through the events unfolding on Arrakis. It's not entirely clear whether Denis Villeneuve intended to draw parallels with the present day or if it's merely his interpretation of the original book's text.

Dune 2 vividly portrays the struggle against a cruel aggressor who plays the role of a colonizer and a sadistic killer. The ‚Äògood old simple solutions' involving artillery against the peaceful population of Siach Tabr to suppress resistance serve as a poignant example. The film also emphasizes the significance of possessing nuclear weapons, while climate change concerns take a backseat. 
Among the Fremen, there's no unified survival strategy, and the choice between fighting and fleeing sparks heated debates. Resisting the aggressor could lead to a prolonged and bloody galactic war. Ownership of a valuable resource keeps the Fremen at the center of political battles.""

The fair-skinned aristocrat Paul Atreides attempts to find common ground with the Fremen. Despite his bold actions, he doesn't escape mockery from the native inhabitants of Arrakis. Paul becomes a messiah for the Fremen due to their fanatical belief in religious prophecies, but was it truly his desire, and are the Fremen ready to follow their Lisan al-Gaib beyond the boundaries of Arrakis?
The final scene of the power struggle in Dune 2 reveals that the Messiah on the throne transforms into a politician. Did his followers understand this? Perhaps the answers lie in the third installment of the saga.

In Denis Villeneuve's film, Princess Irulan possesses ambitions and motivations, unlike her portrayal in the original book. This adds intrigue to the anticipation of Dune 3. Additionally, viewers catch a glimpse of Paul's sister, Alia.
In Frank Herbert's novel, Chani is presented within the framework of a patriarchal world, but Villeneuve pushes her beyond those limits. Chani in the film is independent and self-assured, refusing to be ‚Äòfirst among equals.' The film's conclusion appears more vivid than in the book, thanks to sharp contradictions and conflicts among the characters, which piques interest for the future sequel.

Overall, Dune 2 has set the stage for an epic cinematic saga that science fiction enthusiasts have long awaited."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It serves its purpose as a foundation for a sequel and it serves it well. With breathtaking visuals and cinematography, Villeneuve's ambitious worldbuilding paves the way for something bigger in the later installments. Understandably, juggling a hefty storyline and its huge ensemble of characters is no easy task, though you might be expecting to see more being done with them."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A dull, tedious and inconsistent film. The modern day bores idea of a good time. The best acting performance was that of a gigantic sand worm."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible Cinematography. Amazing Cast. For a First Time Watcher, it was quite confusing, but I would think after watching it, a few times more, it will get better."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's the type of movie you re-play to help fall asleep. Too long and monotonous.
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Felt engaged all throughout!  A hard feat for some movies with longer runtimes.
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"A long time ago, David Lynch directed Dune which of course you know, I haven't seen it. From what I found out today is that it's a box office bomb back in the day. Unfortunately a remake of this epic space opera has came to our faces only in two parts along with the third one which is in development later on with the director of Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, the movie itself has received praise from fans who think this is a better film all around and now with it's sequel on the other hand, Part Two has gotten even better than ever reaching up to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Dark Knight, The Godfather Part 1 &2, The Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List and Pulp Fiction just to name a few. With this however, it's got a huge amount of actors and actresses involved, one of which you will recognise. In the distant future, Duke Leto Atreides, ruler of the planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as the fiefholder of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and sole source of ""spice"", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of their centuries-long breeding program, they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach, a Bene Gesserit and messianic superbeing with the clairvoyance necessary to guide humanity to a better future. She disobeyed and bore a son, Paul, who is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and the Mentat Thufir Hawat; Jessica teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan of his troubling visions of the future. With the sequel of Part 2 been in cinemas recently I decided to watch the first part of Dune and that caught me by surprise in the fair tie and I've watched this twice now. I watched it last night while I was drinking my beer and now on my second watch, that had me preparing myself to review it and give my full thoughts on what I think of it and give it a much bigger praise just like others do. With IT with Pennywise done the same thing with the part 1 & 2, Dune will have the opportunity to do so along with the others years ago. When Paul and Lady Jessica are being chased by a strange giant worm with it's gigantic mouth with no eyes, that had me saying ""What the hell was that?"" and Paul just answered ""It's a thumper."" With it being similar to Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Dune is the best achievement to get sci-fi fans and movie fans infested in the journeys with fantastic visual effects, marvelous cinematography, great story and immense music by Hans Zimmer despite not sounding exactly like those powerful ones he did in the past. Now with that film being done, stay tuned for Part 2 in the near future. I still haven't seen the original version by David Lynch but what the hell, the remake is much better in Part 1 to be exact. Definitely worth it for six Oscars. Now, with Zendaya said it best: ""This is only the beginning."""
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"A refreshing one-time experience after so many years of marvel dominated cinema. Dune is slower paced, artistic and focused on visual storytelling, which i didn't know i was absolutely craving for all these years."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really loved this movie. Not my usual genre to rush and see, really exceeded expectations. Have not seen a sweeping epic of this magnitude in many, many years. It had moments of such intricate focus alongside those gorgeous visual scenes. 
No easy feat. Made true stars out of Timothee Chalamet  and Zendaya in an already stellar cast! Stunning, piercing, perfectly restrained in moments and wonderfully epic in others. Amongst the bursting overflow of Marvel movies and Hollywood blockbusters thrown out at an alarming rate these days, this sets the bar completely in a league of it's own... it sets the bar for all blockbusters that will follow. Amazing!"
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite movies. World-building, fantastic visuals and music, character development that you're invested in, plus loyally honoring the Dune books. Could watch over and over and still appreciate."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"dune is a big set film with plenty of stars including Rebecca Ferguson, star timothy chameleon but It's Oscar Isaac who gives the number one performance. My only complaint was there needed to be less big sounding music."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was like 3 hour montage of crescendos, but with no plot or character development to give any context or meaning to the over-the-topness of it all.  Couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, Denis Villeneuve really has a great vision"
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Movie! Watched it twice!
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Lynch's version is better. This one is all style and no substance and the acting is sub-par.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Another masterpiece by Denis.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,it was amazing as of the CGI and the production allthough it was boring at a lot of points in the film. so thats why it is not a 5 star film.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Good first movie to start franchise
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"In preparation for seeing part 2 tomorrow, I rewatched 2021's Dune Part 1 on Max. I wasn't a huge fan of it the first time I saw it when it came out. I thought a second viewing could improve it and get me prepared for the second one

There are positives and negatives. On the positive side, there is some good action. The two standouts though have to do with the presentation. This movie looks amazing in terms of both special effects and the settings. Also, the score is amazing. It immerses you in the movie.

Unfortunately there are also some negatives. First, they throw so much information at you that it is hard to keep track of it all. As a result, the story is not as strong as it could be. Also, the performances were not good in my opinion. I haven't seen Wonka yet but as of right now I am sold on Timothee Chalamet as a leading man. I didn't think anyone stood out. Every performance was average 

This ended up being an above average movie for me. Both watches I wanted to like it more and it didn't have that spark"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"visually stunning! Fantastic, acting! And supreme direction from Villeneuve!"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Visually stunning with good acting.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune expertly captures themes of legacy, power, destiny, fate, and more against fantastical set pieces, staying true to the complexity of the challenging novel it adapts."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Very bland and boring. The movie was overstretched and drawn out. I could sum this movie up in one paragraph, with majority of it being ""a man takes a walk in a desert with ambien music playing in the background"" A nap would be more exciting! I wouldnt waste my time with this one at all!"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great world building, very effective use of sound design as well."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Utterly forgettable. The reviews clearly demonstrate just how far movies have dropped in quality. It's like anything that isn't awful gets high numbers. This movie fails in every way a movie can fail. Despite the visuals it's in the class of a TV movie. Reviewers should show a little backbone and stop rating based on which movie is the least pathetic
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Denis Villeneuve is crafting the greatest SciFi epic of our time - Everything about it is so immersive and real feeling.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best SF movie i ever seen
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not on par with the sequel. However, it's still a visually fascinating and supremely acted film that opens a vast world of unknowns for viewers unfamiliar with the Herbert catalog."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Yawn fest. Style over substance.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"really awesome, can't say anything bad, though I would like a bit different color scheme. Desert feels too dark at times"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I had trouble understanding some of the dialogue but other than that, everything was enjoyable except for Timoth√©e Chalamet's hair, LOL."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie quite frankly was boring. Chalamete was too weak of an actor for the role to be believable.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"After the disappointment with Star Wars, which increasingly adopted bright coloring and had an excessive use of colors in its cinematography, Dune is a fitting portrayal for a sci-fi film."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It's too underrated.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoy Dune. As someone who has read the book, Oscar Issac is great fitting the role of Duke Leto. The cinematography is great, and the knife duels are well choreographed. I love Timothee Chalemet as an actor, and I can say this is one of the best movies he is in. Overall, a great adaptation to the first part of the novel."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is definitely a must see movie, the only thing that could be different is that the beginning was little bit boring, but the rest is awesome."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,Tr√®s lent au d√©part je dirais m√™me un peu ennuyant mais la derni√®re heure absolument magnifique j‚Äôai h√¢te √† la suite.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, pretty accurate to the source material exept the inner dialogue, which is hard to do anyway without having voiceover. Loved it, bought it, definitely will be a yearly rewatch."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Just absolutely wonderful movie,story,slow pace ,characters , actor's and their soul to movie...just absolutely great movie"
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"After watching the first one,  I believe reading the books would be insightful. A very fun movie with great world building. Great performances all around. They should of had Feyd Faiths on screen more, but he was a great villain, truly evil."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love when science-fiction can rise above the standards and be a true work of art. Villeneuve is no stranger to making epic sci-fi films with very human stories, and he pulls out all the tricks with his amazing adaptation made to be witnessed on the big screen with its breathtaking camerawork and visual effects, plus sound and music that will truly shake your core and make you feel immersed. Perfectly casted. Even though the end of the first part seems abrupt, you will be nothing but excited for part two."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Eye candy does not a great movie make. Villeneuve is trying to punch above his weight, but the movie lacks the sheer brilliance and intellectual depth of a work like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Dune is a good attempt, but the overbearing music and wooden acting takes its toll. The film is too long with a very ponderous first half."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolute MASTERPIECE! If you have the chance to see it in IMAX make yourself a favor and live that once in a lifetime opportunity. It's a 2h46 incredibly well spent.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of my favourite movies ever, incredible soundtrack, amazing acting, almost perfect CGI bar a single shot, and some of the best world-building ever. I'm glad Denis paced the films so that the world-building could shine and the later parts of the novel had room to breathe in an epic sequel."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Definitely lived up to the hype.  Great movie!
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Was a great movie with an awesome world building aspect.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Not trying to age myself but I did see the first film in the '80s. Now that I have seen the two remade films I find them to be far superior and I can't wait for a part 3 the Messiah. Well I will have to wait probably 3 years away ü§û
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It would've been so much better if the pacing wasn't all over the place due to ""visions"" of the protagonist."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"What an introduction to the super complicated, densley rich scifi book of Dune. The cinematography was incredible and totally epic. A benchmark many films will have to try to live up to it. 
Villeneuve has mostly followed the book and some of the action scenes were even better than I imagined. 
What a film. This is the Dune I have been waiting for over 35 years!"
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Lengthy sci-fi book adaptation sometimes struggles to deliver the necessary punch its dialogue and plot offers, but for the most part, this is a wonderfully executed, entertaining and visually captivating experience."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,About as good as it gets for me. I was totally engrossed in this movie.
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excellent version of Frank Herbert's epic sci-fi classic; set in the sands of outer space...(Hence the title)...Young Paul Atreides is caught in the cross hairs of a multiplanetary war between all the Houses of Mankind...Battling over dominion of the spices; the Melange; which enable man to be omnipotent, omniscient and nearly immortal. So he struggles with all of that; all the while he feels the pull of destiny as the new chosen Messiah; the ""Lisan Al Gaib."". The big difference between this and the original David Lynch film has is that THIS MAKES SENSE... And it has an epic sweep and budget that the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries from 2000 just can't compete with...Both Timothy Chalamet and director Denis Villanueva do the story justice; giving it the gravitas and sweep this epic deserves.  Overall: Highly recommended

P.S. George Lucas has admitted Star Wars was heavily influenced by Dune; and it's easy to see that here.."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of my favourite films ever, just slightly better that part 2 in my opinion."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,I am not familiar with the novel and hence my review is entirely solely of the movie. I find it's actually a great watch. Characters are great. Story is broad. I love the introduction of characters and character development. I just wish that some characters did not die like how they did. All in all. A great watch. I'm excited for part 2. And I'm thinking of reading the novel because of these movies. The story is very interesting.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,The first part was so slow and boring.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,Slow burn and kinda have boring parts but then the world building was superb with Timothee giving his best in here.
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,An absolute amazing performance üëè
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,The action is a bit slow but I was not bored at all. Love this movie!
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is a slow burn, and would totally understand the scale of the world building dull, but its ultimately the downpayment for a big pay off in the subsequent movies. The small details in the film I find just hypnotizing."
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film is a waste of almost THREE HOURS of your life. It's so SLOW and BORING, it stretches out half a book and an hour and 30 minutes(max) of plot into almost three hours. It has stupid cliches and the acting from some of the cast(mostly the main character) is AWFUL. He barely ever emotes. All the dialogue is whispered too and I had to ask my brother, who had read the book, what and why things were going on half the time. I also wanted to see more of the space worms, they were barely even on screen. Overall, boring, too long, and bad acting. Also it definitely feels unnecessary that they cut the book into two films. This makes them stretch everything out and the movie doesn't have a clean climax, just a kind of lame fight. Also none of the characters are really likeable. Again, it doesn't help that the main guy doesn't emote at all. I didn't feel anything for his character, at all. Save yourself three hours and do something else."
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,Very good movie i really loved it
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,Dune was a good although I didn't get the plot of the movie I was still a good movie but I was confusing but it is better than the original movie.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,This movie burns very slow for a very long time. I feel asleep a few times the first time I saw it. I paid more attention the second time around. I dig it. I felt this movie didn't need to be this long to get to the point. I hope the sequel picks up the pace.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not bad, a very beautiful film to watch and the story is just getting started but it's a snooze fest. However it's building up to part 2."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,The beginning of the movie was cool and interesting. I like the way bene  is the Narrator in the beginning. Timothe'e Chalamet's Paul Atreides is a cool character. The setting of the movie is cool reminded me of Star Wars  Episode 1:The Phantom Menace. Dave Bautista's Glossu Rabban Harkonnen is a villain of the movie. Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atreides is a very good character! The Action and the fighting scenes of the movie are awesome! I like the way that Paul had visions about Zendaya's character Chani! The visual Effects are awesome! Everything in this movie is perfection.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love the custome in the movie, it make my feel like they always go to the fashion week show. I really like Paul and The lady characters, It's feel like they would do everything for their family, their people. The theme, music , the image in the movie are absolutely gorgeous. The Content of the movie is great."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was very very boring and too long, it could've been summed up in 30 minutes but yet they drug it out and made it painfully boring to sit through and watch till the end. Should've just left the OG movie alone. They honestly don't even need a second movie because that one will be boring as hell too."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've gotta admit that this movie went way above my expectations. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The story leading up to the sequel was compelling, by adding a lot of character development, and sporting top-of-the-line visual effects, the latter impressing me the most. The pacing felt a bit off at times (hence the 4-and-a-half star rating), but eventually picks itself up as the movie goes on, but it does take a while. The performances were insane as well! Timothee Chalamet had a standout performance in my opinion, especially as we get further and further into the movie. And when the movie hits, it hits hard, particularly in the feels with its outstanding emotional weight.

This movie is a definite must-watch, and once you're done with this movie, you'll be ready to go for the sequel - which I plan to see SOON!"
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing film with fantastic pace and cinematography. Well worth the trip to the cinema
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"More time i watch this movie more i love it. Went to see rerelase in imax the other day, and damn it's good. PERFECT after watching part 2 yesterday."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,A beautiful adaptation by the director to Frank Hebert's book
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"great epic movie, sometimes a slow burner but worth every second"
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought that the movie started a little snow but after 30 minutes I was hooked.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve √† fait un travail incroyable sur ce film, en terme de photographie mais aussi bien au niveau de la mise en sc√®ne.
Thimoth√© aussi fait un travail excellent au niveau de son r√¥le. Il est aussi bien compr√©hensible que d√©t√©stable.
Je recommande sans hesiter"
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,OMG! This movie was horrible. The story seems to move slowly for no reason other than to make two movies out of one story. If you are thinking about seeing a movie pass on this one.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely phenomenal film! I was hooked from the beginning! I didn't want it to end and I cannot wait to see the second part to this series. I hope to see more to come!! Timothee Chalamet is a wonderful actor and absolutely perfect for this role.
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite sci-fi movies, it feels really fresh, story is well done, actors are great and it managed to build some sort of tension for me where I'm constantly engaged in it."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"great loved it good pacing, acting, story... has it all"
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,What a show! A Must Watch
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis Villenueve's Dune: Part 1 is a beautifully shot sci-fi epic that sets the ground-work for Part 2. The acting from Chalemet is great, and the relationship of his character with his father and friends is very well written. Hans Zimmer's score is epic and really immerses the audience in the experience. The only minor issue the film has is it lacks a bit of flow at times, but overall a great set-up film. If you can see it on the big screen see it!"
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,I would rate it a 5 if I had a better understanding of the source material or if I were more of a Dune geek. It's great.
"Mar 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was okay but honestly, I don't get why everyone loves it so much, too long, acting is sub par, not the best but decent only because of the directing"
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Watched it 7x before Part 2.
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best movie of all time,as simple as that"
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years. The acting, settings and special effects were phenomenal, drawing the audience into the world that is Arrakis."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Excepcional! Um dos melhores filmes que assisti!
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me encanto, la eh visto como tres veces. 
Muy buena adaptaci√≥n. Excelentes actuaciones. Amo a Oscar Issac. La recomiendo."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Espetacular. Entretem voc√™ do come√ßo ao fim. N√£o tenho palavras. Simplismente amei
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,A clear story brought to the screen. Dune 2 was cut in the right place to make way for Dune 3. Fantastic visuals. So superior to Dune '84. My favorite in '24 so far!
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,76%. Felt kind of like Star Wars and Mad Max combined. More like Star was with all of the different civilizations on different planets. The spice is a very coveted resource that allows them to space travel. Too abstract for my liking. Was good but kind of slow and felt really like just build up for part 2. 2/5 on rewatch.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Slow but enjoyable movie. I gave it a higher rating because I get to see part 2 tomorrow and don‚Äôt have to wait. Feels exciting to see the continuation of the story.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"good movie, amazing cinematography"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies from this year so far. Visual is a explosion of sensations , super well done. It's long but it's totally worth it. Action and more action in every scene. Love it. Dune Part 3 coming soon‚Ä¶"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Grandiose adaptation of a very complex writing. Though missing key elements from the first book the films (Dune 1 and 2) makes up for in presence. On its own the series would make a great sci-fi yarn. But coupled to the book it does pale in some ways. The extrapolation of the fundamentalist vs the secular view of religion from the ideas originally place by the religious sisterhood on Arrakis does seem to be very contemporary, nothing of that nature in the book as I recall"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really good, i've not seen other dune film and i didn't know about the existence of it before this film, and it's good ! mabe too long for me but it was something really good compared of what we currently have"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing, Astonishing, a sight to behold."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"After refreshing myself after 2 years of the film, I can say that I can comment better on the film. The landscapes are definitely a plus, but the plot is sometimes uninteresting, but I can still say it's one of the better sci-fi movies."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Pretty good but can be boring at times and slow paced but thrilling overall.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved the film, the screenplay removed whatever was unnecessary for the screen and everything works brilliantly and Denise got to tell the story he wanted to tell. Somethings could've been stretched in the final act but nothing that keeps it from being a great movie. Ignore the contrarians and just see it for yourself."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Great second half of the first book. Visually stunning. Did not care for the deviation of the original plot from the book.  Always annoying when Hollywood deviates from a very successful book that does not need changes.  Lets hope they make Dune Messiah.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Although the plot moseys long slowly, it's the perfect place to convey a thoughtful and profound story."
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring. Weak storie‚Ä¶ characters without deepness
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Hollywood, pay attention, this is how you do it right. Great pacing, stunning visuals, amazing sound -- but above all, GOOD writing and GOOD directing. Characters feel authentic in their world, and we're allowed to linger in scenes to get a sense of that world. Well done!"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Best film of the year if I had more money I would go back and watch it everyday
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely gorgeous, and the world-building is great. The characters are complex, and the story is good. However, the incredibly dense world-building leads to a distracting amount of exposition dumps that don't always feel natural. The same flaw exists with the characters; they're complex, but they don't get a chance to develop many of them much because so much time is taken establishing the rules of the universe. I feel like this could have been done better, but with an already 3 hour runtime, there simply isn't time. I would have preferred this movie as a 5 or 6 episode TV limited series, with more time given to flesh out the characters and to space out exposition, but this is probably as good as you could do with a single film. All in all, the movie was pretty great, and I hope that part 2 uses the fact that most of the rules are already established to develop the story and characters more."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"""Dune Part 2"" is a cinematic triumph, blending stunning visuals, captivating performances, and a haunting score into a mesmerizing journey through the world of Arrakis. Director Denis Villeneuve's meticulous pacing keeps every minute essential, while Timoth√©e Chalamet leads a stellar cast in bringing Frank Herbert's characters to life. With its grandeur and emotional depth, ""Dune Part 2"" is an unforgettable epic."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie no doubt. Everything down to the acting, soundtrack, lore, cinematography was all jaw dropping. It is a great watch and hell of a ride."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it. The world building, the music score (best of all time?) the brutalism, the acting, the epic scale, the action and above everything else, the athmosphere! This is how it's done, this is science fiction for adults! An absolutely masterpiece. I had no problem with the ending, not more than I had with The Fellowship of the Ring ending, when you know it's the first part of a series."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved it. It combines far-future sci-if with mysticism and it does it so beautifully. My favorite type of movie, by far."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Some of the critics who pan Dune 2 don't like large special effects films.  Or they don't really like the novel. If you like the novel, and the story it unwinds, then you will enjoy Dune 2, because it absolutely captures the letter and spirit of the book. If you didn't like the novel , you won't like the film. I loved this film. I don't know how you make Dune into a film without large scale special effects.  Some critics said it was boring. That's what they said about 2001 too. But Villanueve's direction is admirable. He uses epic battle scenes and mixes them with small scale human interaction. Think of Spartacus as an example. This film , as does the novel, creates many levels of personal and philosophic thought. It speaks to cultism, and the many religions that have searched for their messiahs throughout the ages. Is Paul Atrades a real coming of the ONE or is he just a royal who has become aware of himself as a leader? The intricate intrigue between Harkaans and the Atrades and the many betrayals and hatreds  within and between families. This all done with significant style and pace by Villanueve.  It is masterpiece of science fiction and art. And could not recommend it highly enough to those who love  great film making."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"The soundtrack, visuals, acting, and story are firing on all cylinders. The story is a little tough to follow at first but gets better and better with every rewatch. This is definitely peak sci fi storytelling."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"While the acting, dialogue and pacing of this movie are all exceptional, what really sets it apart are the spectacular visuals that somehow bring the worlds of Caladan and Arrakis to life. It is held back from being a 5-star film as it ends midway through the story but if Dune: Part Two sticks the landing then this will become an all time classic sci-fi series"
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Zzzzzzzzz‚Ä¶ in a word‚Ä¶ Boring. 
With a cast like that it's is shameful for the movie to be this bad.
I don't know why they even bother saying Zendeya is in the movie.. you will see what I mean. 
I was so excited to see this movie, because I wanted to see the sequel in theaters, now I'm not going to bother. I'll wait‚Ä¶"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Better then the original movie version from long ago.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Total brilliant delivery
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,The Perfect Sequel. Needed another hour...3 was not enuff.
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very disappointed. A film that was hard to keep up with story wise and therefore was boring.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Probably the best science-fiction movie ever.  Acting, cinematography, special effects, everything was amazing !"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Was good. Wish some scenes weren't dropped from the book.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty much a masterpiece, the effect and score were unbelievable. I could do without them trying to make Chani more important of a character than she is and also the casting of the emporer is silly."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Visually speaking, this film is perfect, but sometimes there was a feeling that the information and content were thrown around too much, perhaps this helped give this film a reputation for being boring."
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Watched with friends, we paused it a couple of times and none of us could figure out exactly what was going on. I found it hard to care about the characters or their situation. Felt like a beautiful painting of stale bread. Very overrated movie."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great acting, great direction, great cinematography. This movie is no doubt a classic and the best film so far this year. It does move slowly, but with purpose like all great films. Please go see it.."
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The Good: This visuals are awesome, the action is awesome, the acting is awesome. 
The Bad: It's an overused plot. Rich kid loses everything, moves in with the poor, falls in love with a poor girl, uses the poor people to rise up and take his rich life back. 
Yes, I recommend this film."
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,Superbly acted and very well written. It does kinda of feel like a giant flashback and I think they should have cranked up the colour a bit but it's a good show. Fairly close to the novel but still entertaining
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal cinematography, flawless visual effects, and decent performances help make up for an at-times exposition-heavy script, delivering a wonderful new piece of sci-fi that will only improve with time and more story to tell in the sequel."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Very sandy and cool but why was the mom always whispering?
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just like the David Lynch version. Wooden acting. Good looking actors. Less confusing and more faithful to the book. Who thought Zendaya can act? She looks beautiful but she can't act. A Disney mannequin.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"The special effects are so subtle, you don't even notice them after a while.  Combined with very good acting, it brings the story to life."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was epic. The ending shocked me a little.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Sci-Fi movie since Interstellar. Near perfect adaptation of the books.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,I have seen every dune movie or tv show ever created . This is by far the best of all of them . I'm very excited to see part 2 !!
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was the gateway for me to become a die hard Dune fan. A visual and auditory treat, Dune holds a very special place in the hearts of all Dune fans."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best sci-fi movies ever made
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Timothee Chalemet and Rebecca Fergurson Shine in their roles and Jason Momoa was Cool to see the movie can get boring quite a few times and confusing especially Zendaya and the Dream and everytime I saw Dave Bautista's Character, I Just saw Drax. Oscar Issac had no purpose really and I thought i was gonna watch a masterpiece. However, it is very visually stunning, the action choreography is amazing and I'm somewhat excited for Dune: Part Two! Also The Shields Are Cool!"
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic and lot's of fun! Visually amazing!
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really, really good.  I love how well it respected the original novel. Denis Villeneuve is a truly remarkable director and this gets close to the heights of his masterpiece Blade Runner 2049."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent Basis and strong foundation for the 2nd Part
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Missed the boat on this one, but had to make sure I got it in before my screening of ""Part Two."" What a cool movie, man. Gotta say, though, I guess it's not my favorite of Villeneuve's, but what does that even mean for a director with a filmography like his? The visuals here are as striking as ever, the cast is electric and the grandeur of it all is just so infectious. Sure, some of the weirdness of Herbert's novels is just gonna be too difficult to translate regardless of who's bringing it to the screen, but there are plenty of well-realized ideas here to offset the occasional unintended chuckle or two. Gotta love that score from Hans, as well. The memes already had those vocals stuck in my head before I could even see the movie. Now, I've got no chance of shaking the musical landscape of this film from my head. Can't wait to see how Denis and Co. are able to close things out in ""Part Two."""
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Pretty good. Started slow but the battle scenes were sick
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Slow and ponderous. I was expecting to see the worms but the cinematography kept them in the dark, literally. Part 2 was also dragging but at least I finally get to see those desert beasts. Got lost in the narration. Zenya has a funny look. Batista led unintentionally hilarious antagonists. Man, they need serious anger management!"
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Cult. Art movie. Blockbuster.
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Visually, a jaw-dropping moments all throughout the three-hour meandering storyline. 

Admittedly, I wasn't a fan of techno-movies with thinly-disguised patronage of digital studios and fraternity or sorority of aspiring actors at the other end of the queue. 

Cleverly placed symbols of mysticism set amidst dystopian landscape of biblical proportion, the movie is more an exercise on self-indulgence on the part of the producers. Instead of an entertainment, it was more like sitting through a three-hour Episcopalian sermon in a Pentecostal service. 

Movies like this aren't telling a story. They are redefining cinematography. They produce, we pay to watch, nevermind if our bums hurt and minds boggled. Just sir and enjoy the snacks. Tell everyone the movie was great. Why suffer alone?"
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is spectacular. A perfect set piece for part 2 and beyond.
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Cinematography without acting or plot. Total waste of time.  One of the only movies I walked out on.  What is wrong with reviews.  This should not be in the theater.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. Great filmmaking.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Part 1 was so great that we had to watch it again before heading off to watch part 2. Love these movies.
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,The only enjoyment I got out of this was laughing at the name Duncan Idaho.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pour les non-initi√©s, Dune, premi√®re partie, couvre la moiti√© du premier roman de Dune par Frank Herbert. La seconde partie est maintenant en salle et c'est un must √† voir, qui conclut le premier roman. C'est une adaptation tr√®s bien r√©ussie. On nous fait habilement d√©couvrir l'univers complexe qu'est Dune. Fan de sci-fi, je ne peux que recommander!"
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely stunning. Masterpiece from beginning to end and such a beautiful continuation of Part One. I must point out the beauty of the score as well- powerful and fitting. Obviously parts were removed or added from the book but it in no way messed with the integrity or flow. GO. WATCH!
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune was a film that makes sense to anyone who understands the story, as it comes from a book with a lot of depth, so the film was really very faithful to what was written, we had a great script, great special effects, great photography and good acting."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Can't help it. Tried to watch a second time. But like the first time I found the movie plain boring, lacking any character development and the dialogues are meaningless. After half of the movie I just couldn't care for anything that happens."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,A cinematic masterpiece!!
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,I had to watch this movie five times before I could actually get through the whole thing and not fall asleep. Could not follow the plot and it really just was passable for me because Jason Momoa was in it.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Truly one of most visually stunning films ever made. An incredible continuation of the first film with the sound design much improved. One of the most successful book adaptations I've seen- it's remarkable how was able to achieve the feeling of reading the book and give us the images previously only possible in our minds. Outstanding cast and score. Can't wait to see again.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,O FILME APRESENTA √ìTIMOS GR√ÅFICOS POR√âM O MEDO DE SAIR DO B√ÅSICO FAZ A OBRA MUITO SEM GRA√áA MAS ESPERO QUE O DUNA PARTE 2 RESOLVA ESSE PROBLEMA
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I didn't watch Dune Part 1 when it came out and was lucky enough that my local theater(Vue Kerkrade, The Netherlands) was running a marathon of Dune Part one and two back to back! 

And let me tell you it was worth it! The movies are truly able to captivate the viewer and make them forget that time is actually passing by, those 5 and a half hours passed by so quickly, it almost felt like only 2 hours. The story and characters are well written and the special effects are truly stunning, this is a must watch for anyone that even remotely enjoys Sci-Fi stories!"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune: Part One is even better in retrospect after viewing the second film. It's a slow-burn high-brow sci-fi epic with excellent world building and characters. But it shares many of the same issues with the second film, namely it's spiritually dark source material."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm not totally convinced this was that much better than Lynch's movie. I thought the pacing was too fast. If I wasn't familiar with the source material going in I think I'd have been a little lost. Lynch used narration to explain plot points which probably weren't effective but it shows how hard this material is to translate to screen.
  The pandering to minority females by changing Dr Kynes? character wasn't terribly distracting for me although this stuff usually bothers me.
    Jason Momoa? was awful. He brought a cheesy approach to Gurney. Nowhere near as good as the Star Trek guy. The Atreides in my mind are stoic. Akin to European royalty. Momoa with his barbarian build and cheesy jokes seems better suited to WWE or whatever his background is. He's not a bad actor, he just didn't feel like Gurney to me.
   The saving grace in my mind was the CGI or cinematography, the visuals were great. Definitely eye candy but in my opinion the acting and pacing were inferior to Lynch. And Lynch's Dune was not a great film but the characters especially the Baron !! were so memorable while the visuals in this film were better. They weren't unique though, this film looks like all other high budget Sci Fi films. Sorry for disjointed review. Worth a watch but more evidence why Dune is a story that just can't be captured in cinema."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is visually stunning and the story gets you hooked, however this movie is just a whole lot of set up."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Abosuletly phenomenal!

Dune sets the stage for its predecessor, Dune: Part Two, acting as the ignition of a slow-to-tick bomb.

This movie conveyed complex topics from Frank Herbert's novel into simple, enjoyable scenes. Villeneuve's clever approach, ensuring the audience's satisfaction, displays his willingness to perfect this movie. Denis combined mind-dazzling visuals, and extraordinary sound effects to delight the audience- and he succeeded.

Overall, this was a well-written movie with an anticipating story. Undoubtfully, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is one of many memorable sci-fi spectacles that introduced itself slowly, but courageously, into this new universe of spice."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not worth the price of admission. Once you get past the hype Dune part 2 is a slow paced boring movie. A plot that tries to be great but ends up being redundant.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"For me, a cult one minutes after the end."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"MASTERPIECE, watched it few days ago and can not get it out of my head! This is the epitome of cinematography, just beyond perfect, this is an art, truly it is. Can not wait to watch it again‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I thought this latest cinematic version of Frank Herbert's Dune was one of those films you need to watch with the sound turned off ‚Äì not an option in the cinema, I agree! ;-)

This would be especially true if you have read the books, since this latest version changes many of the key characters into the opposite of what they are in print (to no good effect), and generally turns a magnificent novel into a boring film to listen to (but wonderful visually, IMHO), although this is hardly a unique example of Hollywood ruining a great book.

Not that the books stay great beyond the second in the series, IMHO, and I gave up part way into the fourth book, which goes beyond silly into utterly ridiculous.

If this cinematic series makes it that far, people will be talking about it first jumping the shark, and then jumping the sandworm jumping the shark! ;-)"
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Definitely contemplated 3 or 3.5 stars because this film was the definition of world-building, and as a fan of Star Wars above all else, this just felt a bit too close to the area (it's quite obvious George Lucas drew some inspiration from the novel before creating the first Star Wars movie yet this film¬†looked, and felt, too similar to A New Hope for my liking) but it was visually gorgeous, acted extremely well, had a powerful score and was brought to life by an amazing director with a clear vision for the films‚ÄîI also have never seen Rebecca Ferguson in anything else before, as horrendous and that may be, and I must say I am a huge fun‚Äî. Can't wait to see Part Two (and i'm really curious to see if it will live up to¬†The Empire Strikes Back,¬†in terms of a sequel, like everyone says it does)."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,A solid foundation for what's to come.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wonderful film, great detail and care went into the making of this film. Superb acting, directing and vision. A really great film."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"2021's Dune film is a grand Sci-fi epic that is so ambitious that by the end, you will be wanting more of it! The cast assembled here are all top notch lead by star Timoth√©e Chalamet. Now it probably will have helped to have read the novel but know that is not a requirement to enjoy this film. Also I was not a fan of the original film back in the 80s as it tried to fit so much story into such a short time. With this film by visionary Director Denis Villeneuve, they take their time building up the action and the stakes. There is a lot of character story here. Think of Game of Thrones but in space. The action is breathtaking, score is mesmerizing, acting great, and visuals jaw dropping. My only complaint from making this perfect is that the movie starts to get a little off balance 2/3 through. Also 15-20 minutes could have been shaved off with maybe some of those additional scenes to maybe be saved for Part II. Dune is a wonderful experience to be seen on the biggest screen available. Dune gets a near perfect 4 1/2 stars out of 5 from me. "
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ficou melhor depois de sua continua√ß√£o, uma grande obra cinematogr√°fica ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Spectacular movie with great character development. Worth the watch 100%.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,a lot good about the movie. writing or editing was a little off or something.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the slowest and most boring films I've ever seen. The audio was so inconsistent it nearly blew my TV's speaker. Had it on 100 to hear dialogue and 10 for the insanely loud score. The shots of the desert were the only good thing in this film. It felt like every scene depicted something not physically possible or was just overdone with almost nothing moving the plot. The fight scenes were also incredibly lame. I just don't understand what people were watching that rated this movie highly.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,muito muito muito longo
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't know why but i didn't liked it very much on first viewing, despite loving the cinematography. I think i found it too depressing. Then i went, watched it again and was very impressed overall. It was still depressing, but some stories are just like that(and not all stories need to be happy to be good).
Denis Villeneuve is an amazing Director for sure.

Although this is more of a setup for future movies and lacks the action that would elevate it, i think there's enough intrigue to make you want to come back to this world; even for someone like me who isn't familiar with the books. 

I cannot wait to watch the second movie and know more about the future of these characters. Very tempted to look up the full story online but i feel that it would be a disservice to what the filmmaker and everyone accomplished here."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"A truly original film, a modern day start wars in its impact size and seriousness of what it's building it makes you take it seriously and I am sure will be spoken about for years after"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Great visuals and an incredible adaptation of the original novel.
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved the movie. Truly couldn't wait to see part two after being blown away by part one. Timothee Chalamet is amazing here along with the entire cast.
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,An epic masterpiece with impressive pictures and intense gameplay. Cinema is back!
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,It was absolutely perfect. I have read the book many times and the movie did not disappointed me at all. Cast is espectacular!! It is a dream to watch my favorite book to come to life. Well done!
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I unfortunately didn't get to see this in the theaters upon release but watched on my OLED setup 4k UHD disc in my home theater. Beautiful. Zimmers musical score was amazing.  
The bigger screen the better for these films but great adaptation to film. Looking forward to Part 2. 
I'm glad it's split up in 2 movies as it's a large book. People who say it's boring I don't get that. 2.5 hours went by in flash."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,Although visually impressive the pace of this movie was way too slow. It felt bland and one note. So bland that I kept disassociating throughout which NEVER happens to me.
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"WTF did I just watch? This story does not deserve this production value.
It gets more than the minimum because there were some good action sequences and overall it was well done from a technical perspective... So it might be good to put on while you bake some cookies."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Denis Villeneuve has been a masterclass director for his most recent movies. Prisoners, The Arrival, Bladerunner 2049 are fantastic movies that conclude with satisfying endings for an all round great watching experience. 

Dune: Part 1 isn't quite like it. It's the first part to what I imagine will be a long and deep story. The movie feels half baked and what was here didn't seem to match his previous work.

The acting goes from excellent to mediocre depending on the actors, the score is generic and is mostly forgettable and the VFX at times is masterclass and jarring at others.

It's hard to judge half a movie when it's clear there's a full story not yet told. Perhaps my views will change with Part 2. Because although this movie has some great scenes, good casting and beautiful visuals. I left curious of what's to come but not fulfilled by what I've just seen.

If Kill Bill and Across the Spiderverse can leave me wanting more. This movie should of done aswell."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,A great introduction to the Dune World
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I found the movie fascinating, absorbing, and imaginative! The music, the scenes, and the plot are beautiful to see. Some of the images are running still in me!"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Eu simplesmente amei, um pouco lento, mas eu n√£o sacrificaria nenhuma cena por um filme mais curto...."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"i don't think is a bad movie , and it's really well done it's a good setup but nothing really happens , it is really boring , i hope part II picks up the slack but my god they didn't need more than 2h of runtime for what thay did ."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Story telling, tick. Character depth, tick. Cinematography, tick. Sound, tick. Score, big tick. I was going to give this four and a half stars but couldn't find a reason for the half star deduction. I have read reviews of people who really don't like the movie but I can not agree, even slightly. Can't wait for part two."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"After seeing part two part one is a masterpiece. There are plenty of the reviews, but DV caught the magic presented in the book. I wished the second part was at least half that good. And it is half that good. Nothing more. This one is a great introduction to the Dune. Watch this read the book and don't bother with the part two. Sadly this is DV his opus magnum."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Visually stunning. Dynamic story. Unpredictable action. One of the great sci-fi films of modern cinema.
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This faster paced continuation, was exactly what we needed. 10/10 would recommend I would even watch it again!"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,This will forever be one of my favorite films. Witnessing Dune changed me.
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Some of the wide cinematography shots were epic, but the film overall was really boring. Endless sand. It's like if the first Star Wars film had stayed on the desert planet of Tatooine the whole film. (That film was so very much about leaving that rock.)"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,This was such a great film. A cinematic masterpiece with a great cast. It is rare that I enjoy remakes/reboots/new adaptions and this is one I think all sci-fi and Dune lovers should see.
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yet another modern butchery of a classic work. It replaces everything meaningful about the characters and story and replaces them with vast, sprawling empty spaces. Just look up images of the desert and save yourself some time."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,The same arsenal of unremarkable actors strike once again in this half hearted attempt at an adaptation of the dune series.
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"The world building feels extremely slow in the beginning, but it is necessary to get the background. Once the plot hits, the movie goes from zero to a thousand! And once it starts, it doesn‚Äôt stop. What an amazing film this turned out to be! Can‚Äôt wait to check out the second film"
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"The sheer scale and depth of world-building at play is incredible. The cast is well-selected and provides outstanding performances, particularly Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. One of the purest examples of what science fiction cinema should be."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"By far and away one of the most overrated films of the past decade. Poorly written, poorly acted and with some of the worst cinematography and design you'll ever see. They forgot any colours except beige existed and even managed to make the sandworms look boring."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is beautiful
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very well done.  Decent characterizations, an actual plot that matters more than the explosions.  I am familiar with the source material, and it is hard to film something like this - the 1984 movie was an interesting if flawed attempt.  They maybe had to cut out stuff, but anyone who is familiar with the story shouldn't have any issues following this film.  Maybe the filming was a little drab, and they didn't have enough time to really hone in on human emotions, but that is the story of Dune.  Maybe if they had a stronger cast, the performances might have overpowered the drier story line, but I can't really complain about anyone in this film."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Most best world building ever. It's a fantastic journey."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Brilliant,  the world is unworthy of this movie and what it gives to a small group of people."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just straight up mid. The ending just really makes this movie fall flat.
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Epic scale and execution. The Dolby Atmos and 120"" 4K HDR experience at home is a beast. Visually stunning and seamless effects. Beautifully done movie. Read the books when I was a wee lad, and a really nice adaptation. Looking forward to the sequel."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve's first sci-fi epic is a modern triumph. Though it may be laid thick with complex, plot-driven dialogue and its emotions may reside more in the visuals than its characters, Dune is a true cinematic experience. Greg Fraiser's cinematography is staggering; Hans Zimmer's score is annoying but fitting. Not to mention Dune contains some of the best sound design in cinema and, in my opinion, the greatest visual effects you will ever see. Villeneuve does an incredible job of drawing  you in and immersing yourself into the planet of Arrakis, brilliantly leading a team of technical masters."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall, really really solid film. The cinematography and score in this film are top notch. Personally, this film felt really slow and put out a lot stuff for me to garner. It took me a while, but the idea for this film worked really well. Very excited to see where this goes in part two!"
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Super ! Excellent film et belle r√©alisation. L'univers est super bien d√©velopp√©
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,I had to watch it many times to figure out what was what. When I watched The Dune 1984 I had some more Clarity on what this movie was about. But yeah at first it was very hard to understand it.
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was a brilliant, modern adaptation.  The star power is HUGE, the acting top-notch (especially Rebecca Ferguson as the mother - the depth of her emotive expression is inspiring), the special effects and world-building awe inspiring."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Going to give it another try but didn't quite keep my attention
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Rewatching ready for part 2 and I found it even more brilliant than the first time. 
Outstanding world and character building. 
If Part 2 builds upon this...it may be the perfect setup for what I hope is an epic trilogy at the very least."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it.  An interesting and beautiful movie.  However, it is almost entirely void of humor and the ability to tug on one's emotional senses.  Sadly, there is something forgettable about the whole thing, and no draw to rewatch..."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,I love the movie it was action. Always true Timothy Charmine is a really good movie love it it's great on big screen
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolute snooze fest. If they showed this movie to ed Norton he would never have met Tyler durden
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a movie that I enjoy but not a movie that I love. I want to love is so badly but there's a few gripes for me to not put it into the category of 'masterpiece.' I've seen this movie about 5 times now and it's a classic for me. However, my issue is that important elements and key moments are expressed too subtly for such a mammoth blockbuster. I wish the moment where House Atreides signs to go to Arakkis is emphasized more. It was too subtle. They pretty much signed up for a death sentence but as a viewer I'm left with wondering why this moment seems important yet it's just subtly going by. The Doctor who removed the shields way too easily. It needed to be emphasized more and should've been far more difficult to do. I wish there was tension shown in his attempt to remove the shields to the point where we feel the impending doom. I wanted to feel, ""oh shet, it's over now."" But instead I was like, ""what just happened?"" It just happens and as viewers we can easily just miss it because I totally missed it at the first viewing. I was like, ""wait, that's it? That's all it took to remove the shields and for the Harkonnens to invade that easily?"" Aside from that I enjoyed the movie. The world building is very interesting and I'm super curious to know how it unfolds in Dune 2."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent! This wasn't a movie as much as a work of art! This is the adaption Dune deserves.
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is one of the best sci-fi movies of our generation. The only flaw I can find about this movie was the trailer not reflecting the movie very well. The first time watching this movie I expected to have these huge battle and crazy fights with little plot like our generation is used to like John Wick. But after watching the movie twice I found how perfect this movie is. It really shows and big and small this crazy universe is. Its like the first Star Wars movie when the showed tatooine and slightly teased how big and vast how universe is. This movie is a perfect setup for the next movie that I'm very excited for.
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the most epic sci-fi movies in a very long while. A masterpiece in it's genre.
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"I like the way director construct the whole ecosystem. This is so real to me to accept this new invented world. I like the beautiful landscape and all characters in this movie, even the sand mouse is described in a deep way. Respect to the delicate work."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Adventure, drama, and awesome characters.  Successful movie, cannot wait for the sequel."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Simply epic, fantastic world-building, compelling characters, immersive storytelling, amazing visual effects."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"I LOVED the movie. Cinematic masterpiece and the sound design incredible. Performances were amazing. I understand people getting bored , but the movie is a built up to what's next.We should judge it that way and also it's not marvel not everything needs to be up-to speed. It was epic when it needed to be. Overall, amazing first movie can't wait fot the next part. It'll be a movie that defines the cinema of our times."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best way I can describe, and it's from someone who has never read the books, is that it's story will keep you on your seat from start to finish.
With the visuals within the world of Dune to the characters keep the plot at its pace to its design in every corner for a few minutes will keep you entertained.
For the record, very little action but that's a little minor until Part 2 since this is Part 1 being a little more story driven as the book.
As a matter of fact, this movie alone will make you think you are reading the original book along with picking up a copy and read it even before Dune Part 2.

"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,k√∂zel t√∂k√©letes mozi.
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"The beauty delivered by the cinematography is mesmerising, the production design is flawless and so smart, the screenplay delivers exactly what we need to know without any out of the place exposition and the sound is just a masterpiece delivered by the sound mixing team together with Hans Zimmer score.
And if each part is already excelling, the sum of the parts adds a boost that is so unprecedented that makes it an amazing world building masterpiece."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,A true epic mashing the most popular science fiction novel ever with a Lawrence of Arabia feel.
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,A world building spectacle that will delight fans and newcomers alike. Denis Villeneuve's vision of the source material is incredibly detailed and passionately executed.
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty good, definitely dragged on a bit though"
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,That  is good stuff.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Sci-fi movie. Can‚Äôt wait for part 2.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune is an absolute technical marvel, that I can't help but feel is a bit overrated. The technical aspects of this film are incredible. Everything from the CGI, to the sound design, to Hans Zimmer's score, is all perfect, and this film deserved every Oscar that it got. Denis Villeneuve just brings this world to life with his incredible direction. This has a stacked all-star cast, that all give fantastic performances. Whenever the very little action that there is does happen, it is brilliantly choreographed. This films also has some pretty epic moments, like when the space worm shows up, or Jason Momoa's awesome fight near the end. The reason that I don't really love this like a lot of people do, is because I'm a fan of more traditional storytelling. I like a character or plot driven narrative, that has a begging, middle, and end. A film that has setup, as well as payoff. This film is definitely a part one story, as it's almost entirely setup for a film I likely thought this would be. I feel like this could have handled the cliffhanger ending better, as it feels like they just picked a random page out of the book, and said, ""Let's end it here!"" I also felt like the pacing of this was very slow, and made parts of the film boring. Overall, this is a brilliantly made film, that I felt had more style than substance, but I feel like I will like Part 2 more."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I seriously tried to like this movie because I was a fan of the 1980s flick but it was so long and laborious to watch. I enjoy sci-fi, but it was hard to keep interest and I doubt I will watch the second part because I was so bored through the first."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a good movie, but it does not follow the book. The book is much better. Overall, this is a good movie. Oscar Isaac was a terrible pick to play Duke Atreides. Rebecca Ferguson makes up for his disaster performance."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Mais um trabalho de pura excel√™ncia de Villeneuve!
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It is long, drawn out, a boring."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excellent experience with re-release on IMAX theater, excited to the next part."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best book-to-film adaptation nomination from me, as I haven't read Tolkien. With Part Two out, I don't see how you could consider this less than five stars. It is not ""complete"" on its own, and it shouldn't be judged that way."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Just great all around!
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A visually stunning movie, though heavily reliant on dialogue, making prior knowledge of the book or subject matter essential for full appreciation. Despite this, the movie remains captivating and entertaining, showcasing a rich and immersive world."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Marvelous and breathtaking, visuals that are literally out of this world, what a fantastic contribution to the world of science fiction movies."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,The best sci-fi movie I have EVER seen.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, but a bit slow. The acting from Tim was ok but not great. Most of the other actors were amazing though. I've seen it a few times now."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning but wooden acting, confusing plot, almost religious fanatacism. Whoever said Zendaya could act? Read the books."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I wasn't really interested in Dune, but I was surprisingly impressed by it. I watched it three times. The visuals were outstanding. Acting was superb."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Such a great movie on all fronts
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie had a lot going for it! Fantastic sets, costumes, special effects, beautiful music, lore! However my inability to truly connect with Paul and Lady Jessica is what makes this a 2 stars for me. Regardless I will still watch Dune: Part 2!"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece in the full sense of the word, Villeneuve's imagining of the classic sci-fi novel is a vision for the ages."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,awesome movie with a great soundtrack
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Perfect movie with perfect casting
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"""Dune: Part One"" is an amazing science fiction movie! It looks incredible, the music is powerful, and it takes you on a wild ride to a strange desert world called Arrakis. The world feels real and lived-in, full of interesting details and strange creatures.

The actors are all great, especially Timoth√©e Chalamet as Paul, a young man with a special future. Everyone in the movie feels real, and you understand why they do what they do.  The story is about big families fighting for power, and Paul getting caught in the middle.

The movie does a fantastic job of building the world, with lots of cool details. But, it could have explained a few things about the story a bit better. Still, that doesn't stop it from being awesome!

If you like big science fiction adventures with great characters and amazing visuals, you need to see ""Dune: Part One""!"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is so good. You can see how much the actors enjoy playing. Looking forward for the part 2
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"What can I say that hasn't been already. This film is absolute masterclass in the sci-fi genre. I hate to even call it a sci-fi film, because Villeneuve has delivered us such a human story, that almost feels like a period drama. ‚ÄòDune' exemplifies the ""show, don't tell"" ethos in filmmaking. Denis Villeneuve created a universe so rich and seemingly plausible that I just want to explore it and immerse myself in it. There's. It even a criticism to be had, it's a perfect film - assuming, of course, that part 2 is equally masterful"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune gives me true Sci-Fi vibes. I love it. Can't wait for Dune: part 2 tomorrow! Feb 25! I feel part 1 did a great job of building up the story and events. It stayed true to part 1 fashion of open-ended questions and possibilities of lives lost, forgotten, or alive. 5 stars!"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,As a stand alone film it is not good. There is so much exposition for the second film that you could really just say that Dune part 1 is an almost 3 hour trailer for Dune part 2.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not bad, but I've seen better Sci-Fi. Hope part 2 delivers."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune is a cinematic masterpiece that excels in every aspect. From its breathtaking visuals that transport you to the mesmerizing desert landscapes to the stellar performances that bring the characters to life, every detail is meticulously crafted. The epic scale of the story is complemented by a gripping soundtrack, creating an immersive experience. The adaptation stays true to the source material while adding its own flair, making it a standout film. Dune's brilliance lies not only in its grandeur but in the nuanced storytelling that captivates audiences from start to finish. A triumph in filmmaking that deserves all the accolades it receives."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"It had great cinematography, sound effects
And casting of course...
Never read the novel
But it's really interesting"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was Really boring. Won't be watching the sequel.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"The first time I watched this movie I disliked it, it made little sense and the role of The Empire was not fleshed out enough to really understand the dynamics of the various social groups. I gave it a second chance and really allowed myself to fully immerse in the gorgeous sets, colors, music - and it all made sense. The movie is visually stunning and if you focus on the visual and the screenplay, the landscapes, lighting, sounds, music, costumes contribute as much to the story as the dialogue. It is a stunning movie, although I am not convinced that Timothee Chalamet is this bad-ass ninja ü•∑ messianic warrior who has come to save their universe (especially after his dreadful turn in Wonka, which really was an embarrassing part for him). He doesn't fit the part IMO, especially when his father played by Oscar Isaac is such a strong patriarch and leader. The selection of Chalamet probably has more box office draw reasoning than character match. He is too wispy and brooding, a Indie romance/drama lead more than anything else and I think it was a miscast. The same with Zendaya - she is terribly miscast in this role since she exudes a child-like quality that doesn't quite match the character. It just didn't flow for me.  Nonetheless, Hollywood is barely surviving, and movie stars are shrinking so this was probably a smart economic choice. Overall, the cast is stellar but the set design, music and costumes are really the star of the show."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really boring, impressive effects and looks good, but all style no substance. I couldn't watch it all"
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Remember how interstellar made you feel? This was a lot like that, except I knew exactly what was going to happen - and I know what's coming. Buckle up bi*ches, this is gonna be good."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very boring just like any other WB movie. Not original. Look every other movie.
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A pretty typical space war story. Slow paced and too serious to be much fun, but it has some decent effects and performances."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,The story is ok but the plot is very slowly moving forward. I fall sleep two times during the movie run . Movie not for everybody
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune: Part Two"" is a breathtaking sequel that surpasses its predecessor, blending awe-inspiring visuals, profound performances, and a deeply emotional narrative. Denis Villeneuve masterfully expands the intricate universe of Frank Herbert's saga, offering a visually stunning and philosophically rich cinematic experience. Timoth√©e Chalamet shines as Paul Atreides, supported by an outstanding cast and Hans Zimmer's evocative score, creating an immersive experience that balances epic action with intimate character development. This film is a testament to the power of storytelling and cinema, making it a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike, leaving viewers with lingering thoughts on destiny, power, and human connection."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Pacing issues. Was not impressed by the execution of the screenplay. Everything looked terrific but tasted bland. Not the grand epic science fiction advertised‚Ä¶.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great story, great looks. It felt a bit long-winded here and there, but not a problem really."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Didn't feel like 1/2 of a movie to me. This is the total package of an introduction to the Dune Franchise. It more than delivers on the promise of the trailer, and I can't wait for Part Two! 
A great introduction to the House of Atriedies, even though I haven't read the book, this is an amazing screenplay well adapted. I was aware some liberties were taken on characters, but great performances across the board for Dune Part One. I knew this would
Be next best thing."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Welcome to the world of cinema. Dune delivers on all fronts simply because it is a visual spectacle filled with juicy lore and one intriguing plotline. Get ready for a journey of the mind and heart as you see how both sides live.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This Movie is beautiful- the music mesmerizing Timothy really did wonderful and the build up of what will be next is very exciting! 
Looking forward to Dune Part 2"
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Every frame is like a painting.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely adore this movie, one of my favourites of all time"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Flat, boring & instantly forgettable. Didn`t trigger any emotion in me. One good scene though. Sardaukar planet was nice!"
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,A masterpiece of cinema!
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The sound design is the only thing that literally won my heart. But the story is scattered and the stars are wasted. Zendaya is a very very bad casting. This role was NOT meant for her.

Timothee, Rebecca, Jason, all are kind of seems wasted. They have their moments to shine but they're not enough to keep me invested in the movie all the time.

Maybe they're saving cool things for the 2nd part.

The visuals are great but tasteless all the time. It heavily relies on the music.

High hopes from the 2nd part since the first one kinda disappointed me."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dune Part 1 was way too long. Many dragged out unecessary scenes, complicated storyline to follow and overall not very entertaining. Does not make me want to watch Part 2."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"While its protagonist can be a bit bland and it could've delved deeper into its themes and ideas, Dune: Part One is so visually stunning, grand, and epic in scale in a way few movies are today."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,This would have been much cooler 2 decades ago.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the few movies in the last x years I'd seen again... took my 12-year-old son to see the re-release and he loved it a great deal, too! Studios should re-release prequels a month or so before they release the next movie. Deadpool and Deadpool 2, I'm looking at you!"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,This is (in my opinion) the greatest science fiction film i've ever seen.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very well made, hopefully the sequel improves on the very few flaws."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it, it is now my second favourite movie after the Lord of The Rings trilogy"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I always laugh at reviewers, both critics and audience, that complain about a movie being ""slow"". Think it's the instant gratification crowd talking. Do I have quibbles? Yes, but they're minor compared to the stunning overall impact this movie has + being able to retain most of the novel's complexity. As a reference, I also read the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and found it relying way too much on CGI for creating character impact. Overall, very boring in many places."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Zendaya roubou o filme mesmo aparecendo s√≥ por dois segundos.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"it stayed true to the books extremely well, which a lot of movies that are based on books struggle with, and stayed exciting even with the slow buildup."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not a terrible movie visuals are very good but story in Dune part 1 is slow and not much happens. 
When the movie starts it immediately throw you into stori of Dune but nothing will tell you what hapened before the start of the movie. Thre are some thing said but not much. 
Right after that nothing explaining start the story go on. In the middle of the movie nothing much happened except fights, some drama with family, and some story telling. 
On the end of the movie you finally start to think you are getting somewhere but when it starts to get interesting it ends. 
In my wiew whole movie could be squished into an hour and half film. Yes it is ""only"" 155 min. but lot of scenes were empty. They didnt served any purpose exept visualy good looking scenes. 
Actors were great. Visuals were also great but I think some of the space scenes were inspired by Star Wars but that could be becouse both are set in space and there is not much to change. 
Story (Only part1)- 2,5/5 
Visuals (Technical, VFX)- 4,5/5
Final conclusion (Mainly considerate the story)- 2.5/5
I hope Dune Part 2 will be better at story telling."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,One of my favorite movies! Also stays true to the book. Simply amazing!
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'll start with this; the book being adapted here is way to long to be made into a movie without cutting massive amounts of content. This movie has nothing on the book. However, for what it was able to adapt, it stayed true to the book, and the movie looks and sounds beautiful."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing‚Äîthe cinematography, score, directing, and performances are spectacular. The only problem I have with the movie is that it covers only the first half of the book. But that's not necessarily a bad thing; I believe it's the only way to adapt the book into a film. However, being just the first half, the entire narrative serves as a setup for part 2. As a result, the pacing can be quite slow at times. Nevertheless, I still consider it a masterpiece of a movie, and it sets the stage for the second part."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. Doesn't feel like it's 2hr & 40 mins
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Incredibly slow pace that is slower than reading the book itself. Despite this slow pace, however, there are many omissions and poor explanations of important plot points and developement.

The acting is freqently spoken in such a mumbled and unsupported voice (as has become a modern cinematic style...for no discernable reason), that any sort of passion or emotional depth is completely lost, with poor enunciation and pronunciation throughout the film. There are very fine actors in the film and the diverse casting is a fresh welcome, but the direction given is poor, especially causing the film's protagonist to fall flat, mispronounce important words to the source material's universe, and to mumble through most of the film, obliterating the text.

Cinematography is artisticly done but lacks reason or purpose for why it is done, so it feels avant garde rather than serving a purpose to compliment or to advance the film.

Soundtrack is mediocre and borderline horrible, replete with terrible clich√© and a very flat and robotic sound from overuse of poor synthesizers (Let ""Inception Horn"" die already) and tropes for movies with desert settings.

However, the visuals are stunning and very atmospheric and the costuming is fantastic."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"A truly epic depiction of Herbert's source material supported by a stellar cast, soundtrack and imagery."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"An incredible work from Denis Villeneuve that showcases his technical filmmaking mastery very well. The sound is full, the score is evocative, the visual palette is unique to Arrakis, rather than replicating Tatooine. This entire film is pure set-up, which could alienate some fans with regards to story and plot. I appreciated the set-up, knowing there will be a Part 2 that will fully realize this story's potential. The ""unfinished"" nature did slightly take away from the overall quality of the film, but there is enough there to keep most viewers highly engaged (especially for science fiction fans). I would imagine fans of the book are on board with this adaptation, overall. Part 2 is my NUMBER 1 anticipated film of the year for 2024."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Frank Herbert's most popular story, DUNE, comes to life like never before in a movie that is outstanding, breathtaking, and very beautiful to look at."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,A very faithful adaptation of Herbert's classic but also a very soulless one.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Have read all of the Dune books. Did not think this movie was nearly as well done as the one made in the 80's.  Certainly will wait for the second on cable. thank you
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible spectacle and world building, the narrative is just scattered for me personally and it becomes a chore by the time you reach the 8th Paul fever dream about the Fremen."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve's creation is phenomenal. Timothee Chalamet is a chameleon. He sealed the deal of being the leading man of this generation, real Hollywood star. The film touched my soul and one of the best in the recent years."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, I saw in when it originally came out and I just recently went back for a second time to prepare for the second movie and it was just as good. Must see."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a spectacle, a masterpiece of science fiction. I hope part two is even better. Denis Villeneuve is the savior of science fiction in cinema."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Truly a bore fest. Nice visuals does not equate to a good movie. Felt like a long soulless perfume commercial, no in depth character progression, bland acting and forgettable movie."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,| Ratings Categories | {Characters (8/10) ; Cinematography (10/10) ; Plot (8/10) ; Acting (8.5/10) ; Pacing (9/10) = 87%}
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,As a movie critic i give it a 4.5
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Never saw the original movies, but this remake is definitely an intriguing and great entry point for new comers."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"What a spectcale. Visually and audibly amazing. Loved the story, utterly gutted when I realised that we'd have to wait for the rest of the story."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Visually pleasing, if you have a surround sound this one sounds great. Interesting story definitely would watch again."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie looks amazing and beautiful and has really good actors, but It's kinda long and occasionally boring"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I watched the movie hoping for a bit more originality and something different. I'm always useless with character names so having a hero with a nice easy name like Paul was quite refreshing. To me, the characters all seemed to lack depth and the dialogue was a bit shallow. It was like they planned the scenes on this massive budget and then just quickly storyboarded a draft concept on the script. They then ran out of time and just progressed with the draft script where none of the characters had any depth.

I found the story really confusing! I watched the movie with my family and we had an unplanned interuption halfway through the film. Me, my wife and our two kids (17 & 13) had a conversation about the movie. None of us had a scooby-do (clue) what was going on. We more or less followed what what was happening but none of us understood why. The backstory / explanation just wasn't there. We had to accept that the telly tubby emperor was the really bad guy and he stopped liking the other bad guys and basically wanted to give everyone on the whole planet a roasting. The bad guys then joined forces with the good guys to take on the emperor. 

There are several films where I've decided that you couldn't pay me to watch the follow on movie. This isn't in that category. It isn't awful and I would give Dune 2 a second shot. The cast were excellent, the effects were really well done. The budget must have been massive. I just hope they sort out the story for the second film and build the characters a bit."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"As Part One begins, Dune is really amazing and most astounding visuals of all, noted as one of the greatest science-fiction genre by critics and audiences alike which is based on Frank Herbert's novels set in the far distant of the planet, with stellar ensemble performances portrayed as noble families from different houses, praising for Denis Villenueve's directing, costume design, Hans Zimmer's score, cinematography, and others."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolute cinema. Denis is a director that is not afraid to focus on the deeper side of the story. Spetacular sci-fi movie
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"For a Part 1 of a cinematic journey it hits hard. Leaves some room for desiring more, but overall incredible"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best science fiction epics in the last two decades. Worthy to stand up to any modern day science fiction.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked it enough to want to venture out again for Part 2, better than the original at least I stayed awake through the first part here unlike the original where I fell asleep pretty quickly."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I never read the book and hated the first film but this one was well-crafted and very enjoyable.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Always thought this was a great movie but rewatching after Dune: Part Two has turned it into a sci-fi masterpiece. It's fascinating to watch and dissect every line of dialogue having the context of Part Two. I also think it flows better than Part Two.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I will watch Dune 1 just to refresh myself on the story line ,coming this March ."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Meh, bad acting, too slow, poor character development leads to not caring when people died."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete garbage. Boring and tedious.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNEEE
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome sci fo movie with great story action and characters.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The story and performances start very strong, but as the story loses momentum, the acting is strained by the weight it must carry. I recommend watching the 1984 Dune directly after as it fills in some of the lore and character background that enrich the appreciation of Villeneuve's."
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Second half is definitely much stronger than the first but an amazing movie once you get past around 40 minutes
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"A bit long, but I liked it a lot, the sequel looks great and I hope it has the same quality of soundtrack"
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is a masterpiece
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,It's even greater in IMAX!! I saw it in theaters the first round but after getting another chance to see it again in IMAX is a glorious opportunity not to be missed!!
"Feb 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"The surprising thing about this film is the chill that we are not so far from the temperatures that appear in that time (50-60 centigrade). I thought it was perfect that they left the first part incognito and waited for a second part. Overall the story, scenery, characters, beasts caught my attention."
"Feb 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"DUNE is definitely a massive cinematic epic movie experience. Its absolutely stunning to watch in IMAX screen. Lead character performances were great, set pieces are amazing to watch, costumes designs are incredible. There are few downsides as well, the character introductions aren't good feels like we are watching right into an ongoing story, there are some dialogues (whispering) that I couldn't understand. And as a plot, the movie has little momentum, and easily made within 120 minutes instead of 155 minutes.

Overall, Dune is impressive in filmmaking wise and visually beautiful. Apart from visuals there's nothing to be impressed. Worth watching in IMAX format."
"Feb 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That was a good movie. IS WHAT I WOULD'VE SAID!! Hadn't it been for this being a 2 and a half hour set up for the next movie. No plot points are engaging, because it isn't a sudden / major shift in tone or story. it's a constant slow journey. The only good is the technical aspect. "
"Feb 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Just re-watched the movie today 2-24 and it's amazing the cast is fire and the entire script and acting are incredible cant wait for part two
"Feb 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, I can't walt for the sequel."
"Feb 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hard to follow as looses the ""storyline"". Others walked out. We considered that but stayed in hopes it would get better, didn't.  The scene form the ads never appeared in the movie.  Waste of"
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible. Intimate, yet breathtakingly cinematic."
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"The score, performances and visuals in this movie are incredible. The accuracy to the source material feels spot on. Casting choices for each character feel well thought out. The score does everything you want it to situationally and emotionally. Overall, just a very enjoyable movie. There are some slow spots but most will be paid off eventually."
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome! Can't wait for part 2
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Omg go see this again and see it in Imax!!! Also, great sneak peak for Dune 2 at the end!!!"
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Having scarred our planet by mining, this film depicts similar mining activities on other planets - so with natural lessons to be learned. Quite a long movie, but it held my attention throughout. Although I must add, there seemed something a little unwholesome about Rebecca Ferguson's love for her son"
"Feb 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The music is constant. The dialogue is whispered. The sound is horrible. Great settings, plot, action but turn the sound off or get a headache."
"Feb 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Probably one of the best films I have ever seen absolute recommend.

If you haven't seen then you have to see it 
Can't recommend it more."
"Feb 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"An immersive experience, this can't get better anywhere but in an IMAX theater. Sublime!"
"Feb 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune is a must see. In every area the movie is a masterpiece- ESPECIALLY THE LOOK OF IT! As a reader of the book it captures it in the greatest way possible, and timothee is exactly what I envisioned paul to look like when I read the book. Im so happy they split it into two parts instead of following the ideas of the OG dune film. the acting is great, the story is great, the only thing I would change is make It a little bit more colorful in the city areas when it comes to how it looks but its not a big deal so WATCH THE MOVIE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU"
"Feb 8, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best sci-fi adaptions
"Feb 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Beautiful and atmospheric, really puts you into another world. It has deliberate pacing and takes itself very seriously, so it's not something to take your kids to."
"Feb 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Endless boring streching of build up to something that never happened. Doesn¬¥t matter to what minute you jump, the same constant nothing. One of the biggest disapointing story ever."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"one of the best films of recent years, but is clearly a set-up for part 2"
"Feb 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An hour into this borefest I was hoping a sandworm would burst through my floor and try to swallow me, just to add some excitement to the viewing experience."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,As someone who has read all the books I'm happy to say this is as good as it gets in live form! Captures the main parts of the story without needing the inner dialogue. Great film can't wait for the next few!!
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Great üëãüèª waiting for part 2 üí´
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I watched the movie and love the visuals but always felt like I missed something important. Read the books and watched again and appreciate the effort by the film makers to be faithful to the books. Although alot of stories were cut out of the movie, you can tell the heart in making this movie is in the right place. Can't wait for season 2"
"Feb 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,Watching this at home it drags till the last hour
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible cinematography, entrancing music and elite casting. What a visual feast for the senses. Leaves you wanting more!"
"Feb 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Maybe the book would change peoples idea of the movie or maybe its just not my type of film but I found this movie very slow and very boring. It was exhausting to watch and the plot made no idea. It felt like I needed to read the book to understand the movie but my Grandma said she read the book and she didn't like the movie at all and she really enjoyed the book. This movie just wasn't interesting and I'm curious on how others really enjoyed this movie. the only thing going for it to me is the scenery.
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"The hero of this movie is the score. Hans Zimmer rules every scene in this film, and that's saying something given that every actor, writer, costumer, the director and beyond are bringing their best to it and just completely devastating us with how good they are. Dune is storytelling at its finest. What a time to be alive!"
"Jan 31, 2024",NEUTRAL,E uma √≥tima fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica a hist√≥ria de mundo e bem interessante quando chegam em arank a cinematogr√°fica do lugar n√£o √© muito desenvolvida por ser um deserto mas a cultura √© as criaturas s√£o muito interessante tem momentos em que o filme √© bem lento mas o Oscar isaac consegue ser um pilar muito bom junto com o Jason mamoa
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"The scenery is captivating. Great cast, and keeps getting better as the movie goes on. You never want it to end. Looking forward to the next one."
"Jan 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"√â um bom filme, mas funciona principalmente como uma hist√≥ria de apresenta√ß√£o do mundo, personagens, hist√≥ria e entre outros. Sem o filme 2 talvez duna seria algo apressado e sem sentido, apesar de ser uma hist√≥ria muito interessante, Duna n√£o consegue concluir nenhum arco nesse primeiro cap√≠tulo. Diga-se de passagem, trilha sonora, fotografia e dire√ß√£o √© uma obra prima, simplesmente sensacional, da uma imers√£o absurda."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Epic yet sentimental.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune is universally known as one of the most difficult books to adapt to the big screen, due to its vast lore and high density of events. Despite this, Denis Villeneuve successfully manages to transpose this immense story, raising his Dune into the Olympus of the best adaptations in the history of cinema. This movie is absolutely flawless on a technical level, both from a directorial and photographic point of view and from the point of view of special effects and score. It perhaps suffers from the typical problem of all movies that want to be a ""part one"", that is, the fact of interrupting themselves without a real self-conclusion. However, even if non-fans of the book might find some aspects of its development a little obscure since some explanations present in the book are left implicit, Dune remains a gem of the cinema of the last 10 years."
"Jan 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Great cast, solid acting, visually stunning. F fans of the book will be disappointed by the omission of some of the most iconic scenes but overall it was entertaining."
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune is an absolutely brilliant and thrilling Film, Paul is a great protagonist and everything about his character is incredibly interesting. Paul constantly gets these dreams and illusions, throughout the Film many of Paul's illusions actually happen which proves that he truly can see the future. Also the visual effects in this Film are absolutely beautiful and stunning, this Film definitely has some of the best visuals I've ever seen. The only problem I have with this Film is its abrupt ending, but besides that this Film truly is amazing. Overall Dune is truly an amazing piece of Cinema, and I'm definitely excited to see what happens next in Dune: Part Two!"
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was an epic awesome story. Creative world, interesting plot, no eight levels of self-awareness. Lovely."
"Jan 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm giving it 2 stars, not 1 because I only watched about 2 minutes of it. There was nothing compelling to make me want to sit through 2.5 hours of sand."
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Once you get passed the learning curve, Dune Pt. 1 is visual eye candy. Denis has created a universe of beautiful sound and imagery."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,I just watched the re-release last night in IMAX.  I was one of those who never viewed it in the theater due to the virus and the availability on HBO MAX.   It was like a totally different experience in theater.   Wow.  The sheer beauty of this film is something wonderful to behold.  Love live Cinema!
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This was a rare opportunity to get a post-Covid experience to watch a masterpiece of a film with other fans of Dune. This was the best movie of 2021 hands down and I was happy I could relive it in IMAX for 2023 prior to the sequel.
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"AMAZING!!!! This is my first viewing of Dune and now I understand the hype. IMAX Laser does this movie wonders, I saw this at AMC Metreon for the one night screening and I LOVE when the entire screen fills up to the 1:43:1 ratio. It gives me the feeling seeing Oppenheimer on this exact screen did. Words don‚Äôt do this review justice. You need to see it and experience it yourself to understand just how amazing it is."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome remastering of the 2021 movie! Sneak peek is super worth it so keep your patience through the end and the credits!
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Better in IMAX!!! Awesome!!!!
"Jan 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Liked the action and fight/adventure scenes. Actors were all great, and the backgrounds were captivating."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,I‚Äôve seen this back in 2021 but I‚Äôll say it again‚Ä¶A Cinematic Masterpiece!!!
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Watching in IMAX is how it should be viewed. It's truly a spectacular achievement by the filmmaking genius Denis Villenueve, and if Part Two delivers just as hard, this will be science fiction for the ages."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic! This is a visually stunning and a captivating recreation of the famous novel. The movie jumps right in, so pay close attention, as there is a lot of detail to absorb, both cinematically and narratively."
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Visualy stunning and tecnicly one of the best movies.
"Jan 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"To say this is the least interesting of Villeneuve's three big science-fiction films is a little unfair. Most film-makers would struggle to follow up Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 with something roughly their equal. Adapting a source novel as dense and mired in cod mysticism as this makes it all the harder. That the finished project is both coherent and enjoyable enough to not only more than justify its existence but also to justify a sequel is a significant achievement on its own terms. 

The screenplay works something close to a miracle by being economic with quite a significant of exposition and spoken world-building, and the direction is characteristically interesting enough to get us past the denser parts. Like most of Villeneuve's films it is visually stunning; the whole film looks simply stunning, and some of it is expertly designed - I especially liked the shield, which shimmers and hums tangibly. 

I read the book as a teenager  - now too long ago to really remember anything - so coming to this as an effective newcomer I did find that some plot developments seemed to appear out of nowhere; but not enough of them to distract. The biggest issue for me is the film's star. To this point I've been a Chalamet skeptic, and here I saw little to change that. It's true that in epic adventures like this the central character is rarely the most interesting, and it may be that the character flowers and emerges in the second film. That would make more sense of the performance choices; but the combination of the way the character is written and performed makes Paul too much of a blank space for ... what exactly to be projected on to is not entirely clear. There's not enough charisma or interest to anchor the film emotionally; Rebecca Ferguson's character has similar traits (or lack of them), but for me she's a naturally more interesting actor to carry her role past these weaknesses. 

We'll see how the second film may change or confirm any of this It's looks (and sounds, especially with Zimmer's brilliant score) quite magnificent, and does more than enough to bring you back for seconds."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I dont remember the last time i saw a movie this good! When you have the ability to geek out about all the details and lore movies like this is perfect for me. The slow pacing and build up makes it stand out from all the standard copy paste action movies that keeps coming out and this movie came out at the right moment when i was pretty bored of most movies.

Also as a big fan of the books seeing a great adaptation like this is a dream come true and with part 2 out so soon watching this before and part 2 after will be a great experience."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Epic. See it in IMAX. 
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune is one of the best movies in 2021.
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Had a really fun time with this one,
Not surprised that it only made just under 400 million in the box office becuase as it was directed at a older audience and would be quite boring for some one who has a short attention span.But overall in my opinion it was amazing can't wait for the part 2 coming out this year"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,A very brief learning curve to understand the Dune universe without any prior knowledge of the old Dune or the book. The feel and visual look of the film is like a mashup of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"First time I watched it at the cinema, it was just like a blast to me. Fresh and powerful, beautiful landscape, richt story from Franck Herbert's Universe, faithful to the main aspects of the book. I cannot wait the 2nd part."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,An accurate adaptation of a wonderful series! Dune: Part I does a wonderful job of summing up a complex and extremely long book (admitting the fact that it doesn't even finish). To love the movie is to love the book and vise versa.
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing acting, good script (pretty close to the book but could be closer), AMAZING music (Zimmer never disappoints), breathtaking cinematography... almost perfect."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is one beautiful film. What director Denis Villeneuve was able to accomplish was simply breathtaking. Naturally, I am doing things out of order and watching the movies first before reading the books, but this interpretation of the material seems rather inspired. Mixed with Hans Zimmer's powerful score, it's a shame I missed this movie on the big screen. 

Aside from a few awkward dialogue moments early on (the acting felt like acting), my only other gripe is the resistance to use inner monologues. Villeneuve said the choice was intentional as he felt he could convey the material better without them, but to be honest, if I hadn't had watched the David Lynch version prior to this, I would've felt lost at times. 

Despite that, the film was captivating in a way that I hadn't experienced in a movie before. I can't wait for the sequel this Fall."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Yes it could have been more psychedelic and I continue to be slightly annoyed by Villeneuve's obsession with imagery that is too clean, orderly, and monocolor for my taste (even the dirt and grime in his films are spotless) but the book's wonderful weirdness is still there and I remain pleasantly surprised to see the heavy word building and exposition was neither too watered down nor so tedious the movie came to a screeching halt even time they had to explain what was going on."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Better than Star Wars. It's crazy... everything about it. The CGI, acting, music, plot based off the book. Should watch."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sch√∂ne Bilder aber langweilig
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome first entry into this universe. Great adaptation from an almost impossible story to adapt well. Timothee Chalamet did an excellent job as did the rest of the cast. Denis Villeneuve has done an amazing job.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I stand with this movie. An excellent work of art. I really can't describe it. A lot of great actors, great plot, CGI, writing, acting, everything. Warner Bros. and Legendary Prods. cooked up here"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"#MovieReview #DuneMovie #Dune2021

OK I have some mixed feelings about this movie. I went into this movie not understanding what it was even going to be about, because I don't know this story. But going into this movie and as I started watching this movie it reminded me of Star Wars meets tremors.

Which I'm OK with both, I had to pay close attention so I understood the story. I will tell you that Timoth√©e ChalametÔøº is hands-down my top three favorite actors of all time. But he's been that way for years now not because of this movie, but he is the reason I went and saw this movie. #Timoth√©eChalamet

This movie is lined up with so many actors and actresses, people from so many different walks of life. Rebecca Ferguson, is hands-down wonderful in this movie, she is basically the equivalent of the queen, but they call her lady. She does a fantastic job in this movie, her and Timothee Carey the movie completely.ÔøºÔøº

Now the planes look like dragonflies, that's not a spoiler it's in the trailer. I couldn't follow 100% what was going on. But I can say that it was pleasant to watch, it wasn't the best, and it left me with a lot of questions. I wish this edition would've made me believe there's a new beginning, middle and an end. With progression into a possible sequel. But I felt like this movie just basically said you're done, and we're gonna leave you with 1000 questions. That's not really great!

My friend is at the movie theater now watching this movie because he absolutely loves Zendaya but if she's the reason you're going to see this movie then I recommend you watch the greatest showman. The first two hours of the movie she's in the movie a minute max, and then she's in the last 10 minutes of the movie with maybe one line, and the rest she's just staring. So she was heavily promoted as a major part of this movie, to not even barely be in this film.

Jason Momoa, looks totally different with a shaved face, but it was nice to see him out of the Aquaman role. And to see him be able to hold his own in another franchise, he really is a great actor. But again he has a side character so if you're going to see him in the movie you might have maybe 30 minutes. Dave Bautista, it was good to see Drax, but if you're going to see him in the movie you have about 10 minutes. Oscar Isaac a.k.a. Moon Knight, if you are going to see him in the movie you have an hour.

No none of that is spoilers, I'm not saying people are alive or dead, or in the film completely or disappear, no spoilers. I'm just saying those characters are falsely advertised.

Now with that being said, my only thing I could think of that would be a negative outside of your favorite actors being short scenes. I would say it's a little weird that Timoth√©e Chalamet is being portrayed as Jesus. That was a little hard, but it wasn't so pushed, to make the Christians uproar.

But yes, I would love to see this turn into a franchise, and only get better. But when I think of a franchise Star Wars, marvel, Batman, scream, Halloween, and even the descendants. The first film is always so great that it locks you in, and then if the second film isn't so great, most movies, that gives them a third film to round out the trilogy to make it even better again. But this movie definitely missed its mark on the amazing wow factor of the first film. So I would say it gets six out of 10 stars, Timoth√©e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson get 10 out of 10 stars.

But I do recommend giving it a chance, seeing this movie. Because I think it would be better on the big screen, and I also feel it has so much potential to be long lasting. The issue is will the general public give it a chance to succeed.ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº

ÔøºÔøºÔøº"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen - so so so boring I fell asleep and I was watching it in imax. I literally cannot stress how boring of an experience this movie is
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, excited for part two!"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely beautiful!  An epic worthy of the story.  If you love this, then you should go back and watch the miniseries ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" and then ""Frank Herbert's Children of Dune"" to get even more out of the story.  And imo the second Children of Dune miniseries is actually at the same level of this latest movie so you won't regret it!"
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dreadfully boring, you'll find yourself wishing the worms were real so they would put you out of your misery. If you ever feel like watching Dune, I recommend a slideshow of desert screensavers on a timer, it's just as entertaining"
"Jan 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This was a pretty decent flick.  Not the best adaptation by any means. I actually think the Syfy channel miniseries was far superior in its adherence to the source material.  The shots were gorgeous if overlong, and some of the character changes make little sense in context if you are at all familiar with the novels.  Overall not a bad film, not a great one, but better than the Lynch adaptation."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This new adaptation of Dune is fantastic. It's visually stunning and original. The casting and performances are perfect, the overall mood and setting hits just the right blend of a grounded real world and high stakes, with persistent mystery, ominous danger, and magic, the pace is measured but packed with action, and the dialogue is excellent. This is definitely the closest adaptation to the feeling and intention of the source material and I can't wait to see the next chapter."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"A true adaptation of the novel, great all across the board. And I actually like the 1984 film also!"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,I have to just come out and say it's my new favourite movie of all time. So what. I love everything about it.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,a masterpiece - a rare gem in today's pile of garbage
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,I'm saying it's good as it isn't bad! And I'm very much anticipating part two (which took way too long) for the follow-up on stuff... But a lot of things could have been in way more depth and explanation... Also maybe a prequel for some much needed explanation? And seriously I still don't get the spice!
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,The special effects and battle scenes are amazing and the movie lays a very good foundation for Part II. It's way closer to the book than I expected and thought possible. The runtime could have been shortened a bit though.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the movie!  Can't wait for part 2!  I'd recommend watching
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Of course I wanted the dinner scene, didn't we all? But that apart this is the best adaptation yet. Yes it missed many of the themes of the book but has told the story well and the cinematography was amazing on the big screen. Really looking forward to part 2"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part One is a great film adaptation of Frank Herbert's original Dune novel and a breath of fresh air for the sci-fi genre with Hans Zimmer's fresh style of music, absolutely insane cast, eye-catching cinematography, and complex plot."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Classic Villeneuve. Perfect atmosphere, very good picture, CGI was perfect. The acting from Ferguson, Isaac, Momoa, Skarsgard and Brolin was very strong but Chamalet and Zendaya were the weak link of the movie"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was excited to see Chalamet's lead role in this film. Played it well, but the film left a lot to be desired. I know it was only part 1, but the ending didn't leave you feeling like you wanted more."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loves the first Dune when I was a kid but this is next level!  Looking forward to 2nd part.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Denis Villeneuve visuals are 10/10. Story is a little slow to develop but it puts the table for a great part 2. I was entertained and interested by the world of Dune which was new to me.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was blown away by this film. I'm not a big sci-fi/fantasy fan but the cinematography, music and well-paced character development within an alternate universe was outstanding. I watched it twice at the cinema within a couple of weeks. A diamond."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,B to the O to the R I N G. A bunch of nothing.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought Dune was slow and drawn out.  They built up suspense with excellent musical scores but cinematically failed to deliver. I was waiting for something to happened and nothing was delivered.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't understand the point of the movie ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the original David Lynch version of Dune, so was looking forward to a more modern take and excited to see what Denis Villeneuve's take would be‚Ä¶ was not disappointed even with very high-expectation. Cinematography was nearly another key character, simply stunning. Loved the establishing of the backstory for the characters in order to set up the second movie.  If there's and smidge of a constructive criticism it'd be how much of the story was accomplished before the end of part-1, but as good as it was it just made me want part-2 to start immediately (that's the ultimate compliment right?)"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Esperando o segundo, mas esse achei bom. Comparado ao antigo teve mais tempo pra contar as coisas com calma"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A brilliant redemption of 1984's Dune with its wonderful visuals, soundtrack, and acting performances."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow. Simply wow. This is a great SciFi-movie. Cant wait for the next part. With the bagpipes again I hope! üòä
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really like it , can't wait for part 2 in 2024."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. Slow. Characters whispering for no reason. Would be a better series show.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This is my favorite film & book of all time. It's the best adaptation I've ever seen. There is so much emotion in this Movie. I've watched it over 10 times. I cannot wait for part 2.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm a snob for the books and while the effects and costuming were beyond stunning, I feel like they completely wiped away the underlying messages and even the point of Dune at all in order to avoid controversy, especially surrounding religion (primarily Christianity), imperialism, and colonization. They left in just enough to hint at the storyline but borderline sanitized it to not offend. And it seems in the sequel we won't be having quite a few important things either. Stunning visually, lacking the true raw beauty of the depth of the point."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great sci fi story, can't wait for the next one"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece. Epic cast, great story telling and amazing cinematography and special effects."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,In a world full of re-makes and re-hashes of proven formulas. This film is refreshingly unique and does a great job of building a world I hope to see lots more from.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"O diretor conseguiu adaptar a obra de Frank Hebert com mestria. Uma verdadeira celebra√ß√£o para f√£s da obra, como eu. Com uma fotografia e uma trilha sonora de tirar o f√¥lego. Simplesmente magn√≠fico."
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cameo porn in the most boring movie I have seen in a while. Chalamet's bored performance made this a chore to watch completely through.
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aesthetically cool on the big screen, that‚Äôs pretty much it. I suppose it can be appreciated more as a design effort"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A straight up 5 out of 5. Altough it's a part 1 it still can be viewed as a standalone movie and for me it's one if not the greatest space scifi ever made. A masterpiece!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,say no more...its a classic...and part II cannot come soon enough
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have never been much of a sci-fi fan but I enjoyed this one. Visually looks great, good pacing, dialogue and acting. I'll be going to see Part 2 for sure."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A lot of hype around this one and I don't see why. I did not see the original, and big names in this one, but the story just wasn't for me. Too long also and it clearly sets up part two."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece. Faithful to the books (as far as I remember I read them when I was 11) and the soundtrack and cinematography were unreal. This is the standard all sci-fi movies should be set to. Very refreshing to see an actually good sci-fi get released post 2010. The casting was amazing, and proves it is possible to have a diverse cast without sacrificing quality. Very excited to see part 2."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally an adaptation worthy of its source material. Although the pacing is monotonous at first the story does pick up in tandem with staggering visuals & set pieces. Denis Villeneuve has concocted a marvel on a grand scale with enough human emotion that would make Frank Herbert proud.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too sandy. Need more üå≤
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film, truly in Asimov's vision. Also, brilliant soundtrack from Hans Zimmer."
"Dec 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Much like the original this movie was slow and boring.  I also don't understand the current infatuation with Timothy Chalamet.
"Dec 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was easily one of the most bland, boring, and lackluster movies of all time. The acting was horrible, the writing was worse. I saw other people talking about the stunning visuals.  Were we watching the same movie? It was a lot of sand and then every now and then a mediocre fight scene. Watch any war movie of modern day and youll see all the action of dune in the first 15 minutes. My gawd if these high ratings are indicator of intelligence we're all doomed."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not familiar with the Dune story so I came into it not knowing anything about the story line. I loved this movie and literally applauded at the end of it. I'm the type that doesn't need an action packed from start to finish experience. Just give me a good story, good characters, good acting. I love a movie with good cinematography, good character development, and a compelling plot that I can immerse myself into the characters. This movie had all that. It's kind of like Interstellar was for me. A grand cinematic experience that had a compelling story to tell."
"Dec 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"so long and boring didn't even have a storyline
Liked the sand worms that was quite good
WHERE WAS ZENDAYA??????"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,World building off the charts! Really liked this one. Very well put together from someone who hasn't read the books. It got there for me.
"Dec 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's ambience was incredible, with a lot of tension especially with the sandworm scene, but it frankly never hit its stride for me. It was beautiful, yet very slow, with a rather monotone plot that never intrigued me."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie itself is good. My only issue with this movie is the sound. It is one thing to be artistic with the approach to the sound but this movie ranges from head pounding deafening to completely inaudible dialogue. Not sure about the weird sound editing job on this entire movie. 
  The movie Arrival was nearly the same. But not quite as drastic.  I own both Arrival and Dune and they are hard to watch specifically because of the audio."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is the original Star Wars but better, the legendary Denis Villeneuve incorporates practical effects, amazing CGI, deep character narratives, making music its own character, and making overall one of the best book-to-cinema adaptations in Hollywood history."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of those which you must watch in theater.
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Title: ""A Disappointing Cinematic Misstep""

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

I recently had the misfortune of watching this, and to say I was underwhelmed would be an understatement. This boasted an intriguing premise, but as the story unfolded, it became painfully clear that the execution fell far short of expectations.

First and foremost, the pacing was a major letdown. Scenes dragged on unnecessarily, leaving me checking my watch in anticipation of some meaningful development. It felt like the director was more interested in showcasing indulgent shots and lingering close-ups than in advancing the plot. The result was a tedious viewing experience that tested my patience.

The characters, despite being surrounded by a potentially engaging narrative, were disappointingly one-dimensional. It seemed as though the scriptwriters had neglected character development altogether, leaving the audience with little reason to invest emotionally in their fates. The lack of depth and complexity made it difficult to connect with any of the characters, rendering the film's emotional moments flat and unconvincing.

The dialogue was equally uninspired, filled with clich√©s and predictability. At times, it felt like the characters were reciting lines from a tired playbook of overused tropes. The attempts at humor often fell flat, and the dramatic moments lacked the necessary nuance to evoke genuine empathy.

Moreover, the cinematography, touted as a highlight in promotional material, failed to live up to the hype. While there were occasional visually striking shots, the overall aesthetic failed to contribute meaningfully to the storytelling. It appeared as though the filmmakers prioritized style over substance, leaving the audience with a superficial and forgettable visual experience.

To add insult to injury, the climax and resolution were anticlimactic and lacked the impact needed to salvage the film. I couldn't help but feel a sense of dissatisfaction as the credits rolled, realizing that the potential for a gripping and memorable story had been squandered.

In conclusion, it was a disheartening disappointment. The lackluster execution, from pacing issues to shallow characterizations, left me questioning the critical acclaim it may have received. Save yourself the time and frustration ‚Äì there are plenty of more deserving films and dramas out there to explore."
"Dec 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i don't think this movie deserves a high rating. In my opinion, it succeeded with the visual and cinematic aspects as the director did a great job with it and the CGI looks beautiful, as for acting it was decent not the best but not the worst either, the movie felt dragged in some scenes with nothing to offer to the story overall, music score is bad and felt out of touch in the movie with high vocal which make you feel like you watching some epic historical fights that didn't really relate to the world of Dune so Hans Zimmer didn't exactly hit the spot with this one.

if you read the books (i didn't) then you probably would understand the movie better, however, if you didn't then you maybe feel a little bit lost in the story, so i believe if this was turned into a TV Show it would have been better.

for me it is an average movie and nothing groundbreaking besides the visuals"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Frank Herbert's Dune was infamously ""unadaptable"" to the silver screen. That was, until Denis Villeneuve did his thing. It's not perfect and I have my (minor) gripes, but I feel Denis really captured the quintessence of the book. Dune walks the fine line between hard sci-fi and space opera with grace and delivers the spectacle, heroics and philosophy fans of the book expect. Stellar performances, beautiful cinematography and a cracking soundtrack from Hans Zimmer seals the deal. Denis Villeneuve's Dune is about as good as I could have hoped it could be!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A brilliant introduction to this amazing world.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie. Incredibly atmospheric. Great casting and performances
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, Dune done right!
I read the book three times in my life. I understand some of the minor changes made. Even The Lord of the Rings had changes, as novels to films do, so I'm fine with them.
It was beautiful to behold, well directed and well acted. 
Waiting for Dune Part II
Hopefully Dune Messiah will be made to at least finish telling Paul Atreides story."
"Nov 28, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best sci-fi movies made in the past few years. The plot is interesting and has me hanging on the end of my chair for the whole movie. The only reason I didn't give whole five stars is because Dune 2 is so late
"Nov 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Spectacular performance that captures the essence of the book well. A must see for all fans of science fiction!
"Nov 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I expected them to improve on the many failings of the original movie. The original movie had something magical that made it a cult movie despite weak special effects and some odd photography choices. This new attempt is basically the opposite. With a cast of a thousand, good special effects and excellent photography the movie falls flat on its ass. It looks completely fake. Like a job well done. No magic. A sad waste."
"Nov 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Yooo! Where my hive mind at!?""

479-466-0344"
"Nov 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another empty vessel of a modern movie filled with eye candy. Maximum style points, but overall pretty painful to watch as the movie lurches from one predicament to the next as beautiful scenery rolls by. I found myself caring very little for any of the characters. In fact, most of them were little more than annoying."
"Nov 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see!! Can't wait for part 2 & hopefully a part 3 as well! ü§©üòçü§§
"Nov 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not quite another Star Trek or Star Wars but in that vein ‚Äî characters are hard to like despite noble traits
"Nov 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A whole four stars- the movie brought me on board with the franchise where I would otherwise may not have come. This movie has room and time to grow. Sandworms were pretty neat and of course Zendaya plays a role outside of her Spiderman films that I actually kind of enjoy. Definitely need a Dune 2 and look forward to watching it. Great acting and immersive. Worth the time for the watch and great character development. I'm sure the bookworms aren't impressed right now, but hey they try."
"Nov 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not sure why this movie gets good reviews. Everyone whispers through half the movie, most of it is under lite in a desert world. No color, and why was aquaman out of the water?"
"Nov 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie. Cant wait for the next
"Nov 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great cgi. Most was a great cast. Not Paul Atreides... My fave books are the Dune collection. Bad casting for Paul and Irulan or Chani?? (wasn't Irulan be the beautiful and a real temptation to Paul??) Irulan really liked him before the hell broke loose. Syfi series was the best one yet!! Please change my mind cause Zendaya is too cute for plain Chani). Paul liked Irulan. Paul is plain, tiny and boring.. Over and out..."
"Nov 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was so excited about a movie that shows what it will be in the future. The acting was phenomenal, the imagery was exceptional, but the storyline got blown into peices when at the end there was a challenge to kill a fellow worrier to earn your spot to be accepted. WTF? So Hollywood is telling us that 8000 years into the future that we still live like savages???? Sooooooo disappointing!"
"Nov 13, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my all time favorite movies. Denis Villeneuve is a master of his art form.
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"An spectacular film about how fast family can be torn apart with rivalries and unfamiliar environments, with the remains of the family learning to adapt and survive after their sudden loss."
"Nov 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Dune It's a modern masterpiece
"Nov 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great example of how good adaptations are when they hold true to the source material. The cast and world is also phenomenal.
"Nov 3, 2023",POSITIVE,So amazing. and it kept true to the books. The changes made were really incredible and it all looked amazing. Favourite movie ever!
"Nov 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seasoned of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. The fact that VIlleneuve nailed a story that was largely considered unfilmable is almost an afterthought. Incredible script, brilliant cinematography, a killer score (Hans Zimmer's career best) and great performances (especially Rebecca Ferguson) are what makes this film such a masterpiece. It isn't going to be for everyone, but to me it's fantastic. Can't wait for Part II."
"Oct 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saga muy pero que muy prometedora!!!
Espero ansioso la parte 2!!!
Una de las mejores pel√≠culas de la d√©cada."
"Oct 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"From what I understand, Dune is an adaptation of a book series, and this may be the reason the storyline in the movie is so slow. Despite the slow pace, the cinematography in the film was great. By choosing to film outdoors and use real sky and sunlight to create incredible reflections and accurate lighting, something they couldn't achieve by filming on stage. Using well-built sets and props, they really bring scenes to life. I think they could have made some elements clearer, such as a distinction between the ‚Äúhouses‚Äù, as that was a bit confusing in some scenes. There was also a lot of missing context and scenes that provided context for events that did not happen. Of course, knowing that this is just part of a series, the context of the storyline, or lack thereof of it, could be provided in the book or later in the series, I just wish they would have provided more. I'm not entirely sure about the casting of the characters, but I think for the actors that they chose, they did the best they could. It's pretty heavily stacked with big-name celebrities, like Jason Momoa, Zendaya, and Timothee Chalamet to name a few. I also probably could have done without seeing the Baron's bare bottom, but it is what it is."
"Oct 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring.  It's long and drawn out.  One good scene out of the whole movie.  The tone of the movie is dull.  Timothy's acting is horrible, I feel no relation to him or want to see him succeed.  The plot is meaningless to me.  I don't understand the high rating.  Even bad reviews give it a high rating.  Doesn't make sense"
"Oct 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is just like a poetic dream that is beyond a beautiful experience. I read the book after watching the film, and this film version does justice to the reader. This should be 100%, just watch it."
"Oct 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,All the ingredients of a great movie‚Ä¶. minus enjoyment.
"Oct 23, 2023",POSITIVE,an amazing epic that was truly great for people that have and have not read the book
"Oct 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute must-see for anyone who likes Sci-Fi, and the best film of not only 2021, but of the decade so far!"
"Oct 20, 2023",POSITIVE,a solid film with beautiful visuals but god damn there's something about timothee chalamet I can't take seriously
"Oct 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I read the books. They did an excellent job adapting it to film. The kid that plays Paul killed it. He is the way I imagined him to be when I read the books many years ago.
"Oct 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nice visuals and sound effects, yet I wasn't really hooked on what happens in the movie. Things seem to move kinda' slowly.."
"Oct 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Con una historia confusa y poco clara. Las imagenes visuales y la m√∫sica salvan la pelicula.
"Oct 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I could rewatch this amazing cinematic masterpiece at any chance I get. Loved it
"Oct 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stellar in its scenery and intense in its storytelling about a prince beginning his journey to hero! Dennis Villeneuve crafts the world of ""Dune"" with striking set-pieces and an artistically done soundtrack. The highly anticipated second part of this duology cannot come fast enough!"
"Oct 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the books, and I think this does a fantastic job of bringing the story to the screen! Much better than that David Lynch version. The knife fights are especially well choreographed. I'm looking forward to the second movie!"
"Oct 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad. A huge improvement over the '80s version. I was disappointed that I never got a good look at a worm, though.

I've heard good things about the series that came out between these, but I haven't yet seen it."
"Oct 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm sorry to say how disappointed I am at this move. The casting and acting are very good, but the directing is horrible. It is not often that a leave a negative review. But this is not good at all. The original is amazing.  But this is far from the original. For example, there is a battle scene where I can't tell who is who? Both sides are not developed. I can't tell what is going go. They are all cover up with uniforms that I have never seen before.  It could have been taken for another movie. Very disappointed. I will not watch part II. Part I was free on Netflix. I feel bad for all the great actors that are in the move. Sorry about the low score, but I have not meet anyone that like this movie. Maybe it is just me and my friends. Good luck watching this one."
"Oct 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much movie, could be a lot less screen time"
"Oct 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually thrilling, very good performances by the actors, the score is outsanding, one of the greatest book adaptations of all times."
"Oct 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Frank Herbert interpretation by far. Although some significant parta of the book are left out the core base is there. The cast is all-star and the directing is world class.
"Oct 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Very close to book adaptation that I can appreciate.
"Oct 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Being a fan of the of the novel, I can proudly say that Dune is a worthy adaptation to Herbert's classic and finally allows us to rest knowing that the task of conjuring a fabulous adaptation to the book has been fulfilled."
"Oct 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually appealing, well acted.  No levity or humor.  Suspensful. "
"Oct 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect adaptation of the book so far. Dune is to sci-fi what Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is to Fantasy. üëèüèª
"Oct 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is an immersive work. It's kind of slow, even during the action, but the production quality is very high."
"Oct 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched this with my boyfriend and we were so into it. We both admitted we haven't seen a movie this great in a long time. It's truly epic and fascinating and the acting is great. It's a very realistic Sci fi film compared to so many cheesy ones you actually feel like you're witnessing another planet and unusual societies.  I love the main actor as our rising hero. It's awesome!
"Oct 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was challenging for me to stay glued to the screen for the entire duration of the movie (2 and a half hours). The scenes with complete silence were uncomfortable, as were the moments when the characters whispered to each other. It's a one-time watch for me. There were too many foreshadowing moments that felt like spoilers for what would happen in a couple of minutes."
"Oct 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprised how good this movie actually is the only thing I didn't like was they cut it off right and when it's starting to get good.
"Oct 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"DUNE 2021 is an enormous, vapidly hollow toilet load that seriously needs to be flushed [four or five times] before it stinks up and infects the entire house! It's mind blowing what vapidly hollow tripe pro critics and audiences accept today as worthy of their time and money."
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE IT! If you like the books that is.
"Oct 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think movie is a little bit boring.
"Oct 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't unsee the 1984 version. It was designed by H. R. Geiger and had Sting in it. Harkonan  is pronounced with a hard KO. So... this adaptation is visually weak by comparison. The writing is often hacky, over the top, over explained (for people who refuse to read the books) was that a taxidermy bull head??? Just a sophomore treatment of the source. Sorry, it's not art and it's barely Dune, not sorry"
"Oct 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was so bad! so bad. But it has such good ratings. If you are a fan of Dune and have seen the Lunch version or the SciFi channel version, this version is much worse in every aspect, dialog, visuals, characters, color, everything SUCKS, you are just waiting for it to be over. If you have never seen or read Dune, well I can't imagine this is a good move, there is no life to any of the characters or scenes it's just bleak Sci-Fi puke with CGI stink. Yuck .... watch it and see for yourself. 

The book is so deep in developing the world and characters. The other movie adaptations are not perfect but at least they get some things right. The Lynch version was amazing with characters and visual imagery especially for the time, it was innovative  but was too short to tell the entire story. The SciFi channel version actually did the book justice, what it lacked in big hollywood names and budget it made up for in good storytelling and acting. This new version just misses on every aspect, no redeeming qualities whatsoever, nothing innovative, nothing special. I can only guess that this movie was not made for Dune fans, it was made like most movies today, just some money grab, who cares, people will watch it because they have heard of Dune."
"Oct 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The director has an Kubrick like look for the details and visual layers of a story and he has the talent to bring that feeling for that composition to the actors mainly working in front of green screens. There are only some films in history with that level of perfection.
"Oct 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It looks like real. Director perfectly change novel to movie. Make season2 faster!
"Sep 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good si-fi movie I think it's best movie,, watch it and enjoy"
"Sep 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is an imaginative masterpiece for those who want to get lost in a distant world. 

Denis Villaneuve seeminly put his heart and soul in this movie. Incredible attention to detail, unique costume design and believable world building. Dune offers an escapism experience comparable to the original Lord of the Rings thrilogy. 

The movie can be a slow burner and dissappoint those viewers waiting for action-packed scenes. It establishes the world of  Frank Herbert, staying true to the source material. The viewer discovers the political themes and the main characters. A modern classic that was created for generations."
"Sep 27, 2023",POSITIVE,What a weird movie. The plot/story telling/writing is lack luster. But this movie still manages to land based completely on ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù ie: the visuals and audio! 
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Nearly a perfect movie in my eyes. Can‚Äôt believe people don‚Äôt like this movie. Recently in my favorites. Excited for all the other movies to come out.
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,What an amazing movie can't wait for part 2
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never been a fan of denis villeneuve other than prisoners and I really did not like blade runner 2049 because he felt very long and not very intriguing to me but dune feel like blade runner 2049 but better is still has a long pause is but those long pause is actually meant something. The story of this felt very very neutral in the world building was really really visually impressive. I‚Äôve read one book on tune, but I can safely say that my favorite villain in all books is the baron and his people. This has very good sci-fi element that I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs possible and felt like this could actually exist somewhere in our world today. The only things that did not stick the landing was the cliffhanger even though it‚Äôs a proper cliffhanger still feel like some questions that need to be answered but overall a really good film and I can‚Äôt wait for part two 9/10"
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Whilst this is the first of two parts of this film, this version of Dune is not as impressive visually, artistically or in story telling, yet. The orginal film made in 1984 had it's faults, but it was visually impressive, had the spirit and essence of the Dune story and accomplished actors in the main roles. It also had great music. 

Sound is at the forefront of the Bene Gesserit weirding way. It's power and influence is the means by which Paul Muad'Dib,Usul, defeats his enemies, but this hasn't become apparent yet. Note I have also read all of the books in Dune story and was inspired to do so after watching the film in 1984."
"Sep 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"DUNE is a cinematic masterpiece where everything from set design, casting, score, editing and VFX come together like a well orchestrated symphony. Villenueve has risen the bar for all cinema and proven himself to be one of the greatest directors for creating the best movie I've ever seen. It's the first movie I've seen that is even better than the book and part 2 will be even better."
"Sep 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Audio and visually it's probably the most beautiful film I've ever seen. The director Dennis Villeneuve keeps on knocking out bangers although I haven't seen the latest blade film.
"Sep 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is an ambitious and magnficient sci-fi epic that leaves a lingering effect at the viewer and presents a powerful, meditative and gripping experience that is enhanced by Denis Villeneuve's extraordinary direction and the cast's solid performances. There are some things that could have benefitted from better detailing, but that's about it."
"Sep 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I found the plot to be sluggish, subservient to grandiose ideas that got lost in their meaning. It is my opinion that character development was weak. The director and producer took 2 1/2 hours to tell you to wait for the sequel to make sense of it all."
"Sep 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was good, the way their society is organized is fascinating. I loved the story. It was a part one but even then it was great and makes me excited for what is to come in Dune Part Two. I would recommend this film to anyone, it is a well-acted and written film that anyone would enjoy."
"Sep 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a relief to not have screen writers ruin the story as has happened with many other adaptions. Excellent cast , cinematography and effects looking forward to next instalment"
"Sep 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mmmmm. Really wanted to love this movie, but for some reason it just didn't grab me.  Nice visual effects, but for me it was lacking some edge of seat drama/action. Watchable, but I can't recommend it."
"Sep 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A very good science fiction movie
"Sep 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was rubbish.  Nothing compared to the original movie.  And what a stupid idea to make it into two films.  Why do a remake when you can't improve or even do as well as the original.  Very disappointing.  Definitely not waiting for part 2.
"Aug 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"For the longest time, I've heard a lot about the story of Dune, considered to be one of the greatest sci-fi stories ever made but the biggest disappointment in cinema history. The 1984 cult classic is not without its merits, a stellar cast and a great director but a prime example of studio interference. TV has given it an even worse name with its studio edits and rumored five-hour director's cut which has never been realized. Denis Villeneuve, however, with his interest and successes was given the reigns and made a glorious film that was years in the making.

In a far distant future, human civilization has made phenomenal advances in faster-than-light travel but not so much in government and the distribution of resources. Going to war or subjugating other worlds for such resources, in this case for the spice that fuels faster-than-light travel. Human civilization is an empire at odds with ruling houses that fight for the spice of the world of Arrakis. The House of Atreides and the House of Harrakan, with Duke Leto and his family doing what they can for the Empire and its people. But treacherous intentions as well as a prophecy motivated the natives of Arrakis toward the Duke's son Paul. An insurrection causing destruction but salvation as this is only the beginning of the adventure.

Wow! I never understood the acclaim the story received, until now. Frank Herbert created a great story, and I can see how this was screwed up on the big screen. The 1960s was subtle and modest with science fiction but it only blew up when Star Wars erupted the market. But the studios weren't patient and saw only the potential for money and not a great story. But this director was given the freedom to realize the story to its fullest potential and I cannot wait for the second part of this epic to be realized."
"Aug 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Beautiful Song of Dune 

Seeing the IMAX of Dune (2021) is an enveloping powerhouse experience that borders on the spiritual. It is a beautiful and ornate psalm, that feels ancient, as if this story known was to us subconsciously we just need to see the movie to unlock it and bring it forth into our consciousness. There is a melody to the movie that can only be heard in IMAX, becoming a Sistine Chapel experience. You do not need to understand everything that is going on to be swept away by the beauty that you see and hear, just like enjoying the melody of a song without knowing all the words. Part of the mystery is part of its charm. It has integrity, it doesn't feel like it was a part of a million focus groups where we are held by the hand through the journey.

Part of the prayer structure is archetypal troupes familiar in Joseph Campbell's hero's journey threaded through a palace drama, full of competing kings vying for power. At the end of the movie, the palace drama is replaced with a kind of Exodus/New Testament (a mother with her messianic child in the desert - heeellllo) journey. So much of the book is internal dialogue. What is staggering is how much the actors and editors can communicate and capture non-verbally with their internal dynamics. Along with that, the dream sequences/flash-forwards/prescient visions are used to get into the mind of our hero as he tries to make sense of it all and his place in the world.

Its themes revolve around self-reliance on computers, colonialism, and the plundering of one's environment for resources. It is a warning about religion and fanaticism, putting one's faith in a ""chosen one"" designed specifically by those in power to obtain more. 

The future messiah realizes he is a pawn, or meant to be a pawn to those in power, the Bene Gesserit, and he does not believe in their Messianic propaganda machine that has been at work for generations. But something frightening is happening to him and he is on a path that is beyond him, and if he is a true messiah he sees the dystopian future of what that deliverance will rot. Surprisingly, the filmmaker does a better job of establishing this relationship than Frank Herbert does, at least in the first book. And it never seems rote or a chore to the artists, they have the tools to shape the words to life.

The staggering piece is the consolidation of exposition on these dozen or so characters and finding their motives and place in the story. What is efficient is how much information is given to the audience visually. The mentats eye movements and their tattoo commonalities help us identify them in their respective kingdoms. Lady Jessica - place in the movie is not explained until Leto says, ""I should have married you."" It is a great line for the readers of the book, but I could imagine the viewer with no knowledge of the book being confused by that. If she is not the wife then what is she? Well, the movie does not have time to explain. It is on a tight schedule.

Humbled by this futuristic Biblical movie, I am grateful to have a substantial Dune movie, where the producers have respect for the material and are not slaves to the running time like the previous version. With jaw-dropping special effects, a stunning cast, music that shakes the foundations and calls out to our ancestors as well as our descendants, and editing so intuitive taking us into the fractured mind of our hero attempting to put together their destiny, it is a movie that feels tied to the past and the future. Just like Frank Herbert, the filmmaker does not handhold the audience with every piece of exposition, either you are on board or you are lost at sea. Like a dream where some foreign object holds some familiarity, but you can not explain why, you simply understand the relationship to that item without it being explained to you. I feel the gravity of the material, waiting decades for capable hands to set it free onto the silver screen with technology advanced enough to bring these images to life. The hundreds of artists in all departments clinging to the filmmaker's singular vision and getting that vision across. I can feel the filmmaker's hands on the image after so many people have to help realize it.

The movie relies on all the elements of filmmaking to form a seamless masterpiece. It is a trumpeter up on a parapet belting out notes that strike a sonic cord to the ancestors within us, awakening parts hidden from the conscious world. Ironically, the movie transforms Frank Herbert's words into images and sequences that onto themselves defy language. My mind's eye absorbs the film and the response back: <truth.>"
"Aug 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dune is visually and audibly stunning. Sadly, the film relies on it's beauty to carry the sluggishly paced story through most of its long runtime. Examples include extended shots of Chalamet thinking(?) and equally extended shots of Zendaya in the desert with robes flowing in the wind similar to what we see in perfume commercials. The story does pick up and leave you wanting more by the end, but the majority of the runtime is unnecessarily hollow, although beautiful."
"Aug 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I've watched for years. Can't wait for Dune 2. The story line,  the graphics & the star wars kinda of theme is just out of this world"
"Aug 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I found it incredibly boring to watch my only compliments to this film  is the acting and  it was visually stunning
"Aug 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible visuals, acting, score, storytelling, and cinematography.  Stays true to Herbert's novel while bring its own unique elements."
"Aug 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A visual delight, absolute delight üòä"
"Aug 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fantastic Supporting cast, but Timmy sucks the life out of Paul's character. After all the hype, did it even recoup its production budget ?  I see ~ $108 million USA box office and that can't be half the cost. I'm a Villaneuve fan, but that doesn't excuse the substitution of top-notch FX for a clean storyline driven by acting. And long, boring verbal exposition kills this movie when it would have been better to let the audience fill in the blanks based on composition of a scene and the actor's use of facial expression, gestures, and body language - you know‚Ä¶what we call acting. I read the books, I know what will happen, so I'll save my money, skip part 2, and maybe wait for it to show up online somewhere a year later."
"Aug 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film doesn't seem to make much sense from start to finish, so much unexplained lore that makes the film hard to keep up with. Only redeeming factor is an good cast, but that was a waste due to the plot. Will definitely not be rushing to see the sequel !!"
"Aug 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a bit slow, but it's only the beginning. Sets a good stage. I wonder if this would have been better as a series instead of a movie."
"Aug 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"First time i tried to watch it i was probably not giving it the attention it deserved, i therefore rewatched it with my kids this evening since i heard dune 2 is around the corner. This time i was fulle focused and the movie pulled me in. It's a wonderful story both of personal growth and also a fascinating overarching world story. My kids was as invested as i was. Great movie."
"Aug 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"An ambitious effort to take on the sprawling work of the ""Dune"" novels, but Villeneuve here pulls it off in an exceptional manner. While not perfect, this slow-burn epic is lead by its beautiful art direction and is set up for what promises to be an intriguing part two."
"Aug 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Very solid film I like it
"Aug 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nice try, but the atmosphere of the 80's movie was way weirder and better. I will see the second part, but just because I need the end."
"Aug 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Follows the same path as the movie by David Lynch just with more dramatic yelling and way more advanced special effects which was the main reason why the original failed. And it's not necessarily bad. It is good enough adaptation but not worth 3-5 Oscar's for sure.
"Aug 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I usually struggle with slow burn, complex films. They certainly don't spoon feed you, but it is not focused on 10 different characters so it really works. The CGI and scenery is so tasteful. The acting is amazing. I  adore it. I love how you don't really understand why the dictator does what he does. Do we ever really understand why leaders do things? Also such a scary take on the world we live in. As a brit especially it is a tough watch. The only thing I did not like was there is no way Ferguson is old enough to be Chalamet's mum, but I quickly got over that. This is the longest review I have ever written and that tells you all you need to know about this insane film."
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, i'm so excited for the second partüî•"
"Aug 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, boring, boring. The movie is totally overrated. I forgot the plot the second I walked out of the cinema. It didn't deserve a single Oscar."
"Aug 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Can not hear half of it as sounds were over powering and it left my wife and myself totally lost in it.
Waste of time watching this!"
"Aug 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tudo nesse filme bom, a trilha sonora que te faz ficar apreensivo. A hist√≥ria excelente , e o final, com aquela vontade de assistir mais. Perfeito"
"Aug 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Superbly done. Beautiful cinematography. Costumes on point. I have few gripes with this film. Acting is on point. Zimmer is fantastic with his score, as usual. Little to no objectionable content. Would consider for young teens on up just for the scary images and violence. Highly recommend!"
"Aug 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Similar to star wars but a lot slower and no suspense.
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disappointing.  Not enough action.
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just the best sci-fi movie I have seen until today and I think I have seen at least everyone which is better known.
It has a production quality of the old days when movies were not made with a checklist for target audience but in mind of making a good movie."
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Besides the casting, there is nothing that I should like about Dune. Yet, for almost 3 hours I was watching it with full focus. Simply, this movie is just a good period."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Utter Garbage! David Lynch's DUNE was farrrrr better! By leaps and bounds!
Heck, even the Sci-Fi channel mini-series remake of this back in 2000 was better. It's sad to see younger generations get sucked in and deceived by flashy scenery and special effects, and then think it is quality cinema. IT'S NOT!!!"
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was expecting a little more from the main character, but I guess that's why there are 2 parts... Great movie nonetheless"
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"My thoughts are only positive and this is a magnificent movie. Denis Villeneuve is a great director and this just keeps him at the top. The cast is great to marvelous. Timoth√©e Chalamet and Jason Momoa are the best, but everybody else has also got a place on the great performance list."
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is one of the best and most unique films made recently.Fabulous cinematography, clever script and superb acting makes this film a near masterpiece. Looking forward to the sequel‚Ä¶"
"Aug 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie holds up well on a rewatch, but that might be because I could better grasp the names and characters this time around. This film has stunning cinematography and a sweeping musical score. I love that it takes its time to establish itself and the places and vehicles in this world feel real.
However that being said, I think Paul's visions could have been more visualised with different colour grading or something. I also think this film wraps up too late and goes on an act to far. It feels like it's wrapping up and the plot for the second film seems to have been establish and then it goes on for an extra twenty minutes. I can't really decide whether I really like this film or not because it feels like a really big set up for the second film. I guess I'll just have to wait and see."
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Gorgeous visuals and a profound plot with superb acting and music. What more could you ask for from such an epic work of art?
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic world-building narrative and a great cast.
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very hard to find a good film these days. I almost stopped watching films. After watching Dune, I feel I can fast forward watch 25 films to find a film as good as Dune."
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect! That's all I can say.
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Having just finished the book I don't think I've watched a movie so far from the source material. The major events happened but the characters and plots were so distorted I didn't find it enjoyable. The direction of the movie made all the characters one dimensional in an effort to focus on spectacle. Not my kind of film, I always prefer writing and direction over spectacle."
"Jul 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fantastic actors amazing sets.The story is interesting and epic but takes it's sweet time to get going. One of th√© better sci-fi movies you can find out there.
"Jul 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The thing about Denis Villeneuve movies is that they are original science fiction. People are misleaded and have very little knowledge about science fiction. Even though the story is adapted from a novel, the way he portrayed the dystopian world with the post-apocalyptic, fabril and biopunk elements was awesome. As a student of science fiction, the movie was very fascinating to me. We can observe the Biblical references throughout the movie. And do I even need to mention about Hans Zimmer?? Even after the movie is done, the music stays on your mind. It won't leave you. The screenplay was slow which is expected from the director. But whatever runs on screen seems so perfect. The music, the VFX, the acting and direction, everything seems so perfect. I am hyped up for the next part."
"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite films of all time. Excellent cinematography, sound design, special effects, soundtrack, and overall immersion!"
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Greatest Sci-Fi movie of the century. Might not be perfect, but the cinematography, music, sounds and ambition remain unmatched."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredibly good adaptation of a fantastic novel.  An extremely large film and it seems to get better with each viewing for me.
"Jul 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"great character writing, expertly woven exposition and great attention to detail in the world-building, as well as fantastic acting. just wish the sci fi tech was better explained and utilized as it makes most of the actions scenes a confusing mess (particularly notable with the shields which seem to have no internal consistency at all throughout the film)"
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The best adaption of the classic sci-fi novel.
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Accepting that the old-school original wasn't able to compete with Star Wars, this modern remake boringly failed to generate original ideas, yet again. Chalamet's small acting in his already hallow lead role couldn't match the enormously meandering plot. The cast, seemingly hired based off pop-culture trends, gave minimal effort so expectations for further chapters will be low until proven otherwise."
"Jul 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good movie. Visuals are crazy but the plot is meh
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fantastic. It had great action and high stakes. The cinematography and acting were excellent as well. It was a visual spectacle for sure. I am excited about Part Two.
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A phenomenal, visually stunning, borderline masterpiece; a complex, multi-layered story told in a brilliant, simple way. Excellent casting, creating several goose-bump moments building towards a portentous, momentous conclusion."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie! It has a really good story!
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually much better than the original. Story still the same so no surprises.
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A cinematic masterpiece, with only a minor problem spoiling its excellence: the characters and the writing and the plot. Other than that really good."
"Jul 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Switched it off after 30 minutes as it was boring and dull. Might come back to it after I've finished painting the skirting board.
"Jul 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic, larger-than-life portrayal of the immense novel by Frank Herbert! Denis Villeneuve very convincingly brings the source material to life. Cannot wait for Part 2!"
"Jul 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Looks great and promises so much . . Only for it now really to deliver in THIS film. In the end, it felt much more like an epic TV show than a film. The major point of interest was how much Star Wars ripped off. I'm amazed that nobody sued Lucas!"
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is great in all the ways a movie has to be to be good. Firstly, the easier part, the visuals. The visuals are great in this movie, that's how much one needs to hear. Despite the differences of how things look compared to the descriptions in the book are the changes well made to fit a bit more tasteful pallet with nice industrial and both futuristic designs that are more like the current depiction of what is futuristic. The execution of all this is as well great, everything feels like it could be reality and the designs feel like they have purpose, meaning that they make sense and are not there for no reason. 
The story and storytelling. The story is only a small part but already great. In this department, the changes were always good compared to the books and nothing seemed out of place. The storytelling is very good, everything tells a story. Conversations, actions and every detail, it is very well executed and nothing feels like it is there for no reason. The only thing is that it can get quite long but despite this, it all feels in place. The extra time gives suspense and the right feel for the world of Dune which is really about the mind and the mind finds a place in time and the vastness of the movie and like the book."
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an experience, I cant wait for the continuation, yet now the expectation is set where as before it was more a possibility full of potential. Well told story, amazing actin and the cinematography is breathtaking."
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A soulless, dry telling of an epic masterpiece of science fiction.  The director confuses volume for filmmaking and Paul Atreides is a dishrag waif posturing (badly) as a messianic leader. The art design looks like it came from a video game and almost no one in the cast seems to give a hoot."
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lost, yet couldn't stop watching. Was not ready for the Ending, left me wanting more."
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"fantastic movie üî•
with rich story telling, easy to understand (to me), new journey, new tool and gadget something that i can't see in other movie.
so excited for sequel cause the ending is very cliffhanger"
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an incredible adaptation of half of my favorite book ever, Dune. This movie has an incredible cast that all turn up amazing performances, along with one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. I read the book, and I can say that this movie fits its source material like a glove. A few things are changed, like Dr Liet Kynes being a girl, when she was a boy in the book, but I don't care about that change. The baron's personality was also changed for the better, making him ominous instead of a jokester. A few things are removed to shorten the film, but those things are boring and serve no purpose to the story. Denis Villeneuve did a great job with this film, and he was a perfect fit for the source material. The visuals are absolutely stunning and rival the Avatar films, it's one of the only movies in 2021 that I cared about. I am very excited for the second part and how villeneuve will adapt it"
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A terrific adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novel, featuring a stellar cast, strong (if sometimes slow) storytelling, and epic action sequences! Grade: A"
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enthralling and another fine , underplayed performance after The King by the young lead"
"Jul 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watched it on a long haul flight. I heard good things, but really, it was very bland. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't like it."
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Straight up amazing. I watch this movie multiple times a week. So good.
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you love Star Wars and Game of Thrones, you will love this movie! I was pleasantly surprised how hooked I was for the entire 2.5hrs. It's rich with visually stunning landscapes, captivating story lines, extraterrestrial wardrobes and effects, and profound characters that draw you in, emotionally and physically. I'm so excited for the sequel!"
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,The pacing of this movie was so weird. The scenes didn't feel like they made a coherent storyline. It was just confusing. It also didn't make me care about the characters.
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, despite the stunning visuals and interesting source material, I was bored throughout this movie. I'm not sure if it's because I'm frustrated that the ending led to nothing or if it's too lengthy, but I was not drawn in"
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie ever, if you ever saw the original you would know in an instant that this movie sucks so bad and isn't even close to the original....Horrible movie, worst director on earth...."
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"After falling asleep through the original, I was skeptical. This, however, was really well done. Storytelling was clear paced well for a 2.5 hour movie."
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little slow in the beginning, but overall a great film and watch. Amazing scenes and some great acting. This plot is incredibly interesting. I am very excited to see how part two wraps everything up. "
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,An incredible work from Villeneuve. He made the impossible to bring the story to the big screen.
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Under the skillful eye of dynamic partnership Villeneuve & Fraser, sweeping visuals and an astounding score make ""Dune"" the golden standard for all sci-fi epics for years to come."
"Jul 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,The lead actor was so feminine. Unwatchable
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally my favorite story of all time
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely stunning adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert's Dune. The visuals are spectacular as they always are in Denis Villeneuve's films, the character building is fantastic, and the dynamic of the story is spot-on to what the original novel intended. Cannot wait for Part Two. 5/5"
"Jul 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It seems that producers and directors keep struggling to present this tale - based on the voluminous novel written by Frank Herbert.
The novel relates a detailed story. It tells of a unique world. It's full of hardware, science, and fictional descriptions that allow a reader to create a vision of this fantastic world and its convulsions. It makes me want to get ahold of some ""spice"" to expand my mind.
But movies are graphic and do not need to verbally fill in details of all the minutia - they can show us these things as the story unfolds without drowning us in needless verbal discourse or useless demonstrations.
This version of Dune gets stuck in the details as did its predecessor. At the one hundred minute mark I find myself wanting to get to the climax but wondering if I ever will. 
It's not a flop. It's well acted and the cinematography and special effects are great, but I have to keep getting up for breaks so I can sit and enjoy a bit more without falling asleep. The musical score never overpowers but is an accent to the story.
All in all, it's watchable but it's a three and a half not an four or five."
"Jul 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Beautifully filmed but contains no emotional connections to the characters. The movie is entirely too long and there is nothing about the plot to grab you and make you pay attention. I watched until the end because I kept hoping it would get better or maybe I would start to care about any of the characters. (Spoiler- it doesn't and I didn't )
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, a director made a version of Dune close to the book.  Awesome effects, stellar script."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A sci-fi masterpiece period.
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Once you get past the slow start it is a really good movie! The special ware stunning!
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Characters are far more intense than the film explains why. Feels forced.
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,long film great sci fi its like an epic like lord of the rings im excited for part 2 can be slow at times but interesting sci fi plot and acting.
"Jul 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,My god it's bad it just drags on and nothing happens I feel asleep it was so boring.
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the visuals and the cast as well as the interesting characters!
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Great cinematography and story.
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best experiences that can exist on the IMAX screen. The soundtrack, the story, the characters... Everything fits together. It leaves you wanting to read the books and delve into the lore of the saga."
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"absolutely amazing, l loved every bit of this movie."
"Jun 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The star-studded and beautifully-lensed Dune led by the remarkable Villeneuve is somehow only occasionally engrossing. Despite the world-building and all, the somewhat talky and uninspired screenplay make this new Dune far too middling and vanilla."
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good soundtrack, from reading the book there is better spots to conclude"
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved absolutely every aspect of this movie - world, storytelling, visuals and music. Everything worked perfectly. Average Denis Villeneuve movie I'd say."
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic scale and action that does justice to the book.
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"When Dune came out I had no clue what it was but I knew I had to watch it, it looked like a mix of starwars and something dystopian. Finally I watched it at hotel and I kid you not this was hands down one of the BEST Sci-fi movies I've ever seen. I learned more about movies from this movie. The cinematography, writing, score, and the acting is all Great. Before I had no clue what dune was next thing I knew I was watching videos breaking down the lore and watching the original ""Dune (1984)"" (haha that rhymed) which I also liked and both of the mini series, It is Definitely something to watch if your looking for an awesome modern scifi movie. I'm definitely excited for part two and I can't wait to watch it."
"Jun 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the main shortcomings of ""Dune"" lies in its storytelling. The film suffers from pacing issues, particularly in the first half, where the narrative feels slow and drawn-out. The exposition-heavy dialogue, aimed at explaining the complex Dune universe, becomes overwhelming and tedious at times, failing to engage the audience fully."
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Light years better than the original.
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic. Easy to forgive it if all it's faults.
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Vast, stunning, exiting, mysterious, dark, this is the way Dune should have been.... it far surpasses previous versions... i can't wait for part 2."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dune was almost a masterpiece. Keyword being almost. To me it failed hugely because of one simple reason, Timothee Chalamet was nowhere near a good fit for the role. Throughout the movie his demeanor and portrayal of lead character Paul was painful to watch. He did not encapsulate the regality or composure of a man going through what Paul went through. Especially when accounting for the training and environment the character would have been raised in. The only point in the movie I found his acting passable was when he snapped at his mother following his fathers death. He plays an upset child fairly well but that was it. For a movie that should be placed in with other all time greats because of its visually stunning special effects and all star cast it falls flat. Very flat."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,9/10 - Very good start to a series; looking to see what comes next.
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Kynes doesn't sell it for me. The messiah is in her midst and she hesitates?  The actor is miscast and her direction shows it. Villeneuve was hampered by this woman.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie for its great story, its pacing, and the performances given by most of the cast. Ofc there are issues with some of the casting, especially for me personally the casting of Zendaya. She's not a particularly talented actress and her presence in Dune 2021 reeks of diversity hire and just another incident of her being thrust upon another white male lead. The Fremen also are a strange mix of Sub-Saharan African and Arab/Northern African, which is poorly thought-out especially considering the homogeneousness of all the other people groups in the movie. The casting of the Fremen feels unfaithful, as Frank Herbert clearly intended for them to be Arabic, demonstrated by his bastardising of Arabic words and religious naming of the group as ""Zensunni"", combining Sunni Islam and Herbert's own zen buddhist beliefs. The movie would have been 5 stars if not for the irritating blaxploitation that Hollywood apparently can't resist nowadays, but I'll give it 4 for everything else."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"BR: Filme exuberante, com uma ambienta√ß√£o linda e, digamos, quieta. Um filme onde sua aten√ß√£o √© prendida do inicio ao fim. Filmagem, roteiro, atua√ß√£o, entre outras coisas do longa, s√£o incr√≠veis e muito bem dirigidos. Ansioso para a parte dois!

EUA: Exuberant film, with a beautiful setting and, shall we say, quiet. A film where your attention is held from beginning to end. Filming, script, acting, among other things in the feature, are incredible and very well directed. Looking forward to part two!"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"While this movie differs with the book in certain important ways, it's hard to fault it for that when the product still manages to hew closely enough to the plot, all while telling a story with strong points and engaging characters.  The visuals are stunning (such as the ornithopters).  I think this is a rare win, and look forward to Dune 2."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Kann es kaum erwarten den zweiten Teil im Kino zu sehen dieses Jahr! Endlich eine episch- grandiose Adaption!
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was magnificent. Instantly one of me favorite soundtracks.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,How can you put so many of my favorite talented actors into a movie and the movie is just so blah and boring and pointless and puts me to sleep how is that even possible how do you do that like seriously what kind of drugs were you on when you made this movie but the one good thing is I can put it on and it'll put me to sleep when i have insomnia so u get 1 star r that.
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente filme. Lembra muito Star Wars, s√≥ que √© bem melhor."
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The visuals were stunning and musical scores were amazing.  The biggest flaw in Dune is trying to tell such a complex story, with so many elements to it, that it gets choppy."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great reboot Galaxy of Dune. Nice design outfits and combat style to make this version unique. Can't wait to watch ""Part 2"" with Framem tribe."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is an amazing movie. It feels really grand. The sound design and the visuals are on point. My only problem is the casting - I understand that Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya are great actors and they do a good job acting here, but I can't help but see only Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya and not the actual characters on screen."
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This may be the best movie ever made
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is a masterclass on how to make a serious sci-fi film in an age where sci-fi is being destroyed by commercialism. It's well directed, well shot, well acted, well written, and well edited. Every inch of it has been expertly molded for a beautiful, adventurous cinematic experience. The story is amazing and keeps you entertained the entire time. The characters draw you in and make you connect with them. You will be visually stimulated the entire time by the beautiful landscapes and detail of this universe. I can't say enough about this fantastic film. 

In summary, everyone needs to see... to experience this movie. We need more epic sci-fi films like this in the world."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I want to like this movie. It's probably better than 2.5 stars, but I can't tell, because it's too dark to see, and most of the dialogue is too soft to understand."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Timoth√©e Chalamet is the only good thing in this movie. It is too long, tedious, nothing is really remarkable. It's nothing compared to other movies like Lord of the Rings."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The best sci-fi movie ever made. Can't wait for part two and further sequels from this director who's killing it in Hollywood now. 10/10
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic adaptation of the book. If they remain this faithful through the rest of the trilogy, this will be on the level of Lord of the Rings."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Yet another Hollywood rehash splitting the movie in 3 to make more money
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,As the movie ended I felt like I needed to watch everything again and absorb more details from it. The pacing is a bit slow but it's necessary to set the mood . There's a few flaws but you can point it back to the source material. I can't wait for the sequel
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was epic. I dont remember feeling like this since...... my early child hood 30 years ago. Ive found out the next instalment is on November 3rd. I loved guardians of the galaxy, but this might just be my best film. If it was a toss up between which I could see now and which I could never see, id choose this. I work in construction and this played the rounds some months ago. never really paid attention. Jesus did i miss out. The trailer didnt do it justice. I see 1 and 2 stars out there... are you guys mad? I couldnt find a fault with it. It was great to see some old faces (especially Drax from guardians of the galaxy, and our favourite fish guy Jason momoa... might have butchered that name but im dyslexic, give me a break.) yeah na, I will def keep my self alive on the building sites just to see part 2 (also for the wife and kid yada yada yada),"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Villeneuve's movies, I love Zimmer's scores. I have the physical copies to prove it. But this movie just really wasn't for me. Boring, uninteresting drab with the same screeching female vocals every time there's sand or Zendaya on screen. Flat performances. Stop putting Timothy Chateaubriand in everything, please. Gonna pass on Part Two."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! A non-Hollywoodized epic for the ages. A great work and instant classic in the likes of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Blade Runner and Harry Potter. I hope part two will continue with the same mastery all around, from the acting to the direction, production and cinematography."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"[I've never read the book!]
It is beautifully shot, the music is wonderful, the acting is well done (by most). However I feel like it's in the era of ""The 1st movie is only setup"" as it's a bit slow, and nothing much happens."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best film adaption so far. Can't wait for part 2
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Shockingly good.   Nowhere near the camp of the original movie but with amazing effects and solid acting.  Needs more Patrick Stewart tho.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cannot wait to read what is known as the greatest science fiction novel in history, but the movie's first part did not ""Wow"" me past the historical significance of the story."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, slow burn pacing that is true to the source material. One of the best Sci Fi movies in decades"
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think they kind of Clickbait you with Zendaya. It's like movie click bait she's only in it for like 3 minutes. Probably more. I don't know besides that this movie was really good. It kind of felt like a grand story with lots of opportunities and a grand world to adventure and I like that it takes itself very seriously and slow, and it works. I liked most of the characters the set pieces I've grown to like more and the costume design is incredible. Still, there is a couple shots that feel a little empty in some ways, but this is a pretty great movie. I'm excited for the sequel 7/10"
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Dune (2021)"" has excellent world building and visual effects but still fails to pick up the pace."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Painfully slow. Very little at all happens in the first half of the movie, not a great deal more happens in the climax of the movie, and then suddenly it is over without the slightest hint of resolution or even a compelling cliff hanger for the sequel. Had both this movie and its sequel been combined into a 2 hour movie it would have been tolerable, but instead we get half a movie stretched to over 2 and a half hours and which feels much longer."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie as much as the book. A very well-done movie with amazing effects and great actors. The visuals and the score are beautiful.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve ands hans zimmer, if you know those names and their work you wont be disappointed"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nice vistas, some good actors, but skinny 12-year old Timoth√©e Chalamet just fails at his role. Unconvincing and bland he can't hold a candle to Dune 2000's Alec Newman who *owned* Paul Atreides."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dune for the undemanding...
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well, watched it on Amazon Prime for free yesterday, and i'm glad i didn't waste any actual money on it. The intro of this movie feels weird and it was handled much better in Dune from 1984. There were more then enough scenes in the new movie that made no sense and could have been cut without second thought, it feels they were added to inflate the run time and justify the ""second part"". And the ending is as weird as the intro. Overall a movie you can watch once when it becomes available for free on any streaming service and be done with it. Going by the trailers, i'd say the same goes for the ""second part""."

"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Slow, confusing and overhyped."
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Dune is one of the most breathtaking visual pieces of art that I have ever seen. Every moment was well designed and created a universe of wonder. Not only was the setting gorgeous, but the acting was articulate as well. Timothee Chalamet captured the role of Paul wonderfully and has quickly become an actor to watch in the industry.

My main difficulty with Dune was the sheer amount of information to digest. From Arrakis to Harkonnen to the Bene Gesserit, there were more than a few moments that I had to take a step back and ask myself what in the world the characters were talking about. With a excess of whispering intermingled with other languages, the plot at times became disjointed. That being said, I loved the different forms of communication between Paul and his mother.

The best comparison for this film is the Fellowship of the Ring. Full of deep backstory, an abundance of detail and more than a few dull moments, FotR became a masterpiece because of what followed in Two Towers and Return of the King. I see the same thing happening with this film. Assuming the sequels are made, Dune could be remembered as a marvelous feat in exposition. However, if those films are never green lit, this film will be difficult to rewatch as in itself it is incomplete. 

I left the film hopeful for a sequel and satisfied with the experience. I just had to read Dune's Wikipedia page to understand the full story that I just watched. (At least I could remember the greatest name in modern cinema: Duncan Idaho)"
"May 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally Dune on the screen like it is suppose to be...ok they are some slight deviation from the book but you can really feel that mr Villeneuve loves the book and love the story...and the visuals are amazing...
"May 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie stirred emotions in me I never felt before. The CGI in this show is phenomenal, allowing me to suspend disbelief for the whole show. it is also expertly acted, and the soundtrack is amazing. This is the first movie ever where I immediately restarted it and watched it again... and then again. #1 favorite movie of all time."
"May 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Could it be better? Probably not, what an amazing visual experience with epic story telling. Cant wait for part 2."
"May 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Really faithful to source material and stunning visuals. Can't wait for the sequel!
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I literally love EVERYTHING about this movie, the pacing, soundtracks, casting, acting, dialogue ahh just everything was perfect. Anyone who says that it was too slow-paced just doesn't appreciate good film making."
"May 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,It sucks looooooooooooooool üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ wow they really suck bro zendaya donate kiss timmyhe she loves Tom Holland this movie sucks boooooooooooooooooooooooo
"May 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,So much better than the original version. I am looking forward to seeing part 2
"May 12, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD. SO SO GOOD.
"May 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dreadful long boring movie. Shot in the dark for the most part, it relies on loads of FX to mask the rubbish dialogue and plot. Had more fun watching paint dry."
"May 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I weasel mesmerised through the entire show! The visuals were stunning,  the characters were deep and the overall tone just drew me in! It played close enough to the original story to do it justice but built a new world and level of enormity that was fantastic! I can't wait for the sequels,"
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven't read the book this was based on, but my brother has and I found his insights helpful -- not absolutely necessary to enjoy the film, but definitely helpful. 
The first time I watched Dune, the storyline kept building up to a moment and it seemed like after that moment the meatier part of the story would start, so I kept waiting and waiting. Right when I felt like the storyline was starting to pick up and the foreshadowed events are unfolding, the movie ends. It didn't feel like a complete cliffhanger, but definitely a 'there's more yet to come' moment and at least part of what has yet to come has already been alluded to. I hate cliffhangers, so I wasn't sure how I felt about it, but oddly I found myself drawn to rewatch the movie and I'm so glad I did! I found it way more nuanced the second time and I find myself going back to it again and again. I'm not someone who normally re-watches movies, but with this one I appreciate the story a little bit more each time. Thankfully there's a sequel already in progress, so if you absolutely have to know how everything unfolds next, we won't have to wait much longer."
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen in years.
"May 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this was a slow movie that failed to interest me.
Timoth√©e Chalamet is an overrated actor and the only reason that this movie was even remotely popular is because of the endless wave of fangirls fawning over him. the characters were so in depth that my favourite character was the worm who still had more emotional complexity the every other character in this film."
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! I can't wait for the next one. (However, I can see how this might be hard for someone who knows nothing about this universe.)"
"May 6, 2023",POSITIVE,epic cant wait for part 2
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, Denis Villeneuve created such a beautiful movie. Incredible cinematography and a great storytelling"
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The visuals were fantastic, and Timoth√©e Chalamet was surprisingly excellent.  I didn't expect him to be a good fit, but it turns out he was perfect. They should have shown more scenes with the navigator guild and explained the background better, which is the only reason I didn't give five stars.  Rare is the move I see twice, but that's what I did with Dune."
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"High level fantasy sci-fi story telling, this is as good as its gets!  basically a perfect movie.  Acting, writing, directing, cinematography, costumes, all top notch.  Then the Hans Zimmer score, brilliant!  you can be disappointed in the ending, but its a true two parter.  It would have needed to be 6 hours long to tell the entire story in one movie, or it would have felt cheap and not true to the book."
"May 4, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies i have ever seen in my life!
"May 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It's one of the best film with best sound
"May 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Because I haven‚Äôt read the books I was very lost but I liked it and look forward to the sequel 
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The problem with this movie is the sales! Let me explain: I understand Hollywood wants to sell as many movies as possible but this stifles creativity and innovation. The problem with Dune is they've chopped the nuts off it to make it a 12 to sell more seats! The movie/ book is supposed to be deeply violent and dark. By making it a 12 you just aren't going to get the brutality. Strangely the movie in my opinion is actually too grim for 12 year olds. So congrats you've made a movie suitable for no one! Everyone will say bla bla bla visually stunning, but at the end of the day this movie is forgettable because it's not visceral enough. The original is actually more memorable and there were lots of problems making it."
"May 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Sublimemente espectacular
"May 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall the movie was an absolute masterpiece of cinema From the visuals to the world building to the characters Absolute masterpiece
"May 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,It a good adaptation of the first half of the book
"May 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune I firmly believe will be the next generations Star Wars. It's new, it's original and has the potential to world build fantastically. I left the theatre purchasing a second ticket to come and watch it again later that week. I can't wait for the next one."
"May 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like Timothee Chalamet but the movie is pretty slow-moving. It was a long movie.
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune, that was a good one."
"Apr 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I saw this movie in a massive cinema and it was incredible and the cinematic was beautiful
"Apr 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, but not a bit too long for me."
"Apr 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"With its amazing visuals, epic action sequences, a wonderful cast of characters with some standouts, and the faithfulness to (the first half of) Frank Herbert's novel, I think we can conclusively say that Dune finally has the blockbuster adaptation it deserves."
"Apr 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very slow, bad story telling, and a little boring. If your not familiar with the source material it's difficult to follow along."
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely love this movie. The visuals are stunning. You can absolutely see the hard work behind the scenes. The storyline was due to his huge range in topics and events difficult to understand and to follow. To clear things up, I personally recommend reading the books. They give you a lot of background information about the events that are not fully explained or not showed detailed enough in the film. Nevertheless, it‚Äòs interesting and has a lot of aspects, which are not fully linked to each other, making you curious what will happen next. The actors played the roles really well. 

I would definitely recommend watching the movie and it‚Äò s a must-see for all science fiction lovers (including me). I am giving the well deserved 4.5 out of 5 stars. Well done! :D"
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Dune is  OG and Goat thank you for taking time to bring this to life.
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,≈öwietny film i wspania≈Ça ekranizacja ksiƒÖ≈ºki
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"3.5 stars:   Dune is a classic science fiction story told in an almost biblical fashion. It is the story of warring kingdoms, and the hope of the coming Chosen One. There were some great special effects to represent a different type of technology.

The biggest problem the film had was that it just took too long to tell the story 
(two and a half hours). On top of that the plot itself was very slow moving in order to remain true to the story. There are many complicated characters to feature. I actually watched the film in two. hour and 15 minute sittings.  That seemed to help me maintain focus.-"
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very slow and tedious watch. It seemed like they were trying to see how many long desert pans they could fit into a single movie. The characters don't have much emotion in their acting, so it's hard to feel invested when not even the characters seem that invested in their own story. 
Also, the sound mixing has major issues. It's very difficult to hear what the characters are saying with them mumbling in monotone all the time.
At least the plot is somewhat interesting, but it's difficult to follow and moves at a snail's pace. It's hard to follow at times and gives off the same feeling as if you're walking in on the eighth episode of a TV show with no prior knowledge. It's probably most enjoyable to the people who have been long time fans of the original Dune (which I prefer)."
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is probably the best movie adaption we will ever get of one of the best and most influential Sci-Fi books every written DUNE.
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Denis Villeneuve made a masterpiece! His Dune is AMAZING! I cannot wait to see Dune Part Two.
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Timothee Chalamet's = Kendall Jenner's modeling
"Apr 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An emotionless walkthrough of the original, no passion, no anything."
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Looking forward to the next one üëå
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Audiovisual masterpiece, but without a sequel (for now) feels not that strong as a standalone movie."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A franchise that I was to lazy to get in to, but was blown away after the movie. Probably my favorite movie of all time. Great acting, engaging story, espetacular visual effect, Sound, photography, just perfect. A true masterpiece, really anxious for the second one."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Dune book could be separated into a trilogy or a tv series. It is a blend of Game of Thrones scheming and science fiction. Due to its complexity and the deeply defined world, it is a huge accomplishment for such a book to be transferred to the big screen so well. I would compare the Dune movie to one of the Lord of The Rings movies in terms of source material to big screen translation. However, unlike Lord of the Rings movies, it is not immediately apparent what the story and world are all about to the viewer. This is also due to Lord Of the Rings having a fairly simple story in comparison where all the quest is already determined whereas Dune has the characters slowly discover and realise their own ambitions. Overall, a job well done to the entire crew."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"No conoc√≠a ""Dune"" y me ha maravillado la est√©tica de la pel√≠cula, la m√∫sica, la historia. ¬°Ya quiero ver la secuela!"
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune absolutely excels at world building. Right from the start, its clear how intricately crafted the world is, which gets you immediately hooked into the story. While the plot moves along slowly, I think this is a positive, as it gives more time to flesh out the details of the world, making for a much more immersive experience. This is perfectly complemented by incredible music, which always captures the perfect emotion for the scene its in, and absolutely stunning visuals which make the time spent on showing them well worth it. The plot itself is very compelling, with the power dynamics between the great houses and the emperor being very much like Game of Thrones. From the start, Dune does a great job at portraying Paul as a worthy hero who generally wants to do the right thing and isn't selfish or vain. When the credits finally roll, Dune has completely accomplished its goal of getting the viewer hooked on the world and excited for the next installment, which I certainly am incredibly excited about!"
"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"can‚Äòt really give a strong opinion as it is the first part of (hopefully) many, but from what i saw it was great"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic! This film made me believe that these different planets and cultures actually existed. A film to be seen at the cinema. Acting was almost universally great. Storyline held my interest throughout. Only downside was that I thought it didn't end on a high...I guess that it is part one after all!
"Apr 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was completely overrated when released. I didn't understand barely any of it. It was like you're supposed to know more before watching it but there's no prequel, just a bunch of adaptations. I wouldn't watch this movie again or recommend it. Very boring and underwhelming."
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I was so disappointed the sequel isn't coming out until Fall 2023. It's absolutely engrossing."
"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I rewatched the movie and needed the urge to write that this movie must be seen by every human eye.
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has some of the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie, and as a fan of the book, it was a phenomenal adaptation of the concepts and characters in the book."
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good adaptation, though I need to admit that I prefered the version from 1984."
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The visuals are fantastic, the world building is definitely top-tier, and the cast does wonderful work, but as for actual plot, the movie follows a basic formula that makes it nothing special. 

Usually, I personally forgive movie's lack of plot depth if they are at least very entertaining, but Dune will often leave you locked into scenes that will lose your attention and make you snap back thinking, ""What's going on again?"""
"Apr 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Ich finde der Film ist au√üergew√∂hnlich gut. Die Ma√üst√§be sind gro√üartig und der ist Film ist in jeder Hinsicht perfekt!
"Apr 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had been anticipating Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune for quite some time, but after seeing it, it mainly went to show me that when stripped of Herbert's wordy prose, Dune as a story is fairly formulaic and unsurprising.

I'm glad the movie didn't stray far from the source material, but like Lynch's film before it this new Dune movie also fails to understand the real protagonist should be the planet itself, and ended up feeling mostly like a shoddily connected highlight reel, missing all of the emotion from the books, rather than a true rendition of what I read in those pages all this time ago. 

The dull lighting direction and muted colors certainly didn't help either. On the other hand, the costume design is great, and there are some beautiful shots in there. It also takes its time to remind us that yes, under this soulless exterior is still a Villeneuve film."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the ""Dune"" fans of the novel have been waiting for for 50 years. No actors thrown in that don't fit the parts, no ""weirding modules"" thrown in because the director just had to have ray guns, no poetry, no heart plugs...just tell the story that's on the page and represent it well! While the Fremen weren't explicitly portrayed in the novel as dark-skinned, it makes perfect sense that generations of living in a harsh desert environment would make them so. The only issue I had was the unnecessary gender-bend of ""Dr. Kynes"". It wasn't a huge deal, and I couldn't fault the acting, but one of things that brought Paul and Chani together was the shared loss of their ""fathers"". Having Chani lose her ""mother"" & ""parent"" at that point of her life doesn't carry the same impact, but again it isn't that much of a gripe. I can't wait for Part II!"
"Mar 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This one of my favorite. Can't wait to see the second part.
"Mar 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fan of the book. The movie is well made and holds its own.
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Favorite of all time. Please film through Leto's reign at least.
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie.  The cast, especially Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac are excellent and perfect for their roles.  The only one who didn't feel exactly right was Javier Bardem as Stilgar.  The movie is faithful to the books and does an excellent job of capturing their tone.  In some ways, it's even better than the books which is a very rare feat.  My only complaint, which is the same complaint I have with the books, is that it's too long.  I watched 150 minutes and it was really only the beginning of the story.  Watch it.  I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very beautiful and insightful attempt at a story that is nearly impossible to tell. It does the book justice and bring a beautiful perspective to it. The sound in the film brings so much to the experience, The cinematography was very well done. Its very difficult to judge if the film works for people that have not read the book because i have a few times. For a person familiar with the books, the fill stands up well. I'm very impressed."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie with great story, brilliant characters and amazing world. Didnt read the books and now i probably will. Really interesting stuff!"
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a rare thing to find a silver screen adaption that is truly faithful to the source material, masterfully shot AND well acted. Dune was ahead of its time when it was written -- it is a massive, complex sci-fi tale that spans time and space -- those without an open mind and willingness to think critically need not bother. I am grateful to this crew for bringing it to life in such a big, beautiful way. I honestly cannot wait for part 2. I have a feeling the best is still to come."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent Si-Fi world building and performances! Denis Villeneuve does it again!
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very different from the trailer. But also good? Bill xx
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is by far one of the hardest movies that I have rated simply for the fact that it's a blatant and bold ""love/hate"" feel.
This would in my opinion, be one of the best, if not the best film release, visually and otherwise.  However,  the book/movie being split in two was NOT a good idea and reeks of only motivated by the greed of 2 premiers which Hollywood has been doing A LOT in recent years! Milking an already tapped out public out of hard earned money to spread out the movie over a 3 year period and build up anticipation for the second part these days is cruel and unusual.  The audience is well used to 2.5-3hr and even 4 hr movies nowadays and most of use binge watch out series shows. That only leaves a very money hungry studio as the culprit for this flop of film release frenzy. ADVICE: Take a clue from streaming services who release entire seasons out at once. You earn much deeper loyalty. Other than that I absolutely loved this movie. They could have ended in a better place though."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie made in 21 centcury.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aunque no es tan bizarra y surreal como la primera adaptaci√≥n de David Lynch, esta adaptaci√≥n es m√°s comprensible y se toma su tiempo para contar la trama de una manera en que el espectador pueda entenderla mejor, aunque puede llegar a aburrir a algunos. Los efectos visuales y la calidad visual son sin duda mejores que la versi√≥n de David Lynch. Adem√°s, tiene buenos planos y un guion m√°s s√≥lido e inteligente. Una buena pel√≠cula que le dio a la obra de Frank Herbert otra oportunidad para brillar en la gran pantalla. Mi calificaci√≥n para esta pel√≠cula es un 8/10."
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had high hopes but was disappointed that there  wasn't enough action and too many flashbacks in dreams.
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,slurping and chewing with their mouth open.  The noise drives me crazy I did not finish the movie.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just wish the movie went on for longer and more details were gone into.. and that the Harkonnens were more ""evil"" and ""grotesque"" as per the earlier version.
That said however, this version is superior to the earlier make in almost every way however, and does the book justice.. I actually found the film better than the book as the book tended to be quite longwinded in parts.
I was glad I saw this at the cinema for first viewing, as it truly enhanced it's epic scale.
Loved the throat singer of the Saudarker battle preparation, and many other aspects of Herbert's world were executed with a fascinating, strangeness, almost horror befitting of the tale.
Just snuck in for 4.5 stars. The strongest part of the film was it stayed true to the book... a real relief, and a credit to the writers and director. It could have been really awful otherwise.
Look forward to the next instalment."
"Mar 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,So long and very boring plot. The movie produer assumed we had all the time in the world to watch this sh*t!
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,60 minutes of mind-numbingly dull and pretentious exposition followed by a 90 minute soundtrack of relentless semitones so loud you won't be able to hear for days afterwards‚Ä¶ occasionally interrupted by a few words of melodramatic nonsense. Absolutely horrible movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Very Unique Classic Sci-Fi Epic Film. This is designed to tell a Epic Story while also setting up the next film which can be a dangerous risk that fails much more often than it succeeds. However this remembers to stay focused and tell its own story first. Acting is great across the board with very good performances but the standout is Timothee Chalamet who slowly won me over particularly in the second half as a compelling hero as we watch him begin to develop. The cinematography is the best element of this which is phenomenal with great depth and scale to each shot that never feels lifeless despite the dull color palate. (A remarkable achievement) The special effects are very well done also with very clean CGI and practical. The music is very good always feeling epic and mysterious but also never feels catchy and can be overused and does start to beat you over the head sometimes with ""Just to remind you again 2+ hours in this is supposed to feel epic"". The editing is very well done also despite being a bit loaded in the first half setting up the journey.  The only issue is the pacing which isn't bad at all. This is a film that justifies its length by being a epic story with epic shots to take in. However it does take a while to set that up because there is so much it is trying to get in in the first half. I think some of it could've been trimmed perhaps or better explained in a less slow and spread out way. (Something like Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring's first 10 minutes does) However despite the pacing not being up to snuff with everything else and fitting a lot in slowly this is a unique epic that anyone who is a fan of epics, the source material, the director, or any actors in this should give a watch. FYI it does help to be familiar with the source material going into this as it kind of assumes you know it somewhat."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is made for people who read the book. I did not read the book and it was confusing, boring and l have no desire to watch I it again or see the sequel. 
Compare to Lord of the Rings which most people I know didn't read the books and loved it from beginning to end."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not a full 5 star just because I got really disappointed they took a book and chopped it right in the middle.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"finally a perfect adaptation from the book!
Can't wait for the sequel"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Channeling the book into film is challenging, but the writers and director did an amazing job. The important beats were hit, the visuals were breath taking, and the casting was on point. Interested in seeing how they deal with the second half of the source."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I must admit, I still believe ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" to be unfilmable. I realized that, watching Dune: Part One in my local movie theater today. That's why people who have read the book should see this movie adaptation as a single piece of art.

Forget the book while watching this movie. Dune, the book drives on the thoughts and inner emotions of the characters - the things that are left unsaid. Visually, that can only be adapted to a certain extent.

Villeneuve has done a better job than anyone could ask for. I think he had to compromise on not bringing even more details to the movie, considering that the majority of the people will not have read the book. The information overload would have been difficult to follow for most.

This movie is definitely slow, so if you are accustomed to constant dopamine stimulation then you might find it boring.

The visuals in combination with the sound/music are hauntingly beautiful and will stick in your mind for a long time. I got goosebumps almost throughout the entire movie.

Dune: Part One definitely serves as a stepping stone for Dune: Part Two, and more to come... If you are looking for action, Dune: Part Two is definitely the movie to be waiting for. So grab some friends and go watch this movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually spectacular. It's been a long time since I read the book so I can't speak to how faithfully it reproduced the source material, but it felt genuine. I can't wait for part 2!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Writing was horrible.  Theme was completely nonexistent.  Zero character development.  Most of the actors seemed about as emotionally invested as one might expect if they were reading the ingredients on a bottle of shampoo.  Everyone involved should seriously rethink their career decisions after being involved with this patchwork collection of cutting room floor mistakes.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Sooo much boring fighting scenes that I had to skip to not be bored to death entirely  - they honestly seemed like fillers meant to drag the movie longer. That also meant there was sadly not much dialogue... Visuals were good but not a movie I would watch again
"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't get it. Drawn out. Too many stories lines and plots. Unless you read the book it's just hard to pull for the characters or care. BIg production yes but was bored to death.
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Movie Suffers With The Script Of Already Unadaptable Books, It Has  Wonderful Visuals And Sound Design but Those Don't Make a Movie Good Enough To Remember"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Denis Villenueve brings viewers a star-studded sci-fi blockbuster that brings Frank Herbert's 1965 novel to the big screen. Villenueve adds to his recent string of sci-fi epics, following on from the 2016 Amy Adams-starring ‚ÄòArrival', and the Oscar-winning ‚ÄòBlade Runner 2049'. The acclaimed director works alongside ‚ÄòDoctor Strange' writer Jon Spaihts and ‚ÄòA Star Is Born' writer Eric Roth to bring the best-selling novel to the screen.

Timoth√©e Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides (played in the film by Oscar Isaac) and main protagonist of the film. Paul is a man born into an unspeakable destiny who must travel to a new planet to ensure the future of his family and his people. But with conflict over the planet's most precious resource, only those who are strong enough will survive. Chalamet stars alongside a packed cast that includes Rebecca Fergurson, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac and Javier Bardem. ‚ÄòDune' features solid performances throughout its entire cast, but it's doubtful any will be receiving recognition considering they're up against knockout performances from the likes of Jamie Dornan, Benedict Cumberbatch, Will Smith and Caitr√≠ona Balfe.

Despite being an explosive, big-budget sci-fi epic ‚ÄòDune' still manages to convey emotion through it's more intricate scenes. Renowned composer Hans Zimmer crafts an incredible score for the film, Zimmer creates a score that keeps in mind the book's Middle Eastern and Islamic influences. ‚ÄòDune' features breath-taking cinematography courtesy of ‚ÄòLion' cinematographer Greig Fraser. Fraser's cinematography brilliant captures the extensive, explosive action sequences and the close-up, emotional scenes brilliantly. Even though the scale of ‚ÄòDune' led to the first book having to be adapted into two films, Villenueve manages to make this film not feel too overstuffed or confusing to viewers who aren't familiar with the original novel. Previous Villenueve collaborator, David Dastmalchian, makes an appearance in the film, adding to his already successful year that includes performances in James Gunn's ‚ÄòThe Suicide Squad' and the animated Marvel Disney+ show ‚ÄòWhat If?'.

Much like the original book, ‚ÄòDune' delves into many themes including power, fate, and free will. As shown in various conversations through the film, but also through the fact that the Bene Gesserit (a social, religious and political force comprised of women with mysterious powers) has the ability to control those around them with something known as ‚ÄòThe Voice' - an audio-neuro control mechanism that forces others to do things against their will. The film explores themes like family, and finding, and taking, your place in the world around you.

Costume designer Bob Morgan provides ‚ÄòDune' with intricately detailed costumes that keep in mind the film's cultural influences and show a mix between the film's medieval/sci-fi nature. This mix, and also the contrast between the futuristic outfits with the more old-fashioned ones, helps to emphasise and show that in this future, modern technology like phones and computers no longer exists. Denis Villenueve manages to convey the size and scale of ‚ÄòDune' to viewers in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or full-on. Instead, the French director eases viewers into this new, futuristic world.

‚ÄòDune' is an intense, dramatic sci-fi affair that features solid performances from its entire cast. The film doesn't inundate viewers with an encyclopaedia of knowledge to take in all at once, much like how David Lynch's 1984 adaptation required viewers to be given a handout explaining various aspects of the film before screenings. Denis Villenueve gives audiences an exciting and visually pleasing blockbuster whose visual aspects make the film a unique, yet enjoyable, viewing experience."
"Feb 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Featuring unparalleled size and scope, Denis Villeneuve's Dune provides a cinematic experience while forgetting to deliver a complete story. To say the vision of Dune is grand would be an understatement. It's a visual feast combining elements of the Middle Ages with those of the future for a feeling that closely resembles HBO's Raised by Wolves. It's this marriage of genres that sticks out foremost in the opening minutes of the film. A noble house, House Atreides, has been assigned to guard and oversee a planet by the name of Arrakis, desert and useless but for its supply of spice m√©lange- the most valuable material in the known universe. This spice m√©lange, or ""spice"" as it's simply referred to, is a naturally occurring psychoactive chemical makes human beings stronger, faster, and smarter. Most of all though the spice is necessary for interstellar travel as it allows the navigator to properly guide ships through warp space. With a resource that valuable one could imagine that not everyone in the universe was happy to see Arrakis being taken by House Atreides. The Harkonnens, Arrakis' outgoing caretakers, are less pleased to be losing their financial boon and, though they honored the emperor's decree, seem eager to do something about it. In the middle of all this are the people of Arrakis, the Fremen, who live on the desert planet and who have been forever altered by their constant proximity to the spice. The Fremen have impossibly bright and blue eyes from their exposure and their ability to fight has been drastically increased for the same reason making them both alluring and frightening simultaneously. Arrakis itself, affectionately referred to as Dune, is a magnificent wasteland and home to giant sandworms capable of swallowing settlements whole. These worms use a sort of echolocation to hunt, homing in on vibrations that they can feel from the surface. The biggest of these creatures is referred to as Shai-Hulud and it is worshipped as a sort of God by the Fremen, who have adapted to living with these giant beasts. As you can see there is a lot of narrative being weaved into this cinematic experience, so much so that it would be easy to miss some of the above details in the film's first 30 minutes of mostly exposition. Once the places are set the story begins to lurch forward with House Atreides trying to protect the Fremen, the spice, and Arrakis from the Harkonnens and, by extension, the empire. Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) is the young heir to House Atreides, though he is reluctant at the film's start. His father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), makes it clear that he is not some despotic ruler, and that Paul doesn't need to take the helm if he so chooses. Leto's demeanor is stark in contrast to his rival house and represents what is presented as a forward-thinking, perhaps even progressive leader. Paul's mother, Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), is the official concubine of Duke Leto Atreides and deeply interesting in her own right. Lady Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, an order of women hellbent on advancing humanity through genetic experimentation and religious engineering via their chosen one, known as the Kwisatz Haderach. This order also possesses several superhuman abilities like complete metabolic control, superior combat abilities, and The Voice. The Voice is simply a tone or frequency perfected by the Bene Gesserit that they use to compel others to do things, almost like a Jedi mind trick. With parents like these it's no surprise that Paul is special too. Even before reaching Arrakis Paul starts dreaming of a Fremen girl (Zendaya) who we later come to know as Chani. It's clear as soon as Paul steps off the ship that his fate is uniquely tied to that of the Fremen people as they refer to him as ""Lisan al Gaib"", which translates to ""tongue of the unseen realms"" and refers to the one who will bring water to Arrakis' desert world. There is so much narrative to follow that it might be easy to miss out on the unparalleled backdrops that make up Arrakis. For a desert world it's awfully pretty. Action scenes are a delight for much the same reason usually taking place against the backdrop of some sand dunes and an endless sky. There is one bone to be picked like a Fremen sword from a sandworm's maw and that's the personal shield devices. Having never read Frank Herbert's series this reviewer cannot say how true-to-form these shield devices are or how important their utility becomes, but from the onscreen presence all the shielding seems to do is make one-on-one fight scenes difficult to watch with the shield's constant blurring. They also seem to be an uninspiring device because they never seem to impede much damage. It's a minor nit to pick, in general, and there's reason to believe that as the series progresses it might settle better but in Part One it seemed gimmicky and unnecessary. Overall Dune's narrative sum is hefty, and Villeneuve's chosen path makes sense, but ultimately it leans so heavily on the inevitability of sequels that by the film's end it's easy to feel as if the story is just beginning. And it is, but there is an unsatisfying hunger that the viewer is left with, knowing full well that another entry is years away. It's the sort of conclusion that would have made most people stand and cheer if another episode was due to air next week. Alas Dune Part One is an epic table setting that certainly excites with the prospect of more dense sci-fi action to come, but after a nearly 3-hour runtime there's a stark difference between wanting more and deserving more."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Among my very favorite recent movies.
"Feb 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mediocre. 

Very cheesy, bombastic flick that is artistically inferior to even the theatrical Lynch adaptation, that still stands as a baroque sci-fi masterpiece despite all its editing and production issues. 

After an underwhelming intro that spoils everything about the Fremen from the start, we're treated to a rather generic Marvel-esque production quality with a mostly annoying soundtrack that taps into your typical Millenial wannabe tribal chants and drums (YAWN), and with far too many Zhendaya Visions. How about Paul's visions about him ""waking up"", becoming a god, and leading the Fremen to liberation? 

This movie is longer than the 1984 adaptation yet tells so much less! No Padishah Emperor here, no Guild Navigators in sight,.. but on the other hand, more Rambo Momoa action than you asked for! 

Chamalet's acting is rather wooden, if not sleepy, as he lacks the passion, wisdom and introspection needed for someone like Paul Atreides -one of the things that Lynch had totally done right- and strangely there's more romance -incestuous at that- between Lady Jessica and Paul than with her husband Duke Leto. WHY is that, Denis? 

The sountrack by Hans Zimmer, as usual with Zimmer, is good yet unremarkable. All the usual drums and badass fights are covering for too much greyness and uninteresting designs, especially for the spaceships (like those boring-looking Heighliners I was trying to care about, or Bene Gesserit ships that look like yuppie home appliances). Stellan Skarsgard makes for a quite boring archnemesis, and the CGI overall feels uninvolving. 

We're far from the magnitude and psychedelia of the first two-three books, that, also here, Lynch and Brian Eno did the effort of expressing.

This is a Dune for generic yuppie Millenials who mate through yoga sessions, expensive trance music venues and posh diners downtown. Likely reflecting the director's and his production team's views and tastes.. but not getting any broader or more inspiring than this. For all the love thrown at Villeneuve, I'd say he lacks the ambition such an adaptation DESERVES.

Another big-budget, beautiful-looking cinematic piece of rubbish"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Modern movies are universally awful, but this one somehow turned out pretty well."
"Feb 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great cinematography, but half the screenplay is a dior ad. The story feels a little dragged out, but it is still good. Maybe far too long."
"Feb 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Slow and dull, looked to be just showing off special effects"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible.  Immersive, beautiful and captivating.  Loved the acting performances and the director nailed the tone felt in the novel.  Amazing action and the undertones and messaging sang through with beautifully delivered metaphors and dramatic cinematography.  Beautiful movie.  Most enjoyable viewing in recent years."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so well done in every way. Every time I watch it I like it more (it was a 10 the first time I saw it). Bravo to the writers, director, producers, actors, set design, wardrobe. So impressive all around. Sets the right mood in every scene. I've read the book and their interpretation is so good. I cannot wait to see part 2."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome visuals, soundtrack et characters.
Pure Villeneuve"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, a little slow sometimes but i really look forward how they continue this."
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,What an achievement! This movie is a prime example of what filmmaking is all about.
"Feb 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It didn't follow the book and the story was weak, and they left out God."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,I guess it is fine..Little long especially in the middle bit.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great, but not perfect, adaptation of the first two books in the original novel. Villeneuve's artistic and thoughtful approach to creating the Dune universe on screen - coupled with strong performances from most of the main cast - makes Dune (2021) one of the best movies of the year and one of the best Sci-Fi movies in memory. Part 2 should be even better."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dennis Villeneuve's Dune does justice to the classic fictional novel by Frank Herbert. The movie sounds amazing, looks fresh and full of modern filmmaking ideas which characterizes Villeneuve's thought-provoking and pioneering approach to cinema."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"A slow burner, but the amount of detail and development you get is enough to keep your attention. Beautiful visuals."
"Jan 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"movie was mid, not the best, but 6/10 imo"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fabulous visuals, unique soundtrack, amazing action scenes....what's not to like man"
"Jan 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Dune"" is a big sci-fi story of a hero's journey to a dangerous planet to ensure the future of his family and his people, deserving of a rich treatment, and in this regard, the 2021 film delivers. While the performances are good, the most impressive thing is the music and visuals, especially around the epic battle scenes. Although long and slow at times, it is worth it for these moments"
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Dune is a decent film. It is about a noble family who becomes embroiled in a war for control over the galaxy's most valuable asset. Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya give good performances. The screenplay is a little slow in places. Dennis Villeneuve did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the action and adventure.
"Jan 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was hoping that this would show 30 more years imagination, skill and technical expertise than David Lynch's 1984 version, but it doesn't. Lynch was a real visionary who gave us extraordinary visuals in a strange world. This latest version doesn't give the viewer any reason to care about any of the characters, which is a real shame - and feeling so disconnected, I felt I was watching a little skirmish on a spec of dust about thirty million light years away. Casting Josh Brolin was a mistake, he looks just like any ""guy next door"" which detracted from the character. Much prefer the 1984 epic version."
"Jan 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,you need to fire james gunn
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie aesthetically and interesting plot, I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. Definitely one you'll want to rewatch again and again."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"There are so many burning contemporary topics compiled and explored in this half century old scifi founding text, that the questions of meaning and life are inevetibly asked throughout its never ending reads and rereads. And Villneuve succeeded in giving this detailed and rich world a dignified immersive visual realisation. This is a movie universe I will be part of many years to come. I hope."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have to agree with the critics, the cinematography is absolutely stunning! The beginning is a bit slow but once we get to Arrakas, it's a thrilling cinematic ride that had me on the edge of my airplane seat -- watching it on a tiny screen!! I will see it again and I will find a big screen to watch it on because it's too good not to see the full visual effects. 

The casting left something to be desired, but Frank Herbert's story is captivating on multiple levels and the screenwriters and the editors did a fantastic job of pulling together the multiple plot streams into a beautiful symphony of political, spiritual and social/psychological intrigue! I gotta see it again and I look forward to Dune 2.

P.S.: I can't blame David Lynch for not watching this version, it puts his version to shame."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"So very basically. If you don't like this movie, you are probable that kind of person that can enjoy just Snyder or Bay movies, basically your brain cells are not trained to get more than the sparks of an explosion. The problem with this film is that this is a masterpiece of great script, scenography, art direction, colours, the awesome direction of Villeneuve. Really if you don't like this kind of film, no problem, just watch the next useless cinecomic and don't waste time on stuff that is too much for you."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Ein Meisterwerk der neuzeit!
"Jan 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie sucks and so does the acting
"Jan 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible Horrible Movie
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie with dynamic twists and action sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat. Sets up a compelling story arc with its foreshadowing. More of a set-up movie for things to come rather than a stand-alone film.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the sound and visuals of this movie, it made me feel like I was there. Though they shouldn't have just ended it in the middle of the story in my opinion at least end it with something happening."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme √© incr√≠vel.
Para todos que leram o livro Duna, entenderam a dificuldade que √© dar vida  a esse universo, e a forma como isso aconteceu foi surpreendente.
Obs: √© um filme que possui um outro ritmo, talvez n√£o agrade tanto quem n√£o leu o Livro."
"Jan 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It had 2 hours of build up, and 15 minutes of substance at the end to lead up to a sequel."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great, but it has some problems. If you already read the book, the experience will be better. It seems that the end its a cut, that something is missing, and I could have more character development."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I actually fell asleep halfway through this.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best SciFi movie in years!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! It's so amazing! Love it!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite some miscasts (Tufir Havat), and some creative approach to characters (Kines and Jessica), this movie comes as close as possible to the book, without needing a whole series. 
One can see how much Skarsg√•rd enjoys playing the villain, and Chalamet is acceptable as Paul. I'd really like to see how they'll handle the second part."
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning.  And the acting is solid and believable.  My problem comes with the pacing and sound design.  Every scene was loud and covered in music, leaving no opportunity for rise and fall.  This, combined with the lack of any coherence between scenes made me feel like I watched hours of video game cut scenes back to back."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Delicious film that makes your fall in love with the big screen and the genre.
"Jan 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although Dune does have several slow paced moments that can be quite uninteresting, its characters were well built courtesy of its cast."
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I mean, it's fine. Two and a half hours, and almost nothing happens. Not saying the acting isn't good, or the effects, but I just don't understand what the heck is going on or why. It just doesn't compel me. Not even Jason Momoa. I think the real problem is that it's just all over the place and they should have made Paul gay. If Paul was gay it would have been a much better movie."
"Jan 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i can imagine this would be great if you've read the books, but i haven't. so this film pretty much made no sense to me"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,can't wait for the second part... outperformed my expectations.
"Jan 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really felt like this movie was made to people that beforehand know the story, i was definitely not one of them."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best sci-fi in a long time
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"They never say ""The Spice must flow"", but still a good movie"
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's boring. However, it is a great movie for boomers and people who like to read books. They try to appeal to younger generations by casting my favorite twink Mr. Chalamet along with queen Zendaya. I literally would not have watched if they weren't there. Good casting, I suppose."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This IMO is a masterpiece of modern Sci-Fi, I enjoyed every single moment of it."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The visuals in this movie were nothing short of spectacular. The acting is S-tier, and though the movie approaches 3 hours, you never feel the length, and the cliff-hanger ending leaves your mouth watering for the next addition to this series from some of cinema's best workers. The only problem was releasing it on HBO at the same time as theaters, because this deserves to be seen on the silver screen."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'll be honest up front‚Ä¶I'm not the best to get advice from on a movie like this. These kind of movies are always waaaay over my head‚Ä¶it's like they make a plot line so hard to understand to impress viewers. ""The technical part of the stratosphere discovers the new planet with scientific pressure and then the naysayers‚Ä¶"" like what?? Just make it easy to understand!

The visual effects and cinematography are top notch, but I need a plot that actually is spoken in my language to understand."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie looks like it will start a very popular fantasy story but for me it was for the most part slow paced and uneventful. I expect the sequel to be a lot better.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, I'm highly satisfied with this film.¬† Audiences are introduced to a whole new world which is an exciting experience for movie lovers.¬† Visually, Dune cannot be faulted, and performances are well suited and enjoyable.¬† The plot again remains somewhat heavy, with plenty of information.¬† Director Denis Villeneuve nails this, though, and I only had a couple of minor issues relating to elements with details or plot.¬† Comprehending all the details and the complicated plot could be overwhelming and hard work for selected audiences. In the end, I was left feeling highly impressed, and I wanted more of it, like right now."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A visual masterpiece. Rare that a movie does justice to the book. This one definitely hits the mark! Can't wait for pt 2
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece, captivating visuals, rich world, great characters and outstanding performances."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I ever seen!!! It's as good as the first Star Wars! I can't wait for part 2!!
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great adaptation of Frank Herbert‚Äôs novel. It only tells half the story of the first book. So, the ending will feel like Fellowship of the Ring. It‚Äôs a completed story but there is more to go. The cast and visuals add to a great story. The Baron steals the show!"
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,The film was over hyped when it released. Now watching on sky cinema. Find it hard to watch. Can't really understand the story line. Over 2 hours long. I'm sure I can find other better movies to watch that will make the best use of my precious time. Definitely wouldn't be watching any further movies on this. Can't believe that many like this movie! Must have a different taste to mine especially as I am big movie fanatic. Don't say I didn't warn you.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the best movies ever
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this adaptation on dune great music score visually stunning and an simple but well executed story that kept me entertained to the end üòÄ
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,I loved the original and wanted to love this but I didn't hate it.
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Trite reworking of the 1984 film, which in itself was disappointing, but this was far worse.  Little more than a half-hearted attempt to cover the nuances of Frank Herbert's epic novel, instead turning the story into an action movie; almost devoid of any character development or depth."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,A FIlm that you can see more often without losing the fun of it. I hope we do not have to wait long for the second part
"Dec 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Beautiful cast, but too long and too boring."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Simply one of my favourite movies of all time. You can tell this is a passion project for Villineuve, it shows.

This is a movie that gives you more on repeat viewings, the lore of the Dune universe will make this movie far more enjoyable if you familiarise yourself with it.

Can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, very good acting and casting. Takes time to tell the story but never gets boring. Not many movies like this are being made these days which is a shame. I really look forward to part two."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I don't know what to say as a hard core Dune fan other than well done, it's impossible to make this into a film, I think you are a genius for making it as ""Dune"" as you did.  I withheld half a star only for one reason: there was a bit of a drift toward making characters a bit more relatable to Gen Z, but at the same time, I understand doing that.  I felt ""re-imagining"" Dr Kynes did not contribute to the film but detracted from it, just because it was such a massive departure from the book.  But at the same time, it's not like it was bad either, it was fine and the lady is obviously some highly talented actress.  I just think cleaving closer to the film on that would have worked better, but again, what you did was cool enough.

Again, impossible impossible impossible to make this into a film.  Very pleased with the very sincere, earnestly crafted offering from this director who I've grown to like more and more, and from the actors who I feel did very great jobs.  Very well done."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2022 in my eyes, I love the eery sound production behind Denis Villeneuves' movies, if you have a decent surround sound system then his films really do utilise it and you can tell he has passion not only for cinematography but also for sound production, all round the acting is pretty solid, the special effects are mesmerising and the story is one of the best ever written, all that added with the hard punching sound production and perfectly fitting sound track meant that it gave me everything I want from a Sci-fi movie, I cannot wait for part two, Dune will go down as one of the best Sci-fi movies of all time, lets hope the sequels are as good."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved it, an artful reinterpretation of half the first book. Amazing cast, beautiful visuals. May feel a little slow to a modern audience,  but I found its pace refreshing and meditative  Relieved a second film is on the way!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Its one of those movies, that you just have to see it for the first time in Imax 3D.

Perfect casting for almost all characters and beautiful music its simply must see.
Its only first fart of the book, but its a great movie anyway.(next part coming 2023)"
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,there is something missing so meeh
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Slow, but not boring, enveloping, fascinating and creepily beautiful. Can't wait for the next one."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, waiting for the second one"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolute masterpiece!
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Beautiful scenery. Cant wait for the sequel.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,This will be the franchise we show our kids years from now like our parents did to us with Star Wars
"Dec 18, 2022",POSITIVE,it's a wonderful well paced adaptation to a epic novel with excellent acting especially from Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Baron Harkonnen
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"As cold sci-fi, Dune is appropriately massive in scope and scale but honors the journey of Paul Atreides meticulously. It's as lovingly faithful to the source material as its 2 hr and 35 min-run time allows. More a critique of the novel than this adaptation, the one thing Dune fails to do is show the emotional choice Paul Atreides makes between following the path set by his Bene Gesserit mother and embracing the mantel of Duke embodied in his noble father."
"Dec 14, 2022",POSITIVE,Found out the few issues (nit picks really) there are with the movie originated in the book. All around great movie.
"Dec 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,"so slow and stale, probably because i saw the original which was colourful and epic & this version had no soul or style. it just felt...clean and sterile."
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,absolutely incredibly submersive film. Any Dune fans should not miss this rendition of the epic Dune story... cant wait for the second rendition...
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,Beautiful movie. The scenes are great. The acting is amazing. Cannot wait for the next one. It can be really building to something noteworthy
"Dec 12, 2022",POSITIVE,much better than 1984 version
"Dec 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,Walking in I found out how long the movie wasüò≤. But I was shocked when it ended. Visually stunning and even though the novel has many levels and details this production did an excellent job keeping the story cohesive.
"Dec 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I don't think I've ever wasted so much time waiting for a movie ""get good""‚Ä¶ I waited the whole 2 hours and 30 minutes. It was baaaad bad. Maybe people have rated it so highly because they enjoyed the old Dune from like 50 years ago and thought it was cool to see it remade, but it wasn't. Not cool at all‚Ä¶.. people talking about the ""stunning visuals""? It was mostly sand‚Ä¶. They were amazing and showing us lots of sand, WOW. The space ships and things? I've seen much better on low rated sci-fi shows, so yeah nahh. Sucky movie, soo soo sucky."
"Dec 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,"jesus what a mess! i can't believe the 1984 version beats this movie by a long shot!

i really had my hopes up after watching the 1984 version (and due to ""reviews and ratings"" which apparently has nothing to do with the quality of films)

this movie could've been easily shortened to 60 minutes at most, nothing there really made me care for the people or the plot, just looks and feels like a generic film. some of the visuals are OK for a modern film, but how on earth did this get such ratings?!
the costumes are so simple, no interesting dialogues, the scenes and landscapes look so flat and fake.

the 1984 version is exponentially better, maybe only few of the visuals there are not as impressive as the 2021 visuals, but that's only because they didn't have the technology to make it back then.

if you think you've enjoyed the 2021 version i dare you to try the 1984 version and then you will be awakened, just like the sleeper did.

HE WHO CONTROLS THE SPICE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE!"
"Dec 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is a work of art. Timothee Chalamet is incredible in it; a standout by far.  This was my introduction to the world of Dune. I am invested and so existed for part two. I am hoping this will begin a beautiful, critically acclaimed franchise. I can wait to see more from Timothee Chalamet's Paul."
"Dec 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"Spectacular visual experience. I'm hooked for the next one. If it wasn't for the book, which I'm currently trying to decipher, I would have been lost in the details. There's a lot that they just leave out there without an explanation. But if you take a step back, the bigger picture drags you in and gets the adrenaline going."
"Dec 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"oh dear , much hyped and looked forward too , disappointing . great visual effects , but acting and characterisation poor . stalwarts of everything  herbert  , will not have been taken in . the earlier tv series on scifi , of dune and children of dune is the one to watch . the key to these earlier dune books 1-3 , is chani and irulan , the casting of the young paul , chani and stilgar is awful . the only redeeming feature is the mentat eyes . i cant even bring to mind the face of the doctor . the worms are wrong , basically the film has no heart . one needs to remember the brilliant vision of the herberts and their incredible understanding of the human condition ."
"Dec 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"My favorite movie of all time: it has both amazing visuals and an amazing story. The characters are easy to follow and the movie gives you a reason to want to go back to the theater to rewatch it. Unfortunately, it's not in the movie theater anymore, but when it was, I got to experience it firsthand and I can tell you that the movie is the best thing that I've ever seen in the theater. Also, the story and the characters are as good--if not better--than the book. Highly recommend!"
"Dec 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"For me this was style over substance. The acting was strong, but it was as slow as can be, and the story went nowhere."
"Dec 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"I really didn't knew that i liked  in- universe politics in movies. Dune is a movie that I didn't expect to like as much as I do right now. This movie was so good that i actually went ahead and read the book , the last time it happened was in lord of the rings. The thing that made me want to read the book was the world building. The world building is really important and it feels like a universe even though we don't see other planets unlike the 1984 movie where they say only 4 planets matter which makes the world feel small. This movie has moments which makes dune DUNE. The characters also make good decisions and act like wise individuals. There are some things that are whacky like how they didn't set up doctor yeuh and the ending just ends without any sort of conclusion. Maybe they should have focused on the fact that Paul doesn't kill like in the book like batman and in the end he realises with these hallucinations that he has to kill to survive which would have been a much better ending. One thing that I noticed is that how certain things are showed as a twist compared to the book. The book just says the yeuh twist and the harkonnens destroying the atreides and the gurney halleck being alive twist. In this it's more like a twist. And yes of course I am not going to about the movie without talking about its amazing cinematography. The shots are really good. The acting is good. Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto is the best choice. And this movie only adapts the least interesting part of the movie and i can't imagine what the next movie would be like 9/10"
"Nov 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Alright, so much going on here. Incredible cast, mid character interaction, a superb score, top-notch special effects, amazing plot, disappointing pace. 87/100, definitely watching again, super stoked for part 2, too bad we have to wait like 3 years. Hope they don't ruin the sequel. Can't get over this cast. Truly incredible. Just wish they would have fit more of the plot of the first book in, and I wish so many great characters didn't die so soon, but it's faithful to the book, so I can't really complain. Overall incredible movie, shoulda made wayyyyy more money than it did. Great book-to-screen translation."
"Nov 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Can't wait for part 2 !!!!!
"Nov 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"A true cinematic and auditory experience. I enjoyed and visual FX, audio FX and the story tellling of course a lot."
"Nov 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Much better than the 1984 adaptation. This movie benefits from splitting the source material into multiple parts because more time could be spent with a scene or character. It does a good job explaining the rules of the D-universe without overwhelming. Visually, the movie is absolutely gorgeous."
"Nov 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Movie definitely is one of the greatest films of the decade, and it doesn't surprise me how much of a hit it was. However, I feel like the only problem with it was that the movie was a little too stretched out, when the whole movie could've been only twenty minutes shorter."
"Nov 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Like the score that crescendoes throughout, this movie is overwrought. And for that reason, pretty, but empty."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,So much like star wars and Lord of the rings makes this movie just amazing
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The best movie score ever composed! With the best editing ever done in a movie! Plus, the best cinematography ever done in a movie! Also, the best production design ever made in a movie! Not to mention the best sound mixing ever done in a movie! As well as the best sound editing ever done in a movie! And the best visual effects ever made in a movie!"
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"If you like science fiction films, this is pretty much a must see. It is a very good film (in two parts, this being the first half), which I think I appreciated more the second time I watched it. This is a major blockbuster, but I still feel for the original from 1984 which affects my judgement on this later version. A well-acted well designed film."
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"I'm not usually a fan of slow dramas, but this one builds a world and builds to the conflict with competency. It's beautiful and well done. I'm not even a fan of the books or previous movie, but this was very well done."
"Nov 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Just watch it. Your only disappointment will be when you realize how long of a wait you have until the next movie in the series.
"Nov 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I like this movie, but I feel like a person who need more because I want to see more Zendaya she don't show up enough and this make me sad because I love her and admire"
"Nov 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"So here we are with another attempt to make a feature length film of Frank Herbert's Dune, one of the biggest sci-fi novels that has left massive impact on the genre. 
This time it's in the hands of Denis Villeneuve, who took a brave move by making this Dune the first part of the book before Part 2 even been given the go ahead.
My personal opinion is ""Dune"" is glorious from the sound design & to the visuals which are immense. The Hans Zimmer score is great & the score for The House Atreides landing on Arrakis is brilliant & grabs you when the bagpipes kicks in during the battle."
"Nov 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Nice adaptation by Denis Villeneuve accompanied great cinematography. Nicely done!
"Nov 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very Good, one of the Best Movies of 2022.  Great Acting, Great Characters, Amazing graphics and CGI work.  Fighting scenes were spectacular, war scenes were BIG SCREEN, and the Lore and World creation was brilliant. Bravo. Fully NON Woke as well!!!  Cheers to that."
"Nov 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie is an eternal waiting for something that never arrives, very frustrating..."
"Nov 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Masterpiece in every aspect. A perfect movie.
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,Great adaptation of the most epic science fiction book ever written!!
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"might be too long honestly, but it's still a banger."
"Nov 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"The music and the effects are amazing, the story wavers a bit but overall its a very good adaptation."
"Nov 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Undeniably lush, the story of a young king/savior who struggles with his destiny is certainly Old Testament meets Game of Thrones, and Dune does a descent job of creating a movie of action pieces and characters that you want to watch.  But unfortunately between the semi-conscious story development, sleepy direction, and underwhelming tension, this is an epic ... miss.  Why not spend as much time on the plot and character development as the production design.   See instead: Blade Runner, The Empire Strikes Back"
"Nov 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Is there anything wrong with this film? It's biggest criticism was that it was ""slow"". ""Slow""? Who cares? If it hadn't taken the time to include as much of the vast detail of Herbert's world that it could, it would have felt rushed and incomplete. Aside from that, the acting, directing and cinematography are beautiful, and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR."
"Nov 11, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it! I hope there will be another one coming out!
"Nov 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece, music, pictures, lands cape, CGI, actors and costumes amazing‚Ä¶"
"Nov 9, 2022",POSITIVE,Extremely well paced sensory experience with one of the best soundtracks running behind brilliant camera work hard to go wrong with this thrilling sci-fi
"Nov 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"All I can say is, part 2 can't get here soon enough!"
"Nov 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved it, Bit of information overload but still amazing. Dune is not an easy undertaking, but Denis did a pretty bang up job in my opinion. I watched this movie 3 times and loved each second of it."
"Nov 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great adaptation of a great book, can't wait for the second part. Thoroughly enjoyed as a big fan of Dune. Friends who did not know anything about Dune before the movie also loved it."
"Nov 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,Weird movie with no ending
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is the first time writing a review. I read the first book while in junior collage and loved it, watching the movie now 8 years later brings so many good memories. They captured alot of details from the book and I say this is one of the best adaptations from any book Ive read.
Stunning scenery, costumes, great actors. 5/5."
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Brilliant. I looked forward to the second movie. This movie keeps telling it's story throughout.
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,The story is hard to follow if you're not paying again but the graphics are the best I've ever seen and the story and cinematography is on point
"Nov 1, 2022",POSITIVE,Master Piece! This is the first time in my life I have watched a movie 4+ times in a week. Fantastic Visual effect and Background music.
"Oct 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,It's a beautiful movie but way too long.
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Visually striking. Epic. A film that is bold enough not to be complacent with the public. Artful crafted. The first time I saw it in 3d and I have to admit that the 3d is bad, really bad (see it in 2d if they ever re-screen it in theaters).
The dialogues are intriguing.
The characters deep.
The technology is credible.
You feel the depth and the details of a really existing universe and civilization.
The dreamlike narrative is really appropriate.
The acting is incredible.
I hope they will preserve it at the Smithsonian.
People in year 2400 should see it and they will find it amazing. And so will you, and so must you!"
"Oct 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Denis Villenueve regala una experiencia extrasensorial con esta pel√≠cula, una obra maestra disfrazada de relatos cl√°sicos conjuntados para formar ""Dune"", la obra de 1965, que con la visi√≥n de Villenueve presenta de muy buena manera un surrealista relato mesi√°nico con una acci√≥n impactante desde el apartado visual, con alegor√≠as muy bien marcadas como la del Toro, que para mi representa la fuerza imparable vs la sensatez o la injustificada diferencia f√≠sica y mental entre el hombre y la bestia, bestia que podr√≠a tomar varias caras, ya sea pol√≠tica o subconscientemente en el humano, la b√∫squeda por el poder y la tan marcada supremac√≠a humana. Que para mi es lo que representa la pel√≠cula , la dualidad entre la clase monopolizada mente autonombrada realeza con la gente de abajo, dualidad que se subraya en el 1 y 3 acto, mientras en el 1 acto nos muestran la cara de la pol√≠tica por la que se rigen los personajes principales con un cambio abrupto en el 3 acto con la guerra, el r√©gimen del Pueblo. El vestuario en esta pel√≠cula forma gran parte de la interpretaci√≥n de los actores, actores que desde su presentaci√≥n son imponentes, mayor mente marcado en Dave Bautista y Stellan Skarsgard, ellos son impactantes desde su f√≠sico, no necesitan un arco de personaje en la historia su simple misticismo los vuelve interesantes y temibles, conjunt√°ndose de muy buena manera con el resto del elenco, todos lo hacen incre√≠ble encarnando respectivamente su posici√≥n en la historia. Con Timoth√©e Chalamet encarnando a un personaje oprimido por sus padres en una busqueda constante por el poder que no sabe si posee a pesar de ser catalogado como el ""mes√≠as"" del relato, que junto a Zendaya que para mi representa la desconstrucci√≥n de la belleza interna y externa crean una conexi√≥n que aunque no est√©n en pantalla juntos en casi toda la pel√≠cula, las visiones tan bien metaforizadas en la historia crean una incertidumbre que se va alargando y desenmara√±ando en el desarrollo de la pel√≠cula culminando con una fant√°stica alegor√≠a del personaje de Paul saliendo literalmente del hoyo y con ello tambi√©n renaciendo simb√≥licamente de las cenizas de su imperio.

Para mi Dune es una pel√≠cula que est√° en el grupo de ""obras maestras"", crea una obra que desde el soundtrack que combina de excelente manera los sonidos ambientales con la profunda banda sonora de Hans Zimmer puedes notar el peso simb√≥lico que solo un director con la precisi√≥n de Villenueve puede crear, esta obra bien puede ser una cr√≠tica Capital√≠sta y a sus consecuencias de la anarquia del Comunismo y su inevitable ca√≠da o una simple monopolizaci√≥n de las obras cl√°sicas expolotadas a la m√°ximapotencia para crear una narrativa que conjunte a todas ellas. Dune es una experiencia al lado m√°s introspectivo de la desconstrucci√≥n humana."
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing masterpiece that builds out a whole new world properly. Makes star wars (from a star wars fan) look like a cheap knock off.
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve Has pulled off a truly spectacular piece of cinematic film making with DUNE, everything from the cinematography to the score to the incredible sweeping landscapes and rich lore and backstory that stays true to the source material. I can only hope that the film does well enough in the theater so we can see this truly epic story come to conclusion."
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve is an amazing director, and DUNE just so happens to be my favorite thing like ever, so my anticipation for this movie was immeasurable, and let me say, this movie is an actual masterpiece. From a visual perspective, this movie is probably the most beautiful film ever (that I've seen). Based on this director's other works, you would expect nothing less from eye catching angle. The story itself is articulated so expertly, that I can't begin to describe it. It adapts the story of DUNE in the best way possible, and I really don't see any issues with it. The only issue anyone has with this movie was that no one knew if a sequel would come out to finish it, but I am writing this in October of 2022, so since that knowledge is given to me, I can safely say that this masterpiece is simply, a 10/10"
"Oct 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Best adaptation of Dune by far. However,  why oh why does there have to be a two year wait for part two?"
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"The scope of the film is impressive, as are the visual effects and score. Really no complaints here."
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,An epic and deeply immersive cinematic experience that hooks you in and leaves you dying for the sequel. I would most definitely recommend it!
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is the movie I've been waiting for, I been a great mmm big fan of this story and that did an excellent job with this movie. Can't wait for part II"
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece. Quality and emotions that become poetry on the big screen. A colossal work in acting, directing, editing, cinematography, production design... Everything is perfect. Finally a new colossal movie and epic picture for years."
"Oct 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is a masterpiece in science fiction. It excels in drama, action, plot, story telling and scenery. Denis Villeneuve has out done himself. Kudos to his team and much respect to him for respecting the lore and books. Those reviewers that complain about the pacing are probably the same people that are addicted to the now 6 second TikTok or YouTube shorts online. This movie is fantastic. The build up is magnificent. And I love the sound effects and music. Bravo!"
"Oct 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Respectful and intelligent adaptation of Herbert's novel - great spectacle and performances.
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation."
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Una de las mejores pel√≠culas de ciencia ficci√≥n del siglo.
Acci√≥n y efectos especiales de diez, tramas interesantes y un desarrollo de personajes que hace que no necesites saber nada ni de su pasado ni de ellos mismos para entenderlos y conocer sus ambiciones.
Sin duda entra en mi lista de las cien pel√≠culas obligatorias que ver."
"Oct 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Villeneuve manages to make the film engaging despite its uninteresting lore. It has low rewatch value. The fight scenes are terrible. You can't feel the force, punch, or stab in all fights, which is disappointing since Blade Runner 2049 has very effective fight scenes."
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"A teenage dream to metamorphose Frank Herbert's future-shock epic into cinematic resplendence, Denis Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer convey us into a darkling geomorphology of desert warfare, spicy mirage and duels of superpowers with their mind-bending narrative, visuals and score."
"Oct 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Went into the theater with no idea what the plot was nor that it was a remake. LOVED IT. Similar movies as this one sometimes frustrate me due to not having prior understanding of the characters/plot but Dune kept me tuned in the whole time. any questions I had just kept me watching to find out. Can't wait to see part 2.
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"When Dune part two arrives, this two-parter of a sci-fi epic is sure to become a modern classic."
"Oct 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not a reader of the books, but here's my review. Really wanted to like this movie with the stellar cast, acting, visual effects, and an interesting concept. Those parts this movie does exceptionally well. However pace was painfully slow, a lot of confusing moving pieces, and by the end of this long movie I wasn't really sure what was so ground-breaking about what was just watched."
"Oct 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"It does make compromises regarding the source material, but they are understandable. The grandiose look and atmosphere speaks for itself as it guides you into this new world and universe, whose sequel we will look forward to."
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,A fully realised film of the book.  Superb.
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,Exactly what I wanted from a Dune movie.
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is the adaptation we've been waiting for for 50 years! The only way to successfully tell this story is to do it in a two-part film, and this is an excellent set-up to part two. I can't wait until it comes out!
Villeneuve succeeds where Lynch failed in so many ways. Let's get one thing out of the way at the very beginning: NO WEIRDING MODULES!! Using hand signals and subtitles instead of inner monologue was a nice touch as well.
The acting was superb! Having only ever seen Oscar Isaac in the Star Wars Sequels I was shocked at the depth of character he was able to put into Duke Leto. Jason Mamoa was the perfect Duncan Idaho (I would have liked to have seen the scene where he is drunk on spice beer), and I can easily believe him to be one of the most feared warriors in the Imperium. Timoth√©e Chalamet, like Matthew Broderick in the previous generation, was able to convincingly pull off a younger character well enough so that the audience forgets the actor's actual age. 
One of the only issues I have with the film is the treatment of the redoubtable and dangerous Lady Jessica. The number of times she is portrayed as merely fearful and seemingly not in control of herself was insulting to the character as written in the novel. I don't blame this on the actress Rebecca Ferguson, whom I feel did an amazing job with what she was given. I put this at the feet of the director - and even this has a caveat. Her character may toughen up in the next installment."
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,A Sci fi Masterpiece!
"Oct 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was ok I guess. Just watch the 1984 version.. it's better. Not sure why Hollywood has to remake so many classic movies that still hold their own. Lazy.
"Oct 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"If there was someone up to the task of building the world of Dune it was Denis Villaneuve. Everything from world building, cinematography, directing, and character development was on point. I am looking forward to the second part."
"Oct 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is a work of art. The acting is perfect. It was incredible how they adapted such a non-cinematic source material and made it one of the most cinematic movies of the 21st century. The story is amazing as well, and was adapted, albeit imperfectly, rather well for a 600+ page novel over 60 years old. DUNE is the book that inspired so much of sci-fi that we know and love today. You must watch this movie, and you must read the book. And if you want to learn good storytelling, study them."
"Oct 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Admittedly, I have been a huge fan of the book since I read it as a teenager. In addition I'm a bit of a science fiction nut. I didn't think that the scope of the book would translate into film. However, this is the best bloody thing I've seen in years! Brilliant. Much better than the previous version. Better than my own imagination. Can't wait for Part 2 and hopefully Part 3. However, if you are unfamiliar with the original book, the plot would be confusing. Can't rave enough about how much I enjoyed it."
"Oct 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is one of those movies you hold off watching due to Hollywood messing up so many new versions of classic movies and shows. Then you watch it and walk around the house for a week saying ""God Dammit I could have watched this ages ago!!!""
It's near perfect."
"Oct 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Very true to book adaptation with little room for imagination. Occasionally shows the power of the novel, but will have to wait for pt2 to confirm. Worth the watch alright!"
"Oct 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"Never seen or read Dune before I sat down in the theatre to watch this movie, and I've had the wildest experience that evening. The score, the visuals, the incredible story, the characters gave me goosebumps, and I was completely in awe. 
I loved how slow building it was - it  really felt like I was watching a written book, which I like. Since then I've openly told anyone that this is my favourite movie of all time."
"Oct 3, 2022",POSITIVE,I absolutely love that they've refreshed the Dune series and I am so anxious to see what they will do with the whole Dune universe!!! I was truly blown away!!!
"Sep 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Beautiful filmography, quite true to the source. Good actors!"
"Sep 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"ATREIDES! ATREIDES! ATREIDES! This excellent warrior chant echoed in my ears when I viewed DUNE in the IMAX for the third time. My heart was beating for every twist and turn throughout the film. The fact that I knew what was happening with the coup and the sudden fall of House Atreides kept me frustrated and excited for the upcoming battle of Arrakeen. Paul's journey is quite impressive and engaging in the grand scheme of what makes DUNE such a cinematic and written masterpiece. I am looking forward to Part 2, the cast looks absolutely amazing. Hans Zimmer's epic score is saved on my Spotify library! I would like to let Denis Villeneuve that I love his work and courage in building up such a wonderful film. I love the book so much and believe that even the smallest dream can forge large accomplishments. Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, and good luck with DUNE Part 2!!! I must not fear, fear is the mind-killer!"
"Sep 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Much better than the 1984 version, this one makes the smart decision to split the story in two to give it all room to breathe.  The result is an epic, visually stunning movie with strong performances.  It's held back from greatness by a few effects that come off looking cheap and an anticlimactic ending.  Here's hoping part 2 nails the ending."
"Sep 27, 2022",POSITIVE,My new favorite movie of all time‚Ä¶ they were very true to the book and brought it to life brilliantly for the first time ever‚Ä¶

"Sep 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Very good movie with an awesome cast. Intrigued to see where this goes next.
"Sep 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I cannot believe the high scores. Not as good as the original version. actors not as good, and there is sorta this lukewarm atmosphere that pervades this remake. S0metimes originals, no matter how dated, outshine the modern sophisticated remakes i.e. King Kong, The Thing, etc."
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning and beautiful sound make for a masterpiece in today's cinema. Chalamet centers this movie with an incredible performance. The supporting cast makes this movie even better: Ferguson, Skarsg√•rd, Isaac, Zendaya‚Ä¶"
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,See plenty of the Dune TV shows and Movies and so far this was the best and well done.  Enjoyed the books and read a good way through the series.
"Sep 22, 2022",POSITIVE,possibly one of the best made pieces of cinema this century
"Sep 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The story is a little boring and very confusing. Most of the characters are uninteresting. I tried to get invested into the world and story but it's not for me. Other than that, the visuals are amazing, and the score is beautiful."
"Sep 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Hard to understand and the runtime is so long. Not worth the watch in my opinion.
"Sep 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"There are two things that make this movie the best film of 2022. The visual effects and the story. Denis Villeneuve deserves a knighthood for the CGI because the visuals were absolutely perfect. Complementing that is the movie's riveting storyline that sees a political struggle between the Emperor, House Atreides, and House Harkonnens over the known universe's most important commodity. . If you're into Star Wars, then your definitely going to enjoy this one. A highly recommended movie for those who love political dramas and sci-fis."
"Sep 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"Avec le sens du d√©tail et l'amour de l'image de Denis Villeneuve, Dune : premi√®re partie ne pouvait √™tre que r√©ussi sur le plan visuel. Les sc√®nes tourn√©es √† la lumi√®re du jour, entre chien et loup, apportent une touche po√©tique et authentique qui manquent √† beaucoup d'autres films aux effets sp√©ciaux abondants. 

Ce premier film Dune ne d√©grade pas les √©crits de Frank Herbert, ce qui n'est pas chose ais√©e tant la complexit√© des intrigues politique et humaine peut √™tre d√©licate √† transposer, notamment lorsqu'il s'agit de montrer l'√©tendue des pouvoirs de Paul Atr√©ides. 

Par ailleurs, les acteurs pour incarner Paul et Jessica auraient difficilement pu √™tre mieux choisis ; Thimot√©e Chalamet et Rebecca Ferguson forment un tandem remarquable. En revanche, je n'en dirais pas autant sur le choix d'Oscar Isaac pour incarner le Duc Leto. Non que l'acteur soit mauvais, il lui manque une pr√©sence √† l'image ; Liam Neeson aurait √©t√© un meilleur choix, je pense. Cela ne g√¢che pas son personnage pour autant. C'est plut√¥t le traitement de Liet Kynes qui m'a d√©√ßu : sa fin n'est pas aussi forte que dans les livres, alors que Dieu sait qu'il y avait mati√®re √† filmer la sc√®ne la plus marquante de ce film‚Ä¶"
"Sep 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"I don't know what the hell I just watched, but I was thoroughly entertained!"
"Sep 18, 2022",POSITIVE,Epic. Dune is finally here.
"Sep 17, 2022",POSITIVE,The artistry accomplished with visual production impacts your emotions on a subconscious level.  Truly amazing.
"Sep 17, 2022",POSITIVE,Way better than the 1984 film. I was honestly blown away just by how good this movie is. I loved it and I am totally down for Part Two!
"Sep 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"First big film I've enjoyed in a long time. Great structure, tone and epic scale."
"Sep 14, 2022",POSITIVE,Incredible. Complex characters that develop over the course of the movie. Great introduction to a complicated world that doesn't compromise the source material. I watched this twice in a row the first time I saw it and still couldn't wait to see it again. Fantastic music. Can't wait for part 2.
"Sep 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Truly epic from beginning to end. It detached me from reality for a moment in time. I can see why it might be slow paced for some people, but I think for this movie it worked. It needed a slow burn to be enjoyed. Definitely left me wanting more and I'm eager to see part 2."
"Sep 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a fantastic movie, great action and it was enjoyable on all fronts. I like long runtime movies and most people would say it's a slow burn, which it is but it's nice to watch a movie that actually takes time to establish it's environment and the characters within it."
"Sep 13, 2022",POSITIVE,Completely faithful to the text and spirit of the book. Highly recommend. A must see.
"Sep 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,stunning visually but the story is horrible but then again the story was horrible in the books too
"Sep 12, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome movie entertainment!
"Sep 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"I thought they didn't make movies like this any more. I have read the novel several times and I thought there was no way that a movie adaptation could ever do it justice. I am happy to report that I was wrong. This is a magnificent adaptation! I had goosebumps all the way through!

This is the movie I wish I could see for the first time again. Pure cinematic bliss!

The Spice must flow!"
"Sep 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great cinematography, excellent soundtrack, solid acting and appealing plot! Definetly worth watching and re-watching!"
"Sep 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,a good movie. but if the leave it just with this then it's bad for the source material because it leaves a lot of things open
"Sep 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Having read the books, the 2020 film version is an overly long, unexplained, mostly booring film. I know the cash box is the driver of this 2 or 3 part series because the 1984 film is a much better film over all and especially for the first time Dune viewer."
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Somewhat a slow buildup, but the storyline gradually encourages one to appreciate it. Visual effects were believable and storyline thankfully unpredictable for first time watchers."
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"wow, how incredibly involved and well done...spooky. Intense..creative beyond definition of what is reality."
"Sep 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"It's some kind of unspeakable wonder. The soundtrack, the landscapes..."
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved the pacing and story telling, classic sci-fi."
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Epic scale and beutifully filmed, Dune crafts a rich and exciting world for the audience. Dreams are messages from the deep..."
"Sep 8, 2022",POSITIVE,By far the best adaptation of the book. I'm looking forward to watching the next part!
"Sep 8, 2022",POSITIVE,simplemente increible
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,This is such a great start to the dune universe. I'm not an expert on the lore but the way this movie introduces all the concepts is textbook for any sci-fi fantasy. It got a little confusing near the end but was still entertaining enough and action-packed to be an excellent movie.
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Sad when it ended. Eagerly await part 2.
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,It's better sci-fi. I liked it. A couple of minuses for me was not understanding/hearing the dialogue at times (mumbling? not enunciating well?) and keeping track of the story lines and characters. It's a film I would need to see twice or three times to fully grasp I think. I would not mind watching it several times!
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"Cl√°ssico, uma boa adapta√ß√£o, muito bom!
Duna √© uma das melhores obras de arte j√° escritas, 
ao lado das obras de Tolkien e outros grandes nomes."
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,I was transported. I went to see it in imax because this is what Villeneuve suggested but I should have gone and seen it in Dolby to fully appreciate the genius soundtrack (lesson for Dune part 2!).
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie takes a lot of risks by having its first acts being mainly a series of contemplative and cold sci-fi vignettes. It's beautiful to watch and the music brings emotions. The dialogue are short but there is a lot to absorb in terms of lore and storyline. Too long? Maybe but you know that once every pieces of the story will be at its place the movie will reach its paroxysm and I am happy to say that it really gets it right. The last act takes your breath away with surprising action scenes that always keep the artistic sense that the first parts of the movie used to the viewers. That being said, yes the movie is beautiful with spectacular pictures, and meaningful style but the color palette that it's mostly hues of beige will bore you by the end of Dune."
"Sep 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's a pretty good movie, I guess. Fantastic looking and all. But somehow I couldn't feel much sympathy for the most characters. But I didn't read the books, so maybe it's meant that way to create a harsh and distanced world? Maybe just not completely my taste. I loved the depiction of the Baron Harkonnen: only to see him move like this evil slug again I will see the second part!"
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,audio effects of this movie sets whole new benchmark
"Sep 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Dunes Reboot is both better and an improvement over the original that even if it's own set of problems have faults, its still a satisfying film with its special effects."
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"Spectacular, incredible and well done. Superior to Lynch's movie."
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"Breathtaking, well written, great acting"
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film gets 4 stars for cinematic visual quality and not putting me to sleep. If you know Dune, a remake was needed but not attempted because as of yet, there is no way to accurately recreate the world in the Books. Also, the last attempt, which was good just was to lengthy and the graphics where just not there yet. The rendition looked amazing, the acting compelling. My major disappointment, No Zendaya, well just 10 mins at most at the end...sorry spoiler?
""The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.""
ee"
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,I watched it for its Visual Effects.
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"I'm a fan of Dune, have read all the Dune books and short stories, and was worried this wouldn't live up to its source material. Wow, was I wrong! This film captures the sweeping splendor of Frank Herbert's universe and adds some small twists that make certain characters and familiar storylines even more dramatic. Love it! Recommend this one to all science fiction fans!"
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"Acting was amazing, didn't think there was bad acting from anyone. The cinematography was unbelievable and the CGI was top tier. Everything looked and felt real. The story was interesting even the political parts- which most movies completely fail at."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It is a movie that would not deserve any comment, if it did not reflect all the vanity and downturn in which today's film industry has gone. From the director of the interesting ""Arrival"" (2016), through the failed ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), Denis Villeneuve, we came to an impersonal remake of a much better achievement from 1984.

No need to spend too much words on the analysis of this work, because it seems that the story itself did not even interest the authors much. A simple recipe, copy everything that has already been filmed, stretch the already maximally compressed script to two or three potential sequels, pump in as large a budget as possible for CGI effects, insert a few actors (Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin), who would otherwise be ok, if they weren't here only just for decoration, in order to push up the ratings a little more, with the antipathetic and completely wrongly chosen main protagonists, who all together sadly failed.

The individual reassignment of gender/ethnicity of the minor characters from the book is not too irritating, although such choices are, for some strange (or perhaps not) reason, somehow always at the expense of quality. So, they are still irritating, because they are imposed. By the way, if the so-called gender (and any other) equality in cinema has already become the manner of the new age, it is interesting that no one ever replaces any original female character for a male one, if only as an experiment. I guess that would require a certain amount of originality and courage, qualities that are no longer appreciated by modern directors.

After watching this adaptation, it is only possible to love more the controversial 1984 Lynch's version, which, despite all the imperfections, still remains superior in every sense (I mean, of course, the shorter, original version, not the integral, which is much weaker).

The only positive thing that can be said about this film is that, unlike e.g. the long-announced ""Foundation"" series, which is a much bigger disaster in itself, at least holds the original story. And in any case, at least it doesn't come down to purchase of the title of some famous work in order to push someone's other untalented generic script for a story that no one else would ever look at.
All in all, a small consolation."
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"Superb cinematography and a visual overload of movie mastery. Denis Villeneuve delivers once again. A cult classic in the making, cant wait for Part 2."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"So close to the Dune that I want to see on screen, but not quite there.  Still it's a wonderful movie that has me waiting for the sequel."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"When Villeneuve comes out with a film you know it's gonna get wild.

The sense of scale that Denis is able to produce is just mind-boggling and he retains his class the whole time.

It wasn't until the second viewing though, that I discovered what made me feel weirdly confused and dissatisfied after the first viewing. 
It was the simple fact that the whole story, plot, character introductions and largely the whole world-building is all being told as if you already are familiar with it. 
I'm guessing that if I'd read the books before watching I'd feel respected and as though Denis gave a little ‚Äònod' of ¬´you know what all this is about¬ª. 
So that's why the second viewing actually was an amplified experience from the first, since all details of story and plot were settled and I had the time to capture more of the deeper meanings and thoughts behind the different scenes.

Wonderfully tasteful and patient storytelling without losing a single fucking second of pacing. Fucking astonishing."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"As a great fan of Herbet's books, Villeneuve made the perfect adaptation. Hans Zimmer is as its top, and actors performance is absolutely relevant."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,Waiting for Part 2.  The suspense is nerving..
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"Pretty Good! Fantastic visuals, the story is a bit slow but intelligent and compelling."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,Pretty good.   Enjoyed watching a classic movie with original performances.
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,"slow, boring and never fully understood without having seen it about 5 times. highly overrated"
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,Can't wait for the other parts. Fingers crossed we get the complete book series.
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Dune is an expensive art film that stripped the soul out of the source material. The director turned what should have been an action film in to a plodding bore. The film was horribly miscast. Timothee Chalamet's Hamlet version of Paul caused chain reaction problem in the story. Many scenes had to be added to account for the change of Paul from a strong leader who has been trained since birth to step into his father's shoes as duke into a total wimp. The novel has very little opening material that takes place on Caladan while the film lingers there pointlessly. At the same time, scenes that advance the story in the novel were omitted. The one positive thing is the film looks good and has stunning visuals. If you're the kind of person who likes mindless comic book films with no plot, you might like Dune. If you are Denis Villeneuve fanboy, you'll certainly love Dune."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"True to the spirit of the book, this movie is a love-letter to the books and is a must-see for anyone that likes a story well-told and well-filmed."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Having read the book which at first I assumed it was not adaptable. However this movie does it well and gives us context about the fiction. The score is totally unique, much like the duniverse itself. I think this is the best possible adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Unlike previous adaptations, this one Gives Lady Jessica the screen time she deserves. Outstanding adaptation of the book. Ends at an odd moment in my opinion."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"–ù–µ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—é, –ø–æ—á–µ–º—É —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª —Ç–∞–∫—É—é –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –≠—Ç–æ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º, –Ω–æ –Ω–µ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ. –ú–Ω–µ –æ–Ω –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª—Å—è –Ω—É–¥–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ç—ã–º."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Just a masterpiece. Combination of narrative, visuals and score."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great. I went in with low expectations as an old reader, but this was just... brilliant. Can't wait for part 2."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is an absolutely stunning adaptation of the original material. It will be hard for some to follow because they made the decision to do without an internal monologue which the older movie used to help the audience understand the nuances of the story and the characters.

My only criticism is the Lady Jessica. The quality of the acting was excellent, but I think that the way the character is portrayed is such a departure from the books that it actually disrupts the story a bit. She is too emotional; too fearful.

Other than that, absolutely spot on even with some minor changes."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Like Jackson's LOTR Trilogy, it's not perfect but clearly honors and respects the source material.  Denis Villeneuve is developing a distinct, engrossing visual style that alone is a treat to watch.  But pacing, story, costumes, effects and acting are all great.  Fingers crossed for Dune 2 to bring it home.  Will make it the defining ""Dune"" adaptation for a very long time to come."
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"While much of the runtime is spend on world building, what a fascinating world it is. It does indeed feel like the first half of a story, because that's precisely what it is. Once the second film releases I can easily imagine the full picture becoming some of the best 5-6 hours of sci-fi ever put to film. I am also a fan of all 6 Frank Herbert novels and hope they are able to do justice to Dune Messiah & Children of Dune if they decide to adapt them. I hope Jason Momoa realizes what he signed up for!"
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Can't wait for part 2
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Solid.  It is always refreshing when there is a respectful and well-done adaptation of one of your favorite books.
"Sep 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie demonstrates the accomplishment of some great outcomes. Yet, most of it can't be appreciates because the dialogue can rarely be followed. I couldn't finish watching the film because the audio was handled so badly, which now seems to be largely the norm in these modern films. Exacerbating this is the particularly unintelligible performance by Timoth√©e Chalamet which demonstrated the he too believes that great emotion is demonstrated through the obfuscation of the dialogue. Every time he wants to show emotion, it seems like he has never had a real emotion in his life. He seems to think screaming, gurgling and mumbling is a fair enough representation of feeling."
"Aug 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing. You can tell the director loves the book. Can't wait for part 2.
"Aug 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"I did not read the book nor see the original movie, but this version was great."
"Aug 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Two stars for the sound design..Music and the photos..
The rest is an empty shell.
I like Denis Villeneuve a lot but Some Stuff are supposed to remain on paper."
"Aug 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I can see how people liked the film because of the sound and scenery, but that's about it. Zero explaining on most of the backstory, slow beginning, slow middle and rushed end. Half the time I didn't know why things were happening or the reason behind it. I just don't understand what all the fuss is over as I can barely class this as a movie as it didn't have any sort of storytelling in it ( a start, middle and something which was meant to be an ending)."
"Aug 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Slow.  OK movie but very, very slow."
"Aug 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"I am a kid of the eightys, having grown up with films (partially older like me) like star wars and the first adaption of Dune. While leaving an impact it never took real hold, especially after reading the book. Hearing there would be a new adaption by Villeneuve i read it again and had no big hopes because the source seemed just too complex to be adapted for the big Screen. Nevertheless i gave it a chance and SURPRISE it dit not only held up to any possible expectations, it blew them right out of the cinema. I am not sure if i ever have seen an sf movie even close to this ambition and scope. It all checks out: The Vision, the cinematography, the music, the actors. I am more than maiting for part 2, probably never was waiting for a movie as much as for this one. Advice: Choose a screen as big as possible and turn the volume up! See you in the dunes waiting for the Sandworm taking us to part 2."
"Aug 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Damn this movie is a freaking masterpiece
"Aug 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Feels like a Ridley Scott movie. Baron Harkonnen is a pale version compared to the one in 1984. And why in heaven's name are we glorifying desert cultures? Was probably cool and novel back in 1965, but not anymore. Was it inspired by watching Lawrence of Arabia? Make it out in space and you have a hit! Also NOT a big fan of one name celebrities. Oh, and the dragonflies are flights of imagination. Could you imagine the carnage landing in a crowd?"
"Aug 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"i didn't like this movie and i found it so confusing i am a timothee fan, so i though that this movie was gonna be good but tbh it's not my thing, but maybe dune 2 i gonna be better?"
"Aug 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Movie ends on an unnecessary cliff-hanger. Also, why did the Asian doctor have to die in such a gruesome way?"
"Aug 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing in every way. Really looking forward to part 2.
"Aug 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Hands down one of the best movies to be released within the past 10 years. The characters have a depth that is quickly realized. Absolutely beautiful cinematography. The story takes itself seriously, which allows the viewer to feel the weight of decisions made and their succeeding consequences. I can not wait for the sequel!"
"Aug 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,Great effects and sound but not as good as I thought. For all the hype I was expecting a lot more. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Aug 25, 2022",POSITIVE,What a fantastic movie. I had no knowledge of the Dune universe before seeing this and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. It is a fun world that Denis does a good job of fleshing out. The story itself is interesting and the visuals of this movie are amazing. Cinematography is a 10/10. Movie is a massive recommend!
"Aug 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"THE BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN RELEASED 2021.  And one of the best I have seen for a long time full stop.  Simply stunning, grand, and to those who wish to criticise, pull your heads in.  Watched 3 times in less than 2 months, I couldn't help but treat myself, absolute gold.  How a movie should be..  EPIC.  If you enjoyed the early 2000's original release, you will totally piddle your pants, end of story.  CANNOT WAIT TIL PART 2.  Thank you directors, producers, actors, and crew, be proud.  SEN MF SATIONAL.."
"Aug 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A beautiful film with amazing music and visuals. For those familiar with the books or earlier film, it may seem strangely boring as this adaptation has not much more to offer than its spectacle rather than story."
"Aug 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"To me, Dune series is the Bilble of sociopolitics, religious politics and a whole bunch of other kinds of human wisdom. Thus, I can't really forgive skipping the feast in Arrakeen or the missing Green Chamber.

This film reminds me to not pay TOO much attention to trailers. The trailers suggested another 2020s woke disaster which this film is not. Yes, Kynes was made into a black woman, but his role does not get ruined by it and this way all the woke checkboxes got compressed into the single scapegoat who was already the perfect candidate through being a planetologist.

My inner Dune Jihadi scoffs at the softened Atreides. The rest enjoys it. Humans in the Dune universe are already somewhat different from us, no need to overfocus on that.

The actress chosen to play Chani by method of woke checkboxes could not deliver the original, whose savagery hides behind an ""elfin face"" and who fancies Paul from the start. Again, an acceptable casualty since she was never an A-rank toon while Kynes alone would not have appeased the wokeness committee.

All in all, my feeling is that this as good as a 2020s adaptation of a classic work can have any remote chance to be. There's hoping the crew noticed the winds of change in WB/Netflix stories and Part 2 will bow even less to the Nazis and instead just continue telling one of the most compelling SciFi stories ever written."
"Aug 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,the visuals were stunning! but I ultimately got very bored in the end!
"Aug 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Huge fan of the books and previous movie. The first 20 minutes of this film and I knew this was something I would watch over and over. It is different, and I love it. Amazing filmography. Gorgeous. Casting was spot on."
"Aug 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Director/Screenwriter Denis Villenueve (""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Arrival"") is a perfect fit for a story like ""Dune.""  Villeneuve has consistently crafted films that are captivatingly immersive cinematic experiences, sometimes short on story but always visually spectacular.  This ""Dune"" offers truly breathtaking visuals.  In fact, it's the best reason currently available for actually heading out to the movies.  Films like this can be best experienced only in a dark room with a huge screen, lightly populated with socially-distanced strangers who have turned off their cell phones (I'm looking at you, Row G).

Villenueve, along with co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, has created a mesmerizing world for the moviegoer to inhabit.  House Atriedes, long-time rulers of Caladan (a world filled with rainy days, fog and lush beauty ‚Äì think Seattle, but a planet) is ordered by the Emperor to take control of Arrakis (known as ""Dune""), a barren wasteland of strategic importance because of the hallucinogenic ""spice"" harvested there.  (Spice is essential to interstellar travel, life extension and a variety of medical uses, all of which make it the most valuable substance in the world.)  Turns out, House Harkonnen, previous ruler of the planet, isn't thrilled to give up this lucrative enterprise.  Treachery abounds.  The leader of House Atriedes is murdered.  The heir, Paul Atriedes, barely escapes, but is abandoned to wander in the desert, just in case the messianic overtones were too subtle.

Although this film runs over 2 ¬Ω hours, it covers only the first half of Frank Herbert's original novel by the same name.  Even at this length, creating a coherent narrative is a major achievement.  In contrast, in the 1970s Chilean surrealist Alejandro Jadorowsky created story boards for an epic film version of ""Dune"" with a running time of over ten hours.  Astonishingly, Hollywood wasn't interested.  It would have starred an amazing collection of characters including Orson Welles, Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, David Carradine, Herve Villachaize (the diminutive Tattoo on ""Fantasy Island"") and Gloria Swanson.  The lead would have been Jadorowsky's twelve-year-old son.  (If you're interested, watch the 2013 documentary ""Jadorowsky's Dune."")

Villenueve's script has stripped away the pretentious overtones and general bloviating of Frank Herbert's novel.  The original novel is a piece of work, in every possible sense.  Running to more than 550 pages, it was originally serialized in ""Analog"" magazine before being published by the little-known Chilton Books (a publishing house best known for its car repair manuals).  Herbert himself spent time in a socialist commune in Washington state as a child.  He was also a distant relative of Joseph McCarthy and admired his relation's goals if not his methods.  To suggest that his views are ""eclectic"" is to engage in serious understatement.

All this means that Villeneuve had to effectively navigate a dizzying range of topics that include ecology, psychedelic drugs, religion (featuring the Bene Gesserit ‚Äì think extremely badass space-traveling nuns), authoritarianism and actual human emotion.   He succeeds for many reasons.  First, rather than spouting philosophy, he focuses on building a big, far-reaching spectacle that literally encompasses a universe. Second, he has an impeccable eye for casting.  In this case, he's selected Timothee Chalamet (""Little Women,"" ""Call Me By Your Name"") as the messianic son Paul Atriedes, Rebecca Ferguson (""Mission Impossible"" series, ""The Greatest Showman"") as his Bene Gesserit mother, Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina,"" ""The Card Counter"") as leader of the Atriedes clan and a supporting cast that includes Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Zendaya.  All inhabit their roles perfectly.  Finally, Villenueve understands that big ideas can arise and be considered without the need for mind-numbing exposition (that's right, Mr. Herbert) or tidy resolution.

""Dune"" has admirers from a surprisingly broad array of political perspectives, from Stephen Colbert to white supremacists attracted to the idea of a white messiah figure.  Since its publication in 1965, Herbert's weirdly compelling world has offered a welcome respite from the real.  It offers a similarly welcome, thought-provoking diversion today."
"Aug 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"An amusing and fantastically present feat, on all fronts, lays out a foundational adventure, not only in action but amuses the mind in all ways, as well. The stellar cast, perfectly brewed together, enhance the storytelling presented,"
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"Despu√©s de haber le√≠do el libro, me eh dado cuenta que es casi una ley leerlo para disfrutar al 100% esta pel√≠cula. La hab√≠a visto en otras dos ocasiones sin tener absolutamente nada de contexto de la historia de Dune, y aun as√≠, la considere una obra maestra en todos los aspectos, pero hoy por hoy, me es incre√≠ble que esta pel√≠cula exista y ya no puedo esperar para lo que se viene con la secuela."
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie a little slow at times but still very good
"Aug 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Despite the throbbing score of its trailer, Dune is a film that waddles in the footsteps of its older brother. Majestic and intentional, yet careful and forgettable."
"Aug 17, 2022",POSITIVE,Great watch needed more action story line was ok
"Aug 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"it all amazing, the acting, the writing and especially the visual effects.
i think its the best movie to come out this year."
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,"As you would expect from Villeneuve, the film is visually stunning. Admittedly, there are moments where the writing doesn't always seem to match the overall tone, and some of the themes and lore don't hit quite as hard as I would have liked them to. And despite the films runtime, it felt incomplete. This story was clearly setting up for a part 2, and you could feel it. I could have spent another half hour in this world to see some things progress a little further, which is honestly the best compliment I can give."
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,Epic! Sound was fantastic. Will be watching again
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,Glorious‚Ä¶ Pure cinema
"Nov 15, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Compared to the book and the 1984 version of the movie, the characters seem stupid and weak willed. It makes various alterations or additions to the story, which generally weaken the story. The visuals are nice though."
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,It was beautifully shot. It lack some action but the storytelling is very good and you understand that it's a really good warm-up for the next movie.
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,Loved this blend of fantasy and science fiction.  Read the book well over 30years ago and remember what a blast it was.
"Nov 15, 2021",NEUTRAL,I thought they didn't develop enough on the relationship between the mother and her son.
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,It was a stirring movie with amazing visual effects and soundtrack. A few times in the movie I had to close my eyes because it was the slightest bit scary. I will be looking forward to the next one.
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,"This book fan loved it all! The characters were well cast, all of the important story elements were there, and the scenery and music really took us to their world's. Awesome!"
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,Awesome.  The sound was phenomenal. Really impressive representation of Frank Herberts exceptional world building.
"Nov 15, 2021",NEUTRAL,"There's 5-star CGI, but not enough action to satisfy its anticipated hype. They gave us much less than we were expecting. "
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,"Everyone in Hollywood should take notes. This movie is pure effort. Looks beautiful, sounds tremendous, pacing is perfect. Not my favorite actors, yet the director brings the best out of everyone. I love when nerdy source material is taken seriously. Sometimes, it felt like it could have taken a breather for Dune is serious start to finish. Nonetheless, I was very entertained. If the Academy has any honor left, this movie should sweep at the Academy Awards."
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,Great film! Cast was excellent and the visuals were amazing! Sound/music was terrific. Can‚Äôt wait for part 2
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,fairly close to the book
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune (2021) is fantastic! Visually and aurally stunning, and surprisingly respectful to the novel. Highly recommended for those seeking serious and entertaining adult science fiction. (A rarity!)"
"Nov 15, 2021",POSITIVE,This was a wonderful film. All the performances were excellent. Looking forward to part 2.
"Nov 14, 2021",NEGATIVE,Boring boring boring
"Nov 14, 2021",POSITIVE,Technically superb and visually appealing. Its only limit is the excess of epicity that we find in so many scenes.
"Nov 14, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Never read the books and have to say that I would much rather read from the beginning than to watch another movie. I thought that the actors showed promise, but that is as far as the entertainment goes. According to my husband this movies missed the mark and a lot of the important story was lost. The dialogue was very hard to follow and while the story tried to make sense, it didn't."
"Nov 14, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Slow, nothing really happens."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,Never have read the books or seen the original dune films but a fan of scifi i was blown away by this film. The story and the way this movie was shot is incredible. This films universe is propably going to be my new favorite.
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,It's  awesome! Great movie!
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"The story was great, loved the action and the dialogue. The camera work is unbelievable! The way they focused on the faces of the characters and blurred everything else was truly amazing. There better be a part two for this series cause I wanna see more!!!"
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve creates another banger. This isn't my favorite of his films but it's still fantastic. My main issue with it though is that it is on the slower side and there is an emphasis on set up here but with the knowledge that it's set up similarly to the Lord of the Rings films then it wasn't something I took a major issue with. Even if it's a lot of set up, it's an engaging and investing set up. Besides a couple of scenes, I was fully engaged with the story and characters throughout. On a pure technical level, this film is masterful. The visual effects are off the charts. All of the ships, locations, and animals feel incredibly realistic and whimsical. The cinematography is fantastic. I prefer the cinematography in Blade Runner 2049 but it was still amazing here. Every shot looks incredible with how it's lit or the framing. The performances were pretty great. I wouldn't say this is the best performance from these actors with the exception of Jason Mamoa and Rebecca Ferguson. Both of them do a great job and I'm excited to see what else they can do. Hans Zimmer once again puts out another banger score. This is easily the better between this and No Time To Die but both are still great. The character work definitely helps the set up feel engaging. We don't get a lot of exposition dumps about our characters but we are shown how they act and it's great. I wouldn't put this at the top of a Villeneuve ranking but it's up there and I can't wait for the sequel. Definitely check this film out when you can. It's worth the price of admission."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,Great!! Great casting and looking forward to the next one
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"I believe Dune is the Star Wars of this generation, at least it feels like that way for me because I was in awe the entire time watching this movie. I fell in love with every aspect of the world building and the deep complex intricate aspects of the universe this movie takes place in.
 A must watch if your a Scifi fan"
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,Must watch in the movie theater to get the audio an visual effects. 
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"Held true to the book which is an action filled feudal epic without sacrificing character development.  Can't wait to see part II.  Loved the fight scene between Paul and the freeman.  What that guy did snarling at him with his teeth chattering reminded me so much of what Anthony Hopkins did with his lips smacking over the thought of fava beans...and somebody, lol.  Spooky."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,Can't wait for the next movie!
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,Excellent adaptation of the book. A must watch
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"Simply a beautiful movie.  The soundtrack and special effects were outstanding.  I have read the books there are some things they did really well but a few things I miss like the internal dialog of the characters and the more overarching politics (including CHOAM) were missing. The reason for and the repercussions of Jessica having a son instead of the daughter she was ordered to have was also not really mentioned. But maybe they will touch on that in the next movie. 
Excellent movie all around."
"Nov 1, 2021",NEUTRAL,Good but not great. I really wanted it to be great but it was just average.
"Nov 1, 2021",NEUTRAL,"DUNE must be experienced on the largest screen possible.
The DUNE novels never made it into my hands, so I might not be the target audience for this film. I did try to enjoy the 1984 movie directed by David Lynch, but I couldn't finish it. But I do like big Sci-fi films, which is what this movie is. So if you plan to watch DUNE filmed with IMAX cameras, I recommend finding the most giant screen your theater has to offer.

DUNE is long and slow sitting at 2 hours and 35 minutes. For movie lovers and DUNE fans the long runtime and drawn out story will not be a problem. For the rest of you, be ready to look at your watch for time to time. I enjoyed the cinematic shots from beginning to end but knowing this movie is a drawn out PART 1 of a planned multi-movie franchise made it difficult to appreciate this movie for what is is, an intelligent, eerie and gorgeous sci-fi epic.

Surprisingly DUNE is not director Denis Villeneuve's best film.

His more notable movies are better than DUNE, such as 2015's Sicario and 2017's Blade Runner 2049. Despite that, Villeneuve is an excellent filmmaker and has a great eye for this genre. All the visuals were top tier, and the special effects were seamless, which will easily immerse moviegoers into the world of Dune.

The cast is brilliant, which features Timoth√©e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Zendaya. After DUNE's debut, Chalamet, who has already signed on to play Willy Wonka in the upcoming origins movie, will be offered plenty of prominent roles. Unfortunately, this movie is not filled with that much dialogue, and at times this whispery dialogue is incoherent. But the cast does give stellar performances with what they are handed with. Also, seeing Oscar Isaac in his role as Leto Atreides has me super excited for his Metal Gear Solid movie.

Verdict
I give DUNE a 7.5 out of 10. It is a sci-fi soap opera full of epic landscapes and intense action."
"Nov 1, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Godawful waste of time. Yes, the cinematography is stunning, but the dialogue is inane, acting barely marginal. Costuming failed.... why does everyone, good & bad guy, all look the same? it crawls along ...and NOT in a good way. Even worse, the sound is just horrendous, to the point that about half of the speaking roles cannot be understood, it is all garbled and you miss a good part of the plot. . If you haven't read the book, don't go to the movie, you will be confused. If you saw Dune 1, don't go to this one, very disappointing."
"Nov 1, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Great visuals, with outstanding action scenes. It's worth the price of admission to see Rebecca Ferguson. I liked this movie a lot."
"Nov 1, 2021",NEGATIVE,Boring boring boring
"Nov 1, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Shit movie, it was so boring I fell asleep and had to rewind it‚Ä¶ TWICE!!"
"Nov 1, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Almost walked out.  Too loud! Too violent! Uncomprhensable dialogue and scenario, but brilliant cinematography."
"Nov 1, 2021",NEGATIVE,It dragged on forever...
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,Way more details revealed in this version. The graphics were very realistic! Surpassed my expectations as a big Dune fan!
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Looking forward to part 2!
"Oct 26, 2021",NEGATIVE,Too long and storyline slow
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,"This is the best/truest adaptation of the book to date.  (Keep in mind, this movie only covers the first 1/2 of the first book.)  The script leaves out a lot of the complicated, unrelatable Dune language, which makes it flow better.  

The acting is great, right down to most of the extra character actors.  The costumes are as realistic as one can expect for a sci-fi movie.  The special effects and digital renderings of the ships, Caladan, and Arrakis are superb.  

DEFINITELY watch it in a theater first.  It is huge in scale!

My only complaint is the same complaint that I have for ALL movies at this point:  the sound mix between the dialogue and the action scenes is completely infuriating.  Some of the dialogue is so quiet that it is difficult to hear, while the action scenes are so loud that they nearly blow your eardrums out.  Seriously, someone in Hollywood needs to fix this consistent problem!!!"
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,"As a fan of the novels who has seen the original, and the reboot mini series on Sci-fi(now Syfy), I absolutely loved this first part! Definitely worth seeing in 3D!!"
"Oct 26, 2021",NEUTRAL,Visually entertaining.
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,This movie absorbs you into the world and builds a thrilling story
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Visually amazing. Sound and score is impressive. Can‚Äôt wait for part 2
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,So good to see a movie adaptation that was almost as good as the book.
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Awesome story first of all-if you have bot read the first book already please do so. The theatrics and cinematography are beautiful. The  acting is spot on. Looking forward to part 2 and 3
"Oct 26, 2021",NEUTRAL,I struggled to understand the movie after the 2nd time in IMAX
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,"I have watched it in IMAX and at home on HBO/MAX.
The IMAX difference could not be larger.  You cannot truly appreciate how massive this film is unless you see it in IMAX and hear it in IMAX.  
I have a state of the art home system I spent thousands on.  Doesn't touch the IMAX experience. 
The movie itself is very well paced and interesting throughout.  It only suffers from not having a hard date for the sequel."
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Best adaptation of the book!
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie. More of a retelling of the 1984 movie than the original book, but so well done. I can definitely see myself watching this movie again. Can't wait for Part 2."
"Oct 26, 2021",NEUTRAL,Directed and acting were beautifully. Sets and costumes were amazing. Great supporting act and good action. Little long and some of the Philosophy was hard to follow but otherwise great film.
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Great movie. It helps to have read the books.
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,"I liked it that it was science fiction and fantasy theme. It was awesome plot even its just part one.
I now its a book and its thick one.
I wanted to show more and it ended so quickly and  now hopefully part two will come out. I was edge of my seat . So cool and awesome"
"Oct 26, 2021",NEGATIVE,Slow and confusing a theme
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,"The soundtrack is insanely thrilling and fascinating. All the percussive sounds and deep low rumbling noises that Hans loves to use. That opener is kind of ominous but also incredible. Omg what am I getting myself into?! This is exciting. The sound design that Zimmer created with his music and sound effects is amazing. Experimental and bombastic. 

How is the House of Atriedes just going to blindly accept some mission like that without any knowledge or background of what their mission entails? They have no idea what they're getting themselves into. Very interesting concept with the whole wrist gadget that creates a personal force field. Blue meaning a hit and red meaning a death blow. I really liked the subtleties during the conversation with his Asian doctor and mother. The way his doctor spoke to him in Mandarin and warned him, and then his mother doing sign language, telling the doctor that this event never happened. That whole scene with the old lady dressed in black robes was something else. It seems Paul has been handed down some sort of powers from his mother. He has the gift of visions. 

Arrakis seems to be a very religious planet, resembling much of what seems like Islam. I love how shrouded in mystery everything is regarded to Paul being a chosen one. Holy shit, the harvester in the desert looks just like the box that Paul put his hand in to test his pain threshold. Holy fuck man that sandworm is terrifyingly enormous. It could probably swallow up moons. Jeez man, these Harkonnen are fucking ruthless. Damn, Leto went out like a straight G. And Duncan too! Holy shit! Fight till the last breath, literally. Dude the technology that the Harkonnen possess is terrifying. The laser that can literally cut through anything is horrifyingly powerful. That was incredible, it was almost as if the sandworm was acknowledging Paul. That's so crazy how Paul had to kill the one Fremen member so that he could be accepted into their community. He had never killed anyone before that. My worry is that Paul's mother vows extreme loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. What if they use her as an inside spy to infiltrate the Fremen? That look that she gives at the end made me question what her motives are. Things are going to get really interesting in the next movie and I cannot wait. 

Exquisitely shot. Every shot seems to have a purpose, and each one is beautiful. The imagery is incredibly epic and grand in scope. And the cgi is actually impressive. A lot of the artistic designs and concepts for the objects in the movie are very original and beautiful to look at. Already this movie is making a poignant statement on business greed, land ravaging for resources and colonization. I love the overall ominous tone of the soundtrack that gives off this stepping into the unknown feeling that makes it both exciting and uneasy at the same time. Ok, Denis was 100% inspired by Star Wars for this movie, no doubt about it. Some of the interiors seem to be inspired by H.R. Giger. A lot of the objects in Atriedes home world seem to be inspired by ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphics and such. The lighting is beautiful. Perfectly casted and exceptionally acted. This movie is filled with a powerhouse cast of actors. 

Beautifully epic. Everything looks incredible in this movie! Omg I can't get over it. There's so much to look at. From the wardrobe design, to the interior design, to the lighting, the colors, the objects, the space ships, the film locations, the grand scope of the sets. It's overwhelming to say the least. The lore is incredibly rich and pretty deep - fascinating. All the different languages and factions, all the technology or lack thereof. An absolutely exciting enthralling epic that also has elements of suspense and mystery. Beautifully ominous imagery all throughout. And of course in great Villeneuve fashion, the compositions of his shots are magical. It's themes on fear and overcoming fear, charging head on into it is inspirational and motivating. It's been a pretty dull and stale year to say the least (2021), but this movie right here just made it all the better, it gave me hope for the next. The movie was incredible, amazing. I didn't want it to end. I was immersed in the world and its characters. It's incredible what Denis and his team were able to create just from adapting the book. I mean he's basically creating a new franchise, sort of speak. He's paving the way for the Dune universe to be expanded upon. Maybe a tv show or something? Idk maybe not lol maybe wishful thinking. All I can say is I can't wait for Part 2."
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Wow it holds your attention I cant wait for Part Two
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE,Loved everything about it! A fantastic book successfully made into a fantastic movie. Thank you!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Great effects! Timothy displays great on screen command and presence
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Good movie. A lot of information to pay attention to. I‚Äôm looking forward to part two!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Very intense movie! Lots of action, great plot! Sometimes hard to follow and the scenes sometimes give you a light-shock, but overall, I really enjoyed the movie."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, I hope Warner Bros Green Light Part 2.."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula de ciencia ficci√≥n √©pica. Te adentras en su Universo tan rico en los primeros minutos y no quieres salir de ah√≠. La m√∫sica, los efectos visuales, la caracterizaci√≥n y vestimenta de personajes, la producci√≥n y todo a un nivel tan majestuoso que logra generar una sensaci√≥n hermosa al salir del cine. Una frase de la pel√≠cula que resuena d√≠as posteriores de verla: ""So√±ar despiertos"" cobra fuerza cuando asimilas lo grande del mundo que Villenueve te ense√±a con su cine. 
Trama pol√≠tica a lo Game of Thrones, batallas espaciales y cuerpo a cuerpo, desarrollo de personajes, mitolog√≠a de Arakis, religi√≥n, romance y ambientalismo, todo en un trabajo de cohesi√≥n impresionante que es acompa√±ado por la √©pica."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,AMAZING. I didn‚Äôt want it to end.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"This an amazing adaptation. I was disappointed when I realized that this was only part 1 of 2, but am eager for part 2 to come out!"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Epic can't wait for part 2 .
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Wow!  What a great movie.  A definite must see!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"I‚Äôve read all the books. My husband has not. We both were so glad we saw this, especially in a theater. I was grateful they didn‚Äôt cram the entire first book into this. You were able to take in the scenery, u see stories, appreciate the effects. The music made it. Part 2 will be the test if there are more dimensions to Timothy C"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"There's a lot to unpack here. To some it up; It's a big, sweeping sci fi epic with fine performances, sure handed direction, and an excellent score. There's moments that do drag for me, namely in the third act but on rewatch these will most likely not be bothersome. Honestly, this combines a lot of the fun sci fi of Star Wars and the sprawling, deliberately paced beauty of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Definitely looking forward to the second installment."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,amazing! a treat for the eyes!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Incredible, I can‚Äôt wait for this invigorating gut wrenching series to continue."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Top notch sound design and cinematography by Dennis Villeneuve.  It was almost perfectly cast with so many compelling actors and a wide-ranging ensemble. If you adored Blade Runner 2049 then you will love this movie.
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,"I wasnt expecting the film to be 2 parts, didnt know that until it started and the screen read part 1.  Other than that close to the original."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,This was absolutely phenomenal. The relationship between the film and the novel is uncanny. The soundtrack itself is a 10/10. Cannot wait for the following films.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,This movie was phenomenal. Finally have the technology to tell this story with its proper ambition.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Loved it all.  Some of dialogue couldnt be heard.  Almost a whisper!
Worth the wait"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,D U N E ‚Äî P a r t O n e is everything you want from the beginning of a thrilling story as old as time!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,I loved the movie and am looking forward to the next one. I think I enjoyed it more than Star Wars. Loved the characters and the movie stars that played them. It followed the book very clodely.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Very true to the book!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Visual feast that is very faithful to the books. Cant wait to see the sequels! Music is out of this world
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Great story.  Finally told with actors and technology worthy of the tale.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,epic filmaking on full display.  I think I loved it.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Cinematography was outstanding.  Casting was great and enjoyed the special effects.  Cant wait for the next chapter.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Great movie from start to finish.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Amazing!  Must see even if youre not familiar with the book!
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. But why is everything shot so dark. Hard to see at times and the fight scenes hard to follow. Still looking forward to second one. 
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"I'm an old fan,  wasn't disappointed.  Have to wait for part 2"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"good story, interesting plot, no ending"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Well done. Enjoyable.
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,The movie was too long and boring. I preferred the David Lynch‚Äôs Dune which was mystical and magical.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,I read Dune when I was a teenager. And then many of the sequels. This movie finally did justice to one of my favorite novels.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Incredible. One of the best sci-fi epics I've ever seen. So much style and beauty. Please go see in the theater, for your own sake and to ensure part 2 is made."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"I loved how well Denis stuck to the books story and feel. I cannot express how happy this movie made me as a fan of the book. I want to be critical but I honestly cannot find anything I disagree with. The baron still floats around which isn't how it works in the book but I understand the decision from a visual perspective. I really Cannot wait to see part two, own this on blu ray and watch it on hbo max again as soon as I get home."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,You must see this movie. You absolutely have to.
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Since I had read the book and seen the first Dune movie, I had a good grasp of the plot, but my wife and daughter-in-law were lost.  There should have been better plot development knowing how complex the overall plot is."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! masterfully directed! you can definitely tell that Denis Villeneuve is a fan and respects the source material. this movie offers a sense of scale that i haven't experienced in a while. this movie made me excited for what's to come! it is an absolute must see.
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,"It was a pretty movie. A lot of background, a little anti-climactic. I‚Äôll probably watch the second one though, to see where the story goes. Looks like they‚Äôll take it beyond the original."
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,Im honestly believe this movie is overrated.
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,2 hrs 35 minutes of sand worms dreams
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,Great story a bit slow
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Takes you to another world, wow!"
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Less Frank Herbert, more like Star Wars and Game of Thrones had a baby."
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Only thing good about this movie was the CGI, love the actors but lost the whole time"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Villeneuve's DUNE is a stylistically beautiful and narratively well-crafted adaptation of Herbert's classic science fiction novel. It sticks fairly closely to the structure of the book, but does leave some holes and some subtle moments from the book might be lost on viewers not familiar with the source material. There are differences from the book, to be sure, but all of the major notes are there and adapting DUNE is a significant challenge. Villeneuve was up to the task. The art design of the film is spectacular, with some nods to Lynch's DUNE here, but the sound design is vastly superior to the earlier attempt. Very well acted and maintains a good balance between the political conflicts, human drama, and action. This isn't fast food action scifi, it's slow cooked and rich."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I have not read the 1965 novel that this is based on nor the 1984 film by David Lynch. However, I am a huge fan of the director Denis Villeneuve and loved all the films he has made so far. The premise is ""Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will survive"". So is this another hit by Denis or his first work I don't like?

Let's get the obvious out the way first, Dune (2021) is a visual spectacle! The cinematography by Greig Fraser is wonderful. Every shot in Dune is gorgeous whilst also capturing the beautiful and grand nature of the otherworld planets. The costume and set department also do a wonderful job of really making it seem futuristic. Especial praise to the design of all the spaceships as they are remarkably designed. The CGI is very good as well, thankfully. Hans Zimmer of Interstellar fame does the music score for this film and it is magnificent. He uses to great effect a choir and electrical instruments that elevates every scene in the film. Dune (2021) also features a stellar cast who all do a great job in their respective role even those with little screen time. My biggest praise has got to be for Stellan Skarsg√•rd as the Baron who is just creepy and unsettling every time he is on-screen.

The story is also very intriguing and engaging. There is a political aspect throughout this series that gives a Game of Thrones vibe. There are alliances, secret agendas and backstabbing that keeps you glued to the screen. The movie also focuses a lot on world-building with the noble families, the ""voice"" power and the Fremen; a group of natives to the desert planet. All of this lore make the world of Dune feel more vibrant and unique similar to that of Lord of the Rings which managed to pull you in; Dune (2021) does the same. Denis does a great job in making all the politics and jargon stated, easy to understand for the audience.  There are also a large variety of characters in the film and Denis does a phenomenal job in making it clear what their personality and agendas are. The main character,  Paul Atreides played by Timoth√©e Chalamet, has a clear character arc with the struggle of his power and him being next in line for House Atreides. Most of his story arc gets a clear resolution by the end of the film.

However, Dune (2021) is a part 1 that just covers half of the book and it shows. Most movies build up to an epic 3rd act but Dune (2021) just ends midway through the 2nd act. This ends up feeling very jarring, to say the least as it doesn't end on a high note. It is also incredibly slow-paced. Since a majority of the film is dedicated to just exposition and explanation of the world; it results in a lot of moments that feel dull and sometimes boring. Additionally, the fight scenes and action scenes are serviceable but could be improved. Apart from the fight scenes with Duncan (Jason Momoa) the others are choreographed blandly and shot awkwardly as well. 

Overall, Dune (2021) has a lot of love and effort put towards bringing the grand vision and scope of the novel to the big screen. Every frame in this film is eye-catching thanks to the cinematography, costumes and set design that had a lot of thought put towards it. Nevertheless, it is a very slow paced movie that might deter some people from enjoying it. Despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed Dune (2021) and it was no doubt one of the most memorable Sci-fi movies to come out. It would be a crime for this to not get a sequel!"
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,I understand it‚Äôs set up for a Peary 2 but they should‚Äôve leaned on background more if they were going to make this such a short real world time.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Great cinematography, well developed characters, new twists to previous adaptations of the  Frank Herbert novel.  I'm a huge Dune fan and enjoyed the 2021 film immensely.  Looking forward to part 2!  Aloha"
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,They graphics and actors were much better then the first two versions. The only problem is the audio is VERY loud. Blocked out what they said at many points.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,It was beautifully filmed with a beautiful cast but I was expecting an incredibly different movie from the 1984 David Lynch adaptation and it just didn't seem like a million percent better than that given all the hate for that one.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Can only say Amazing! Must see. Can't wait for part 2
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Great remake.   Likable cast.  This first movie only reaches a third of the story of the original movie.   Disappointed that they didn‚Äôt show a Guild Navigator and some scenes were too dark.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Wonderful interpretation of Frank Herbert's first book.  My only complaint is that it was an interpretation of the first half.  Waiting to see the second half will be painful.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Best soundtrack for a movie 
Best movie this year, Best special effects, best acting and the theater in Milford Ia. DUNE"
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,A true epic of a film. Great acting by all. The visuals were stunning. I watched it at home in Dolby Vision. I can only imagine how beautiful it is in IMAX. Hoping this is the beginning of a series of films. Academy Award Material. 
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Dennis Villeneuve did what others could not. This adaptation is pure gold! Can't wait for the sequel!
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,The movie was loud and it was hard to hear the actors
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,This movie exceeded my expectations. Been waiting for years for this movie to be made and it was stellar cannot wait for the next one I'd love 3 or 4 more plz! If you are a Sci Fi nerd like me you will love it. I want to cry this movie was just so beautiful and mesmerizing. It was so well done it should be a best picture nominee and the acting was superb. Stunning! Obsessed with Dune!üôåüôåüôå
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,Best movie of the Year hands down.
