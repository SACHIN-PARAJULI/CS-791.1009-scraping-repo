"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE," “Dune” or “Dune: Part One” (2021) is the second film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel series. In the future year of 10191, an Emperor governs the universe, and this universe’s most valuable resource is spice, which aids in interstellar travel, but it is only found on Arrakis, a desert planet. The Emperor determines which House (thank you, “Game of Thrones” for making these concepts more comprehensible) will occupy Arrakis and insure that spice can be harvested without interference from the indigenous people, the Fremen, who never consented to the Emperor’s rule. The brutal house of Harkonnen have occupied the land and grown wealthy as a result of their position, but the Emperor orders them to withdraw and gives the job to the House of Atreides, whose head is Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and whose home planet is Caladan. His consort, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is training their young, inexperienced son, Paul (Timothee Chamalet), in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, a group of women who possess physical and mental abilities, even though men do not exhibit these traits; however, Paul is different. He dreams of fragments of the future, is learning how to control minds and shows physical prowess that other men do not exhibit. Moving to Arrakis challenges the House of Atreides to the point of possible extinction, but also makes Paul’s dreams come true. Why would I, a person who had zero interest in Herbert’s novels and did not enjoy David Lynch’s version (through no fault of Kyle Maclachlan), commit to watching not one, but two or more Dune movies? Denis Villeneuve. I found most of his films prior to “Blade Runner 2049” (2017), which is gorgeous, to be riveting, and arresting visuals accompany surprising stories. Apparently Villeneuve’s lifelong dream was to adapt Herbert’s universe for the big screen so while I am happy that he, like Paul, is finally able to bring his fantasies to life, it is not always a good thing for him or everyone else. No slander on Villeneuve’s adaptation, which I prefer over Lynch’s take, but “Dune” is broad in its characters and narrative. It feels predictable, and there is zero investment or tension over well-known characters’ development. Villeneuve’s “Dune” is the cinematic equivalent of a meditation garden: gorgeous to watch with its characters’ polished skin, smooth stonelike spaceships, sand enveloped landscapes, sunlight and shadows playing portentously on golden, bronzed metallic surfaces or verdant landscapes contrasting its arid sister planet. It is important for visuals to tell the story, but the people feel like the supporting actors, not the driving force, as they float elegantly with their gravity defying suits or trembling shields. The more that a person’s face is covered, the less than the audience can relate to them or should be suspicious of them. It is like a tasteful “Star Wars” with superb production values, but lacking in the raw, untidy energy of Lucas’ epic. While Timothee Chalamet may be the headliner, “Dune” is an ensemble affair; however, Chalamet sets the dour tone as a brooding, wan Paul. At least cowriters Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (who penned “Prometheus,” “Doctor Strange” and “The Mummy”) and Eric Roth (“Wolfen,” “Forrest Gump,” “The Insider,” “The Insider,” “Ali,” “Munich,” “A Star Is Born,” “Killers of the Flower Moon”) acknowledge that the man boy does not look like he can hold his own in a stiff wind, forget a physical confrontation. In one scene, Paul dodges and catches a minute assassination drone, a hunter-seeker. At the time, it seems plausible and deft, but as the film unfolds and more impressive warriors cannot withstand such an attack, it becomes retroactively impressive. Paul’s slight frame makes sense because if he displays feminine mental abilities, he should also possess feminine physical attributes. Paul’s sullen countenance is not chronic and breaks when he spends time with his weapons teachers and father’s faithful aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, who is still gorgeous but mostly cleanshaven), an adventurous cheerful bro type, and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), a man determined to teach Paul how to fight because the memory of war haunts him. Paul reverts to his original settings countenance when he is with his parents. The weight of his parents’ expectations, his predicament and his visions suppress his youthful buoyancy. In retrospect, Duke Leto Atreides (the scrumptious Oscar Issac sporting a lush, perfectly trimmed beard) feels like an inspiration for Ned Stark, and the only person on the chessboard who wakes up too late to the stakes of the pageant-filled game that he is playing and begins panicking long after it is too late to turn things around. The Duke is the kind of guy that others may not need to go to the trouble of assassinating since he engages in enough activities that could get him killed. He fancies himself above the Harkonnen because he is respectful of the Fremen and treats them like people, but he still wants to harvest the spice and make the Emperor proud so the only difference is a lack of self-preservation gene and good manners. His disembodied hand on Jessica’s neck, a gesture of love, gets framed as a feeble attempt at possession and control. His identity is irrelevant in the sequence, and he almost does not exist long before he arrives at Arrakis. The real star of “Dune” feels like Jessica. Ferguson is born to play supernaturally dubious women, and Jessica in Part One may edge out her performance as Rose the Hat in “Doctor Sleep” (2019) because of the range of her character’s journey through the course of the film. Jessica appears to be a privileged mother and significant other, but she gets the best lines during the Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling, who is incapable of delivering a less than excellent performance despite the heavy veil) implementation of a test, “Fear is the mind killer.” It is like someone else delivering Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” speech. The creative choice suggests that she is being tested as much as Paul by refusing to save him. There is an interesting power struggle between Jessica and the rest of the Bene Gesserit regarding how to produce the Kwisatz Haderach through a breeding program. If any part of “Dune” feels reminiscent of Villeneuve’s previous films, it is the breeding program. It reprises themes from “Enemy” (2013) and “Blade Runner 2049.” All women in this universe, except for Fremen women, are double agents with their own agenda by belonging to this breeding cult which entwined itself into the framework of this problematic structure. While Paul’s existence and survival would be impossible without them, especially his mother, at some point, everyone views the women with more suspicious than declared enemies. By the end of Part One, Jessica bears no resemblance to the woman having breakfast with her son in the opening. She is a fierce, driven, and focused person intent on her mission and survival. Even though the plot points may be intentional, sardonic takes on such tropes as the noble savage and the white savior, they simultaneously validate such tropes in the overt storyline. It is kind of like the think pieces on “Saturday Night Live” where a problematic political figure goes on the show and makes fun of themselves. Showing that you know something is problematic is not the same as not being a problem. “Dune” is not doing the same work as Bong Joon-Ho’s “Snowpiercer” (2013) or “Parasite” (2019) where he takes a storyline where the audience expects one well-trod turn of events then subverts it by obliterating all expectations because the narrative is inherently flawed and needs to be flipped. Narratives like “Dune” understand what is wrong but cannot imagine how to obliterate it or what being right would look like. The story’s structure is kind of like Paul. He is aggrieved that his mom and her fellowship are treating him and others like puppets, but he rather likes being center stage whether as a duke’s son or the Fremen’s champion. It is hard to give up benefits of something that works for you. It also unironically purveys in tropes like the evil albino. Evil albino in chief is Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whom Stellan Skarsgard plays and proves why he thrives in Lars von Trier films. He relishes being unrecognizable under mounds of practical effects and makeup. In gender bending casting, Sharon Duncan-Brewster plays Dr. Liet Kynes, a character with ambiguous allegiances, who gets an eleventh-hour trite backstory, but on the way to that moment, is mysterious and intriguing as Arrakis’ guardian. Javier Bardem plays Stilgar, a Fremen, and largely provides comedic relief. “Dune” is a stunning realization of a beloved sci-fi series, but I felt nothing. Jargon heavy and remote, Villeneuve’s proudest achievement feels like a step back in terms of being more than the equivalent of a purveyor of beautiful gowns. Once the occasion is over, it can be forgotten without any sense of lessons that can be extracted to preserve the heart and soul on harsh, realistic days of drudgery. Side note: loved Villeneuve’s allusion to famous paintings such as Casper David Friedrich’s “Wanderer above the Sea of Fog” or Jacques-Louis David’s “The Death of Marat.”"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"It would be enough of a cinematic experience with just the visuals, but the technical elements within the sound are award-worthy."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Approaching a monumental project like Dune has destroyed many great filmmakers. While David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation continues to grow a cult following, it’s far from well-regarded. Alejandro Jodorowsky never saw his depiction come to life, despite some wild and ambitious plans. Yet the choice to serialize and break the story into two parts helps Denis Villeneuve‘s Dune shine as a science fiction epic. Few movies showcase this scale, and once again, Villeneuve proves himself one of the best filmmakers alive. However, some early pacing issues and the two-part nature make Dune feel somewhat incomplete. Past the year 10,000, two rival families come to blows. The Harkonnens ruled Arrakis with an iron fist. The planet, home to the indigenous Freman, possesses large reserves of Spice. However, the Emperor of the Known Universe strips the Harkonnens of their rights to the planet. Worse, the stewardship of the planet passes to House Atreides – fierce rivals of House Harkonnen. The battle for control of Arrakis begins a deadly game, one that leaves Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) on a collision course with destiny.  Herbert’s Dune often received criticism for its depiction of colonialism and white savoir tropes. Unfortunately, these issues cannot be wholly corrected with the castings, but Villeneuve adds more nuance than most directors would. His version does not mix words and lays the track for the idea of propaganda working its way into religious sects.  Villeneuve’s depiction of the Bene Gesserit – a group of mystical women who serve as concubines and partners to the heads of houses – is perhaps the most alluring aspect of Dune. Ferguson’s performance as a woman with incredible power yet few resources makes for an impeccable performance. I personally pushed for Ferguson in the awards race, primarily based on her ability to craft an emotionally affecting performance, while still assisting the worldbuilding. While there are other performances that stand out, Ferguson remains the film’s MVP.  The largest issue facing Dune: Part One undeniably revolves around the table setting it must perform. By splitting the story into two halves, Villeneuve sets up an epic second half of the story. However, it also means that long sequences serve merely as exposition and world building. This is not always exciting cinematically, and simply repeating “desert power” does not further explain why the Fremon would be so valuable as allies.  One sequence, when Stilgar (Javier Bardem) meets Leto,  works wonderfully. Other moments become too repetitive, such as seeing Fremon near Paul refer to him as their mesiah across several scenes. Surprisingly this becomes an issue of “tell instead of show,” a rare moment for Villeneuve to overembrace dialogue. While Dune: Part One mostly avoids the pitfall, the scenes where it does not stick out like a sore thumb.  As Dune: Part Two  gets ready for release, it’s worth revisiting our introduction to Arrakis. While the first part feels like table setting, it succeeds because of its brilliant visuals. Villeneuve continues to build an impressive blockbuster resume and has become a master of sci-fi in the last decade. While Dune: Part One may only be the beginning, it’s a culmination of Villeneuve’s journay as a filmmaker and visionary. "
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE," I’ve always been interested in Dune, but attempts to get into the beefy novel in the past have failed and while I enjoyed the 80s cheese-fest adaptation it didn’t really feel like I’d experienced the all-time classic, so when this film came along and was said to be only half the book due to how accurate they aimed it to be I was excited, but also weary of potentially the second film not being made so put it in the back of my mind until Part Two was official… Then I sort of forgot about it, until now! So with Part Two about to hit cinemas, let’s take a look at the first half of the original Dune story, shall we? In the far flung future the planet Arrakis is among the most valuable as it’s the only planet in the known galaxy that produces a substance called “Spice” that allows interstellar travel. For many years the rich (and now super-wealthy due to owning the Spice trade) House Harkonnen have ruled over the planet but suddenly a call comes from the Emperor that they’re to leave as their rival house, House Atreides, are the new owners of the fiefdom. This is the general set up, that and on Arrakis there are native people known as the Fremen who have fought against the Harkonnen for decades. The focus soon narrows on our lead protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who is not only the son of Atreides leader Duke Leto Atriedes (Oscar Isaac) but also the son of Lady Jessica (Rebecca Freguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit, a cult of sorts that have the ability to influence and even command people by the use of their voice and despite the Gesserit being exclusively female Jessica has been teaching Paul in their ways. Paul has been having visions recently about Arrakis, more specifically a girl (played by Zendaya) and due to this is increasingly invested in his Dad’s plan of siding with the Fremen to create a large army to fight off the inevitable attack by the Harkonnen. As the Atreides get settled on Arrakis we find out that the Harkonnen leader, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) has made a deal with the Emperor to wipe out House Atreides and thanks to this not only does he have his own army, led by his nephew Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista) but also a couple of regiments of the Emperor’s guard to do the deed. After a scene where Leto and his son explore the local climate, which includes large spice mining craft that has to deal with a colossal sand worm that sees Paul nearly killed when he accidentally inhales some Spice in the air and has another vision, it becomes night and the attack begins. While Leto falls (though he does nearly kill Vladimir in his final moments) Paul and Jessica manage to escape thanks to the efforts of Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and the local ecologist and “Judge of the Change” Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) but end up having to travel the dangerous sands of Arrakis when they use their commanding voice to down the Harkonnen ship they were on. It goes without saying given the cast but the acting is top notch and thankfully the visuals match it, especially the deserty world of Arrakis itself (which is handy given the majority of the film takes place there!) plus the soundtrack is mesmerising and played just right. You could argue a slow pace across its two and a half hours, though to me that was perfect as it really did need everything to be set up and for you to care about these people before it comes crumbling down, and I’d understand annoyance if you went into the film not knowing this was a “Part One of Two” but I can only say that I really enjoyed my night in with the film and I’m frankly glad I waited this long because having to wait years for part two would’ve been a killer! Dune’s first half lived up to the hype as a mix of political intrigue, sci-fi storytelling and a large selection of really interesting characters, all with great visuals and sound design to match. The two and a half hours flew by and left me really looking forward to more, which is something very few films that length can claim. Roll on Part Two! As Paul and his mother survive a night on the sands the new Duke of Atreides has another Spice-induced vision, this time of himself and the mysterious girl starting something of a war across the known galaxy and deposing the Emperor as they watch the bodies pile up in their name, a vision that scares the boy and has him lash out at his mother for giving him these gifts. The two decide to cross the desert to find the Fremen, for assistance to get off-world in Jessica’s mind but for Paul it’s all about fulfilling his father’s dream of uniting them so he can get revenge on the Harkonnen and reclaim Arrakis. On the way they narrowly avoid being devoured by a massive Sand Worm in a great scene you saw in all the trailers."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE," 2021 is a year unlike any other, but also a year like every other year.  Yes, theaters reopened (kind of). Yes, cinema was saved by three young men in spider suits (kind of), And yet, living in an area not catered to by independent film, many of my best films of the year happened right at the end, which always makes context difficult. On top of that, there are films that, as of this posting, are not available to be seen (I’m looking at you, The Tragedy of Macbeth and The Worst Person in the World).  But I digress, as there were still great films to be seen in 2021.  Here are my Top 10 this year, minus some movies that I wish made my list. I solemnly swear that films like Copshop, No Time To Die, In The Heights and tick, tick…Boom! were on my Top 10 for most of the year.  Alas. Ridley Scott provided maybe the biggest surprise of the year. Not sure that there was a movie with worse press leading up to its release. A Rashomon-like story about a sexual assault? Directed by a man? Yikes.  And yet, it all works. Ben Affleck gave us one of my favorite characters of the year, and Jodie Comer is a Top 5 female performance for sure. Her subtle (and unsubtle) acting choices differentiating the three versions of the story take us on a serious journey, not only into the events, but her character’s psyche throughout. Plus, the titular duel absolutely lives up to the hype.  The brutality of the time is encapsulated perfectly in Ridley’s vision. This is one of the many late comers to my list, but Mass was worth the wait. Yes, it is stagey. It is basically in one location.  But the screenplay and simple camerawork draw you in and brings you into horrific pain. Looking away never feels like an option and that is due to four, near pitch-perfect performances. Picking a favorite seems trite as they all build on each other. But it was wonderful to see Jason Isaacs being given a chance to bite into a serious role again. He, along with all three “leads”, deserves both serious awards consideration and a chance to play these types of characters again. Welcome to the year of the musical! As a fan, I am here for it. I actually have three musicals in my Top 20, but this is the best of them. Yes, there is one gaping hole of charisma in a lead, but the other lead and supports make up for it. Ariana DeBose lives up to Rita Moreno, Rachel Zegler passed Sondheim’s test, and Mike Faist absolutely owns Riff. But still, the most important pieces are behind the camera. From the audacious opening shot to the decision to stage “America” off of a rooftop; Spielberg, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and a fabulous adaptation from Tony Kushner enable West Side Story to make all the right choices for a 2021 update. The first of three foreign language films may be the most difficult film on my list. Not too expected, given that it is adapted from a short story from Haruki Murukami short story. The film dares to truly take its time. Not every journey is worth three hours, but the performances of Hidetoshi Nishijima and Tôko Miura carry the film, even in moments of silence. Drive My Car will not be for everyone, but for those willing, your patience will be rewarded in the purest form of empathy available for cinephiles this year. Possibly the most beautiful, and near inscrutable film this year, is David Lowery’s epic, Arthurian tale. In a film world full of obvious explanations, The Green Knight provides precious few. Dev Patel proves once again, that you can use a diverse cast of phenomenal actors and it doesn’t make one bit of difference. He defies your sense of supposed believability and completely inhabits the character of Gawain. Patel exhibits sensuality, insecurity, and honor all in one beautiful two hour stretch. Lowery proves, once again, that he is a do everything filmmaker that, love him or hate him, has a singular vision worth watching. Look, let me get this out of the way.  I’m a fan of the book, and I was completely sure that no one could do this. But by god, Mr. Villenueve found a way. Part art film, part big budget science fiction, Dune really hit all the marks. There are even moments that surpass the novel, especially the relationship between Leto and Paul, mainly due to a heartfelt speech from Oscar Isaac. Stunning cinematography paired with a perfectly cast film (especially Jason Momoa, of all people) ends up with a truly rewarding big screen saga for the ages. Just give me Part 2 already! This was definitely the movie I looked forward to most this year. I mean it’s Paul Thomas Anderson, the man hasn’t made a bad movie yet. It’s weird to find a movie underwhelming at number four, but I firmly expected this to be my favorite of the year. But it is still, obviously, fantastic. Most of the complaints about the film are wildly overblown, but it is a challenge. Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman shine, and it is especially lovely to see normal looking people in major film roles. Licorice Pizza also provides maybe the most fun low speed vehicle chase in film history. It is a grand, fun, romantic ride, that I guess will provide even more greatness on rewatch. Much has already been said about Jane Campion’s western masterpiece, and for good reason. It is indeed truly great. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a career best performance, American accent and all. His switch from terrifying monster to tough love mentor (and back again?) is truly one for the ages. Campion, in a change from previous work, zeroes in on toxic masculinity with a laser focus that is wildly uncomfortable to watch. The Power of the Dog proves, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that you do not need pure good character to root for to make your movie not just watchable, but engrossing.  Yes, yes, the movie where she has sex with a car.  It’s real and it is phenomenal. I did not think that I could be more impressed with Julia Ducournau after Raw, but this is somehow even better. Her lack of concern with being accepted or understood by mainstream audiences is infectious. Titane plays with gender, parental relationships, and sexuality in equal measure. It is a near impossible film to describe or recommend, but here I am doing both. If you actually want to be pushed as a film viewer, Ducournau is the director you should be watching. She managed to make a movie weirder after making a film about cannibalism. Some of the most stunning imagery of the year wrapped in a film that sticks with you for months. Ugly and beautiful. Pedro Almodóvar and Penélope Cruz are obviously a match made in cinephile heaven. It seems like no one gets her skill set quite like Pedro. Parallel Mothers is a rare movie, one that completely subverts expectations just with the final scene. It feels like melodrama, surrounded by political moments that will be forgotten. But have faith, it all comes together with a perfection that is unnerving. The final shot colors the journey we have been on in a way that will haunt you, as long as you are paying attention. Not only am I sure that it will become even better on rewatch, but it has actually gained in my esteem, the more I think about it. This is Almodóvar at his most political and romantic, an absolute treat for all of the senses. "

"Aug 10, 2023",POSITIVE," BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — One new version of an old story that works while another one that fails are among this week’s new entertainment options. “Dune” 3 ½ stars: Director Denis Villeneuve faced a major challenge in creating “Dune,” an epic science fiction production based on the classic 1965 Frank Herbert novel of the same name. Herbert’s writing is so rich and complicated that past efforts to adapt the book have either failed to happen or in the case of the 1984 film from director David Lynch, could not live up to the power and grandeur of the original writing. Villeneuve (“Blade Runner 2049”) has succeeded where others have failed by showing a deep respect for the novel but also being equally aware that the very essence of the production is that it must be entertaining. His “Dune” is a visually stunning tale of greed, power, hope and love that finds sharp contrasts in a monochromatic environment. Telling the tale in a proper way is complicated by the futuristic world that Herbert created as the setting for his story. Unlike the picturesque beauty of the “Lord of the Rings” setting or the intergalactic backdrop of the “Star Wars” franchise, “Dune” unfolds in a world almost void of color. Despite the harshness of the location, Villeneuve has created a film that embraces what should be dismissed as visually bland and shows how beauty can be found in even the most subtle of differences. He got great help from two-time Oscar-nominated production designer Patrice Vermette, two-time Oscar-nominated editor Joe Walker, two-time Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer in creating the stunning visuals in the film. “Halloween Kills” Grade ½ star: The film picks up moments after babysitter-turned-vigilant Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) have “killed” Myers in the 2018 film “Halloween.” They have left him caged in Laurie’s basement that has been set on fire. Of course Myers doesn’t die and sets off on a killing spree where the deaths range from grossly bloody to super silly. No one should ever have to die by having a car door hit the gun they are firing and accidentally shooting themselves. David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, Scott Teems – writers of “Halloween Kills” – try to pass off what is shorter than a fortune cookie message as a full movie script. The entire story is Michael Myers kills stupid people who chase him. The trio has taken the pathetic horror film trope of having the victims of the killer hopelessly running away until they can be slaughtered and turned it into everyone running toward the killer until they can be slaughtered. They were going to get killed anyway but the stupidity level of this movie will make your head hurt. “Cobra Kai III”: Series takes place more than 30 years after the events of the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament with the conflict between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). “Mass”: Two sets of parents (Reed Birney and Ann Dowd, Jason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton), agree to talk privately in an attempt to move forward years after an unspeakable tragedy tore their lives apart.

"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE," Initially scheduled to be released in 2020 and postponed many times due to the pandemic, Dune (2021) has been on everyone’s radar for over a year, and with good reason. Ever since the release of David Lynch’s 1984 misfire and an ambitious but flawed 2000 television miniseries, as well as the failed release of Jodorowsky’s promising adaptation, fans of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed novels have been waiting a long time for someone to bring Dune to the big screen while preserving the scale and scope of what continues to be one of the most beloved and influential sagas in sci-fi history.  And, with master storyteller Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) at the helm, a stellar cast, and a team of creatives of the likes of composer Hans Zimmer (Inception), director of photography Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty), production designer Patrice Vermette (Arrival, Sicario), editor Joe Walker (Blade Runner 2049), and Oscar-winning visual effects supervisors Paul Lambert (First Man) and Gerd Nefzer (Blade Runner 2049), it won’t come as a surprise that Dune is just as enthralling, epic and stunning as we hoped it would be. Though Villeneuve’s latest film isn’t, at times, entirely satisfying narratively speaking, it’s certainly the best adaptation of the novel to date, as well as a technically flawless, incredibly immersive experience whose impressive world-building requires you to watch it on the biggest screen possible. Set thousands of years in the future, Dune is a story that touches upon many themes and takes place in an interstellar society where different civilizations are fighting to gain control of “the most valuable substance in the universe” —  a rare and highly valued natural resource they call the Spice, which can influence anything from space travel to commerce, knowledge, and even human existence itself. But Dune‘s universe is as complex as it is full of planets, whose inhabitants come with different sets of motives and purposes: there’s the desert planet of Arrakis, where the Spice can be harvested, but that is made inhospitable by elements that vary from unbearable heat and frequent sandstorms to terrifying, deadly “sandworms” that tend to show up at the worst possible time. Living on Arrakis are an indigenous, spiritual human civilization called the Fremen, as well as many wealthy “oppressors” that take turns colonising it, sent by the emperor to harvest the Spice.  When Dune begins, an imperial decree has just made Duke Leto of the House of Atreides (Oscar Isaac, of the Star Wars franchise and The Card Counter), from planet Caladan, the new governor of Arrakis, and that causes friction with the previous residents of the planet, the Harkonnens, rivals of the Atreides. Led by Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, of Chernobyl and Mamma Mia!) and eager to regain control of the planet, the former colonisers start plotting to defeat Duke Leto and his family — the Duke’s concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, of Mission: Impossible – Fallout), who’s part of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient religious order of women with superhuman mental and physical abilities, and their son, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, of Call Me by Your Name and Little Women), who shares her mother’s powers and who also happens to be destined to save the universe and ensure the future of humanity.  Just like the book, the film begins with Duke Leto, Jessica and Paul embarking on a trip to Arrakis with swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, of Aquaman and Game of Thrones), and follows them on a journey where nothing and no one are quite what they seem. As the Atreides attempt to forge alliances and fight for their own survival, Paul tries to decode a series of visions that mainly involve a mysterious Fremen girl whom we’ll later come to know as Chani (Zendaya, of Malcolm & Marie and HBO’s Euphoria), and to master the “Voice,” the power of the Bene Gesserit, in the attempt to become the “mind powerful enough to breach space and time, past and future” that many believe to be coming to save the world. This brief introduction doesn’t even begin to describe the complexities of Dune‘s universe, a world made of a myriad of characters and exploring many themes, from religion and politics to environmental change, all while following a young man’s journey of discovery of his own identity, and a quest to fulfill his destiny that sees him battling against powerful, unknown forces. In fact, Dune‘s world is so intricate and full of characters, locations and unknown terminology that one of the issues with past adaptations of the novels was that the uninitiated struggled to understand the universe’s dynamics and rules: that was the case with David Lynch’s film, where the initial lack of explanations on the nature of the Sand and the characters’ role within the narrative made it hard for people who hadn’t read the novel to follow our hero’s quest.  But what’s really impressive about Dune (2021) is that it’s surprisingly easy to follow: co-writers Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) cleverly weave information into the narrative in a way that ensures we’re immediately able to grasp the essential facts we need to know about a world that never fails to be absorbing and intriguing, as there’s just as much mystery and action to keep us entertained throughout. In fact, it’s easy not to notice that Dune is nearly three hours long, as it’s so effortless to get drawn into an utterly fascinating world we can’t wait to explore, made all the more compelling by the film’s sound design and cinematography, as well as a series of memorable performances that will have your eyes glued to the screen. As a fan of the novels, it has been a lifelong dream of composer Hans Zimmer (Inception) to score a Dune adaptation, and, when the opportunity came along, he rose to the occasion by crafting an unforgettable, instantly iconic score that highly contributes to giving the film a more defined identity, as well as making it more immersive and affecting on an emotional level. Dark, ominous cues make the tension rise and the action become more urgent, while percussions draw us into the film’s mysteries; the use of certain notes often gives the film an otherworldly quality, and a feeling of suspension of time, while a chorus of female voices makes everything more solemn and mystical, reflecting the power of the film’s female characters.  And, if Dune‘s score and sound design give the movie more depth and meaning, it’s the film’s stunning world-building that gives us a world that you’ll instantly recognise if you’ve read the book, and that you’ll be immediately drawn to even if you haven’t. While the sci-fi components of the film, such as the suits worn by the Fremen, the sandstorm and a series of buildings, ships and props, are somewhat reminiscent of Arrival, the gorgeous, desaturated palette that defines Arrakis gives us plenty of meditative, quiet moments, while the mystical quality of Paul’s visions reflect his mental state, as well as the journey that’s ahead of him. Needless to say, Paul couldn’t have been played by anyone else but Timothée Chalamet, who inhabits the role with incredible confidence, showing us a character in constant evolution who does what he can to control the forces (and Voices) inside him without losing his own self, all while having to unexpectedly take on a new role that’s bigger than himself. If the film’s screenplay gives Paul plenty of epic, memorable lines, it’s Chalamet who brings his character to life by letting raw emotion through at exactly the right times, showing us a “lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground” who inevitably becomes the leader he was meant to be — which makes for highly rewarding, meaningful storytelling. Sharing many scenes together, Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson complement each other perfectly, and the chemistry between them is undeniable.  Ferguson excels at playing one of the most complex characters in the film, showing us a woman who’s constantly conflicted between her duties as a sorceress and as a mother, and giving us more than one goosebump-worthy scene while also conveying the wisdom of someone who’s seen and experienced a great deal during her lifetime. Chalamet and Ferguson are the film’s standouts, but every single cast member gives us incredibly committed performances that help give depth to their characters: Oscar Isaac moves us more than once as Duke Leto, one of the film’s most likeable characters, while Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) imbues enigmatic Fremen leader Stilgar with passion, gravity and raw power with facial expressions alone.  Zendaya‘s body acting draws us to her character even if she hardly ever speaks, Stellan Skarsgård never fails to terrify us as Baron Harkonnen, and Dave Bautista (the Guardians of the Galaxy films and Avengers: Endgame) and Josh Brolin (Milk and Avengers: Infinity War) are just as fearsome as Harkonnen’s nephew and war master. Among the supporting characters, the standout is Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Sex Education), who plays ecologist Liet-Kynes (who has been gender-swapped from the novels), one of Dune‘s most fascinating and intriguing characters, made unforgettable by the intensity with which Duncan-Brewster delivers her lines. When I left today’s screening of Dune at the Venice Film Festival, I was mesmerised by the craft on display, from the film’s achievements on a technical level to a series of highly believable, committed performances that, alone, make the film so very compelling and absorbing. Yet, I found that something was missing, and that something has to do with the film’s narrative. While it’s no secret that the director would like there to be a Part 2 to the film, it’s also hard not to notice that Dune would feel absolutely incomplete if it were to stand on its own, as not only does the entire film revolve around a conflict that isn’t resolved by the time it ends, but the ending itself feels like it should be a beginning, and it can be very frustrating to get invested in a story that ultimately leaves you with no answers and no real resolution. Only time will tell what Dune will turn out to be, as a final product, and whether or not it will be developed into something more than a standalone film: for now, we can enjoy watching an incredibly well-crafted adaptation that’s faithful to the source material while also breathing new life into it, and an immersive, epic cinematic journey that will absolutely leave you aching for more."
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE," The many media attempts at adapting Frank Herbert’s epic space fantasy Dune speak to its lasting appeal and its potent impact. David Lynch’s 1984 movie, defended by the filmmaker’s most ardent supporters but excoriated by a larger chorus disappointed in the heavy hand applied by House De Laurentiis, marked the end of a lengthy journey to the screen that defeated the likes of Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott along the way. Dreams of what might have been — Orson Welles as Baron Harkonnen! Moebius and H. R. Giger design! — gave way to the realities of any “faithful” adaptation. At its best, Herbert’s book presents a stunning vision of political power, ecological/environmental awareness, ruling-class genealogy, military conflict, thrilling mysticism and religious myth-making filtered through a messianic hero’s journey. At its weakest, Dune has too many scenes of people standing around and talking. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One is a worthy addition to the collection, besting the Lynch film in certain ways but still flummoxed and frustrated by the source material’s conversation-heavy downside. Villeneuve is clearly a fan, a Bene Gesserit-level adherent to the Weirding Way and a desert mouse who respects the Shai-Hulud. The director’s impressive track record with dazzling ideas and/or imagery in settings both smaller (Prisoners, Enemy) and grander (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) raised expectations higher than a Guild Navigator on uncut spice. In Dune, the filmmaker delivers at least 450 meters of world-building eye candy to remind everyone of Herbert’s far-reaching influence. Villeneuve juggles a huge cast filled with famous and should-be famous performers well-suited to flesh out their occasionally flat literary antecedents. Some great faces made up Lynch’s roster, including many favorites in the filmmaker’s stock company, and Villeneuve could not ask for more capable portrayers in nearly all the principal and supporting roles. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica and Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, despite sharing few one-on-one scenes, walk off with the movie. While Lynch’s screenplay diminished and truncated Jurgen Prochnow’s Leto, Villeneuve concentrates the time and attention required to both express the Shakespearean tragedy of the Red Duke and articulate the emotional connection between Leto and his son. Perhaps Jodorowsky was on to something when he argued for a 10 to 14-hour running time. If all goes according to plan, Dune: Part Two will remedy the insufficient, almost fleeting, presence of Zendaya’s Chani, Javier Bardem’s Stilgar and even Dave Bautista’s Beast Rabban. There’s no question that Villeneuve’s decision to divide the book leaves both newcomers and the Dune faithful with lots of questions and the empty feelings that go along with unfinished business. As many viewers have already noted, the second section should have been filmed at the same time and prepared for a 2022 release. Villeneuve’s  Dune  takes itself so seriously that plenty of observers have dipped their Gom Jabbar needles into poisoned inkwells. David Ehrlich’s vicious takedown at IndieWire is entertainingly arch, slightly cruel and not entirely fair. Peter Opaskar’s wild, tongue-in-cheek defense of Lynch’s version as the greatest film ever made — one of several recent reassessments of the 1984 movie — was posted at Arts Technica before the critic watched the new one. I am glad to live in a world where we already have two big screen interpretations and Frank Pavitch’s fantastic documentary. If we don’t destroy ourselves, there will surely be enough Dune by the year 10,191 to please everybody.

"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE," Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival) and featuring a killer cast including Timothee Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name), Rebecca Ferguson (The Greatest Showman) and Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Force Awakens), the sci-fi blockbuster of the year is finally here. Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a young man born into a great destiny, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his people. As the planet falls into huge conflict over the spice, the most precious resource in existence, Paul and his family must conquer their fear to survive. Having a cast this star-studded definitely paid off, every performance managing to deliver. Rebecca Ferguson was a stand-out as Lady Jessica, the Mother of Paul Atreides who is competent in using 'the voice', a skill enabling her to manipulate speech to take complete control over others. Jason Momoa (Aquaman) also impressed as Duncan Idaho, a great fighter and commander who does his best to protect his people. Josh Brolin (Avengers: Endgame) brings humour and heart to the movie with his character Gurney Halleck. Timothee Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides was fantastic, proving he can lead a movie with ease. Paul is a very troubled character who battles with who he wants to be and who he is expected to be, Chalamet managing to perfectly capture every emotion. With a cast this big and a story this dense, many actors unfortunately did not receive enough screen-time for us to root for their character and learn enough about them. Oscar Isaac was under-utilised even though he was in a leading role and gave a great performance, Stellan Skarsgard could've been a much more menacing villain if given more time to shine, and fan favourite Zendaya (Euphoria) mostly only appears in dream sequences with few lines delivered. Already proving himself in the sci-fi department with previous accolades Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Denis Villeneuve was clearly the man for the job. His direction is phenomenal, which is apparent in every element from the acting performances to the visuals. Dune is a sight to behold, featuring some of the most gorgeous cinematography of the year as we venture to the planet Arrakis. Every shot appears to be meticulously crafted, focusing in on the characters as the vast landscapes fill the background.  Hans Zimmer impresses yet again with a heart-pounding original score, pairing well with the cinematography to create an immersive experience. As epic as the score was, it unfortunately took precedence over the dialogue at times, especially during act 2 when a lot of whispering is used. It can sometimes feel difficult to hear line delivery from the likes of Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson, which hinders enjoyment as its a huge world being crafted with lots of exposition. It definitely demands a rewatch in that respect. It's important to remember before heading in to see Dune that this is only half a story; those familiar with Frank Herbert's novels will already be aware of the scope of the source material, and the title claims its only Part 1 when the play button is pushed. On one hand, the story feels slightly incomplete, as the movie features a lot of exposition and world building, feeling more like set-up than a complete story. On the other hand, this is hopefully only the beginning of what Dune could be, with a lot coming up to look forward to. Villeneuve does well to include a healthy amount of both character development and world building, with action-packed scenes aplenty to balance out the heavy exposition. Thankfully, Dune shows rather than tells, allowing the audience to think for themselves and piece it all together. It does its best to avoid confusion, and if Part 2 hopefully comes to fruition, it could be even bigger and better. Dune is a masterful sci-fi blockbuster that is going to please the majority of its audience. The visuals are crying out to be seen on the biggest screen possible, easily becoming the movies standout. Every performance delivers, Zimmers score is impeccable, the characters are likeable and the action scenes are well choreographed and entertaining. Unfortunately, its difficult to give Dune full marks as at times it felt like it didn't truly get going, and we needed much more development as certain talents were underutilised. That being said, Villeneuve did his best to include vital information to ensure the audience understood the complex story, and has set up a delectable world that can only get more exciting from here. It is a movie that is likely preferred after a couple of rewatches, an activity that fans and critics alike have not found a chore to undertake."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE, A true cinematic treasure that will be cherished for decades to come &amp; gave me the same feeling that I got watching A New Hope for the first time&#46; This is Epic to the highest of standards &amp; I need more right now&#46;
"Jul 26, 2023",NEGATIVE," The 2022 science fiction epic, Dune, was a passion project embarked on by French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. Villeneuve foreshadowed his ability to deliver breathtaking images as far back as 2013 with his excellent yet underseen thriller, Enemy, which features a gargantuan spider towering above the skyscrapers of Toronto. Dune takes place over eight thousand years from now when humanity, under the auspices of a feudalistic empire, has colonized various planets. In a veiled reference to colonialism and Middle Eastern oil, the most important planet politically and economically is the inhospitable desert world of Arrakis, informally referred to as Dune, and the only place in the cosmos where “spice,” a substance necessary for interstellar travel, can be found. Timothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of the Duke of House Atreides, played by Oscar Isaac, and Lady Jessica Atreides, portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson. Paul accompanies his parents to Arrakis after his father accepts the emperor’s request to restore stable spice production, even though House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and sworn enemies of the Atreides, have other plans. Apropos of Joseph Campbell’s mythology of the chosen one, Paul might be the messiah prophesized by the desert dwellers who have lived on Arrakis for thousands of years. Villeneuve has taken Frank Herbert’s classic novel and crafted a film that strains under the weight of his obvious reverence for the material; there is a Shakespearean gravitas to Herbert’s writing, but the ponderous sense of self-importance that permeates Dune is reminiscent of George Lucas’s Star Wars prequels. The only attempts at anything resembling lightheartedness are two lame jokes that land with a thud near the very start of the film, both of which are shown in the trailer. Visually, Dune is unquestionably awe-inspiring, as evidenced by its sweep of technical awards at last year’s Oscars. But the special effects dwarf human interactions, as evidenced by Dune’s total shutout from every acting category. As with superhero movies, the talented cast is in service of spectacle, doing little more than providing the expositional sutures that connect one elaborate set piece to the next. When the virtual camera does pull away from massive CGI spacecraft, sandworms, and desert battles, Villeneuve’s direction struggles to create memorable performances. Timothée Chalemet delivers most of his lines as if he’s battling lockjaw; macho warriors played by Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa are stereotypical characters that could have just as easily been inhabited by Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson; and Oscar Isaac is uncharacteristically one-note as Paul’s father, wearing his stoicism like The Shroud of Turin. The rare exceptions include Rebecca Ferguson as Paul’s fiercely protective mother – she gets to flex her thespian muscles the most – and Charlotte Rampling, who dominates the screen as the venomous Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood of witches. However, if you’re a fan of impressive world building and special effects done on a spectacular scale, Dune definitely delivers the goods. To paraphrase Roger Ebert’s advice following the home video release of an earlier desert-based epic, Lawrence of Arabia, you could watch Dune on your TV and enjoy some of its majesty, but to experience it properly, it needs to be seen on the largest screen possible. Dune: Part Two is scheduled to premiere in November, so those regretting having missed out on the first chapter’s original theatrical release will be able to catch up with it on its inevitable re-release. Ever since he was a teen, Paul has been involved in some form of film criticism, exhibition, or production. For the better part of two decades, he moderated the film discussion group, Let’s Talk About the Movies, which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic Del Mar theater in downtown Santa Cruz. In 2023, Paul's insightful KSQD movie reviews earned him Tomatometer-Approved Critic status on Rotten Tomatoes (https://rottentomatoes.com/critic/paul-kanieski)."
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," Synopsis: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet's exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence, only those who can conquer their own fear will survive. It's no secret that Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite filmmakers. Ever since Incendies, all of his films received my highest rating, except Enemy, which I still love tremendously. Therefore, it was impossible to set low expectations for an adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, one of the most prominent sci-fi novels of all-time. The first and only translation to the big screen was in charge of David Lynch back in 1984, becoming one of the most impactful movies of the respective decade to receive a cult following, despite the well-known production problems that resulted in a divisive flick. I intended to rewatch Lynch's version a few days before Villeneuve's take, but due to recommendations from fellow colleagues, I stepped back in order to try and feel the immense scale of Dune - both technically and narratively - as if it was my very first visit to this vast universe. With a screenplay written by Jon Spaihts (Passengers), Villeneuve himself, and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born), plus the ensemble cast stacked with stars who could lead any blockbuster, I entered the glorious IMAX theater, and I left… completely and utterly stunned. Fortunately, for good reasons. Despite the overwhelming hype from over-the-top early reactions - journalists craved for that pull-quote harder than with any other film this year - I tried my best to not let the global positive feedback impact my expectations too much. After all, ""this is only the beginning"". At the time of this review, the second and supposedly last part isn't yet officially confirmed, but it's a matter of time for it to be certain. But let me focus on this first chapter because it has a lot to explore and discuss. And I mean, a LOT. The lengthy runtime and deliberately slow pacing don't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Villeneuve's filmography. With Dune, his filmmaking traits fit like a glove. The lingering camera helps the viewers feel every story beat, almost as if the audience is watching a documentary and following the events in real-time. I'll get to each cast member later, but obviously, it's tough not to feel engaged in almost every scene when so many talented actors are around. One of the most challenging tasks about adapting Dune is its world-building. Heavy exposition is somewhat inevitable, but Villeneuve is able to balance the different voice-overs - spoken in different, distinct languages - in seamless fashion. The riveting opening sequence with Zendaya's (Malcolm & Marie) narration quickly establishes an intriguing premise to an extremely complex, layered story that tackles numerous topics spread across Houses Atreides and Harkonnen, as well as the Imperial House and the Fremen - guardians of the Arrakis deserts.  Thematically, Dune is one of the richest sci-fi/fantasy narratives ever. Probably, the most political saga of the genre. The constant backstabbing between the distinct houses - Atreides has loyalty and mercy as their banners, while Harkonnen is based on power and brutality - gives rise to discussions about economic growth, limited resources, climate issues, war, wealth, space travel, and so much more. Villeneuve succeeds in taking a brutally intricate story and making the long runtime worth the viewers' investment. Practically every scene with or without dialogue gets its respective payoff throughout the movie. Nothing is shown on screen without a purpose. Even the several shots highlighting the spaceships taking off or landing add to the tension of those moments, aided by Hans Zimmer's powerful score and Theo Green's impressive sound design. I'll take this last sentence as a transition to write about the award-worthy technical aspects because if there's something certain about this year's Oscars and similar shows is that this film will receive dozens of nominations. Technically, Dune should be the new definition of ""epic"" in the dictionary. Nowadays, blockbusters ""look great"" regularly, but this new adaptation of the famous novel is simply a completely different beast altogether, just like Blade Runner 2049 was in 2017. From the eyegasmic visuals to the heart-pounding score, every single audiovisual element is meant to be witnessed in the biggest theater on the planet. An exceptionally immersive cinematic experience that will please the eyes and ears of every moviegoer.  The sound and production design surround Dune within a massive scope, a truly colossal, outrageously big film. Of all the hyperboles that people have been (over)using to describe it, I accept with all my heart the ones related to the gargantuan scale of this beautiful piece of cinema. The shot selection is on-point throughout the entire movie. DP Greig Fraser (Rogue One) delivers wide shots worthy of belonging in a museum. Every frame is dripping with visual quality, but the lack of a broader color palette is definitely a personal nitpick in an otherwise technically perfect flick. The character work is remarkable, to say the least. With such a jammed cast, the writers develop each character through interesting dialogues and gripping action/war sequences. The viewers will have no issues differentiating each character and associating them with their respective House and role there. Honestly, to be able to balance and encompass so many people and storylines successfully is a monumental task, even with the extended runtime. The acting is phenomenal across the board. Timothée Chalamet (Little Women) proves his haters wrong by compellingly leading a huge blockbuster filled with renowned stars. As Paul Atreides, Chalamet shows a much more serious side of him, and Villeneuve's style allows the actor's expressions to remain on screen enough time to show the viewers what his character is genuinely feeling and thinking. However, my personal standout has to be Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep) as Lady Jessica.  The actress offers the best performance of the entire cast, demonstrating her outstanding emotional range. An incredibly passionate interpretation of the second most important character of the film, who adds a mysterious layer to the already tense atmosphere. I won't go through the whole cast, but I still have to mention Stellan Skarsgård (Chernobyl) as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen - steals every scene he's in with a fiercely menacing display. Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Josh Brolin (Avengers: Endgame), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), and Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Sex Education) also deserve much praise. Zendaya and Javier Bardem (Mother!) are barely in the movie, which could disappoint a few audience members. If the viewers aren't familiarized with the original novel or the 1984's film, Zendaya's continuous presence in the press tour and marketing campaign will feel like false advertising for this movie, even though her character undoubtedly possesses a significant role in the sequel. The actors are great as expected, but their short appearances - mainly the actress' - are connected to my major issue with the film. ""Dreams are messages from the deep"". That's the first piece of voice-over heard in Dune. Paul has countless dream sequences vital to better understand his arc, as well as the overall plot. However, both the moments where these are inserted and their quantity hurt the already steady pacing. Dune is indeed a slow-burn, but despite knowing it's only half of a gigantic movie, I still believe this part could have gone even further. I'd gladly watch thirty extra minutes to get a bit more of the Fremen's arc, but the unnecessarily repetitive dreams drag the narrative too much for my taste. The more I think about Dune, the more I love it. In fact, there are many more memorable scenes than I ever anticipated. I vividly remember dozens of sequences, whether these are the energetic, explosive action/war scenes - impossible to imagine Dune out of the Best VFX category - or the highly engaging dialogues, such as one with Paul and a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. Game of Thrones fans will find some political similarities that might help them enjoy this saga even more. In fact, comparisons with two other popular franchises have to be made. From a filmmaking perspective, some shots resemble The Lord of the Rings' depiction of its famous kingdoms. The first time Arrakis is seen by the audience is quite similar to when Gandalf visits Gondor. In addition to this, Villeneuve truly cuts this first part in half in the sense that it feels like this film doesn't have a proper third act. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there's still a conventional climax and some sort of final build-up to let the audience know the movie is about to end. On the other hand, Dune ends somewhat abruptly, as if someone came in and stopped the projector midway through the film. Nevertheless, from an audiovisual standpoint, Dune has much more in common with Star Wars. From the enormous spaceships to the actual space travel and various planets, it's challenging not to find several resemblances. Bear in mind that sharing common elements doesn't mean a particular franchise is as good or better than the other, far from that - in that regard, don't forget Dune was around way before SW. Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story surrounded by an absolutely massive scale. Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography, despite some narrative-pacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences. Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out in a stellar cast, where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive. From the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions, without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting action/war scenes, the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen, where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie. Finally, don't forget that epic sci-fi/fantasy films are quite rare, so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out, instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas. There's enough space to love them all."
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE," Unpopular opinion: Denis Villeneuve’s blockbusters are his weaker movies. Don’t get me wrong, the French-Canadian director earned his place in Hollywood to make such big-budgeted epic science fiction like Dune. But that doesn’t change that his most impressive and enthralling films are the ones he made on a lower budget. Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario — they all have a distinctive style and an emotional depth that brought well-deserved attention to Villeneuve. Those features lifted him up as one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary cinema. His first, widely celebrated and praised, sci-fi, Arrival, was carefully balanced — being a meditation on grief and a thrilling blockbuster. Yet its most captivating quality was the emotional turbulence. It’s a fascinating and heartbreaking picture that stays with you for a long time after the credits roll. Blade Runner 2049 had an immense amount of obstacles to face. Although the director couldn’t tackle all of them, making the movie happen was an achievement in itself. He paid a price — the sequel wasn’t the financial triumph the studio hoped for, and it was nowhere near as complex as his previous works — but BR2049 was undoubtedly his child. He came through and delivered a clear and stellar vision. And finally, we arrived at Dune — which might prove to be an even greater challenge than anything he’s ever done before. Despite the pandemic and its repercussions on cinema and filmmaking, Villeneuve pulled off Part One. So, credit where it’s due, he deserves the merit. Before you start typing a comment to threaten me with decapitation, let me come clean: I went in watching it as a total Dune-virgin. I’ve never read the books or seen Lynch’s failed adaptation and Frank Pavich’s documentary, Jodorowsky’s Dune."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Villeneuve can build spectacle and innovative tales because we have seen him do it before, but his rendition of Dune isn’t one of them."
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE," I’ve watched more movies in 2021 than I have any other year, and I couldn’t be more excited to explore all the different varieties that I was able to discover. Because of the large amount that I saw relative to years previous, I felt like this year I was really able to define my taste in what I enjoyed and why I liked certain pieces of media. It became more clear to me what makes a movie objectively “good”, and what makes it enjoyable for me to watch, and I’m so excited that I’m able to share my list this year of my top 10 favorite movies from 2021. Only making a small splash at the box office, The Eyes of Tammy Faye moved me incredibly because of Jessica Chastain’s transformative performance, and the powerful commentary about religion, capitalism, and greed. Chastain as Tammy Faye portrays a morally grey character as someone filled with so much brightness and joy and genuinely believes what she’s doing is good, contrasted with what we, the audience, know are disgustingly selfish and offensive acts. Chastain delivers such a powerhouse performance that’s grounded and emotional while staying campy and entertaining to watch. In most senses, I actually hate this movie. Watching Danielle (Rachel Sonnett) interact with her family is almost unbearable to see. They push her around (literally), pull her arms, talk about her weight, criticize her eating, question her career choices, and pressure her into a myriad of uncomfortable situations. Set at a shiva in a tiny house, the amount of people surrounding her and desperate for any escape is suffocating. It reminds me so much about how I often feel when I go to my own family functions (and reminds me why I avoid my family), which is why it’s so amazing. It’s incredibly relatable, and it’s comforting to see that maybe I’m not the only person who dreads going to family functions. As a former theatre person, this film hits all the right points exactly as it needs to. I ended up quitting theatre (ironically after I had already received my degree in it) because of how difficult it was to sustain a real career in it. Andrew Garfield is able to teeter the line of the struggles of being a creative without ever stepping into the cliche of the tortured artist. As Lin-Manuel Miranda’s directorial debut, he wisely frames the story as semi-biographical. The framing device is able to enhance and benefit the story by putting songs side by side to the events they’re depicting in both comedic and dramatic senses, and it centers on the heart of the musical, Jonathan Larson. I’m a huge fan of animation. I often find it frustrating when the medium is only regulated to children’s content, so it’s always refreshing when there’s a piece that uses it in a creative and artistic sense to tell mature stories. I couldn’t be more excited when I heard about Flee, which combined the medium with the documentary genre, making an incredibly rare and beautiful film. I was drawn to the material of the documentary as well, about a gay refugee recounting his experience fleeing his home country. I have the privilege of living in a country where I’m not persecuted for my sexuality, and I believe it’s important to learn more about those who do not and try to better understand their experience. It was incredibly moving and heartbreaking, and the animation made the documentary aspect of the film come to life, compared to feeling as if it was merely an interview. Adam McKay is an incredibly divisive filmmaker, but I usually fall on the side of loving his work. I was a fan of the political commentary that Vice was making, and I thought the satire and comedy created an absurd and fun watch. I was looking forward to Don’t Look Up because of the cast, and the general vague plot description. A lot of criticism has been thrown towards this film for being too obvious, but I thought the point McKay was trying to make was incredibly effective, and it was nice to see the craziness of the world we’re living in portrayed as how it actually feels to live in it; often frustrating but usually ridiculous at how oblivious and indifferent most people are. I could continue watching this film over and over again, and I find it hilarious every single time. The emotional premise combined with the incredibly poignant and relevant political commentary of the film is great enough, but it’s the performances that really elevate this film. Originally written to be a one act play, the film forces the characters into one room for a brutal conversation for its hour and a half runtime. All four members of the ensemble cast are stellar in their roles and the performances they deliver, with each one having at least one moment that will prove to you how incredible they all are. Ann Dowd and Martha Plimpton are definitely the stars of this film, and I can’t remember the last time I cried so many times in such a short time span. Underrated and, in my opinion, an underseen movie, Nine Days is a sort of philosophical sci-fi that asks the questions of what happens to us BEFORE we are born. So many pieces of media speculate what happens to us after we die, so it was unique to see something from the opposite perspective. Ironically, without even showing any of the characters living their life, it really shows us what the meaning of life is, and how to find purpose and joy where there might not always be any. The outlook on life from the different character’s perspectives sets up great dynamics and conversations to sort through and try to find yourself in when you’re agreeing or disagreeing. It’s a moving piece that shows us how we can either live as if life is meaningless, or we can find joy wherever it may be, and I think that’s incredibly powerful. I’ll be honest, this year was the first time I ever ventured into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have steered clear of the MCU mostly because I felt there wasn’t much to them; they were just big budget films made to appeal to the widest audience and make the most money without any sort of artistic purpose. I watched WandaVision when  it premiered this winter because of the great reception it was getting, and I fell in love with both of the main characters, but especially with the nuanced portrayal of Wanda’s grief and PTSD. By July, I watched Iron Man for the first time and slowly made my way through the MCU, trying to hit certain benchmarks before each film came out. In some ways, I still feel the same way I do about the MCU. Most of the films from the franchise are good enough, but nothing amazing. They’re all entertaining, but I don’t always feel like they have much depth to them. Spider-Man: No Way Home completely moved me by the amount of heart that was put into the final installment of the trilogy by its entire cast, and the desire to please fans who cared not only about the MCU, but the character Spider-Man, in particular. It also expands on the character and the universe it’s in, without getting too complicated and sticking true to the formula that works best for these films. Was it anything amazing? Not by any means. Did it open my eyes as to why so many people love these movies? In a sense. It was my first “huge” marvel theatrical experience (as Shang-Chi didn’t quite sell out, and Eternals was a critical flop). What this movie did was remind me why I love movies, even in their simplicity, and I can’t trade that experience for anything else. Is this the best thing Pixar has ever made? I don’t think so, not nearly by a long shot. However, this movie means more to me than many other animated pictures ever could. While it’s not explicitly gay, the narrative behind Luca and its two main characters, Luca and Alberto, are incredibly gay coded. Disney/Pixar is still hesitant to label and create a gay story, especially one with kids involved. I want to say as a gay kid this would have been so important to me, but honestly, I never really knew I was gay until I was a teenager. As kids, we’re raised that straight is the norm, until proven otherwise. That’s why as a gay adult this means so much more to me. It’s beautiful seeing two kids just be authentically themselves and have fun with each other, in the cute way that kids would have crushes on each other. I can see all the criticisms that others might have with this film, but to me it holds such a special place in my heart. As my most anticipated film of 2021, Dune would have had to be very bad to make me not like it. I was much too young when The Lord of the Rings came out, and this feels like the first large scale and giant spectacle work since then. Laced with complex politics, interesting themes on religion, gender, imperialism, and environmentalism; this has just about everything a fantasy/sci-fi fan could want. Its world building is so intricate and detailed, between the plot and the action sequences, it’s easy to stay entertained through it’s two and a half hour runtime. While some criticized it because  it doesn’t feel complete as it only covers half of the book, I personally felt satisfied, and the ending only made me more excited for the upcoming part two."
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE," Groundbreaking Oscar-nominated director, Denis Villeneuve, has returned with Dune, the story of Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto who embarks on a harrowing journey to the most dangerous planet in the universe to preserve the legacy of his family and people. At the core of this intergalactic power struggle is spice which has become the most important commodity in the universe. Based on Frank Herbert’s bestselling novel of the same name, it is a coming of age story for the king-in-waiting who is forced to put his training in combat and his special gifts to the test on this death defying mission. The film explores a variety of themes including facing and overcoming ones fears. We also see different relationship dynamics play out on screen as Paul learns who he can trust; most importantly learning to trust himself. Chalamet shines in the lead role as he portrays the wise beyond his years Duke, while still revealing his youth, zeal and inexperience. Rebecca Ferguson (“Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”) delivers an equally believable performance as Lady Jessica, his mother and concubine to the Duke who not only gave him his unique powers, but is forced to train him in how to use them (think Obi Wan Kenobi and a young Luke Skywalker). As he learns to trust himself, she in turn must learn to trust her son as he grows into the man and leader he was destined to be. Also appearing in the film is Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”) who sometimes draws criticism for playing the same character in all of his roles. While Momoa plays the predictable role of the muscle-bound warrior and swordmaster, Duncan Idaho, in service of the House of Atreides, he breaks the mold slightly by revealing deep love, affection and loyalty to Paul. Meanwhile, Oscar Isaac (the “Star Wars” franchise) is the wise and almost fearless Duke Leto Atreides. As one of the few characters in the film who isn’t some sort of alien being or doesn’t have a special power, he not only provides a human touch to the film and a connection point for audiences, but he impresses as he is able to rule and garner respect and loyalty simply off the strength of his character. Rounding out the cast are Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), who in limited screen time continues to show depth and maturity as she evolves from a child Disney star, as well as Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), and Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”). Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is simply epic in every sense of the word, from the acting and action sequences, to the score from Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. The grandeur of the film is accentuated by captivating shots and landscapes, including large and arid sand dunes, that not only create a sense of desperation but leave you feeling amazed at the beauty and expansiveness of the world they live in. Between the shots, action and visual effects, viewers may have trouble deciding where to look on the screen. While the film is said to be true to the original novel, viewers will be able to enjoy it without having read the novel or watched the original 1984 adaptation of the film. If you like the Star Wars franchise you will definitely enjoy Warner Bros’ and Legendary Pictures’ Dune."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE," When the theatrical and HBO Max release of Denis Villeneuve's new sci-fi epic Dune were still three months away, a handful of Imax theaters across the US hosted a special two-day Dune event. The presentation revealed the first 10 minutes of the film, as well as 15 minutes of related materials and the movie's trailer.  I attended the event. Here's what you need to know to prepare yourself for the film, which arrives in theaters and on HBO Max Thursday, Oct. 21.  SPOILERS AHEAD: From this point on it will be difficult to talk about the experience without spoiling the film, so if you don't want any details ruined, please stop now.  The Dune universe is a lot. The scale of everything is ridiculous, its rules more than a little weird, and you could probably spend the time it would take to see this film in its entirety breaking down the galactic politics leading up to the opening scene. But instead of holding your hand through all of author Frank Herbert's backstory, this film just drops you in the middle of everything. You get a brief explanation from Chani, played by Zendaya, about why the planet Arrakis is important, how ruthless the Harkonnen family are and that suddenly they left. There's a question about who the new oppressors of Arrakis natives the Fremen will be, then immediately you're taken to the bedroom of royal scion Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, and his story starts.  As a fan of the Dune universe, I loved this. No hand-holding, no background, just 60 seconds of introduction and off we go. I wouldn't go so far as to say it felt like the introduction you get in the book, but the feeling of being dropped into something that feels impossibly big is familiar.  I'm grouping all of the different special abilities you see in the Dune universe as powers for the purpose of making this point. Across all the scenes included in this preview we get to see Paul using his Voice on his mother Lady Jessica and master of assassins Thufir Hawat wield his Mentat ability, and there's a one-on-one fight with personal shields on. Spectacularly, none of these things looked or felt the way I'd imagined they might. In each case, what I saw on screen was even more impressive.  The unique audio choices that represent the Voice, the way Thufir's eyes instantly go white as he processes information and the skin-close shimmer of a personal shield all made me so excited to see more of each.  This was a fascinating detail from the conversation between Villeneuve and Hans Zimmer. The legendary composer said it was weird epic space films are always scored with music that sounds decidedly Earthly, so he sought to find new sounds to help demonstrate how alien these planets truly are. He didn't specify just how he invented these new sounds, but in the example scenes, he certainly nails a strangeness in the score.  Zimmer also relies on singing, especially when someone from the Bene Gesserit nuns is on screen. The higher-pitched chanting or soft-spoken women singing in the background immediately bring a feeling of power and terror to their scenes, which is appropriate given everything they're capable of.  I've seen many iterations of the Dune vehicles across TV, film and video games, and I've never felt like any of them fit the descriptions in the books. I'm not sure the vehicles in this new Dune movie match what's in my mind's eye either, but they're undeniably the coolest versions I've seen so far.  The Ornithopters in Villeneuve's Dune are more dragonfly than bird in design, but they do a great job moving more like the animal than a ship, which was the point in the books. These small crew ships were always supposed to fly more naturally than mechanically.  The Carryalls are often described as ""like an Ornithopter but bigger,"" but that isn't what you'll see in this film. They don't look bad at all, but they don't look like bigger versions of the main vehicle.  Spice Harvesters feel truly massive in this film. The sheer size of them, even as one is fully consumed by a giant sandworm, is incredible. Finally, the Spacing Guild Heighliner no longer looks like a space ship, and that's great. The scale of these vessels were often lost in previous films and shows, but this version helps show how insanely big they are.  There's been a lot of conversation about whether the Fremen eyes were enough. In the past, their eyes have always been presented on screen as glowing, piercing, electric blue. While that looks great, I never felt like it did justice to the way the eyes are described in the books. In fact, the Eyes of Ibad are described as being blue within blue, with no white at all. I think this is more realistically presented in this film. It feels more plausible that the blue would be intense but not unnatural. "
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dune is a true masterpiece. I can’t wait to see how this duology ends, and if Denis Villeneuve sticks the landing, this may be the best science fiction movie of all time. "
"Nov 28, 2022",NEGATIVE," Two of this year’s high-profile Venice premieres, Dune and The Card Counter, are auteurist works recognizable by multiple of their makers’ signatures. Both star Oscar Isaac and arrive as pandemic-affected productions that (try to) bear no trace of that circumstance. Dune finished principal photography before COVID-19’s global spread, while The Card Counter was 3/4 of the way through production when it hit; Isaac completed its rescheduled remainder before flying to Hungary for Dune reshoots. Optimistically subtitled Part I (this covers the first of the novel’s three volumes)*, Dune arrives with the unplanned burden of attempting to make the case for the Big Screen Experience—Denis Villeneuve’s been very publicly unhappy with the pandemic initiative of a simultaneous theatrical/HBO release. The film’s first act, however, is regrettably anti-persuasive on the theatrical viewing front: widescreen, shallow-focus close-ups of people talking through expository set-up. Frank Herbert’s source novel has infamously defeated previous adaptation attempts thanks to the challenges of compressing a mythology that’s surprisingly complicated given how simple it is on a fundamental level—two families warring for control over the same territory, whose indigenous inhabitants resist both. The draw is spectacle, yet it takes a long, dull time to get there. Timothée Chalamet is Paul Atraiades, next in line to maintain his family’s colonialist practices by harvesting “spice” from planet Arrakis and reluctant to assume the enterprise. Chalamet occasionally shows off plausible swordfighting skills during the first 40 minutes—prone to joyously, seemingly unselfconsciously gamboling and weaving through most roles, here the admirably physical actor channels all that energy into this one action movie direction. Otherwise, he’s as weighed down by humorlessly functional dialogue as the rest of the cast, easier to identify by archetypal role than their sometimes complicated names. Mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is loving but fearful for Paul amidst palace intrigues, father Leto (Isaac) similarly caring but politically reactionary; weapons trainer Gurney (Josh Brolin) is seemingly hostile but deeply loyal, his counterpart Duncan (Jason Momoa) a emotional-puppy-dog alternative. Leading the bad guys are Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, trapped inside what appears to be a Col. Kurtz latex fatsuit and bald cap) and warrior Globbu (an uncharacteristically uncharismatic Dave Bautista, whose performance tops out the growls-per-minute ratio). As part of his research, it’s known that Herbert read T.E. Lawrence’s The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, echoed in Paul’s journey from ambivalent would-be representative to full-on desert rat walking off with Arrakis’s resistance. Whether Herbert saw Lawrence of Arabia isn’t known, but it’s impossible not to think of it, since Villeneuve’s Dune unfolds against identical-looking landscapes also shot in Jordan. Yet for all the sand and desert architecture, Dune under-delivers on both sheer scale and action. Momoa and Bautista are both fine fighters who get relatively little chance to kick ass, the rest of the cast is on dialogue duty and most setpieces are of the “CG ships crash through CG haze into CG sands” variety. Even I, a Dune novice, knew enough to expect that something called a “sandworm” would show up eventually and look cool; the dialogue promises its arrival throughout, like a teaser for the end of the movie you’re already watching—and it is in fact pretty neat when it shows up, but too little too late. DP Roger Deakins was originally attached to this but split before production for unspecified reasons. His three previous collaborations with Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049) looked more like each other than they did the director’s work with other cinematographers, and I liked them more than any of Villeneuve’s other films accordingly. Here, working for the first time with Greig Fraser, Villeneuve suggests that—questions of color, grading, grain et al. aside—he does now have a consistent visual playbook all his own, which doesn’t turn out to be a good thing. There are ominously controlled overhead helicopter desert shots like Sicario, giganticicist and darkly colored interior sets out of 2049 and gauzy handheld dream vision shots of a woman staring out on an empty landscape around magic hour a la Amy Adams in Arrival. These go-to approaches are scattered between the more generic dialogue and action, and it makes the current limitations of Villeneuve’s visual imagination perceptible. The biggest problem, though, is Hans Zimmer, whose score is incredibly loud and unremittingly the dominant sound for more of the movie’s 155 minutes than not. Zimmer’s approach to musical cultural appropriation has been blithe since at least 1994’s The Lion King, while his subsequent rise to Coachella fame has accelerated improbably. Both worlds collide in Dune’s score, a nightmare barrage of field-filling drums punctuated by the odd muezzin-ish call to prayer—given how fraught the material already is (brown-skinned desert peoples vs. The Man), the Orientalist tinting is poorly thought through. Every time I went to the multiplex in summer 2016, I’d walk past an auditorium booming the thunderous punching-sounds foleys and Zimmer’s score from Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and it never failed to make my life a little more unpleasant. Five years later, the most cogent thought I emerged from Dune with was, “Hans Zimmer must be stopped.” I can’t improve on the coinage Paul Schrader came up with decades ago to describe his signature works as “man in a room” movies. As he recently reiterated to the Los Angeles Times’s Mark Olsen, “they usually involve a man alone in a room, wearing a mask, and the mask is his occupation. So it could be a taxi driver, a drug dealer, a gigolo, a reverend, whatever. And I take that character and run it alongside a larger problem, personal or social. [… In The Card Counter] the mask he wears is a professional poker player. And the problem that runs alongside him is that he is a former torturer for the U.S. government. So it’s a mix of the World Series of Poker and Abu Ghraib”—a fully accurate synopsis, to which I have little to add. The Card Counter is fully a “late auteur” effort, where economy of means and distillation of thematic intent routinely crosses the line into dramatic lassitude, down to perceptibly/charmingly slow driving shots (anyone that slow during interstate travel would get rear-ended in no time). Isaac is the aforementioned Abu Ghraib torturer, pseudonymous William Tell, who now bounces from casino to casino grinding out acceptably small winnings. At night, like the protagonist of an underbudgeted Jean-Pierre Melville movie, Tell retreats to anonymous nearby motels; when he enters, he takes down not the mirrors (which Melville characters stare into before going to meet death) but the framed wall art. Then he sits and journals his thoughts, which are peak Schrader (“Is there a limit to how much it takes to reach expiation?”). Card Counter’s main problem is the absolute lack of chemistry between Tell, his financial-sponsor-turned-love interest La Linda (Tiffany Haddish) and Cirk (Tye Sheridan), the more innocuously/platonically charged Jodie Foster to Isaac’s De Niro. (“With a K,” Cirk keeps saying—not until the credits did I know at which end the unorthodox letter went). The latter’s father was a soldier alongside Tell who came home, abused his family and committed suicide. Cirk wants homicidal revenge against Major John Gordo (Willem Dafoe), the private contractor who trained both Tell and Cirk’s dad; Tell, who alternates between laconic moodiness and awkward lunges into near-banter, wants to save Cirk from the probable consequences of his vengeful instincts. Even when all three leads are seated at the same table, they seem to be talking past each other on the world’s most awkward speed date for a surrogate family unit, with the would-be parents making ostensibly fond references to “the kid.” In American Gigolo, Light Sleeper and First Reformed, redemption gets conflated with sex in the single figure of a romantic interest; saddled with the latest iteration of this unenviable function, Haddish is unprepared to make the leap to her “comic performer shows off dramatic chops” role. But both the hits and misses in Card Counter are irrelevant to its central charm, which is comparing/contrasting how it varies the tropes of Schrader’s self-created genre. Gigolo harvested “Call Me” for two hours of instrumental variations in Giorgio Moroder’s score, while Light Sleeper assigned Greek chorus function of sorts to Michael Been’s value-neutral, lyrically on-the-head songs. Similarly scored, Card Counter hands these duties over to Been’s son—Robert Levon Been (of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club), co-writing with Giancarlo Vulcano—and the results are truly dismal, aspirant imitation late period Talk Talk crossbred with one of Eddie Vedder’s gloomier days. (I can’t tell if one lyric, repeated over and over, goes “In my lonely admiration” or “In my lonely abnegation”—either would fit.) Like Dafoe writing with a bottle of wine in Light Sleeper and Pepto Bismal-fueled Ethan Hawke in First Reformed, Isaac keeps his very own diary of a country priest alongside a bottle of whisky, recording angst in voiceover that reads out the handwritten text. Dafoe’s handwriting was loopy but sloppily legible cursive, Hawke’s enviably neat longhand; Isaac demonstrates freakishly legible, disciplined and consistent cursive. Teaching cursive has been, by and large, phased out, so this is a record of a dying art, as is the film itself—20 years from now, no one will be making movies like this. Most perverse and moving, though, is Schrader’s third riff on the ending of Bresson’s Pickpocket, where protagonist Michel meets his love Jeanne in prison. She rests her hand against the wire separating them, he puts his head up and announces “What a long, strange path I’ve taken to find you.” American Gigolo first repurposed this as a final prison reunion between Richard Gere (points at screen: “That’s the American gigolo”) and Lauren Hutton, speaking on phones separated by a transparent pane. “My God, Michelle, it’s taken me so long to come to you,” Gere says and rests his head against the divider as the camera tracks in from her side, arriving at an angle where it almost looks as if she’s transcended the barrier to touch him—a striking effect, held briefly before a cut to black and credits. In Light Sleeper, Dafoe’s not in jail proper but a detention center awaiting sentencing; Susan Sarandon comes to visit and reaches out to hold his hand across the elbow-height token wooden barrier separating them. This time the shot’s held for the first half of the end credits, a solid minute-plus during which the strain of holding the position on both their arms is perceptible. Card Counter takes this final gesture much further, with a reunion now stripped entirely of dialogue and a final shot of just Isaac and Haddish’s fingers reaching out, a glass pane separating them in the frame’s middle. This time, Schrader has his performers hold their position for the entire end credits, during which both performers adjust their fingers and drop their wrists as the shot rolls. This metaphysical reconciliation is now fully rendered as a feat of mild physical endurance, a devotional gesture both odd and touching for the reverence it shows this ending and its faith in its enduring power, no matter how many times distilled and refracted. * Full disclosure: I try to read the source novels of films I write about, time permitting, but there was zero chance I was going to ingest the 700ish pages of Dune. I did try to read it as a pre-teen, when I made the dumb mistake of trying to read the 50+-page appendix first and was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of made-up proper nouns. Wikipedia, of course, is no substitute for direct knowledge, but this entry’s credibly thorough and I’m reasonably sure none of what I’m about to say is completely off-base.↩"
"Nov 23, 2022",POSITIVE," A film is, at its core, a piece of entertainment. While cinema is also a fascinating and diverse macrocosm of art, films like Dune make the case that intermingling approaches to the medium aren’t always possible. The novel and the film are about a noble house that is given control over the desert planet of Arrakis. There, a mysterious substance, explained more adequately in the novel, is mixed in with the sand. The spice has a psychoactive property that enables the consumer to become hyper-aware, which helps to navigate ships through the vast and dangerousness of outer space. The cast is superb. Oscar Isaac is the patriarch, Rebecca Ferguson his wife, and Timothée Chalamet is his son; Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Change Chen, and Stephen McKinley Henderson play military and civic advisors to the house. Stellan Skarsgård leads a rival house with his own raft of servants including Dave Bautista and David Dastmalchian. Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Babs Olusanmokun, and Golda Rosheuvel play Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants, the former three of which have little narrative relevance and don’t make their first appearances until late in the film. And rounding out the cast are Sharon Duncan-Brewster as an imperial ecologist and Charlotte Rampling as the head of Ferguson’s Bene Gesserit religious order. Science fiction is a way to look at the current political landscape far removed from the actual events and shine a bright spotlight on problematic behaviors. Frank Herbert’s Dune is a perfect example of this and in many ways so much more than this. The novel looks at falling republics, ecological malfeasance in the pursuit of oil (in the case of the novel, spice), and religion and how seamlessly it can be integrated into a society. The difference between a novel and a movie is built on how you can actually review the material and reflect on it. With literature, you can stop and look up relevant terms, learn peripheral information, and absorb what you’ve read. With a film, all of that introspection must be done after the fact and you are required to be entirely present in the movie and be able to make notes of any unusual situations or ideas that you need to look into later. For a casual moviegoer, a lot of that information is missed and left merely as confusion. Director Denis Villeneuve tries to convey that as simply as possible and he does an admirable job with it, but without the core foundation of the written work, some of the minutia and subtlety is sometimes missed. Dune is a film that is largely faithful to the source material and like The Lord of the Rings, which defined how a fantasy novel could be adapted, it leaves out some of those details to streamline the film. Being a film based only on the first half of the Dune novel, there’s perhaps more to be learned from the eventual sequel than could be assessed ahead of time and the movie provides plenty to chew on in the interim. The break feels natural and the events to come will be rather interesting to see, but it also feels incomplete, mostly because a lot of the religious commentary and mysticism isn’t given its proper due. In addition, some of the political machinations of collapsing empires is present and some is absent. That too needs fleshing out in the subsequent film. Solid performances and some gorgeous visuals help absorb the audience into the narrative in ways that would otherwise be challenging. Villeneuve does well at avoiding over-explanation of the plot and conveys much of what makes the source material involving. However, in the end, Dune is a movie that needed more entry-level information than could easily be experienced in the relative brevity of the motion picture form."
"Nov 12, 2022",POSITIVE," A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence-a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential-only those who can conquer their fear will survive. Frank Herbert’s source novel is so grand in scale and dense in detail (it even has appendices detailing events and terminology), that reading it or watching the film requires a PhD in science fiction, let alone adapting it to the big screen. (NB: if you are looking for a handy primer to the saga, read this Dunesplaining article from Empire). So it is quite the flex for director Denis Villeneuve to helm Blade Runner 2049, one of the greatest sequels of all-time but an initial box office failure like its predecessor, and then double down on making a new version of Dune. Not only that but agreeing to film the first half of the story on the proviso that Part 2 would only be made if it is a success. It is understandable why people would be nervous about his prospects. Alexander Jodorwsky’s failed attempt in the 70s is now the subject of a documentary. There was also David Lynch’s 1984 critical and commercial failure. Somewhat harshly in retrospect despite Lynch himself calling it “a huge, gigantic sadness in my life.” One of the main issues with Lynch’s version, was the over-reliance on voiceover to try and explain the plot. Also, despite its 137 minute runtime, once House Atreides falls on Arrakis, the film feels incredibly rushed. Bouncing from one major plot point to the next until an emotionally unsatisfying climax. There is no such issue here. In fact, the exact opposite. As evidenced by 2049, a film in which one could have spent hours immersing themselves in, Villeneuve is an absolute master at world-building. Part One takes its time to introduce each new character, faction and world in immense detail. Helping to create a deep connection and emotional investment that will continue in the next film. Lynch’s Dune was unfavourably compared to Star Wars. True, both stories follow the adventures of one family in an intergalactic war for power however this new version only really looks to that galaxy far, far away for inspiration in design. Like the original Lucas trilogy, opting to build gigantic sets and film on location to generate a grounded sense of reality within the fantasy. As the winds blow spice and sand around the characters here, one feels they are right there with them on Arrakis.  Anakin Skywalker may have said “I don’t like sand. It’s coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.”  However there was clearly no Melange on Tatooine as if there were, he might have enjoyed it a bit more. For you don’t even need to physically ingest it in the cinema screen to know you are seeing something truly special. Paul Atreides may have a destiny similar to the Skywalkers yet so does the actor playing him. Timothee Chalamet has been the internet’s and Film Twitter’s chosen one ever since Call Me By Your Name. There was symbolic passing of the torch from Pattinson to Chalamet in The King. In a way, Pattinson going “you can deal with all the fangirling and memes for a while, I’m off to do more A24 movies”. Having provided supporting turns for the likes of Gerwig and Wes Anderson, here he fulfills his potential as a leading man. Proving himself worthy and capable to lead a major franchise of his own.  Like Luke in A New Hope, he starts from a place of tempestuousness, trepidation and fear. Fear is the mind killer after all. Yet by the end of Part One, he has taken his first steps into a larger world. He grows in confidence, strength and physicality as he progresses. Going from boy to man before our eyes whilst hinting at even greater things ahead. Chalamet is helped no end by having a Fantasy Film ensemble to spark and bounce off of. Some make strong but fleeting impressions, knowing they will return down the line, such as Brolin, Bautista and Skarsgaard. Of the rest, there is no weak link with Jason Momoa injecting some swagger as Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac & Rebecca Ferguson shining the brightest as Paul’s parents. To be honest, there are no weak links to be found anywhere. No tears in the stillsuits as it were. Hans Zimmer’s industrial score (bagpipes?! Who knew?) and Greig Fraser’s cinematography are simply out of this world. So people of the world, spice up your life and see Dune. Don’t worry about seeing it on “the biggest screen possible” as some critics would tell you. Just see it. So Villeneuve can conduct the final part of this truly epic space opera."
"Oct 11, 2022",POSITIVE," As a self-proclaimed Denis Villeneuve superfan, and for that matter, a Dune novice, I found his tenth directed feature film to be a tad too long, despite its epic scope, jaw-dropping action sequences, and visually stunning images. The adaptation of what many consider the most significant science-fiction novel of all time could not have been easy. There are piles of exposition that need to be explained for anyone new to the series. For those, the first act can tend to be confusing. Some will even find it convoluted, but it is understandable considering the source material’s density. Of course, the film opens with the title sequence, Dune: Part One. So, the insight I’m offering is hardly mind-blowing. This first installment aligns with The Lord of the Rings –– a necessary step to something better, even great.  By all accounts, Villeneuve’s Dune uses about half of the first book. (Even with numerous installments in the series, the director said he only plans on doing two films to tell Herbert’s story). Dune takes place in, you know, the future. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is given the job of governing the planet of Arrakis by the emperor. A desert planet enriched in “spice” (referred to in the book as “melange”), the richest material in the universe. Spice has the power to extend life, enhance levels of thought, and allow travel to move faster than the speed of light— this world’s B-12 shot. Even though Leto knows of the dangers and likely retribution of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) of the House of Harkonnen, he will do anything to get the planet back. This enrages his psychotic nephew, Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista). Though the Baron seems to have a plan that he hasn’t told his followers yet. The Duke brings his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and his son, Paul (Timothée Chalame). He brought along an army and his trusted advisors, including Paul’s mentors, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), and the House of Atreides Mentat, Thufir (Stephen McKinley Henderson). When Leto takes over, he shows a kind heart. He offers equal rights to the Fremen — natives to Arrakis. They live in the desert and are led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). The land is subject to extreme, dry heat. Oh, and those giant sandworms that led everyone to know about the noise ordinance. All of this happens while Paul continues to have dreams of the future. Others doubt him, but Jessica suspects he may be the Fremen’s Messiah. If you thought my synopsis was confusing, the film drops you in the middle of a world that somehow manages to be vague and convoluted at the same time. However, the exposition-filled first act is woven into dialogue that is as natural as one could hope for. That credit should go to the script by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Passengers), and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump). It’s informative while still entertaining, and you never once think of their vision as anything less than cohesive. Though, Dune, like Rings and Star Wars, doesn’t have a breakout character that represents a sense of comic relief. Momoa’s Idaho has the most fun in his role, but the film desperately needs more of this. Despite my slight criticism over the length and its story that can lean toward the south of sun-baked, Villeneuve’s film is well-crafted and has a maturity that we haven’t seen in an epic since The Lord of the Rings. It’s a heck of a ride. When all hell breaks loose, the invasion scenes that you see in the trailer are spectacular. I’ve never been one to set a moral high ground on how films should be watched, particularly with the rising costs of a theatrical experience and not to mention the current pandemic. Still, Dune demands to be seen on the big screen. The production value exceeds expectations, even more than any film I have seen in years. The team that Villeneuve gathered is of the highest caliber. From Tom Brown’s (Saving Private Ryan) art design, Jacqueline West’s (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Bob Morgan’s (Inception) costume design, Greig Frasier’s (Rogue One, Zero Dark Thirty) stunning cinematography, and Hans Zimmer’s beautiful, evocative score, it all exceeds expectations. However, the heavy metal bagpipes were an odd choice. Then, the only thing that can exceed that is the cast that Villeneuve has gathered here. The cast is pure perfection. Chalamet holds his own here, and it will be exciting to see his growth going forward in this film series (I still contend the studio will want to take scrap a part two and make it a trilogy). Brolin and Isaac stand out, like Ferguson, as she continues to find the poignancy in any action heroine she takes on. She has wonderful chemistry with Bardem’s Stilgard that points to an exciting storyline going forward. Even if Zendaya is underutilized here, she will have a more prominent role in future installments. Overall, Dune’s exceptional qualities far outweigh its minor criticisms. If anything, the first film feels incomplete, which is understandable considering the massive scope. If part two is the final chapter, perhaps both will make one five-hour film feel like a complete experience instead of one step to the bigger picture. Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website. Since a young age, Marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous “Rotten Tomato” approved status – in 2023, he achieved that status."

I'm beginning to think that one of the unexpected side-effects of 18 months of COVID is the ballooning out of film running times. It might be posited that filmmakers, knowing they didn't have to rush films out until audiences were back in cinemas, took their time, killing hundreds of hours micromanaging their editorial team and making the most of every frame filmed. Dune, Denis Villeneuve's stunning imagining of the Frank Herbert novel, comes in at two and a half hours long. And Villeneuve's film only gets itself halfway through the novel. This is a ""Part One"", with the second half yet to be filmed and due for release in October 2023.  Fans will want to know how this stands against David Lynch's also-brilliant camp 80s version. The answer is, they are both glorious, and they are completely different.  Villeneuve has a strong aesthetic to impart that references Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, Geiger designs and Lawrence of Arabia, amongst other iconic visual references.  From Herbert's cult 1965 novel, Villeneuve works with co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth on a deliberately paced screenplay as true to the novel as is possible without being 15 hours long.  On a distant set of planets, a decades-long battle of political power and intrigue has been playing out. On the sandy desert planet of Arrakis, the Harkonnen clan has controlled power and, most importantly, the mining rights to the planet's lucrative spice.  Arriving on Arrakis is head of the Arteries family, Duke Leo (Oscar Isaac) and his wife Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Jessica might be a royal wife, but she is also a sister in a powerful sorceress-like religion, the Bene Gesserit, and it seems her son with the Duke, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) may have inherited some of her powers.  The people of Arakis have a myth of a foreign hero who will come to be their saviour, and signs exist that this person may be Paul Atreides, and the sisters of the Bene Gesserit are keen to bring this myth to reality.  But it is possible that the Emperor's placement of the Atreides onto Arrakis was a deliberate action to undermine or ruin the family, with doom coming at them from all sides, only one being the desert's giant sandworms, and many more sources being the Harkonnen waiting in the wings with massacre on their minds.  When Paul and his mother are marooned in the Arrakis desert, his growing powers may be able to save them, or perhaps their saviour might be the indigenous Arrakis girl Chani (Zendaya) who has been haunting his dreams.  The star power in this production is dazzling. Charlotte Rampling is terrifying as the mother of the religious sect, Stellan Skarsgard barely recognisable as the corpulent murderous Baron Harkonnen, a shaved Jason Momoa is just as handsome out of his Aquaman garb as the Artreides family bouncer Duncan Idaho.  Performances are equally strong, but the star power of this film is the production design. Particularly delightful are the imaginative engineering of the film's ships and other tools, beginning with imaginative tri-winged dragonfly-inspired aircraft, or the film's training weaponry that coat their wearer in Minecraft-like techno blocks.  The production team play with political symbolism, not just from Leni Riefenstahl's playbook. It's not just the film's characters that are imbedded with fascist ideology. Herbert wrote his novel in the post WWII ear, but Villeneuve hints at more contemporary inspirations.  Villeneuve's world-building is epic. Visually epic, but also part of his approach to the screenplay's slow deliberate pace to pull out the novels more important scenes and storylines. Paul only meets Zendaya's Chani at the film's end, and we can imagine the second film, when it comes, will enjoy a swifter pace, now the world-building is out of the way. "
"Aug 16, 2022",POSITIVE," It’s hard not to be excited for a Denis Villeneuve movie. The French Canadian director, screenwriter, and producer has such a compelling filmography. I was introduced to Villeneuve via his 2010 Oscar nominated drama “Incendies”. But it’s his terrific run since then that has turned me into a bonafide fan. I enjoyed both “Prisoners” and “Enemy”. His 2015 border thriller “Sicario” may be my favorite film of his to date. “Arrival” was my #1 movie of 2016 while 2017’s “Blade Runner 2049” was a gutsy and heady sequel to a 1982 sci-fi classic. It almost feels like a natural progression for Villeneuve’s next film to be his biggest and most audacious project to date. “Dune” is certainly that. This massive sprawling science-fiction epic is the first film in a two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 cult novel of the same name. Packing a hefty budget and a star-studded cast, “Dune” is a herculean undertaking brimming with ambition and made with the unquenchable passion of a filmmaker who has called this his “longstanding dream“. There are a number of ways that a project of this size and scope could have gone awry. But Villenueve is a savvy filmmaker with a dedicated vision. I’ve seen “Dune” multiple times now, and I can honestly say that I’m struggling to find a single bad filmmaking decision anywhere in his movie. Bold statement, I know. Without question, it was the right choice to break this up into two movies. This film literally starts with the “Part One” tag and ends around the halfway mark of the “Dune” story. As mentioned above, this benefits the film greatly because it allows the right amount of time for us to be immersed into this striking and complex world. And it allows Villeneuve (who co-wrote the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) to acquaint us the many political, ecological, and societal intricacies that help give the story depth. Set in the very distant future of 10191, “Dune” tells the story of young Paul (Timothée Chalamet), the gifted son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), the leader of the powerful House Atreides. They live and rule on the planet Caladan where Paul, next in line to lead, is trained in combat by close friend and House Atreides warrior Duncan (Jason Momoa) and Leto’s top aide Gurney (Josh Brolin). His mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), an acolyte of a mysterious sisterhood called the Bene Gesserit, teaches him the secrets of a mysterious inner power he possesses, a power that’s causing haunting dreams of a troubling future. Meanwhile on the harsh desert planet of Arrakis, the brutal House Harkonnen, ran by the chillingly vile and grotesque Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), have become obscenely rich controlling the planet’s production of a priceless mineral called Spice. The Harkonnens callously harvest the coveted natural resource, avoiding massive sandworms and persecuting the resilient indigenous clan known as the Fremen. Their leader is Stilgar (a solemn and reticent Javier Bardem) and also among their ranks is Chani (Zendaya), a young woman who has been appearing in Paul’s dreams. After an imperial decree orders the Harkonnen off of Arrakis, the emperor grants stewardship of the planet to House Atreides. Suspicious of the mandate but loyal to the call, Leto accepts with hopes of forming an alliance with the native Fremen. That proves to be easier said than done. After 80 years of oppression, the Fremen are leery of any new offworlders. And can the Harkonnens be trusted to leave behind all the wealth and power found in the sands of Arrakis?  Ultimately the film very much belongs to Paul, a young man trying to find himself while being pulled in every direction. As Leto’s heir, everyone expects him to be next in line to lead House Atreides. Jessica’s sect (led by a wonderfully creepy Charlotte Rampling) hopes Paul is “the one” which they intend to use for their own cryptic purposes. And the Fremen, having heard of this messiah-like deliverer, wonder if Paul might be the fulfillment of that prophecy. As Villeneuve patiently and methodically lays out his story, we’re struck by the surprising amount of narrative depth. Not only is “Dune” thematically rich, it’s filled with connected backstory. But to the screenwriting trio’s credit, they often (and smartly) allude to the lore rather than bury us in it. Yet there are still many layers to their story, and it’s impossible to narrow the film down to one single category. Of course it’s science fiction, but it’s also a coming-of-age story, a war movie, an anti-war movie, a sociopolitical parable. Another testament to the film’s richness. But without question the movie’s biggest strength remains its world building. From the imaginative costumes to the jaw-dropping production design, Villeneuve and his talented team of creators have made a stunningly tactile world and every frame gives us something worthy to consume. Whether it’s the lush overcast Atreides homeworld with its vast waters and craggy coastlines or the stark yet gorgeous oceans of sand on Arrakis that look like golden brown meringue through DP Greig Fraser’s camera. Interestingly, the technology of “Dune” leans more primitive than futuristic which helps the world feel rooted in our reality. There are no fancy LED panels and very little high-tech gadgetry. Even the structures convey this, often resembling old ruins rather than state-of-the-art facilities. The ships are massive and breathtaking spectacles yet designed with a cold austere simplicity. The machinery has a rusty industrial look and even the incredibly cool ornithopters (which resemble giant dragonflies) are a believable evolution of our standard helicopters. To the performances, I admit to being a bit of a Chalamet skeptic. I’ve never thought he was a “bad” actor, just not up to the gushing hype that follows everything he does. Here he earns the praise he’s been getting. Chalamet brings a boyish petulance to Paul in the film’s early scenes, but over time convincingly turns his vulnerability to maturity. Isaac is fittingly stoic. Momoa is full of charisma. Brolin is stern and abrasive. Ferguson deftly manages the emotionally meatiest role. Skarsgård is devilishly menacing. Sharon Duncan-Brewster is mysterious yet exciting. Zendaya does fine with the few scenes she’s given. I honestly didn’t know what to expect from “Dune”. I’ve never read Herbert’s book and I don’t remember a thing about David Lynch’s 1984 film. Perhaps that’s why “Dune” 2021 blew me away. From its opening shot to the final fade, I found myself enraptured and transported. Villeneuve’s captivating direction, Hans Zimmer’s brooding exotic score (one of his very best), the exquisite sound design, the visual feast that screams to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Together it all makes for a smart, evocative, and rousing experience that reminded me at every turn of why I love cinema. And this is just Part One of the story. Honestly, this very well could be my movie of the year.  It’s brilliantly realized and it’s easy to follow, despite the fact that it throws a lot of information and lore at you.  I have to give real credit to Villeneuve and the writers for making it accessible.  I love the 1984 movie, despite its problems, but this blows that version out of the proverbial water.  My biggest gripe with Dune is not with the film itself, but rather the way the movie was handled by Warner Bros.  This is a big-screen movie in every aspect, so putting on HBO Max on the same day as it hits theaters was incredibly stupid.  Looking at the world-wide box office results, my gut feeling is that Part 2 will be greenlit pretty soon, but for a while it looked like that was entirely up in the air.  While I absolutely believe that Part 2 will happen, anything else Dune-related won’t.  At least, not under the current leadership.  Hopefully, when Discovery takes the reigns, they’ll understand Dune’s real potential.  As it stands, Denis Villeneuve’s film is absolutely incredible.  The sense of scale is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before.  And this is done WITHOUT 3D.  5 stars?  Abso-frickin’-lutely. Wow, Keith, what a wonderful review of the movie.  I still haven’t seen it but I read the book and see the movie follows the plot well.  I’m glad he bent towards lo-tech rather than hi-tech, as he did in Blade Runner 2049. Thanks so much. As you can tell, I’m REALLY high on this movie and recommend on the biggest screen possible. It’s a breathtaking experience that genuinely transports you to another world. I loved it! I have just come back from the theatre after watching this film. It is every bit magnificent and your review echoes my thoughts perfectly. A Timothée Chalamet film from the first to the last frame I was reminded of Matrix, ‘He’s the One’ dialogue stirring the pot. Fingers crossed that Part 2 happens quickly. I must have a part 2. If for some insane reason it doesn’t get the green light it’ll be one of the biggest travesties in movie history. But I’m really confident that part 2 will be announced. Oh, there’s no doubt that we’ll be getting a part 2.  Whether it gets greenlit by Warner Bros. in the next couple of weeks or when Discovery takes over in March, a part 2 is most certainly going to happen.  With a movie of THIS scale, you really don’t want to NOT finish the story.  The problem is that we won’t see part 2 for at least 2 years, if they start production soon. I know it! Talk about a painfully long wait! I have heard rumors (and I emphasize “rumors”) that HBO Max was interested in a series from the Dune universe. Who knows, but I would be all for it. It was a stunning movie; even though it wasn’t a 100% faithful representation of Herbert’s book, it was a fan’s dream come true. Being that the book itself was such a complex and grand story, I believe Dir. Denis Villeneuve really encapsulated the book in this first part movie as best as it can be translated into film.  I was left speechless about ’10 minutes into the film as I didn’t realize how quickly I had become sucked into the entire atmosphere that Villeneuve managed to create in the movie. Fantastic, and I’d also give it a 5/5 (originally 4.5/5) as I realize it really does match up fantastically with the book. Safe to say, though, I also agree that Villeneuve’s work usually speaks for itself. So I’ll be incredibly excited for the second part to release as well! I love your perspective (as someone who is a fan of the book). I love that it is winning both fans of the book and those with no connection. That’s a sign of a well-made adaptation. I am also a bit of a Chalamet skeptic, his range here needs to be a bit broader, but that is mostly the writing. Momoa practically steals all the energy of the movie. I am afraid I compared every moment to the 84 Lynch version, sometimes it excels and in other places it fall short. I think the two part decision is the right one as long as they actually do part 2. A great looking film, I’m still not sure it has solved all the puzzles that plagued everyone who has attempted this, but I am very happy it exists. I’m really looking forward to reading this review in full when I see this soon. I have to keep as much of it a secret as I can! But . . . . wow it’s been hard. Make sure you let me know how you feel about it. I was blown away and really impressed with how Denis brought this massive vision to the screen. I saw this yesterday afternoon where I realized why I spent more money on the typical afternoon ticket because I went to a Dolby Atmos screening of the film and… it was worth it.  I’m finishing up my own review of the film right now as… FUCKING GIVE ME PART 2!!!!!! Great review. I definitely agree with you about this movie. It was truly a fantastic and cinematic experience and I felt that Villeneuve was perfect for the feature and did the source material justice. Thanks Jason. I’m so enthusiastic about it. I’ve seen it three times now and have picked up something new each time. Huge fan of it. I’ve read the books and am glad to read in your comments that it sticks pretty close. Looking forward to seeing it at some point. This is on my must see list and will hopefully catch it. I hardly recall the novel . I just couldn’t get into Herbert’s narrative and the story didn’t grip me but I know many who love it and that’s all cool. So I’m looking at this movie from a different perspective , in a way much like you . The main attraction for me was Denis Villeneuve , I’ve truly loved his work , especially in the science fiction field . Both Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival were fantastic , so I was confident he would handle Dune well. Once again an excellent ,thoughtful and comprehensive review . Thanks my friend. Absolutely see this, on the big screen of at all possible. I know “see it on the big screen” is often thrown out there without much thought. But this truly is a testament to the theater experience. Anxious to hear what you think of it. “I just received news from Legendary that we are officially moving forward with Dune: Part Two,” the filmmaker said. “It was a dream of mine to adapt Frank Herbert’s Dune, and I have the fans, the cast, and crew, Legendary and Warner Bros. to thank for supporting this dream. This is only the beginning.” Great review! I’m in the same boat as you, never read the books and I never saw the original film and was totally captivated by this. Bring on part two! Thank you! Love that you loved it. I was excited for it but honestly didn’t expect to be sucked in the way I was. I can’t get it out of my head."
"Aug 16, 2022",POSITIVE,The world building and story telling in this film was completely brilliant&#33; Everything had a purpose&#44; and everything was well planned out meticulously&#46; Besides the beautiful cinematography&#44; Hans Zimmer&apos;s score shined throughout&#33;
"Jul 28, 2022",POSITIVE,There was a lot of things to like about this film but when it ended I couldn&apos;t help but say to myself &quot;Damn that&apos;s it&#63;&quot; - Kennith B&#46; Inge
"Jul 11, 2022",POSITIVE,Villeneuve adds his usual brains and soul to yet another epic blockbuster property and&#44; once again&#44; he&#8217;s secured victory&#46; But it is us&#44; the audience&#44; who gets to reap the rewards of his hard work&#46;
"Jul 8, 2022",POSITIVE," A spice-war space opera about feuding houses on far-flung planets, Dune has long been a pop-culture building block. Before Frank Herbert's 1965 novel was adapted into a wrongly reviled David Lynch-directed film — a gloriously 80s epic led by Kyle MacLachlan and laced with surreal touches — it unmistakably inspired Star Wars, and also cast a shadow over Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Game of Thrones has since taken cues from it. The Riddick franchise owes it a debt, too. The list goes on and, thanks to the new version bringing its sandy deserts to cinemas, will only keep growing. As he did with Blade Runner 2049, writer/director Denis Villeneuve has once again grasped something already enormously influential, peered at it with astute eyes and built it anew — and created an instant sci-fi classic. This time, Villeneuve isn't asking viewers to ponder whether androids dream of electric sheep, but if humanity can ever overcome one of our worst urges and all that it brings. Dune tells of birthrights, prophesied messiahs, secret sisterhood sects that underpin the galaxy and phallic-looking giant sandworms, and of the primal lust for power that's as old as time — and, in Herbert's story, echoes well into the future's future. Blade Runner 2049 ruminated upon a similar idea in its own way, as many movies do. Indeed, Ridley Scott was hired to helm Dune before Lynch, then made the original Blade Runner instead, so Villeneuve is following him again here. Dune's unpacking of dominance and command piles on colonial oppression, authoritarianism, greed, ecological calamity and religious fervour, though, like it's building a sandcastle out of power's nastiest ramifications. And, amid that weightiness, it's also a tale of a moody teen with mind-control abilities struggling with what's expected versus what's right. That young man is Paul Atreides, as played by Timothée Chalamet in a stroke of genius casting that seems almost fated — as if returning Dune to the big screen had to wait for the Call Me By Your Name star. (The book also earned the TV miniseries treatment in 2000, and we should be thankful that a 90s iteration soundtracked by the Spice Girls' 'Spice Up Your Life' didn't ever eventuate.) When the narrative begins in Villeneuve and co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth's (A Star Is Born) retelling, Paul's life has been upended. House Atreides, led by his father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, Scenes From a Marriage), must leave its watery home planet of Caladan to take over the desert world of Arrakis. Previously run by their enemies in House Harkonnen, it's the source of the universe's melange stores, with the spice making interstellar travel possible. Spice also expands consciousness and extends lives — and, while forced by imperial decree, the monstrous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, Chernobyl) isn't happy about handing Arrakis over. To say House Atreides' move doesn't go smoothly is like saying that its new home is a tad toasty, but the tricky transition is just one of Dune's concerns. Another: the plans for Paul. House Atreides' heir, he's being trained as such by the Duke, security expert Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson, Devs), swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, Aquaman) and weaponry whiz Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, Avengers: Endgame). But Paul's mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Reminiscence) hails from the Bene Gesserit, an all-female group who pull the galaxy's strings, and she sees him as its fabled chosen one. On the page, Dune sports an abundance of plot, of which this film only relays half; its title card dubs it Dune: Part One, a move only backed up post-US release when Dune: Part Two was greenlit. This opening chapter is never overladen, however, even if the Fremen — Arrakis' blue-eyed Indigenous peoples, including tribal leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem, Everybody Knows) and the defiant Chani (Zendaya, Malcolm & Marie) — are clearly poised to enjoy a larger part in the sequel. Savvily, one of Villeneuve's big choices is to let Chani's narration introduce the movie. It immediately helps to side the feature with the oppressed, rather than merely embracing several layers of power from the get-go. It also signals a concerted effort to ensure this isn't primarily a story of men. It whets the appetite for more, too, including from Zendaya — who doesn't get much screentime, but still leaves an imprint that'd stick even in sand. Treading not only in Lynch's footsteps, but in Chilean French director Alejandro Jodorowsky's — whose aborted 70s stab at Dune is chronicled in stellar documentary Jodorowsky's Dune — is a mammoth task. Big-budget slams and failed visionary attempts tend to stick in filmic memory. Plus, Lynch's movie featured a heap of other future Twin Peaks stars, and Sting, and a score by Toto (no one blessed the rains, though). Meanwhile, Jodorowsky had Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali and Orson Welles, with Pink Floyd on soundtrack duties. To match, Villeneuve boasts a magnificent cast, all doing their utmost, while Hans Zimmer's throbbing notes set an intense and ominous mood as expertly as his immensely dissimilar work on No Time to Die also did. But what gleams brightest in this take on the tale is its breathtaking visuals, meticulous plotting, a pace that gives the narrative space to breathe and an alluring sense of mystery, as well as the ability to prove simultaneously vast and intimate. When Dune's desert landscapes linger as far as the eye can see, they shimmer with heat, texture and possibility. When the film lurks in palaces bubbling with political scheming, it hews slick, muted and brutal. As lensed by Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Lion), these are shrewd choices — pitting the expansive, grainy yet inviting against the confined, sleek and savage — in a movie that knows how to make every image both count and feel visceral. Awe-inspiring to behold, and operatic, Dune turns a literary giant into a cinematic one. It broods brilliantly, dreams vividly and muses sharply, as Villeneuve's work (see also: Arrival and Enemy) does at his best. It stages tremendously engaging action sequences, too, as Sicario also did. The one drawback: as grand and majestic as it is, and as much of an astonishing feast for the senses as well, it could use a slightly wilder streak. Dune rarely makes surprising moves — it doesn't quite take a ""walk without rhythm and it won't attract the worm"" ethos to heart, aka the line from the book that's immortalised in Fat Boy Slim's 'Weapon of Choice' — but it's always thrilling, immersive and spectacular."
"Jul 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"[Villeneuve] delivered superbly produced entertainment cinema, of visual fortitude, aggrandized form, and banal contemplation. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jun 25, 2022",POSITIVE," While we’re a handful of days behind schedule, The Letterboxd Files with yours truly has returned for another round of things that you could’ve already read if you had a Letterboxd and followed my account. If you don’t, never fear. I’d never deprive you of these painfully casual film blurbs. I wouldn’t even dare. This week, we’ve got Elvis, a spattering of William Friedkin and Wolfgang Petersen (because why not) and more reviews from the vault because I have a job and didn’t watch as many movies this week. Lmao, Baz, you crazy SOB. Elvis is a 159-minute atomic blast of rhinestone glory. Genuinely unsure how Austin Butler pulled that off, and how Tom Hanks was able to be so evil with that accent. A stunner. Let Luhrmann do whatever he wants for the rest of his career. Can we put to rest the idea Walk Hard made it to where you can’t do a biopic like this anymore? Literally just hire someone as insane and opulent as Baz Luhrmann and nail the cast. Elvis is a rattler. No idea how Baz decided to put a Denzel Curry track in the Elvis movie, but I support. Maybe not my favorite Petersen film, but it’s pretty compelling when it’s showing the horrors of contagion and how futile we are to nature. Having actually lived through a pandemic and gotten the virus in question (with tons of vaccine flowing through me), it is fascinating to see the “what if?” horrors of 90s imagining of what this might look like. Clearly it’s going off a disaster movie’s playbook, and the military conniving feels a little trite for how something this serious would actually go. But just having lived through a moment where U.S government severely mismanaged the opening stages of a pandemic…incompetence and malevolence at the federal level don’t feel that off. Petersen really found something to say with the state of our leadership at the top with his government trilogy (this, Fire, AF1), and though this is the least effective of that trio, it’s still a noxious reminder of how we pale in comparison to nature’s worst. Cute monkey, too. God bless Wolfgang Petersen for mounting such a thrilling, phenomenally stupid-yet-surprisingly deep studio blockbuster at a time where we need way more of that than Spider-Man 7. Gary Oldman snapping in every scene is a hoot. I originally intended to only watch an hour of this, but it was so magnetizing, I couldn’t do anything but finish it. The classic 90s political thriller, complete with an air-tight script for 2+ hours, some great performances and a steady hand from Wolfgang Petersen. I miss Clint Eastwood acting in other people’s movies. Just a grand time. A scuzzy, sun-drenched LA neo-noir where nobody is good forever and everyone has something to hide. Obviously the car chase is a landmark, which what else would you expect from the guy who made The French Connection, but I was equally impressed by Friedkin’s ability to zap the film of any predictability. It’s just a daring, morally dubious cops-and-grifters saga with one hell of a Willem Dafoe performance. Everything burns. It’s stunning to me we used to live in a world where this was a major release from a movie studio. Sure, it got stomped by Star Wars, but what didn’t in 1977? A clear pathway for movies like Uncut Gems and Triple Frontier, and a white-knuckle, unforgiving descent into a very specific land of desperation. One of the few movies where it felt like anything could go wrong at any moment, and you feel that tension from opening to closing credits. Friedkin is a master of shot composition, and in building that exact shade of gut-wrenching tension that makes you want to yell at the screen. There’s something powerful that the film that’s going to stand as the future of Pixar is made by a team of amazingly creative women. Domee Shi elite: best directorial debut at Pixar since Lee Unkrich doing Toy Story 3. Staggering talent. It’s got shades of Scott Pilgrim and Aardman, which is one of the higher compliments I can give a movie. It nails the 2000s feel, down to the fact that it feels like one of those 00s live-action family films aimed at preteens. That’s a feat! I usually don’t give Disney credit for creative risk anymore, and boo on them for pulling this from theaters, but this is a step in the right direction. You quite literally can’t make this movie 10 years ago. Generational spectacle. It’s the first of a whole, but it feels still like a complete journey. It’s one of those rare experiences you can’t miss on the big screen – like, if you have any love of film at all, you must see it at least once in a premium format. I think it’s going to be canon one day / it’s the shining example of Villeneuve’s talent and what makes him the most interesting director working. I mean this seriously – some moments in this rival the same awe I felt the first time I watched 2001 in a theater (IMAX) – you just get those goosebumps and feelings of disbelief at what you’re watching. I still don’t know how they pulled some of this off – I’ll be honest, I got a little emotional watching some of this again in such a grand way. Not just for what we missed during the lost year in theaters, but just in appreciating what the best of what the spectacle of moviegoing can give you. A+ movie. The bulk of this is very squarely fixed in a Bush America, and some of the commentary lacks the kind of nuance that we’ve learned about global
politics since it came out. I think some of it is the same kind of issue Blazing Saddles faces now – timely subversion that now looks dated without viral context – but some of it is just Parker/Stone’s sense of humor just not advancing past what was allowed at the time. Some of it is aggressively funny, some of it is just not quite there anymore. What’s surprising is some of its best material isn’t even humor – it’s the darkness that seeps in with the characters and the story. The music is solid, the puppetry is deeply impressive, the puking scene is still the funniest part besides the house cats. I really wish there was more here that aged well, but it’s still quite good for what it’s trying to do. It’s not my favorite thing Parker/Stone have done, but it’s important for what it accomplished, even if what some of it accomplished shows a little naivety and insensitivity. As much as the absence of John R. Dilworth looms over this (it’s very weird he virtually had nothing to do with the revival of Courage and didn’t sign off on this), this is leagues better than the CGI Scoob! movie that committed the unforgivable sin of recasting Shaggy. Matthew Lillard is the only person that should be allowed to play or voice Shaggy until his passing; this should be U.S. law. The tonal clash of Courage’s artsy/creepy horror comedy and Scooby Doo’s kooky 60s mystery caper isn’t nearly as jarring as you’d expect. No Dilworth means the graceful terror of the original Courage series is missing, but the body horror comedy and abstractions, and all the usual beats, for Courage are present. The original show is landmark for animation and one of the best animated series of all time; this revival is pretty darn enjoyable in a “good fan fiction” sort of way. Thea White’s Muriel being back and is just as good as ever, just before her passing, hits hard. I forgot what a spectacular piece of voice acting that was and what a great, tender character she is. She and Courage’s dynamic still hits home. So sweet. Some of this is a little too goofy for its own good (Eustace’s rap number is a choice), but it’s so much better than it has any right to be, and just so, so much better than the big-budget animated film meant to spark a cinematic universe. It gets both series’ right, and it has Lillard right where he needs to be. Also, what a randomly hilarious/moving statement on the relationship the anxious have with calming apps. The likely first and last Courage family reunion was a nice little thing I didn’t know I needed. Mixing in Scooby-Doo is a clever little wrinkle that makes this direct-to-DVD ditty worth the time. The best and worst of Kevin Smith, rolled up into a delicious burger that gives you the runs. As I get uncomfortably closer to 30, I can’t help but feel much more so now the burden of time than I did when I snuck-watched this in 2006 that Smith places on Dante and Randal, selling burgers and talking pop culture into their 30s as life passes them by and they start to grapple with the fact that they’re not really “young” anymore. You can tell that Smith is at war with himself as a creator here, still slinging the same shock-disgust humor but wholly unable to fumble the emotional beats that define his best films. He can’t let go of some truly uncomfortable jokes by today’s standard (half of Randal’s shtick would get tossed out in millisecond in today’s climate, for obvious reason), which makes some of this movie age like an old hamburger on the sidewalk. It’s not really “fair” to judge everything on that standard, with Smith more than willing to answer for Randal’s defeating immaturity with deep-seeded insecurity and fear for how small he feels in a world that seems to be passing him by and a past he probably never fully appreciated until it was long gone. They say youth is wasted on the young, and it’s clear Smith is asking himself, and his pop-culture obsessed audience, if they really understand how precious the days of empty chatter with beloved buddies are, how the time you spend with those you love and the good you can rummage up to do for others really cements your time on this planet, not the big dreams you muster or the life goals you feel bound to complete. Dante and Randal may feel lost in the dog days of the service industry, but it’s that they’re together that makes it worthwhile, and even joyous and well worth the menial nature. Though, Smith’s irony comes with finding that out before so much of it is off the clock. You can’t always appreciate what you’ve got while you’ve got it in abundance, which is why life can be so bittersweet. Smith’s penchant for vulgarity and shock value never served him quite like he hoped; this, of course, came before his spat with Rotten Tomatoes and Cop Out/Yoga Hosers period when you could tell he was struggling to find his voice as an artist who saw an industry starting to pass him by and a style that was growing more dated by the hour. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot was actually a pretty nice little comeback vehicle for him, and clearly, Clerks III might be his best chance in decades to make a sincerely good movie, informed by real-life struggle. Dante and Randal have always been his most honest characters and best evolving reflections of self, as you can tell Randal’s teary lament to Dante in jail is fully Smith purging his own insecurities about aging onto the page. Making Randal have a heart attack to directly mimic his own experience really has some dramatic potential that rivals anything he’s done in his career. It might be the best proving ground he’s ever had. Though, you just hope the juvenile sensibilities strike more toward character than offensiveness. I get some of Randal’s gross-out, low-brow, creepy gags are of their time and made to reflect a shallow, immature, likely dishonest goober who talks a big game and doesn’t have much to back up with. But his persona is caught between genuine empathy and a damning sense of obsoleteness. People complain “you can’t make this anymore” with certain comedies, but clearly some of this movie’s humor is irresponsible and embarrassing. Thankfully Smith has beyond evolved his rhetoric (his latest View Askew film finds a much more palatable sensibility), but you’ve got to weigh this film’s good heart, smart wordplay and deeply touching character work and performance with its at times bewildering lack of awareness. Though, that’s Smith for you circles 2006. Jeff Anderson’s performance, beyond being really nuanced and powerful at its best moments, also captures a sense of lowliness and timidity that does make this film’s most face-planting moments feel less proud and more self-critical than Smith’s page does. This is a very good film in spurts, and a bizarre, rusted time capsule in other ways. It’ll rightfully stay in its time of release and probably will get revisited with some negative attention once the new film comes out for how cringey some of the humor is. But also don’t forget the beating heart of it all, that helps contextualize some of this film’s lesser angels as sad consequences of living life without full awareness of how precious it is and how wonderful it is to have those around you. A glorious over-exaggeration. Jan de Bont knew how to give folks a good time at the movies. For the goofy moments and aged VFX, there’s a real sense of terror with the storm and a real sense of excitement for the chase. It’s a great cast, Bill Paxton such a loveable jackass in this, and Helen Hunt does a great job as the anchor for the emotion. PSH, obvs., is the MVP though, the world’s best storm-chasing hype man. This is a little long and ridiculous, but it’s also just a tour-de-force roller coaster theme park attraction. Which is ironic, because the actual theme park attraction for this sucked. Look, the Russos were a weird ass pick to direct this movie being that the last non-MCU film they made was You, Me and Dupree. Cherry is a lot of things, and at times, the Russos completely whiff on what they’re trying to say, only to be bailed out by their really impressive cast. The Russos know how to cast well; that’s the only reason this film, at least to me, holds itself together. It’s a glossy Goodfellas of an addict’s descent, free of any nuance. The Russos are not the guys who will give you that. But Tom Holland is a supremely gifted young guy who understands the story much better than the Russos do, and he’s pretty dang good here. He’s better at capturing the dangers of  boredom and economic disruption, better at casting a side eye to the empty, dangerous machismo of his military training, better at portraying the devastation of PTSD and the inability to find meaningful help for it, better at sliding into addiction and eventual ruin. The Russos don’t know how to do any of that convincingly, but their filmmaking still, somehow, refracts back with oomph because they were smart enough to wrangle in Holland (and Ciara Bravo, who does some under-appreciated heavy lifting her). The Russos are not probably going to make another movie like Cherry with some of these reactions devastatingly negative, but I found some engagement in this thing. It’s no better or worse at fast food imitation of a better filmmaker than its peers (I think they’re doing more Refn than Scorsese), and it’s, again, anchored by an actor in a better movie. Holland is genuinely good here, and that military section is genuinely interesting and thoughtful in its brazenness to depict the downsides of army life in such a crass, empty way. It’s unafraid to have a more blunt conversion about the 00s wars than some other things I’ve seen, and I liked that about it. The addiction drama is grimy and shallow, but Holland, Bravo, Jack Reynor and Forrest Goodluck are so dang good in portraying the darkness and immorality of the moment that it becomes surprisingly watchable. I don’t think the Russos are doing bad work here, but I question what happens if the cast falls through. It’s a decent flick, but Holland earns his stripes. A voracious, twisted vision of Hell, a carnival of sin and discord forged in the bowels of something unholy and wretched. Gaspar Noe by means of Lars von Trier with John Waters, David Lynch, Harmony Korine, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Zombie, Darren Aronofsky, Uwe Boll, the Farrellys and Tim Story serving as creative consultants. A disturbing survey of a languishing grave of holiday capitalism, screeching from the beyond warnings of greed and excess. A demented ballet of gruesome revenge from an ugly, amoral soul. I feel I am drawn to this film for its pungent nostalgia, for the feelings I have when I watch it that cannot be explained for the quality of what I’m watching, but I also defend the filmmaking. This is what happens when a film goes so off the rails that it dips into a twilight zone where so many delirious accidents and haphazard creative choices get hocked together into something so unsettling, garish, crass, dated, individual. There will never be another movie like Ron Howard’s The Grinch and 2003’s Cat in the Hat. These are abominations, but also such fascinating time capsules and signifiers for what the Universal Studios corporate suite thought was cinematically appropriate for the work of Dr. Seuss. In a world of MCUs and sterile family entertainment, I crave something so disastrously captivating as Ron Howard’s The Grinch. It’s wrong to like this movie, but like it, I do, for all of its festering warts and licked toads. It’s legitimately entertaining in a very selfish way – I find no inherent value in what I’m watching, but I still take great pride in finding value in the experience. I think this film works in some ways because there are some genuinely great things about it, on purpose and on accident. Jim Carrey is a man possessed – it is the most physical performance of all time, and I’m dumbfounded and deeply fascinated that he did this, Me, Myself and Irene and Man on the Moon so close together. It’s like he did The Majestic as a way to come off the acid trip he must’ve had to go on to be in those consecutive movies. I don’t like to think he ever took the Grinch makeup off – he just stayed in there, pushing the brink of his mental stability until he was just Grinch, nothing less, nothing more. Just Grinch. It’s an astounding feat of physical comedy and excess emoting. It’s a miracle he was able to do this and make it so lasting – I mean that. Rick Baker and company’s makeup is unbelievable for how it just meshes into the characters. The dog is a good actor dog, Taylor Momson is a good kid actor, Tambor plays smug like a fiddle, Clint Howard is the perfect actor for such a besmirched production. Getting Faith Hill to sing the main song over the credits after this nearly two-hour psychedelic breakdown is absolutely hilarious. This movie should not exist but I’m so glad it does. It’s a wonderful example of some of the deeply strange stuff that masqueraded as family entertainment when I was a kid. I’m all the better and worst for it. I find value in this film. It’s a weird, unkempt, relentlessly crude-yet-disarmingly-warm piece of early 2000s kitsch. But it’s also one of the most popular and rewatched Christmas films of all time. Only a holiday movie could be so bizarre and still garner such adoration and loyalty. A cheap sizzle reel of hero worship and political myth-making; telling in its utter inability to find anything particularly laudable about Rudy Giuliani in flashbacks of his spotty career in public service as a draconian attorney-turned-mayor. Any virtue bestowed upon him is in imagined dialogue, where any of his actions are heralded as “the right thing to do” because he’s Rudy, a good American and New Yorker who *loves his city.* It’s telling Giuliani made a cameo in this to give it his official seal of approval – it’s mostly the biopic equivalent of blowing smoke up the buttocks. I really don’t know what to do with the 9/11 material here. It’s obviously the pivotal part of Giuliani’s public persona, what he was mainly known for pre-Trump. Giuliani’s actual response and legacy to that horrible day is much more complicated now than it was when this film was made, already coronated as “America’s Mayor,” a shine that largely followed him nationally up to his time in this current administration. It’s a little shameless to have footage used like this, pandering in a way to serve mainly the purpose of telling Giuliani’s story. It’s his movie, but this film’s handling of 9/11 feels very lacking. But it was also released in 2003, before anyone really saw the full picture? I don’t know. James Woods’ performance is kind of just what he used to do in movies; banter quickly and yell loudly. It’s a strange balance of wanting to portray Giuliani as this moral fortress who also casually cheats on his wife, shows no mercy in his law, uses the Southern Strategy to win an election and berates superiors as a showing of “strength.” He’s given a glowing aura the story can’t organically fulfill. On subtle purpose or accident, it just shows him as a brash, ineffective, “law and order” politician who gets thrust into history and is hailed in the moment for saying all the right things and being at the front and center. It’s not to say he didn’t do good things around 9/11; it’s just that he’s not nearly the unifying hero that this movie tried to make him out to be. Clearly this film has no cultural currency outside of that Twitter clip that went viral (not very indicative of the rest of the film, which is as a whole listless, uneventful and kind of boring), but it is a fascinating time capsule to see how reputations get built off of fictional work. He was America’s Mayor because that’s what folks were told he was. It’s how Trump was seen as a successful businessman who could stabilize the economy. Stories matter! Myth-making in politics is dangerous; this film is definitely guilty of this. It’s whatever. A Made-for-TV procedural biopic that can’t really rectify its desire to glorify its subject with a life’s story unable to provide many examples of why that glorification is wholly deserved. I really wonder what the good people at TOHO thought when they left the screening room after being shown Roland Emmerich’s take on the beloved Godzilla. It’s probably like what Walt Disney would think if those people who make cheap animated films with Rob Schneider for Redbox made a Mickey Mouse movie. Godzilla ‘98 is a thing to behold, a doofy creature feature where quite literally everyone is an idiot and common sense and basic physics are thrown to the wind in exchange for lots of explosions and loud roaring. The Godzilla roar is one of the most jolting noises in global cinema, and here, it’s sounded so much, all at once, you lose sight of it and just get lost in the cacophonous nonsense. I can’t deny Emmerich must’ve had the time of his life here, because this is a silly movie with a true sense of personality. It has no idea it’s so crazy and lazily written, and it marches around like it’s the second coming of Jurassic Park. Jan de Bont was originally supposed to make this, and I would’ve been so curious to see what that would’ve been like. He showed so much clever restraint on Speed, and Emmerich never met a restraint he didn’t want to break with 30 tons of explosives. He’s basically who he is as a filmmaker, a much less problematic, hokier Michael Bay who has destroyed the world like 5 times. Respect is due to how unfailingly sincere he is, even if his films have never been particularly great. Godzilla ‘98 is a big, uninspired, contrived mess, but you have to at least somewhat enjoy how happy-go-lucky it is. Like, they basically took a big dump on the Godzilla mythos and reduced him to a lifeless, CGI horror of a dinosaur, and I still didn’t hate this stupid movie because of how eager it is. I really, really hated how they lost Godzilla so much. No one in New York could not keep their tabs on a gigantic monster; multiple scenes have everyone asking “where’s Godzilla?” like it’s Homer Simpson trying to pitch Poochie to the Springfield TV execs. He’s right there, you’ll yell at the screen! He’s right there! Godzilla is right behind you! How did he go from rampaging in the streets to hiding in the sewer system? Why does the Mayor in this get so mad about evacuating the city after a gigantic dinosaur attacks? Why did this film cast Harry Shearer to play the news anchor when he also voices Kent Brockman on The Simpsons, making a phrase like “the Disney Store has been looted” less of a forbidding sign of the times in this movie and more like an episode of The Simpsons? Why was Hank Azaria’s character composite for “Animal” the cameraman “a slice of New York pepperoni pizza brought to life by a wizard?” Why did they try to lure Godzilla by putting down a big pile of fish in the middle of New York City? Why is the military so stupid in this, even by the standards of movie military people? Is that *really* Godzilla, or just a giant stupid lizard who apparently has the ability to lay hundreds of eggs, in the span of like an hour, much less. Why was a renowned nuclear physicist taking a picture of Godzilla with a disposable camera multiple times? Why didn’t I absolutely hate this movie? I think it was because of the French military subplot. I did enjoy that. Jean Reno is always great. This is ok? Gleefully dull, but with enough earnest panache and spirit that you can’t dismiss it outright. There is a great moment where Matthew Broderick (a casting decision I actually didn’t hate) tried to escape on an elevator at Madison Square Garden from a bunch of hungry baby Godzillas, barely getting the door to close to save his hide. He gets to another floor, and the door opens. He sees a bunch of other baby Godzillas chowing down on a popcorn machine. They look at him. He says, “wrong floor,” and closes the door. I laughed. This was a heck of a bit. Why couldn’t the whole movie just be that? Godzilla as an IP is fine now. This is, ironically, kind of like the 2001 Planet of the Apes film I just watched (in 2020). This one is probably more remembered since it was such a big thing, but they’re both big-budget one-stop pop culture moments that flamed out because no one really liked them. This was also far too long, but I don’t think that really matters at a point. Liked those practical sets, though! Love those practical sets. What a fun, nasty little movie. Tim Burton got the raw end of the deal that this wasn’t a bigger thing. It’s got such an anarchistic spirit, it’s laugh-our-loud funny, it’s insanely creative, the multi-narrative layout works well and the aliens are so fun. It’s a better movie than Independence Day, and I wish we talked about this every 4th of July instead of Independence Day. It’s such a wonderful lampoon of the establishment and hammers in Burton’s disdain for those in charge. It’s also got the frenetic spirit of a PG-13 Tex Avery/Chuck Jones/Bob Clampett cartoon. The dove gag and ensuing “no birds” sign, and the aliens’ general disdain for birds in general, made be howl. This movie is a heck of a comedy, on top of its delightful parody of sci-fi tropes. I’m most struck by this rewatch because the animation is starting to really date itself. This movie is almost 20 years old! That astounds me. I was, like, 8 when it came out, and I remember being so enthralled with how weird and funny it was. I was laughing so much as a kid in this that I purposefully wet my pants so I could avoid going to the bathroom and miss any of the movie. I was that hooked; I peed myself in honor of Shrek. It holds up because it’s one of those movies that always will. It’s just hard to make an animated movie with this much staying power, one that, even if some of the animation is looking a little rusty these days, still crackles with so much wit and has such a large heart. Jokes I still laugh very loudly at: the Duloc welcome song and the exploding song bird, the brimstone exchange, most all of Donkey’s lines, probably more. The welcome song was one of the funniest things I’d ever seen when I was 8. The timing of that is unreal! Everything about Shrek is good. It’s all at once such an oddball movie and a towering achievement in animation; I think one fuels the other. Hot take: Shrek is a great movie! I’d kind of seen rumblings about people revisiting this and being kind of awestruck by it, and I can happily say I am now in the number that says the 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie is fantastic. I watched this on HBOMax at my fiancée’s (now wife!) house, and when she saw what I had watched, she texted me and said “did you really watch Josie and the Pussycats?” She is a very understanding person! I mean, yowza. Where the heck did this come from? Where was its audience when it came out? Why am I just now watching this? It’s great! It’s basically using a nostalgic IP as a Trojan horse for scathing, hilarious satire on the blind consumerism of the late 90s/early 00s, where people just bought stuff without really thinking “hmm, why am I buying this? Is this good? Is it good for me?’ I feel like we’ve all become more mindful of being advertised to and about the products we buy, but a movie like this still makes you kind of look around and see that we are still a world dominated by brands. It’s that now brands have to play fair, er, maybe just more fair than they used to? Consumerism being a means for conformity and a suppression of individual ideas, championed by those who are trying to compensate for how their individualism backfired on them, is not a theme I expected in the 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie. I really couldn’t have told you a year ago I’d be singing this film’s praises, mainly because a year ago I had forgotten this movie existed. It’s great! Unlike a lot of the teen-driven movies of its time, this one is incredibly smart and has some serious panache to the style. It mimics the boy band music video template in its aesthetic, which ages more like a wise stylistic decision to date the material rather than a point of convenience in the filmmaking process. The entire cast is excellent (I mean this in no point of irony; Tara Reid is Oscar-worthy in this film, like on the same level as Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids, as are the script, songs and maybe even Parker Posey and Alan Cummings), the satire hits in waves (I cannot understate how biting some of it is, particularly the way it brazenly skewers the music business and its treatment of the art, artists and audience), the humor is belly laugh worthy (the Du Jour, 2000-2001 graphic got me right in the kisser), the writing and direction are creative and assured and the music is legitimately great. Du Jour in and of itself is such a brilliant sendup of the boy band. Every single note of satire is just great here; the world might be different than when this was made, but my goodness, this is such a clever, endearing, madcap film. It’s genius how they pull this off and so sad that few people really grappled with how great it is when it was released. It’s one of the best cult films I’ve ever seen, and one of the flat-out best satires, period. Watch this! It’s on HBO Max (at the time) and it’s legitimately superb. We can’t go to movie theaters right now but my goodness you can sure plop on the couch and watch the wonderful 2001 Josie and the Pussycats movie. One of the best things I’ve seen in awhile. When I was a kid, I didn’t watch this a ton after I saw it in theaters, primarily because this was the dark Disney movie I don’t think anyone in my family was keen on revisiting. I get why! It’s an inescapably human, decidedly non-Disney work, a gorgeous, philosophical rumination on religion, moral hypocrisy, the infallible nature of man, the power of kindness in a world that so often forgoes it, genocide, repressed human emotion fermented into pious villainy, the war within the church for servant love versus moral rule, inner beauty, societal oppression, etc. It’s not a movie 4-year-old Cory really “got,” I’m sure, and it’s precisely why, though they detract from the film’s swelling power at times, the gargoyles are necessary. Kids needed, y’know, something to hold on to, and wisecracking rock things do the trick! But adult Cory loves seeing something like the “Hellfire” music number in a Disney movie. This is the darkest “G” movie of all time! It’s like the Bambi’s mom scene for 90 minutes! Knowing deep down this isn’t even Quasimodo’s story, and though it’s thrilling and unforgettable to see him swing through the corridors of Notre Dame singing about going outside his shelled home. It’s Frollo’s story, the real Hunchback of Notre Dame, a grotesque man whose devious moral crusades mask his inability to rectify with his own shortcomings and fear of not being good enough for his false sense of righteousness. It’s a disturbingly relevant character, and Tony Jay voices the hell out of him. Musical numbers like “Topsy Turvy” and “Hellfire” just aren’t things Disney does or ever did. This film came out during a major transition for Disney and it feels like this film slipped through the cracks. A happy accident, if you will. I don’t want a watered down live-action version of this. I want the most PG-13 “G” movie of all time to stay how it is. If you just kind of let the gargoyle stuff be (the Jason Alexander’s gargoyle is attracted to a goat material is almost funny in a really embarrassing way), this film is the best thing the studio put out in the 90s that wasn’t Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin or Lion King. Heck, some of the highs here are as good as those movies, maybe better in some regards. This is a hallmark in taking a basic story trope, the boy and his dog, and driving in a wholly original, delightfully irreverent vision with it at its base. I really appreciate that Disney didn’t seem to hold this one back much; the studio’s output was at a point in the early 00s that, in a post-Tarzan world, they were making more non-musical risks. It eventually cratered and they had to return to the song-and-a-scene format of the 80s/90s Renaissance (Princess and the Frog/Tangled really starting in the second Renaissance), so some not good movies like Home on the Range and Chicken Little, slipped through. But so did outstanding films like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet. The voice cast here is just to die for (Daviegh Chase doing this and Spirited Away in the same year is unbelievable), and the animation is gorgeous. Sanders and DeBlois really let the backdrops take a dust into Hawaiian watercolor feel, and when a film this nutty and sweet also have a rigorous artistic backbone. These guys also know how to plot story like crazy so you know the pace, emotional beats (elite) and narrative payoff will be there. I wish Disney didn’t beat the heck out of this with that B-grade television show and all the direct-to-video sequels, because this film’s legacy deserves the gold standard. It’s one of Disney’s best animated films and one of its most proudly original. It’s also got the emotional sophistication you expect from the studio’s best works. It’s the A-team. The surfing Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride sequence is earned, not bought. When a film can pull something like that off so effortlessly to where it’s not like “hey, look, a great idea!,” that’s when you know."
"Jun 8, 2022",NEGATIVE," Observo en la portada del suplemento dominical de este periódico, un titular con aroma lírico. Dice así: “La emoción de volver a las salas de cine”. No he prescindido de ese acto presuntamente emocionante después de los tres meses de confinamiento. Y puedo jurar que excepto en casos mínimos no me ha asaltado ese sentimiento que inunda el alma. La calidad narrativa o poética, el suspense o el miedo, la identificación emocional, las sensaciones que te regala ser testigo de historias, personajes, situaciones y diálogos dotados de arte, sería un motivo excelso para practicar el ritual de volver al cine, pero si lo que veo y escucho me desinteresa, aburre o irrita me da igual sufrirlo en una gran pantalla y acompañado o en una pequeña y solo. Comprendo el atractivo que reunirá para mucha gente que después de año y medio desértico se estrene comercialmente una película como Dune, que pretende representar al gran espectáculo. Hollywood sabe desde hace mucho tiempo que dispone de una clientela tan numerosa como fiel que responde a sus fórmulas invariables. Ocurrió con la saga galáctica (me gustaron las primeras, el resto me parece tan mecánico como previsible) y el cine de Marvel, habitado exclusivamente por superhéroes y supervillanos, un género lleno de ruido, abarrotado de imágenes rápidas y clónicas, música incesante, vacío. Hablo como siempre de mis gustos. El permanente éxito de taquilla de ese tipo de películas confirma que la clientela es masiva. Sus razones tendrá. Pero el gran cine de aventuras que me ha hecho feliz desde niño creo recordar o compruebo en gozosas revisiones que era de otra forma. Bueno, para gustos están los colores, que sentencia la sabiduría popular. Me acerco al pase de prensa de Dune a los cines Kinépolis de Madrid, que garantizan una visión y un sonido apabullantes. Está dirigida por Denis Villeneuve, alguien con vocación de autor que ha realizado películas que me inquietaron o fascinaron. Como Incendios, Prisioneros, Sicario y La llegada. Junto a otras que me parecieron tediosas, irrelevantes, pretenciosas, incluida la innecesaria continuación de la justificadamente legendaria Blade Runner. Aquí vuelve a adaptar al cine la saga literaria que se inventó el novelista Frank Herbert. No la he leído. Los aficionados a la ciencia ficción la veneran. Tendrán sus motivos. Es un género literario que no he frecuentado, aunque me apasione la obra de Ray Bradbury. Tal vez este hiciera ciencia ficción, pero ante todo siempre le he considerado un poeta terrenal. Y ya sé que sus crónicas fueron marcianas. La primera adaptación al cine de Dune llevaba la firma del santificado David Lynch. Me pareció un horror, un caos sin la menor gracia. Me atornillo en la butaca con la esperanza de estar entretenido o maravillado durante el muy largo metraje de Dune. Pero desde el principio me pierdo un poco con su argumento. Lo sitúa en una galaxia desértica, en la que lo más codiciado es la explotación de una especia llamada melange. El emperador debe negociar entre el poder que otorga a los épicos y civilizados miembros de la familia Atreides y la respuesta que darán los villanos, oscuros y sanguinarios miembros de la familia Harkonnen. Todo ello rodeado por un halo de esoterismo, incesantes batallas galácticas y el protagonismo elegíaco de un Atreides joven y destinado a convertirse en el símbolo del bien. O sea, el rollo de siempre, el enfrentamiento entre la luz y la oscuridad. Las imágenes son espectaculares y sombrías, la música no descansa jamás, el tono de la historia pretende ser epopéyico y filosófico. Nada de esto evita mi indiferencia hacia los personajes ni lo que pretende contarme el director tan estilista. Ninguna emoción, por supuesto, pero sí un notable tedio. Y deseo que le vaya bien a Dune, si esto sirve para el retorno del gran público, imagino que mayoritariamente juvenil. Pero a mí no me provoca ninguna de las sensaciones que me hacen seguir amando el cine. ¿Qué cine? El que me gusta, el que considero bueno. A estas alturas, abandonar el dogmatismo me parece una indeseable quimera."
"May 30, 2022",POSITIVE,While clearly just the first half of a longer narrative&#44; what a thrilling first half this is&#46; 
"May 20, 2022",POSITIVE,While Dune 2021 is a very well presented and styled gourmet sci-fi dish&#44; for a platter stuffed with &quot;spice&quot;&#44; it unfortunately lacks a ton of Dune flavor&#46;
"May 17, 2022",NEUTRAL," If it had been an eight minute short, with the electrical Charlotte Rampling, as Reverend Mother Mohiam – in full goth regalia, in a darkened library, on a distant planet, pain-testing the blank slate that is Timothée Chalamet, as Paul Atreides, to gauge his capacity for impulse-control, and the suitability for the job of a Messiah – I would have given it a five-star, no questions asked. However, as things stand, the third screen adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert – the first famously being by David Lynch’s (1984), the second a miniseries (2000) –  is well over two hours long, and feels more like an obscure, scattered conversation overheard on a long train ride, peaking early with Rampling’s natural mystique, and then hitting a downward spiral – all dense plot and mild tedium, a bounty of sensual imagery wasted on zero substance. Its casting is a downer of sorts, too. Along with the choppy script by Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and Villeneuve, himself, the choice of actors is the film’s key mishap – predictably stretching from epic old-school to random indie, the weight of a performance as if measured in marketing-approved screen time.  Unlike the supremely confident Rampling, Stellan Skarsgård as arch-villain Baron (Vladimir!) Harkonnen and the brooding Javier Bardem as the earthy Fremen, Stilgar, had little manoeuvring space to flex their very significant acting chops. However, the hollow centre of the narrative doughnut firmly belongs to the permanently poker-faced Oscar Isaac, as Duke Leto Atreides, and the above-tagged Chalamet, as his son Paul – bearing both the burden of being the chosen one and carrying what was to be a thinking-man’s blockbuster without an essential element for this particular endeavour: action-hero bravado. A casting choice I could not explain in any other way than the fact that Chalamet seems a popular pick for big budget leads in recent years, and was pretty good in some of them. Rebecca Ferguson as the sorceress mother of Paul, Lady Jessica Atreides, of the order of Bene Gesserit, almost bridges the gap between the two thespian universes, simply by sheer determination to do her best for the story, and perhaps could have offered so much more were she not annoyingly framed as Terminator 2‘s (1991) Sarah Connor, thus her entire performance seemed to me a déjà vu. In a nutshell, nothing and no-one within Dune made me care even a tiny bit about a single royal from the noble House Atreides, lament the fate of the gorgeous yet deadly desert planet Arrakis, or even pay attention to the term spice, let alone remember why it is so valuable to everyone – which is why this incredibly sophisticated enterprise failed in a key mission of any quality storytelling, and therefore, a piece of cinema, at least with this one viewer – and that is some measure of emotional investment in a narrative. Haters are going to hate. As a Dune fan who read the book as a teenager, this version of the saga was Epic. As I said, haters are always going to hate. Readers, this film was magical and if you want a magical experiential viewing, see it in a theater with D Box motion seats."
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Paul's family is evidently descended from a long line of matadors.
"Apr 16, 2022",POSITIVE," Who would have thought I would at all be fascinated by an epic movie based on a 1965 sci-fi novel, written by Frank Herbert, that spins an involved tale that begins with Duke Leto of House Atreides—of the ocean planet Caladan—being assigned to replace House Harkonnen as fief ruler of Arrakis…to control the lucrative (awk!) SPICE production?  Neither had I ever read the essential (for true sci-fi fans) Herbert novel, Dune, NOR watched the  reportedly disappointing 1984 film adaptation….also titled Dune. So why am I now driven to wildly applaud this 156-minutes of otherworldly, ultra escape—a flick I have been purposely avoiding since its inception?  ANSWER: Because this movie version of Dune (aka Dune: Part One) directed and co-written by Denis Villeneuve, has so enveloped my thoughts and dreams (at least one night, anyway) that I now give up. It has grabbed me in ways never felt since the first time I saw Star Wars during the summer of 1977. Let’s call Dune: Part One a deeply thinking person’s Star Wars.  Maybe I just love the giant sandworms of Dune because I groove on the sarlacc in Revenge of the Jedi. But there must be more to my Dune “thing” than one scary creature.  The paramount attractions, the visuals, connect immediately. The landscapes, costuming, sets, makeup, creatures, and wild special effects are stunning. So awesome are they that of Dune’s 10 Oscar noms, four won for Cinematography, Visual Effects, Production Design and Editing. Factor in two more wins for the Sound and Hans Zimmer’s Score.  Basically, the epic tale is one of political power and corruption set way into the future. (Egad, have we no hope of someday living in a society devoid of such strife?) Families are pitted against families, and planets against planets. Good and evil exist as do loyalty and deception. These are themes common to any literary structure in which—of course—conflict must exist. In Dune, the conflicts are often spectacularly shown (huge battles) or shadowy (Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, being groomed as a potential leader). Topping or at least equalling it all, is an international cast of impressive actors. Some of their characters will not make it to Dune: Part Two, to be released Oct. 20, 2023. (That is, unless they are somehow brought back from death.) Of course, I will not divulge who survives here.  The relatively brief list includes a Spell Check nightmare of Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides, the ducal heir; Oscar Isaac (Duke Leto Atreides); Josh Brolin (Gurney Halleck); Stellan Skarsgård (Baron Vladimir Harkonnen); Stephen McKinley Henderson (Thufir Hawat, the Mentat); Zendaya (Chani, a mysterious Fremen woman); Javier Bardem (Stilgar, Fremen leader); and Jason Momoa (Duncan Idaho, sword master of House Atreides). "
"Mar 30, 2022",POSITIVE," El principal escollo de todas las adaptaciones fallidas de Dune siempre fue, más que los costos de producción para la recreación de ese mundo desértico en el que deambulan los personajes, cómo dosificar toda la información concentrada a lo largo de la saga. Es decir, cómo articular la inmensa cantidad de trivia sobre distintos linajes, poderes, economía de extraccionismo y detalles híper específicos de trajes, armas y equipamiento, sin dejar de conservar cierta plasticidad y flexibilidad cinematográfica. En estas arenas movedizas se hundió nada menos que David Lynch, un artista intrínsecamente plástico. Si volvemos a aquella película, el principal problema no era la limitada libertad creativa bajo la supervisión de Dino de Laurentiis, ni el poco aire de movimiento de cámara que le brindaba el diseño de sets tan barrocos como estáticos, sino la hiperinflación narrativa. Como a Lynch nunca le gustó explicar sus películas, sus films siempre resolvieron todo por la vía visual. Sin embargo, ya desde el comienzo su Dune empezaba con un insoportable bombardeo de información, y en numerosas oportunidades se atoraba en una sucesión de personajes que narraban didácticamente un montón de detalles de la trama. Denis Villeneuve, un director que sabe administrar como pocos cantidades inusuales de información, tenía delante el reto definitivo, el gran gusano de arena a domar. Lo magistral de Villeneuve en este caso fue ir por la senda opuesta a mucho de lo que lo caracterizaba, optando por reducir la información a lo mínimo y centrarse, por el contrario, en el aspecto mucho más sensual, no narrativo, cuasi abstracto, que emanaba del libro. De esta manera, Duna funciona a veces como una extraña ópera abstracta en la que percibimos más las intensidades que la representación de los sucesos, y a veces no sólo no sabemos en qué parte de la historia estamos, sino qué es lo concreto que está sucediendo. Así, en la película podemos ver esa suerte de blitzkrieg traicionera de los Harkonnen, pero el registro de la catástrofe va más allá de los personajes y sus cuerpos: el terreno del conflicto y del drama parecería reducirse a algo más primigenio, donde los misiles y los estallidos se estampan en la pantalla en la forma de una fusión de luz y sombras, y donde las personas corren y perecen en su huida, pero no como seres vivos, sino como un grumo de óleo espeso que sobresale en la superficie de un lienzo (Duna por momentos es la respuesta futurista a la premisa de performatividad bélica pura de Dunkirk). Incluso en el momento apoteósico en que Paul Atrides (Timothée Chalamet) se enfrenta al gran gusano de arena, la boca del monstruo no se nos revela de la forma hiperdetallada en la que caería cualquier producción con un departamento de CGI multimillonario de hoy en día; al contrario, el avance es, más que hacia una sucesión de dientes aserrados de lamprea, hacia un agujero negro que denota un vacío total, algo que es peligroso, pero en una dimensión más metafísica que concreta. Es este uno de los múltiples ejemplos en los que se muestra que todo en la película es más operístico, incorpóreamente musical, que narrativo. No sería un atrevimiento decir que la autoría de Duna se disputa por partes iguales entre Denis Villeneuve y Hans Zimmer. En esta nueva búsqueda de sonidos o tonalidades que se superponen a lo melódico, Zimmer encastra con una dimensión persistente de los films del canadiense: en la mayoría de sus obras siempre hay algo imponente, tan inasible como insoportable de asimilar. En Incendies esta dimensión sobrecogedora se encapsulaba en ese juego matemático que explicaba el embarazo de una madre a manos de su propio hijo. En Arrival esta dimensión la encarna tanto la nave con forma de semilla que pende vertical a metros de la tierra como esos seres paquidérmicos con los que intentan comunicarse los humanos. Esta dimensión daliniana encarnada en las kilométricas extremidades también se daba en la araña de Enemy. Y en Sicario, si bien no hay un monstruo descomunal en lo físico concreto, la idea de que el verdadero mal está infiltrado en las fuerzas del orden adquiere una nueva dimensión terrorífica y omnipresente. Duna está todo el tiempo atravesada por este juego enmudecedor de escalas, pero el verdadero efecto es más sonoro que visual, con esos ensordecedores ruidos blancos de Zimmer que se superponen como bocinas o sirenas afásicas (sin que se pueda casi precisar si son diegéticos o extradiegéticos). Lo visual corre por el mismo carril: lo que vuelve terrorífico al Barón es esa mezcla entre gordura e ingravidez, la manera grácil en que flota entremezclada con esa grasa que lo envuelve (y que parecería estar densamente inspirada en el coronel Kurtz de Apocalypse Now). Hay una escena en la que el Barón sufre un ataque casi letal y de repente lo encontramos en una esquina del techo, respirando en un tubo de ventilación con esa fragilidad fiera que sólo tienen los animales acorralados: la sensación de asco y horror que genera es similar a la de encontrarnos a un murciélago herido que revolotea en nuestra habitación. Así, lo crucial en Duna son las imágenes y los sonidos, o más bien las emociones puras aguardando debajo de las arenas de estas imágenes y sonidos. Villeneuve muestra, con nada menos que un megablockbuster, el uso de su segunda voz casi como si pudiese controlarnos con la habilidad de la reverenda Gaius Helen Mohiam."
"Mar 29, 2022",NEGATIVE," There are fans for whom Dune’s second coming has been anticipated with a kind of religious devotion. The first cinematic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s cult science fiction novel in 1984 was a film David Lynch would rather forget, so there were high hopes for Denis Villeneuve’s new version. Could they get it wrong again? Well yes, they could, but in a completely different way. This new Dune has tended to polarise its audiences, with some of its detractors now having second thoughts about the 1984 film. I remember that movie as a complete mess, but history lays the blame on the studio rather than the director. David Lynch, at the time, was one of the world’s most acclaimed emerging filmmakers, and there were huge expectations. It became over-ambitious, with the studios doing much of the cutting and editing, and Lynch not even present for retakes. If Lynch’s Dune could have been conceived as a mini-series, such as the highly successful Twin Peaks (1989-91), it might have had a better chance. (There was a three-part mini-series of Dunein 2000, directed by John Harrison, which proved massively popular at the time.) Even Lynch’s mangled final version clocks in at three hours, with a credit to Alan Smithee, the imaginary Hollywood director that gets the blame for Hollywood movies the real directors want to disown. Nowadays, Hollywood has a new method of dealing with a long, intractable story: turn it into a franchise. Why make only one blockbuster movie when you can stretch it out to three or four, or – in the case of Star Wars – infinity? So when faced with the problem of adapting a complex, sprawling novel with no fewer than five sequels, today’s studios see an opportunity to keep cranking out revenue for years to come. To me, the new Dune felt like one long, slow build-up for the movies ahead. The major characters and plot details are laid in; the battle lines are drawn up between goodies and baddies; we’ve been introduced to the special features of the desert planet; but by the time the credits roll it feels as if we’ve only seen the preamble. It’s often been said that Dune is unfilmable, and this new version is a tacit acknowledgement that there’s more here than can be squeezed into the standard two hours. To promise a whole series of films might be dressed up as a gift for fans, but there’s a lingering cynicism about this project – a feeling that it’s essentially a way of maximising returns at the box office. Many years ago I dipped into Dune (1959) and found it virtually unreadable, but the novel has millions of admirers. Herbert is famous for dealing with a raft of issues that have become only more important over time. There’s an ecological theme; an analysis of the human propensity to follow tyrants and strongmen; a warning about the dangerous nexus of religion and political extremism; a look at the appeal and effects of mind-altering drugs, and so on. Name a pressing topic of our time and it’s there in Dune. This doesn’t, however, do anything to improve Herbert’s prose style. In this, he is like so many famous American science fiction writers whose books are full of good ideas and bad writing. For another prime example try reading anything by Robert A. Heinlein. Somehow, Villeneuve and his colleagues have managed to capture the turgid aspect of Herbert’s prose in this new Dune, which is jam-packed with mournful stares, endless mumbo-jumbo relating to the House of Atreides, doomy prophecies, awesome responsibilities, and on and on. Everybody looks vaguely hungover and grumpy – as if this is the best way of conveying Deep Seriousness. For those of us who haven’t spent their lives studying the Dune novels, it’s portentous and confusing. The story is set in a distant future when interplanetary travel is commonplace, but for some unknown reason everyone likes to dress and act like figures from the Middle Ages. Feudalism seems to be the preferred political system, with the known universe under the control of the Padishah Emperor Corrino IV, who is every bit as teacherous as the Roman emperors. The good guys are the noble House of Atreides, who are invited by the Emperor to take control of the desert planet Arrakis, which provides a valuable ‘spice’ used for interplanetary travel. What they don’t know is that their stewardship is simply a ruse, a set-up for an attack by their hated enemies, the war-like House of Harrkonen. The reason for this double-cross is that the Emperor sees the House of Atreides as an implicit threat to his power – rather like Vladimir Putin views the Ukraine. There is, apparently, a prophecy or two to this effect, with the leading candidate for the Messiah being young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Naturally this makes Paul a marked man, but he is well protected by his sturdy, macho helpers, and the mystical charms of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who belonged to a sect of cosmic nuns before she married Paul’s dad, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Are you following this? The star of the movie is a massive CGI desert worm that gets excited whenever it detects a vibration in the sand. Its acting is far more expressive than any human character. Yet the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen (free men, get it?), have learned how to avoid worms. By the end of this first installment Paul has hooked up with the desert tribes and absolutely nothing has been resolved. I hope this doesn’t count as a spoiler but it’s painfully obvious at the half way mark that – like Paul Atreides – we’re in this for the long haul. I’ve generally found it’s impossible to say whether someone is acting well or badly when they’re kitted out in fancy dress and obliged to intone a lot of silly-sounding lines that advance an improbable plot. It’s no surprise that nobody in Dune has been nominated for an Oscar as a lead or supporting actor, not even the worm. Neither does Villeneuve score a Best Director nomination for his ponderous work. The only truly deserved nomination may be Greig Fraser, for some impressive cinematography. Although it has its fans and admirers, Dune can count itself lucky to make the short-list for Best Picture. The good news is that the studio will probably have a further five or more opportunities to improve their standing. Get ready for a long war of attrition."
"Mar 28, 2022",NEGATIVE," Broadcast television is tanking so badly that ABC, the television network that airs the Oscars, has insisted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that eight categories be cut from the annual awards telecast, including Film Editing, Production Design, Sound, Original Score, and Hair and Makeup.  Worried about ratings and therefore ad dollars, ABC (a division of the Walt Disney Company), is willing to ignore the essential crafts of Hollywood filmmaking, from editing to hairdos, in favor of the rancid Best Original Song category. That way the aging broadcast TV audience won’t miss out on seeing performances by such contemporary crowd pleasers as former country-and-western sitcom star Reba McEntire, and maybe even overmodest, ubiquitous Lin-Manuel Miranda. Miranda also directed an Oscar-nominated film this year, so if he were to sing his song, it would be like if Alfred Hitchcock had also written “Que Sera, Sera” for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) and had to perform it onstage at the Oscars instead of Doris Day. Or, since Miranda has nominations for two movies, only one of which he directed, if Hitchcock had written a song in The King and I. This is what a film director is to ABC-Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros.-HBO Max. What film directing has become in Hollywood is a team-building exercise with lots of group hugs and a public-facing mascot from the generic world of show biz. The mascot could be anyone camera-friendly. Being a director is now something of an honorary position at that level, like being the Grand Marshal of the Hollywood Christmas Parade. ABC has lost faith in the films themselves, swallowing the right-wing notion that the nominees do not reflect popular taste. Therefore the less time spent on them the better. Give the people what we think they want: Beyoncé and Billie Eilish. Anything but actors from these movies. Olivia Colman? Where are the three Spider-men? Where is The Batman? The atmosphere in which the highest honors in filmdom are now broadcast to the masses is more like an episode of Wheel of Fortune in which the contestants can’t solve the puzzle, no matter how many vowels they’ve bought. The audience on social media engages in Frustration Discourse as they watch loser-winners grapple with their moments of professional glory on live TV, all so ABC can continue to exist in a world that has left it behind. It’s also a world in which actual movies have become marginal, especially during the Oscars. Every moment is confused, all of it a ritual no one in the film industry believes in anymore but enacts to ward off demons of their future: simultaneous release in theaters and on streaming, no back end, no residuals, voiceover work in animation and video games, shrinking foreign markets, foreign markets where film releases are moral quandaries, a series of bad decisions like the ones that led to The Suicide Squad, Cameo, and the final, furthest away specter: a world without an In Memoriam reel.  As I watched this year’s Oscar films, a cargo ship called the Felicity Ace burned in the North Atlantic. Massive and packed with luxury automobiles bound for the U.S., it was on fire and adrift, abandoned by its crew, its shipment of expensive cars doomed. Life at the beginning of the pandemic reminded me of the Costa Concordia, the luxury cruise ship in Jean-Luc Godard’s Film Socialisme that later sank, a metaphor for the shipwreck of capitalism that Godard guided into reality in 2010. Now this new Titanic appeared without people, only machines, floating aimlessly and aflame as the pandemic moved into a new phase, possibly its end phase but probably not. CODA admirably focuses on the working life of a Gloucester fisherman family in which the father (Troy Kotsur), mother (Marlee Matlin), and son (Daniel Durant) are deaf (and played by deaf actors), and the daughter is not. Their struggles with the hearing world and with unfair labor practices, and their plan to collectivize the docks, are the backdrop for daughter Ruby’s conflicted desire to get away from the sea and go to the Berklee College of Music. The deaf characters are easy to relate to in this pleasant, unmemorable movie. For instance, even though I can hear, I would have the same confused, impatient reactions were I forced to attend a high school musical. Presented with a group of teens singing David Bowie’s “Starman,” I would watch in silent frustration, too. The issue is that for me it would be easier to forget. The self-conscious boredom and fascism of Denis Villeneuve’s films, along with their sandy-inky beige-taupe-gray-black-brown-orange color palette, make them look different than other blockbusters. They are in fact post-blockbusters, and Villeneuve’s unnecessary new version of the first part of Dune shows how a depressed attitude that has given in to all that is wrong with current Hollywood filmmaking, and has also given in to all that is wrong with the world, might appear to be new. Especially to a director who believes mankind still tells stories around the fire at dusk, or after dinner, or before watching Euphoria, which Zendaya is also in, but more often. After all, as Flaubert said about writing Salammbô, “Few will guess how depressed one had to be to undertake the resuscitation of Carthage!” Same with the resuscitation of Dune, which already exists as a movie, a TV miniseries, and a documentary about a movie version that didn’t happen and should have. The futility and pointlessness of Villeneuve’s secondhand white-savior epic comes through as laziness. To understand that, we need only compare one scene from the 1984 David Lynch version to the same scene in the new one. In Villeneuve’s hand-in-the-painbox scene, nothing is charged with hidden meaning, and nothing seems painful to Timothée Chalamet’s Paul. It is not much of a trial for him, and all the work in the scene is done by Charlotte Rampling’s Bruce Conner Couch costume. We know Chalamet will not have a problem. It’s already clear he is “The One.” In Lynch’s version, which incidentally occurs in a movie that is not that great by the end but is at least very weird throughout, Kyle MacLachlan’s Paul seems genuinely frightened by being forced to put his hand deep inside a woman’s box. The viewer does not yet understand Paul’s status in this world, and there is no way to know what will happen when he places his hand in this trap. Where Lynch is hallucinatory, intense, and Freudian (or, in a word, hysterical), Villeneuve is dull and literal, and his scene is simply a test that allows the lead character to move up a level, like in a video game or a YA novel, which we knew he was going to do. Later in the movie, the idea that Chalamet could just speak in a certain tone of voice and other people would do exactly what he wanted them to do reminded me of Brooklyn teens ordering in restaurants. Lynch’s penile sandworms, pre-CGI, were better realized and more menacing, and the Harkonnens, whose name is now pronounced differently, were more disgusting in 1984. This Dune toys with the idea of genocide, but it’s mostly a movie for people who like to memorize things. All these stupid names, one after another. Frank Herbert was trying too hard. So is Villeneuve. This basic Lawrence of Arabia tribalism and its jihad-mongering, with its conflicted son and dangled possibility of revolution, were also aspects of Villeneuve’s equally ponderous Blade Runner sequel. Since these notions have already appeared in so many other twenty-first-century blockbusters, it is hard to ascribe them to Villeneuve-as-auteur, despite all the black water he dips them in before rolling them in the sand. Jackie Wilson said the Troubles were a wee bit of fun now, weren’t they? In our little house on our little street, which were fine for us when they were being bombed, we had perfect TV reception, and Pap (Ciarán Hinds) was twenty years younger than Granny (Judi Dench), who loved nothing more than winning acting awards. Pa (Jamie Dornan) was handsome and good, when he was around, and in perfect shape from those Fifty Shades of Grey sessions, and Ma (Caitríona Balfe) was such a put-upon knockout mommy like she was in Ford v Ferrari that she should have been in this a lot more, instead of it being such a Balfe fast. Our director, Kenneth Branagh, he loves Shakespeare and Agatha Christie and, yes, even Thor, which he reminds us of with a shot of a comic book, but in black-and-white, unlike the splashy Marvel comics in West Side Story, which is also set around the same time, has a lot of music in it, and is about two sides fighting a turf war. Belfast is in black and white so Branagh can separate it from his hack work, because it’s a personal story from his childhood, and because documentaries about the past are in black and white (or “monochrome,” as Netflix calls it now when promoting films like Passing), and Belfast takes place in the past and it’s about real things that happened. 2021 was a big year for b&w, and this movie falls in line with one of its current uses: telling stories for dads. Branagh’s explosion of treacle, with Jude Hill as a cuddly blond toddler, was the most popular. Mike Mills’s C’mon C’mon, with Joaquin Phoenix as a public radio producer shepherding a neurotic little kid (Woody Norman), was enervating to the point of narcolepsy, the opposite of what Branagh’s doing in Belfast. It was unlovable.  The best of these films, and therefore the most ignored, was Alexandre Rockwell’s Sweet Thing, in which his own daughter and son (Lana Rockwell and Nico Rockwell) are menaced by an alcoholic father, who Will Patton plays with every stop pulled out, a performance of total fucked-up-edness, a man trying to be nice before he loses it completely and swirls down the drain. Rockwell’s film also featured Van Morrison music like Belfast, but not in the same celebratory, uninhibited way. Sweet Thing is set in a kind of fairytale, skid-row present and shot in New Bedford, Massachusetts, without any cute Irishness, even though there’s no doubt some could have been located in the area. Sweet Thing confronted American racism and child abuse and cops shooting black kids, none of which were presented as fun like the Troubles in Belfast, though Rockwell placed them in a beautiful film where his use of black and white was justified and worked. It made Sweet Thing more immediate, not less. It was clearly a Gen X movie about childhood, in which Rockwell’s memories of freedom and neglect were poured into a constricted, dangerous present. Sweet Thing was also unlike Mills’s film, which took place coast to coast in Dullsville, U.S.A., and catered to and indulged kids while recapitulating white parental self-regard instead of exposing it like Rockwell did in his film. C’mon C’mon (terrible title) attempted to do that through documentary scenes with black parents and their children that struck me as well-intentioned cop-outs. It therefore made sense that Phoenix worked for NPR in it, but I don’t think that was the idea.  Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem are post-life versions of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in Being the Ricardos, spruced up and perfected by computers and surgeons to exist as animatronic forms whose ability to handle drama and comedy surpasses anything humans could do back in the 1950s. Creating these androids on his keyboard and in the studio must have been so difficult for Aaron Sorkin that he dropped his own mask and finally admitted it was entertainment, not politics, that has interested him all along. What else could explain the outright fabrications in this movie, which include a phone call from J. Edgar Hoover, in front of a live studio audience, that washes away Lucille Ball’s 1930s membership in the Communist Party and makes everyone cheer? This right-wing appeal to Hoover and the FBI is the opposite of Clint Eastwood’s in J. Edgar (2011), where Eastwood and Leonardo DiCaprio carefully outlined how a police state was created in the U.S. That Sorkin glosses the McCarthy Era like this and places himself to the right of Eastwood is surprising. But it makes sense, because no one in Hollywood is more aligned with the entertainment/tech industry/Washington politics nexus than the power-loving, success-worshipping, union-hating Sorkin. Somehow this extended to slighting Karl Freund, the German cinematographer of I Love Lucy, who invented the three-camera sitcom setup that’s still in use seventy years later. Why Sorkin chose to do that is also telling: it made Desi Arnaz look smarter, Sorkin’s goal with all his protagonists.  Jessica Chastain’s performance as Tammy Faye Bakker, disgraced televangelist wife and singer, borders on the monstrous. By the end it almost crosses over into a kind of American Fellini. It doesn’t, though, because The Eyes of Tammy Faye is a whitewash of this con artist’s life. Like her husband, Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield), Tammy Faye was a grifter who preyed on the homebound via broadcast TV, convincing them to send money so that their souls would be saved and they would go to Heaven. The Bakkers of course lived in luxury and built a Christian theme park with that money. No one at any time seems to have brought up that they were turning Jesus Christ into Mickey Mouse. Chastain and her screenwriter and director want us to believe Tammy Faye was an ambitious but God-fearing Christian puppeteer desperate to get out of her Minnesota hometown. The film excuses her, insisting her Christianity was deeper than that of her televangelist competitors—Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, and their ilk. Though it is clear Tammy Faye empathized with gay men stricken with AIDS and tried to convince her followers to treat them as human beings, not as the pariahs the Reagan Right wanted them to be, this fact doesn’t exonerate her. As a Christian, it was the least she could do. Her second husband, a church builder and developer played in the film by Sam Jaeger, ran afoul of the law just like her first. The film, however, shows Tammy Faye alone at the end, toughing it out in a crap condo, not married to conman number two.  The fun here is supposed to be in watching Chastain transform from a cute, peppy, and horny Bible-college student in the late 1950s into the full-on, Divine-in-a-John-Waters-movie look of Tammy Faye’s infamy thirty years later. While she is never not a chipper cornball high on her own supply, she is never tragic, either, because like a Trump wife, she shits in a gold toilet. Garfield’s Jim is a closeted, prissy fake, yes, but Tammy Faye is a grotesque with a Betty-Boop-meets-Sarah-Palin voice, unhappy because she’s blinkered to reality. Through it all, the Bakkers’ audience of twenty million kept sending them money whenever Tammy asked. Though she did live in a life-size dollhouse, her fate was to become a national joke, not the heroine of an Ibsen play. King Richard demonstrates, step by step, the value of sticking to your plan, even if some folks think you’re crazy. I don’t mean Richard Williams’s plan to turn his daughters Venus and Serena into tennis champs. I mean Will Smith’s plan to win an Oscar. Williams, like the actor who plays him, knew the value of finely tuning a capitalist product and introducing it into the marketplace as a brand. This is a business movie, which reaches its height not when Venus Williams (Saniyya Sidney) almost wins her second professional match and reveals her talent and grace to the world, but when the Williams family decides to hold out for a better sneaker deal. “Nine months later,” we read on screen at the end of the movie, “Venus signed a contract with Reebok for twelve million dollars.” I don’t mind being nudged to cry as the Williams sisters’ reach for the stars in Compton. But I call “out” when I am asked to weep with joy over their first professional product endorsement. I did not quite get why the theater director protagonist (Hidetoshi Nishijima) in Drive My Car was not allowed by the theater company to drive himself to work every day. The idea that it would have been an insurance liability seemed odd. In any case, his 1987 red Saab 900 becomes essential to Hamaguchi’s film, and without it the rehearsals of Uncle Vanya that make up much of the rest of the drama would have been stifling. Not that the film is necessarily opened up by the driving, since a lot of that is interior: a man inside a car listening to the voice of his dead wife (Reika Kirishima) on tape while another woman (Tōko Miura) drives him around. Cars attained a strange new level of prominence in movies in 2021, an indicator of our changing relationship to the automotive as cars helped destroy the planet, became unaffordable as the pandemic continued, and sometimes burned and sank into the ocean. I don’t mean in F9, the latest Fast & Furious movie, in which a car travels into outer space, driven by Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris. F9, a truly stupid movie, wastes resources, just burns through them to make money, and part of its stupidity is that it makes room for Helen Mirren and Cardi B before explicitly comparing the idea of “family” to a 1970 Dodge Charger. That’s not it, Vin. Not at all. But it is not too far off from Julia Ducournau’s staggering Titane, a French film in which a woman (Agathe Rousselle) has sex with a Cadillac (baby, you can fuck my car), gets pregnant, and gives birth to a hybrid. As in Spencer and France, these films explored women’s relationships with their automobiles, putting them in the driver’s seat instead of men. Titane took this to an extreme that was maybe too much for car-centric North American viewers. It didn’t meet with the same outrage as David Cronenberg’s 1996 adaptation of J. G. Ballard’s Crash only because it came out during the pandemic, and the few people who saw it were rendered speechless. It was my favorite film of last year. Cars develop consciousness in these films. The way the voice of the wife returned, speaking through the Saab’s tape player in Drive My Car, pointed in that direction—the direction of getting over grief and loss as we try to return to life. It is a trend that began in art films with the talking limos in the garage at night that ended Leos Carax’s Holy Motors in 2012. In the recent King Car, an underseen Brazilian movie that is almost as good as Bacurau and has a lot in common with Titane, director Renata Pinheiro creates a revolutionary situation in Pernambuco, prompted by a talking car in a junkyard. Sex with vehicles ensues. “From this evolution there is no return,” King Car explains. Through intercourse with machines, in this contaminated environment, “we discover our true values. It’s where we face our ghosts.” These three films are the products of different cultures with different film traditions, but there is a direct line connecting the ghosts in each. Car accidents were way up in the U.S. last year. College students strapped for cash began living in their cars inside university parking garages, and reality TV shows staged deadly airborne car stunts. A show at the Museum of Modern Art called Automania put cars on display like in a showroom, parked safely away from the road. It was evident on movie screens, however, that the evolution of the automobile as a sexy, dangerous vehicle continues in new directions, and they are not driverless ones. Cars exert a different kind of control than that and have a tight hold on us, driving mankind. The in-reverse, out-of-gas moving truck scene in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza approaches driving from the opposite direction. It’s an anti-chase that glides backwards without a roar. Alana Haim guides the truck expertly, younger men nattering at her, threatening to choke her. The film becomes obsessed with the 1973 oil crisis, which is maybe why it’s so frenetic and high-energy. Characters are in motion and running—Haim runs so much in the film that it becomes like a parody of The Worst Person in the World. The adult men in Licorice Pizza are automotive maniacs, poor players strutting their hour in the movie, actors and directors playing actors and directors. Defined by nostalgia for 1970s California, Licorice Pizza is to 2021 what American Graffiti was to 1973, but from the other side of the mirror. Anderson’s 1970s beats George Lucas’s 1950s because Anderson is expressing a minority opinion, not celebrating a majority culture. American Graffiti existed as something it knew everyone who saw it would agree on. Licorice Pizza turns the camera around and speaks to the few. Thus, everything is backwards and wrong in Licorice Pizza, as it was in the 1970s when compared to now: children raise themselves, adults date teens, teens start businesses, restaurants alienate customers, and getting work is an audition for something else, with hidden, sexual motivations barely under the surface erupting as stupid jokes. It is impossible to know whether things are based on skill or luck as the world slips backwards into the future. Everything is temporary and can be snuffed in an instant, like the waterbed sales that reverse supply and demand overnight. The effect is that Licorice Pizza can never be central to the culture it is part of. That is its strength. It exists on the edge of Hollywood and is written in the margins of the film industry, adjacent to it, with an address in the Valley. This movie seems like a transitional film for Anderson, a stopgap, like so many things that emerged during the pandemic. And like the pandemic, it goes on too long but time flies. The melodrama in Pedro Almodóvar’s latest film is deceptively muted, though the film’s plot is brazenly manipulative. The director of All About My Mother makes it easy to guess how this story of thwarted motherhood will unfold as soon as Janis (Penélope Cruz) and Ana (Milena Smit), both pregnant, end up in the same hospital room. This concentration on the present-day mechanics of the plot buries the film’s parallel story, about mass killings in fascist Spain in the 1930s under Franco. Parallel Mothers is a film of corpses and skeletons as much as it is about babies and children. Almodóvar leads the viewer to an excavation the same way Janis leads Ana to understand the history of her country. Unlike the story of what happened at the hospital, it should not come as a surprise to her. Almodóvar has always dug up whatever is buried in the subconscious of his characters. As they fall into comas, we find they have been raised in caves or that their family history is hidden below the surface in a mass grave. From film to film, his characters’ psychological states come more and more to resemble the political history of Spain. At the same time, his filmmaking, like Penélope Cruz, does not age. He seems more contemporary the more he becomes an outlier to the mainstream of commercial cinema. Billy Wilder told Almodóvar there was one thing he should never do, and that was to give in to the temptation to make a film in Hollywood. Almodóvar has made twenty-two films since his first in 1980, and now we learn he is on the verge of making his first feature in English, with Cate Blanchett. Either it is time for him to show us how it’s done, or this is a bad idea. Over forty years, we’ve learned from his films that things usually don’t go so well, but it’s foolish not to be optimistic. As things fall apart, at least they can look great. That is a lesson Maggie Gyllenhaal did not keep in mind as she adapted Elena Ferrante’s novel The Lost Daughter for the big screen (Netflix). In Almodóvar’s Julieta, two actresses played the same woman twenty or so years apart, as Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley do here. Where Almodóvar dressed his seaside tale in 1980s New Wave colors and Hitchcockian ambiance, Gyllenhaal’s beach melodrama is a new kind of arthouse film for home viewing, in which seriousness of intent must be signaled at all times. Through flashbacks, Gyllenhaal makes the bizarre or mysterious elements of the film too clear, right up to the end, when everything goes haywire in the opposite direction, and it becomes hard to understand what’s happening. Colman phones her daughter and bleeds into the tide with an orange in her hand, a stew of symbols assembled from previous scenes.  The problem is the flashbacks. We see Buckley as the young Colman, an English professor and a harried mother and wife embarking on an affair with a colleague who is supposed to be brilliant. Played by Peter Sarsgaard to resemble late-period Michael Stipe, this sensitive, bearded academic cracks jokes about Pierre Bourdieu and Paul Ricœur (a first for Netflix). It is therefore obvious in a second why the middle-aged Colman feels such guilt for abandoning her family. Still discombobulated years later, she vacations in Greece next to a sketchy, semi-Mafia family like the one that lives across the street from me. She finds herself dancing to “Livin’ on a Prayer” by night and translating Dante into English by day, two strange activities we didn’t expect from her or anyone this year. The film follows the Chekhov gun rule, but with a hatpin Colman gives to shady, unstable Dakota Johnson. It was only a matter of time before Johnson returned it.  The movies force us to ask questions. Seeing The Eyes of Tammy Faye right after Nightmare Alley prompted a brain teaser, since the two films share a scene: Would you rather see Jessica Chastain give Andrew Garfield a hand job in a bathtub, or see Toni Collette do the same to Bradley Cooper? That was the old-timey con-woman convincer move, as far as Hollywood was concerned last year.  Guillermo Del Toro’s remake of Nightmare Alley corrupts an evil story. William Lindsay Gresham’s terrifying and singular 1946 novel was itself a tale of corruption and the great sui generis work of hardboiled American fiction. Its plot did not need to be tampered with, but Del Toro and Kim Morgan’s screenplay cheapens something that purposefully dealt in tawdriness. Since this film comes close to being Del Toro’s best, it is too bad he had to throw out the penultimate sections of the book. I mark it down to his essential torturer’s mentality. His flaw as a screenwriter-director-producer it that he thinks of himself as a great liberal and friend of the common man, but he can’t not revel in the infliction of pain and suffering on his villains. So instead of just making the millionaire industrialist Grindle (Richard Jenkins) a vindictive and deluded mark for Cooper’s fake mentalist, Stan, Del Toro has to turn Grindle into a serial killer who must be beaten to death, and then have Grindle’s bodyguard (Holt McCallany) run over by a car, in graphic detail. In Gresham’s novel, Grindle becomes Stan’s Javert, the figure who hunts him, turning him into a drunk, a hobo, and finally the thing he most fears becoming, a carnival circus geek. Here I must indulge in psychoanalysis, like Cate Blanchett’s character does in the movie. In fact, I suspect on some level Del Toro wants the viewer to. I put his cruelty down to his subconscious identification with Grindle more than Stan. At some level, Del Toro recognizes himself in this wealthy sociopath, an aspect of his personality he wants to punish and kill, harshly. There is no mercy there. That kind of unnecessary cruelty continues to mar his serious work, as it did in The Shape of Water. Otherwise, Del Toro’s Nightmare Alley is a model of atmosphere and production design, with beautiful, committed performances from character actors who were given great roles, most of all Collette, Jenkins, McCallany, David Strathairn, Willem Dafoe, Mary Steenburgen, and Tim Blake Nelson, though if Nelson and Dafoe had swapped roles, the film would have ended with an extra dash of evil, turning it more hardboiled and more Detour-esque, a tale of fate more than gore. With the menacing Dafoe as the guy doing Stan the worst favor at the end, and Nelson the creep who got him into it in the first place, the balance would have tilted in the direction of eternity, or at least hell, where Del Toro thrives, poking away with his pitchfork. In all the film industry talk about how Nightmare Alley and Steven Spielberg’s new version of West Side Story underperformed at the box office, and how that proves audiences are uninterested in seeing non-franchise films by high-end directors in theaters, no one seems to have considered that both remakes are period pieces, and that the original films, when they came out, were not. They took place in the present of the time they were made. So maybe it is something else the audience has rejected. Cigarettes aside, Spielberg’s film is marvelous, an improvement on Robert Wise’s 1961 film version of the Bernstein-Sondheim musical. That one was distinguished by Daniel Fapp’s stunning, Tashlinesque color cinematography as much as by the music. Unfortunately, there was not much Fapp could do with the brownface the actors playing the Sharks and their girls were forced to wear by the producers.  Though it is better than that, and maybe Spielberg’s second or third best movie, it nonetheless feels academic somehow, the large cast a jobs program for theater kids, the gentrification theme something I don’t believe Spielberg cares about in the least or has any experience with. Tony Kushner’s rewrite of Arthur Laurents’s original book for the show is quite convincing, however, as Spielberg goes bravura immediately, with a Kane-esque crane shot (computerized) through the ruins of the neighborhood that became Lincoln Center. This shot links the opening to so much in Spielberg’s previous work. It is a set piece from a war film, reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler’s List, and of course, Lincoln, since a sign enters the frame that says LINCOLN in huge letters. Once again, all history is the same to Spielberg, a teenage gang war in Manhattan the equivalent of World War II, 1961 the same as 1941.  Doing mid-century modern and crime jazz, Spielberg remains obvious. After an astonishing overhead shot of mounds of salt in a municipal salt shed as gang members approach in shadows from both sides, Spielberg has to have one of the gang members shout, “It’s salt! For when the streets ice up!” Because after all these years he still thinks his audience is not the brightest, and all the world is the mass audience to him. As the song “Tonight” has it in the movie, “The world was just an address,” a lyric that never sounded so fatalistic to me until I heard it in a Spielberg movie in 2022, with the wealth gap widening and pushing all but the richest people out of this city. Spielberg moves “Gee, Officer Krupke” indoors, to a police station waiting room, which works better and makes more sense than the nighttime storefront in Wise’s film. More importantly, every decision Spielberg has made to open the film into the city streets works magnificently in this last-gasp movie of joyous urban life, all of it perfectly executed and choreographed with great verve and beauty. His Maria (Rachel Zegler) is more soulful than Natalie Wood was in the earlier film. With her Barbara Steele or Soledad Miranda looks, she fits into this film without a happy ending, adding to the sense that things will not work out, that the lovers are doomed along with the freedom their access to the city promised. There was always a bit of 1960s horror in this operatic tragedy. Then, it was the predictive horror of youth in revolt. Somehow the director of Jaws found it on location, in some small way, like he did in Martha’s Vineyard half a lifetime ago. He gives in to it. There is no future for these lovers, no way to fight against what is happening to them and their neighborhood. Jonathan Larson’s life was tragic. Cut short by an aortic dissection in 1996 just as his musical, Rent, was about to open to great success on Broadway, he’d written Tick, Tick . . . Boom! in 1991, but it was only performed twice in his lifetime. Now Lin-Manuel Miranda has turned this autobiographical musical into a Netflix movie starring Andrew Garfield as Larson. As in CODA, we hear “Happy Birthday” performed, because these films are about the birth of artists in their quest for musical theater acclaim. Both films have a desperate, fleeing quality, which posits that seeking artistic success is difficult and punishing, too hard on others around you, and a race against time. In the hands of Miranda and Garfield, this becomes a form of desperation in which every song is forced out as a last-ditch effort. Near the end, when Michael (Robin de Jesus), Larson’s best friend and roommate, discovers he has AIDS and sings, on the verge of tears, “Is this real life?,” the answer is yeah, but no. That’s because show biz dreams swamp social reality every time, even in scenes that pit them against each other. Part of Larson’s story is that in the late ’80s he wrote an elaborate sci-fi musical called Superbia that was excellent but too complex to be staged. In Miranda’s movie we see a bare-bones preview of it performed for critics, investors, and Stephen Sondheim (Bradley Whitford). In the context of 2021 and Netflix, Larson-Garfield’s description of Superbia in this performance takes on an added resonance. Superbia, he explains, “is a satire set in the future on a poisoned planet Earth, where the vast majority of humanity spend their entire lives just staring at the screens of their media transmitters, watching the tiny elite of the rich and powerful who film their own fabulous lives like TV shows.” Including this can be read as either a pitch for Netflix to make another Larson movie or an example of how capitalism and spectacle absorb everything. Rest assured, however, that if Netflix did make it, they would probably hire Ben Wheatley to direct it, which would prevent anyone from enjoying and absorbing it. What we have here is the kind of movie André Bazin called a “superwestern,” which is “a western that would be ashamed to be just itself, and looks for some additional interest to justify its existence—an aesthetic, sociological, moral, psychological, political, or erotic interest, in short some quality extrinsic to the genre and which is supposed to enrich it.” Doubly true in this case, because in Jane Campion’s Power of the Dog, her lead character (Benedict Cumberbatch), the ruthless cowboy with the non-ruthless name “Phil,” is exactly that—ashamed to be just himself. Phil is a repressed gay man in a macho profession, needling his weaker brother (Jesse Plemons), who has married a woman (Kirsten Dunst) Phil considers a slattern. Dunst’s greenhorn son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) notices this and contrives to eliminate Phil from the ranch. Here it’s the opposite of the situation in the superwestern Shane (1953). Instead of “Shane, come back, my mother wants you,” its “Phil, go away, my mother doesn’t want you.” As a Netflix art film, a perfect breeding ground for a movie like this, it is also super-serious, like The Lost Daughter. Similarly, the film’s ambition leads to confusion. Again, the ending is murky. A lasso soaked in anthrax is something new in a western, it has to be admitted, but getting to that point was a slog, a slow crawl to the Oscars. In a non-superwestern, somebody on the ranch would have smacked Phil in the mouth in the first scene. Though he is threatening and mean-eyed, he is no Liberty Valance, and his needling of the other characters is intolerable and obvious. The way he keeps talking about “Bronco Henry,” his absent mentor who we are led to believe was also his lover, is repetitive and tiresome. On the ranch it would have become a source of humor. Phil’s banjo duel with Dunst’s poor piano playing, in fact, is more like something from Blazing Saddles than Unforgiven. Most damningly for this film that is so subtly concerned with right and wrong, Campion’s use of New Zealand in place of Montana and a British actor for a ranch boss is the moral equivalent of computer-generated imagery. That brings it back to Bazin, where it should end. Ultimately, Campion’s portrait of a repressed cowboy, I think, flatters Hollywood. Varmints like Phil may or may not have tamed the West, but for sure they continued on to Los Angeles to found talent agencies and direct superhero movies. Joel Coen’s black-and-white film of the Scottish play is not made for an age when the TV remote and the smartphone are pointed toward your hand. More like a silent movie by Lang or Dreyer, this Apple TV production overwhelms Shakespeare with monolithic sets, powerful compositions, and piercing cries. Frances McDormand as Lady M. and Denzel Washington in the title role struggle to keep up with the mise-en-scène, while Kathryn Hunter, an amazing actor I do not remember seeing before, plays all three witches and the Old Man in tour-de-force performances that minimize digital trickery but still get lost in Coen’s frames. It was inevitable that this version would be compared to Orson Welles’s. His cheapo 1948 Macbeth for Republic Studios is better because it isn’t as distant as Coen’s, despite being seventy-three years older, but it’s more awesome, with more cold terror and high drama. Welles goes for it, as usual, while Coen’s film is something of an exercise. As for being the first film from a brother act minus one, even with Shakespeare writing the screenplay, this movie certifies Ethan’s value. When the best thing in a Coen film is a long sword fight, something is missing, and The Tragedy of Macbeth is a movie where we can pinpoint what it was.

"Mar 28, 2022",POSITIVE," Warner Bros. and Denis Villenueve both have a lot riding on Dune, the latest stab at adapting Frank Herbert’s seminal novel for the big screen. The last time the epic sci-fi was made into a movie it flopped hard at the box office, as did Villenueve’s Blade Runner 2049; the filmmaker’s most recent attempt at reinventing a decades-old classic for modern audiences. The fact Dune‘s title card has a ‘Part One’ prefix signals right from the beginning that the director has no intention of telling a complete story, which is the single greatest and most glaring weakness of a film packed top-to-bottom with strengths. Of course, nobody knew that the pandemic would come along and decimate the entire entertainment industry, but it’s a bold and downright risky move opting to spend $165 million on a star-studded blockbuster that doesn’t have an ending. Dune has been called unfilmable on plenty of occasions, and you’ll likely be less than ten minutes into the 155-minute running time before you decide whether or not the story is going to be up your street. Opening any film with a voiceover that delivers exhausting exposition is a gambit, but the incredible visual style on display from the very first frame offsets the dry info dumps about Arrakis, spice, the Houses of Harkonnen and Atreides, Fremen and all the rest. Make no mistake about it; Dune is a dense, complex and incredibly ambitious slice of Hollywood spectacle, one that might not be for everyone. However, if you immerse yourself into the richly-detailed world and allow the sheer scope of this thing to wash over you, the end result is comfortably one of the most distinctive and unique studio-backed titles to come along in a long time. Trying to condense the plot of Dune is a fool’s errand, but in the broadest of strokes, it’s a classic Hero’s Journey right out of the Joseph Campbell playbook. Timothee Chalamet’s Paul Atreides is the son of Oscar Isaac’s Duke Leto, and they’ve just been appointed by the Imperium empire to assume command of operations on Arrakis. Paul has continuous dreams that may be prophetic in nature, with Zendaya’s Fremen Chani a recurring figure in all of them. As it turns out, the House of Atreides has been lured into a planetary ambush by the Harkonnen, forcing Paul and his mother Lady Jessica to flee into the desert, all while the young man wrestles with the destiny of being Muad’Dib, essentially the Chosen One of the Fremen. If that doesn’t sound like your bag, then there’s really no point in watching Dune at all, because huge swathes of the narrative are dedicated to characters talking about political machinations, prophecies, double-crosses, disbelievers and the like. On a technical level, though, Dune is never anything less than spectacular and often outright astounding. Villenueve is one of the best visualists in the business, and when you marry that to Greig Fraser’s stunning cinematography and an understated yet still sweeping Hans Zimmer score, it’s always a feast for the eyes and ears. Early comparisons to Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars sounded lofty, but they’re not entirely accurate, either. Dune is a much different type of movie, and while it shares plenty of DNA with those aforementioned classics in terms of expanding its mythology and laying the groundwork for what’s to come, Villenueve isn’t so much interested in action sequences or a stirring sense of adventure as he is in treating everything with the utmost seriousness, solemnity and thematic weight. Luckily, the cast are about as uniformly excellent as you’d imagine given their pedigree. Chalamet makes for a well-rounded protagonist even if he does flirt with bratty territory once or twice, with Isaac and Josh Brolin furrowing their brows and letting their gruff charisma shine. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista do veer a little into the one-dimensional side of things, which will likely be rectified should we get that Dune: Part Two, with Jason Momoa providing the only real levity and lightness of touch as Duncan Idaho, regularly popping up to steal scenes thanks to his easygoing natural charisma. Another issue with Dune is the pacing; it’s a long movie that very much feels like a long movie at points, but at least it’s frequently punctuated by grandstanding scenes of great actors doing great acting, intricately-choreographed fight sequences or some classic CGI destruction on an intergalactic scale. As an experience, it’s unlike anything else you’ll see this year, and Villenueve wasn’t lying when he said you won’t get anything close to the best of Dune if you watch it at home. Circling back to this beginning of this review, just to reiterate that a lot of people are going to find the ending of Dune infuriating. For two and a half hours, Villenueve’s awe-inspiring effort has been building towards Paul finally meeting Chani and becoming the man he was always destined to be… and then it ends. Calling a movie Part One is fine if Part Two is already guaranteed to happen, but Warner Bros. have made it clear that finishing the story is entirely dependent on how the first half fares at the box office. If the numbers aren’t up to scratch, then Dune will always have an asterisk next to its name as 50% of what it wanted to be, so let’s hope that audiences turn up in their droves to see it this weekend."

"Mar 23, 2022",POSITIVE," The desire to acknowledge mainstream movies alongside typical Oscar fare isn’t a new development: From The Dark Knight’s Best Picture snub inspiring a rule change to the nearly implemented Popular Film award, the Academy wants the best of both worlds. But the focus on the fan-voted awards and the hype that surrounded No Way Home potentially sneaking into this year’s Best Picture race have ignored the giant sandworm in the room. There’s already an epic, immersive, crowd-pleasing tentpole up for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, and Dune doesn’t just deserve a seat at the table. An ambitious spectacle with a level of craftsmanship comparable to The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Mad Max: Fury Road, Dune winning Best Picture is exactly what the Academy needs: a blockbuster celebrating the inimitable, awe-inspiring power of the big screen that everyone can get behind.  The critical and commercial success of Dune was hardly a sure thing. Celebrated auteurs have twice tried to make a movie out of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel. The first attempt, from Alejandro Jodorowsky, was never completed—though its failure was turned into a documentary—while David Lynch disavowed his fascinatingly flawed adaptation that made it to the screen. But these high-profile setbacks didn’t deter Denis Villeneuve, whose impressive CV of big-budget genre filmmaking includes a worthy, sumptuous sequel to Blade Runner. If someone was going to crack the code to Dune, Villeneuve seemed a good bet.  Villeneuve’s solution was to split Dune into two films, a move that would give the political machinations of Herbert’s dense, sprawling text more time to breathe. That Villeneuve made this decision without the guarantee of a sequel was quite the flex, but Dune: Part Deux was put in an even more precarious position when the pandemic arrived and WarnerMedia controversially elected to have all its 2021 theatrical releases simultaneously available to stream on HBO Max. Villeneuve voiced his frustrations with the company in a scathing Variety op-ed in which he extolled the virtues of the theatrical experience and how essential it was for Dune. But reading between the lines of his column, you could also sense the palpable anxiety that a half-completed Dune would become one of cinema’s greatest what-ifs. (A what-if that was partially self-inflicted, no less.) Of course, there’s no longer any concern about the franchise’s future: The sequel is happening. And the fact that Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures made the announcement within days of Dune’s release spoke volumes of Villeneuve backing up his big talk with a very big movie.  Dune made an impression before a single frame was even shown on screen, as the discordant sounds of the Sardaukar—their garbled words translating to “Dreams are messages from the deep”—set the tone for a jarring, transportive experience. In an era of cinematic universes that pander to audiences with familiarity, there’s a lot to admire about Villeneuve’s confidence in his own, uncompromising vision—and that viewers will go along for the ride. It helps that the special effects spared no expense. The sandworms are as unfathomably enormous as advertised, underlining that, despite the expanse of barren desert on Arrakis, the planet is very much alive. The dead-of-night siege perpetrated by House Harkonnen against House Atreides was laced with apocalyptic dread, as hulking ships descended from the pitch-black sky to raze everything in their wake. Throw in Hans Zimmer’s booming, Oscar-nominated score, which in certain theaters rattles your seat like a plane going through turbulence, and you can understand why Villeneuve was so insistent that Dune had to be seen on the big screen.  Dune winning Best Picture won’t save theaters, and it probably won’t halt the Oscars’ ratings slide. But in adapting one of science fiction’s most iconic—and notoriously unadaptable—novels into a blockbuster with artistry, gravitas, and a battalion of movie stars to bring it to life, Villeneuve has created something special. Dune is an antidote to stale, familiar franchises, and a breathtaking reminder of why we love movies the way they’re meant to be seen. With the Academy fretting about the waning popularity of its award show, and an industry continuing to reckon with the ever-shifting tides of the pandemic, the Oscars can do much worse than embracing desert power.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful?

"Mar 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"If nothing else, Dune wins its place as a masterpiece of adaptation, truncating roughly half the novel into its runtime to expand the books monomaniacal focus on Paul into a more ensemble narrative."
"Mar 10, 2022",POSITIVE," There are waves in the sand, and they're moving. Your mind is not playing tricks on you, though the thought might pop into your head while you're immersed in the engulfing landscapes of “Dune,” Denis Villeneuve's transporting, richly textured adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi novel about political intrigue, what it means to be a leader, and things that go bump in the sand. Any concerns this reviewer might have had about the “Sicario” auteur's ability to tackle the source material's dense and complex meditation on lust for power and violent backstabbings were promptly allayed by the confident mise en scene and effortless worldbuilding. It bears the French Canadian director's trademark gravity, but not in a way that it becomes overbearing or numbing as it sometimes has been. There are even moments of levity. Could this possibly be the same storyteller known for his pessimistic worldview? Believe it. The 54-year-old filmmaker reportedly wanted to make a piece of pop entertainment that both cinephiles and Joe Moviegoer could dig. Mission accomplished. At least for now. Let's call this massive movie ride by its original, and more honest, title: “Dune: Part One.” Villeneuve, working from a screenplay credited to him, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, has opted to cover roughly the first half of the book, delivering a final cut that clocks in at 155 minutes. It feels just right to this sci-fi nerd, but more on that later. There's an inevitable sense of déjà vu that comes with seeing the story of young, gifted, troubled Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and the baptism by fire that might just make a leader out of him. After all, David Lynch had a go at it in the 1980s. While the results there were far messier and more erratic, I still have a soft spot for his gaudy vision. Blame Kyle MacLachlan's Pisces energy and Sting's scenery chewing. Temptation was purposely resisted to revisit the 1984 film prior to seeing the 2021 production. What's most striking about Villeneuve's more reined-in reimagining is that despite the distant future setting, and all the thrillingly rendered technology that goes with it, this “Dune” feels thoroughly old-fashioned. It often plays like an early CinemaScope sword-and-sandal epic in space opera drag. There's no attempt to 'roid things up to appeal to a younger demographic. This filmmaking team has astutely intuited that if you assemble this machine right, people will be drawn in regardless of aesthetic preferences. You won't need a glossary to guide you along. Everything is laid out with the kind of clarity that is too often taken for granted. Paul's dad, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, rocking some mighty facial hair), accepts the stewardship of Arrakis, a desert planet known as a sparsely populated wasteland. It is also the source of “the spice,” a photogenic grain with manifold qualities, including making space navigation possible. The drug also enhances mental abilities in a way that makes real-world hallucinogens feel like Tylenol. A family of noble lineage, with plenty of enemies, is tasked with overseeing the celestial body that houses the most coveted substance in this interplanetary empire. What could possibly go wrong?

The film alternates between scenes showing Paul —withdrawn, brooding, haunted by visions that look uncannily like Arrakis — interacting with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), his devoted father and those in their immediate orbit, and those that introduce us to the miscreants plotting to swoop in and ruin the Atreides clan's ambitious plans. That would be Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, bearing a possibly coincidental resemblance to a certain political figure) and his nephew, Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista). Thrown into the mix is Reverend Mother Mohiam (a shrewdly cast Charlotte Rampling), member of an exclusive sisterhood trained to hone abilities that some look down upon as witchcraft, but whose gift for backdoor wheeling and dealing can turn the tide in the minefield that the Atreides family is about to enter. Mohiam, still miffed at Jessica for reasons revolving around Paul and Leto, is unsure as to how Paul fits into her plans. In a squirm-inducing scene, she tests his ability to withstand pain.

Leto has big plans for his son, as does his mother, but as the attractive household leaves their ocean-rich planet for the arid sands of Arrakis, it becomes clear Paul might be destined for even greater things. The iconography in the desert planet, with its tribal culture and territorial disputes, brings to mind the Arab world, both during the time of T.E. Lawrence and its contemporary unrest. Add the way Paul is regarded by the native residents, or Fremen, as a messianic figure who would fulfill a prophecy, and that could make some viewers look at Chalamet's scrawny aristocrat as a white savior. But it's clear Villeneuve aims to highlight the character's insecurity, his trepidation that he might fall short of the duties that will be asked of him. When the other shoe drops narrative-wise, there's a controlled grandeur to the chaos. There are few surprises from a storytelling viewpoint, but it's all executed with such airtight precision that we can't help but be swept along. There's an adolescent earnestness that, coupled with the prowess behind the camera, results in a viewing experience that is at once comforting and oddly endearing. Also, those sandworms are about as spectacular as promised. (Man, they're big.) Kudos to cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette for sustaining a chiaroscuro look that makes every surface so tactile. This is sci-fi made with chops and conviction, and as such, it never comes across as filmmaking by committee the way other franchises frequently do.

Mature yet juvenile, otherworldly yet pleasingly familiar, “Dune” demands to be experienced on the biggest screen you can find (sandworms!). Yes, I'm aware it's on HBO Max for a limited time, but if you have resumed going to the theaters, take the plunge. After all, personal filmmaking on such a massive scale only comes across once in a blue moon. (Isn't that so, Peter Jackson?) That big, fat grin I had plastered on my face never faded. Denis Villeneuve's “Dune” is now playing in wide release, including IMAX engagements at AMC Aventura Mall, AMC Sunset Place, Regal Cinemas South Beach, and the granddaddy of them all, AutoNation IMAX at the Museum of Discovery and Science in Fort Lauderdale. It is also available to stream on HBO Max for the next 30 days, but it's so much better on the big screen.

"Mar 10, 2022",POSITIVE," When you read a lot of genre fiction, or even regular literary fiction that leans toward the complex, you hear the word ""unadaptable"" a lot. Tons of Stephen King books are ""unadaptable."" Thomas Pynchon is ""unadaptable."" House of Leaves is ""unadaptable."" For decades, Frank Herbert's audacious science fiction masterwork Dune was considered unadaptable, and then, in 1984, David Lynch's attempt proved that to be more or less true. It's so dense, and there is just so much detail to get across to your audience, even in the background exposition before you get to the actual narrative. Nevertheless, it's one of those books that is so beloved and influential, it's always in the back of Hollywood's mind, waiting to be put to screen once again. Denis Villeneuve, having proven himself with his Oscar-nominated Arrival and improbably fantastic Blade Runner sequel, was handed the reins to take another shot at it, this time separating the story into two parts—the first of which comes out October 22 in theaters and on HBO Max. Dune, technically titled Dune: Part One, introduces a universe ruled by a substance so precious, noble families wage war upon each other to gain control of it, until one family realizes the true scope of the wealth buried beneath the sands of one desert planet. It feels like the movie that fans of the novel have been waiting for. Everyone else's mileage may vary. The year is 10191 and humanity is ruled by a planetary Imperium that tracks and manipulates the relationships between the noble houses, shifting families back and forth according to the Emperor's whims. The favor now seems to land on House Atreides, who has been gifted control and residency of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, covered as it is with desert from pole to pole. Dune is the home of spice, a substance that allows the members of the Spacing Guild, who take it as a drug, to jump through space, transporting people and materials all around the galaxy. Whoever controls spice production on Arrakis will become very rich indeed. But the Atreides family and their vassals need to tread lightly: The gift of Arrakis is definitely a test, and likely a trap, overseen by the Atreides' powerful enemies, the brutish House Harkonnen. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and his family, Bene Gesserit (an order of genealogy-obsessed sorceresses) concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their fey son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), arrive on the planet ready to ally themselves with the blue-eyed Fremen, the native human population who have developed ways of surviving in the wasteland, building ""stillsuits"" that recycle the body's water and walking in odd ways so as not to attract the attention of the giant sandworms that swim beneath the desert's surface, plaguing spice mining equipment and swallowing anything in their path. Before they can accomplish much, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his forces, led by the sadistic Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) wreak havoc, changing the course of the Atreides family's fortunes. What they don't count on is the hidden power of the Atreides son Paul, who has a connection to the Fremen deeper than any of them suspect. As you can probably tell by the two whole paragraphs of plot description, Dune is complex. And, again, this is only the first part, setting up the exposition needed to understand what's going on and then cutting off about halfway through the novel, as Warner Bros. prefers to wait to see how this movie does before allowing Villeneuve to film Part Two. What's impressive about this movie is how straightforwardly it sets up everything you need to know, giving plenty of context to bizarre phrases like ""Kwisatz Haderach"" and ""gom jabbar"" so that anyone paying attention can pretty competently follow what's going on. It also has plenty of room for long, involved conversations between characters, using the space efficiently to introduce nuanced relationships between them—during a ceremonial meeting, Duke Leto mutters to his Warmaster Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) to smile, and Halleck responds, stonefaced, ""I am smiling."" The friendship between Paul and jovial swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) is particularly rich. Villeneuve uses these interactions sparingly, but they breathe life into a story that could very easily become extremely dry and dull. That's what's impressive about Dune: To make a film this straightforward out of some of the densest material in science fiction is a feat, and one that Villeneuve and his actors accomplish pretty much without a hitch. As long as you're paying attention, you'll get it. Conversely, if you don't feel like paying attention to what's going on, the movie is a true feast for the eyes (and the ears, thanks to some garish sound design and Hans Zimmer's booming score). Building interiors are stark, angular, shadowed; spaceships are chunky, loud, and tangible; costumes are extravagant, with voluminous flowing veils, comically high headdresses, and tubes poking out of every fold. Airships are outlined by searchlight beams cutting through thick mists, miles of sand vibrate in waves as worms pass underneath. Dune can't really be called ""accessible,"" because the novel itself isn't what we'd call accessible, either. Audiences who are predisposed to find fascination with its complex political intrigues and gibberish phrases will enjoy it, those who already don't like those things likely will not, and those on the fence are hard to predict. The movie, like the novel, makes you work a little for its affections, and will reward you for the effort. Bigger rewards will likely come in the sequel, adapting the more psychedelic, more out-of-this-world material of the book, which makes Dune's current situation (a dense space opera released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming) more than a little precarious. Dune: Part One will leave fans not only wanting, but hoping for more. The spice, in other words, must flow."
"Mar 10, 2022",POSITIVE," Sicario , Arrival , Blade Runner 2049 - it’s fair to say Denis Villeneuve has been on a bit of a roll behind the camera.   And now the French-Canadian director has turned his hand to adapting Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, which paved the way for Star Wars and many other genre favourites.   Unlike mega-fan Villeneuve, I am no Dune aficionado, having never read the book or seen David Lynch’s mostly derided 1984 take on the source material.  Get all the news from your area – as well as features, entertainment, sport and the latest on Lanarkshire’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – straight to your fingertips, 24/7. The free download features the latest breaking news and exclusive stories, and allows you to customise your page to the sections that matter most to you. Given the original book is around 500 pages long and crammed with world-building and lots of characters, Villeneuve wisely took the decision to split the story into two movies.  As has come to be the way with Villeneuve’s work, Dune is an exceptional looking film; you quickly get swept away in the desert planet of Arrakis and the sandy, dusty surroundings are punctuated by cloudy blue eyes, neon lasers and sun-kissed skies.   The scale is epic and you should see Dune on as big a screen as possible, with the moment the famous giant sand worms finally make their appearance counting as event cinema at its best.  Villeneuve’s cast are suitably stellar. At first I was concerned Chalamet might struggle to carry the weight of his key role but he grows into it masterfully.  Other standouts include Rebecca Ferguson ( Lady Jessica ), Oscar Isaac ( Duke Leto ), Zendaya ( Chani ) and Josh Brolin ( Gurney ), while there are slender but unsettling turns from Stellan Skarsgård ( Baron Harkonnen ) and Charlotte Rampling ( Reverend Mother Mohiam ).  Some characters are clearly set up for bigger things in the next movie and this also leads to a lack of resolution which, along with a lot of dialogue that will go over non-fans’ heads, grates at times."
"Mar 10, 2022",NEUTRAL," Dense with lore and backstory that may be a touch intimidating to the uninitiated, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s doorstop sci-fi classic Dune is a windswept epic in the true sense, tawny-tinted and forebodingly handsome in its design.  Dune is about a young man born to high status, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, soft-spoken, with a wellspring of defiance in his eyes), whose family have been offered a dubious gift from their Emperor: a desert planet called Arrakis, inhabited by native people called the Fremens who have been brutally oppressed by a savage race of warriors known as the Harkonnens.  There’s real visual dynamism in the film, with a strong backbone of rhythmic editing to intersperse Paul’s journey with oblique visions of a cloudy future. The production and costume design, too, are austerely beautiful, particularly its dragonfly warplanes and octagonal concrete palaces.  Chalamet is well backed by a strong supporting cast, from Stellan Skarsgård as head of the warlike Harkonnens to a heroic battle-hardened soldier played by Jason Momoa.  Engrossing and frustrating in equal measure, Dune is the first instalment of what may prove to be a science-fiction Lord of the Rings; a mega-budget world-building fantasy on a huge scope. What hampers the film most is the concept of its serialisation: while it’s a compliment to say that I wished it would continue after over two hours, it simply fizzles instead, offering a half-hearted conclusion in service of setting up a sequel. Ultimately, Dune sacrifices its own momentum to cut itself in two rather than commit itself – and its audience – to following Paul on his long and dangerous journey. It lacks a certain faith in the viewer, and that’s a shame, because the film’s ambition is admirable. "
"Mar 8, 2022",POSITIVE," In the long history of novels being adapted into films, it seems a certainly that people have always spoken of ‘unfilmable’ books. Of course they are usually only considered unfilmable until an enterprising production team actually films them, as was the case with Peter Jackson’s widely acclaimed The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Frank Herbert’s Dune has spent a lot of time on people’s lists, despite both a 1984 feature film and a 2000 TV miniseries. In this case people use these adaptations as proof of their ‘unfilmable’ sentiment. Both film and series have their own critical flaws, and these seem to justify the argument that Dune is simply too long, too complex, and too expensive to film. Acclaimed writer/director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Prisoners) has taken a red-hot go and proving the naysayers wrong, with his 2021 epic feature: titled Dune in all marketing materials, but Dune Part One once the audience has paid for a ticket and started the movie. Not only it is a slightly dubious bit of deception, it is also a key sign of how Villeneuve has attempt to ‘film the unfilmable’. Rather than adapt Herbert’s entire 412-page novel in one shot, he has split the work into two. For those familiar with the plot, Villeneuve’s Dune goes as far as Paul meeting the Fremen in the desert. To see the rest of the story, viewers will have to wait until late 2023. For those unfamiliar with Dune, it is an epic science fiction story set far into humanity’s future. The known universe consists of a massive empire, within which rival aristocratic houses compete for the emperor’s favour. Travel between star systems requires the use of a substance called melange, or ‘spice’, and it is only found on the planet Arrakis – more commonly known as Dune. The brutal House Harkonnen is robbed of its control of Dune, with authority given by the Emperor to fierce rival House Atreides. The Harkonnens, of course, are not prepared to let go of their prime asset so they can help it. That set-up barely scratches the surface of Dune, of course, and the main challenge facing any filmmaker is how to capture and deliver an enormous amount of world-building, history, and political machinations into the space of a few hours. There is also the extensive cast of characters, whose varying allegiances, goals, and personalities must be established and played out. David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation essentially tried a ‘kitchen sink’ approach, overloading the film’s first half in particular with names, characters, and situations piled so thick and fast that it simply became confusing. Villeneuve tries what is essentially the opposite approach, stripping out a lot of extraneous detail and trying to both slow down the feed of information and only give the audience what they need to know at any given time. The approach seems only partially successful, as well as rather uneven. In some cases it still feels as if too much of the novel was unnecessarily retained. In others the absence of proper explanations renders some of the characters’ choices a little difficult to understand. What is included takes two-and-a-half hours to play out, at what often seems to be an interminable slowness. I cannot shake the feeling that with a little more trust in the audience and a more energised pace, Villeneuve could have captured the novel very effectively in the space of three hours. As it stands, this slow and methodical technique seems to show off a director afraid of their own production: as if one over-confident misstep would mean ruin for the whole enterprise. It is, of course, impeccably designed. From the costumes to the enormous machinery and craft of mining spice the film presents a beautifully realised and consistent universe. It lacks a variety of colour, which seems a shame – everything is either grey or brown, which seems as much a hallmark of post-Gladiator epic filmmaking as the whisper-and-shout delivery of the dialogue. Villeneuve has assembled an absolutely outstanding cast of actors to populate his Dune. Timothée Chalamet presents the precise blend of youthful naivete and inner strength than protagonist Paul Atreides requires. Oscar Isaac and Stellan Skarsgård are fine as rival leaders of Atreides and Harkonnen. A fine range of actors fill the various supporting parts: Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Chang Chen, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Zendaya, and a number of others. They are uniformly superb, yet as with the other elements of the film they feel very carefully arranged like figures in a doll house. It would be hard not to recognise an allegory of the colonial oil trade in the Middle East within Herbert’s Dune. The film certainly does, with Hans Zimmer’s multi-layered score reflecting the music of the region and the costuming the fashion. The Fremen – indigenous peoples of the deserts of Arrakis – are simultaneously fetishised as an exotic 19th century Arabia and apparently cast entirely without actors of Middle Eastern ethnicity. It is not the best of looks; neither is the film’s apparent embrace of the ‘white saviour’ narrative – although that is more a result of splitting the story in two than anything else. Dune is certainly worthy – oh so worthy – and handsomely produced, and should please most fans of Herbert’s iconic novel. At the same time it feels rather like a film made in fear: fear of making the wrong creative choice, or omitting the wrong bit of the book, or even the wrong delivery of a famous line. It would be a lie to claim I did not enjoy it, but like Lynch’s previous attempt I enjoyed with some fairly major caveats. To my mind both films together demonstrate that Dune is far from unfilmable – but that perhaps the best film version would exist somewhere between the two. It is hard to fully pass judgement of Villeneuve’s Dune. By the end of 2023 we can hopefully tell for sure."
"Mar 7, 2022",POSITIVE," One of the most anticipated films for many attending the New York Film Festival was without a doubt Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. The outlandish and artistic sci-fi epic will leave audiences wanting more. This is definitely a good thing. Many will be satisfied with the product Villeneuve has bred for the big screen, creating a take on outer space visuals somewhat reminiscent of Salvador Dalí. Dune, or Dune: Part One as it is officially titled onscreen, is an adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. It follows a young Paul Atreides who might just be the chosen one. Finding out is part of the journey. His family must travel to a hazardous planet to fulfill a duty assigned to them by the emperor. They quickly come to realize that malicious work is at play as they try to harvest the planet’s resources only to come across various setbacks and deadly threats. Dune is your typical hero’s journey. Paul ventures into the unknown, crossing the threshold into a world foreign to him, yet familiar all the same. Audiences will be able to fully transport themselves to Paul’s reality. It does a good job of helping one understand the rules of the world in a quick stride. That being said, it does not hold the viewer by the hand. The exposition, while done well, might be overwhelming to some. There is a lot to take in and process, but once the ball gets rolling, there’s no stopping it. The story itself is a calculated adaptation of a colonial narrative set in worlds unknown and new to us. The most lengthy task at hand was to convince the audience of this world’s realism. To hook them in. Dune succeeds at this. However, the grand scale splendor isn’t enough to distract from the absence of Villeneuve’s trademark emotional vulnerability.  Many have praised the 2017 film Blade Runner 2049 for balancing its cold exterior with said vulnerability at its center. While Dune is a nearly perfect film, it exudes a hollowed-out nature at times. To perfect the visual spectacle, the film creates emotional moments that, while well-timed and fitting for the narrative, often feel formulaic. At the very center, one can’t help but think the emotional core of the film is missing. At its roots, it’s also a conflicting narrative. The hero of the film partakes in the colonial siege of a foreign territory. While his family suffers the consequences, he is framed under the guise of empathy. Part one of the Dune duology in short tackles the crumbling of an empire. It explores loss under the ruse of conquest for honor. Villeneuve ventures into the politics of expansion and takeover that will ring true to many that face this reality today. Nevertheless, the film does not go beyond that. It presents the ramifications of forced subjugation, leading up to the exploration of the other side’s perspective in the future installment.  In terms of the performances, the cast was one to watch. An excellent and dynamic ensemble, they make the best of every scene. To name a notable outlier would be difficult because one cannot excel at what they’re given without another. Timothée Chalamet might be the exception due to the cards he’s dealt as the protagonist.  The mountainous weight of Dune weighs down on Chalamet’s shoulders. As a result, this adds to his portrayal of Paul. A young man with too much to take on too fast. The same doubt one might cast on his ability to carry the role translates into the same doubt one might have on whether Paul is prepared to step up to the challenge. Without a doubt, they both are.  While lacking the visual charisma Chalamet often brings with his presence, he was a mesmerizing lead. Clouded by conflict and turmoil, it contributes to the troubled atmosphere of the story. He’s able to characterize the film as an exploration of a subtle loss of humanity through the sacrifice of one’s empathy in the face of loss through his performance. His journey will probably seem to many as the antithesis of K’s own in Blade Runner 2049."
"Feb 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Perhaps the best, or at least the most revealing, thing that can be said about Denis Villeneuve’s grandly mounted adaptation of Frank Herbert’s “Dune” is that he makes it look easy.  This isn’t to say any filmmaker could have shepherded the movie to life, nor that this installment announcing itself as “Part 1” doesn’t mean Villeneuve has been graced with a bigger sandbox in which to convincingly create set up this sandswept saga about intergalactic rivalry and schemes which span centuries. Rather, Villeneuve makes adapting the narrative intricacies and otherworldly enormity of the source material look easy by succeeding at probably the hardest thing: Committing wholeheartedly to an aesthetic vision so shamelessly grand and evocative that, at its best, this story of young Paul Atreides on the desert planet Arrakis feels like the story Villeneuve has been quietly working towards for the better part of the last decade.  In certain respects it’s true. Not for nothing has the French-Canadian filmmaker become accustomed to making movies no one else would think to try, for good reason; “Arrival” is a masterwork adapted from a short story exploring language in the pitch of arithmetic, and the alluring open-endedness of Ridley Scott’s seminal “Blade Runner” practically made an unspoken rule that no sequel would be attempted. Villeneuve, it seems, enjoys breaking those rules almost as much as he ignores them altogether. This is to say, he so earnestly makes the case his trademark brooding, brutal style is the right vehicle for this half-adaptation of “Dune” that at a certain point you begin to wonder if Villeneuve doesn’t see himself in its central prophecy. He, as is the case with Timothée Chalamet’s Paul, is a lad of great expectations.  That only makes us all the more vulnerable to be initially enticed and then wholly entranced by the implications of a “Dune” adaptation which suggests the inevitability of disaster while wondering if destiny is something not to glorify but to fear. The lens is wide enough to reconsider the worlds of wizards and hobbits, should we choose to apply it. But with Villeneuve peering through, “Dune” most readily translates as a fable where the lines between losing and finding oneself are blurred against the backdrop of royal responsibility, moral emptiness and, yes, giant sandworms whose underground gliding the visual effects team realizes here with screen-shaking suspense.  You’ll hear those beasts referred to a few times as “Shai Hulud,” one of several phrases either derived or borrowed outright by Herbert and this screenplay (by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) from Middle Eastern vernacular. As was the case in 1965, so does it remain true here that “Dune” plays as allegory for resource-grabbing and interimperial tensions over valuable lands, only here oil becomes the ultracommodity spice and colonial powers become the houses Atreides and Harkonnen, the former of which has been assigned to take the reins in overseeing spice production on Arrakis from the latter. Contending evermore with the encroachment on their lands are the native Fremen, rebelling sometimes but mostly remaining in their isolated caverns while awaiting their emancipation. Meanwhile, Paul’s position as the perhaps-supernaturally inclined son of House Atreides leader Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, conveying a sense of regal capability) is also the reason he attracts the attention of the Bene Gesserit, a group of suspicious and strictly female string-pullers of which his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, the ensemble’s soulful anchor), is a member.  Got all that? Because it’s just the start. “Game of Thrones” fans might find it easier to settle into the behind-the-curtains plotting which will culminate in a massive nighttime invasion, but the rest of the audience can rest easy even as other faces arrive to bolster this story’s rosters. Helped along by a bit of movie-opening exposition underscoring the movie’s strange structure, “Dune” largely succeeds at one of its tallest tasks: Coherently positioning the players who fill the superbly rendered palaces the plot only partially unfolds in, and establishing their various loyalties through elemental means. The Atreides’ home planet of Caladan is a peaceful oasis of green and blue, for instance, while the Harkonnens reside on a stormy orb where they prefer their decor inky and oppressive. On Arrakis, the new abode of House Atreides is a city of geometric black holes that look as though they were excavated from the dunes themselves.  That those pompously massive sets (designed by Patrice Vermette) shrink into feeble sandcastles when the camera (manned with the assured hand of frequent Villeneuve collaborator Greig Fraser) soars toward the vast stretches of desert surrounding them is no accident. To fully appreciate the grandiosity of “Dune,” these most memorable sequences seem to suggest, we must notice the smallness as well—the way House Atreides ships, with their fluttering steel wings or spherical shapes, shrink to the size of bugs on the screen as they approach massive sandworms; the delicate and ominous framing of a fallen patriarch's hand at this first installment’s violent climax. What Villeneuve understands in bringing Arrakis and the power struggle over it to cinematic life is that sheer scale is a malleable force, and a viscerally overpowering one in a story nearly devoid of lightness or displays of affection. The epic’s investment in character resides on the edges of its spectacle, amid the juxtaposition of sandy mysticality and rumbling militarism. On one hand, Villeneuve’s faithfulness to Herbert’s novel extends to the rigid shallowness of this world’s denizens, ones defined almost exclusively by either calculation, greed, unquestioning responsibility or defiance. It’s difficult to imagine Chalamet imitating the space-opera buoyancy of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker, but “Dune” is also no “Star Wars,” which means the young star isn’t trying to. His hushed portrayal begins to feel more purposeful when “Dune” shifts to Arrakis, and that may as well indicate how the young star’s settling into the role is meant to mirror our own settling into this world.  On the other hand, the shallowness of motivation may very well be part of the point, and part of the reason Villeneuve – whose stories tend to locate a resonance in the desperately bleak – seems so natural a translator for “Dune.” His knack for visual grandeur will keep him making films for years, but the bigger the universe, the bigger the pathos that’s needed to fill it. Undoubtedly there’s an initial awkwardness in seeing these characters shift their positions on such an intricately staged, intergalactic chess board with such passivity.  But passivity is not a minor thing. Paths to predetermined places don’t appear out of thin air, not even the lethal, blazing-hot air of Arrakis. And “Dune” perhaps gets stronger and more tantalizing as its 155-minute runtime creeps along because Villeneuve – through beautifully edited sequences of recurring imagery and hazy chronological leapfrogging – foregrounds these ideas of powerful figures who are merely biding their time for power to be snatched away, finding comfort in the cognitive dissonance emphasized by the director’s technical precision. Agency and destiny are in constant conversation when it comes to Paul’s story, even if it takes about an hour for “Dune” to render their dialogue legible. And at its core is a messianic figure increasingly agitated about whether he can ever measure up to the narrative and aesthetic bombast he – and us, by proxy – is enveloped in.  “Dune” is haunting in these implications, and nearly potent enough to reflect on an entire genre as Chalamet’s performance increasingly reflects Paul’s subdued tug-of-war. You could call the cliffhanger ending rousing if you want, but I’m not entirely sure if Villeneuve doesn’t intend for the final moments of “Dune Part 1” to be a red herring. After spending the last few years debating if the director had the goods to pull this massive project off, it’s more than a little appropriate that there exists the possibility we could spend forever wondering if this iteration of Arrakis’s would-be savior has the capacity to see his path for what it really is, even as his footing grows ever more confident. "
"Feb 17, 2022",POSITIVE," Director: Denis Villeneuve
Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem. Following David Lynch’s divisive adaptation, for years it felt like Dune was one of those stories that would never make it to the big screen in a satisfactory way. Many adaptations have whirred into production before falling apart, but if there’s one filmmaker that knows about defying the odds, it’s Denis Villeneuve. The French-Canadian director was the one who brought us back to the world of Replicants in the astounding Blade Runner: 2049, and has cited Frank Herbert’s Dune as a passion project. Set in the distant future, Timothee Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, heir to House Atreides and son of its patriarch, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rachel Ferguson). As House Atreides arrives on the planet to take over the Spice mining operations, Leto faces several obstacles – a resentful native people known as Fremen, and the former steward of Arrakis, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). As a bitter betrayal unfolds, Paul realises that visions he has been having are indicative of powers that will make him a great leader, if he can only survive the planet’s deadly landscape. This is a truncated explanation of the plot, which only covers half of the first book (the title screen comes with a “Part One” caption). Isaac is a wise leader, and has some beautiful scenes with Chalamet, particularly an early walk by the coast where the pair talk about duty. Her devotion to her religion, and how it relates to her son’s destiny, make her an unpredictable element as things progress, but as ever the Oscar nominee brings a lot of passion to an essential role. Dave Bautista and Jason Momoa have some memorable scenes as enforcers for either side, while Josh Brolin is all business as he teaches Paul to fight. Zendaya is only really seen in flashbacks, and like Javier Barden as Fremen leader Sildar, there’s a sense that this is a teaser for more expanded roles in a sequel. Where many actors would have been making kissy faces at Marvel the moment they gained notoriety, the 25-year-old has opted for an interesting career path since breaking through in Call Me By Your Name. He forms immediate bonds with his co-stars thanks to a vulnerability that isn’t often seen in films of this scale, while still remaining a believable force in action scenes, despite his frame being intentionally slighter than his beefy colleagues. A story about a man’s destiny is hard to follow if you don’t care about the man, and Chalamet makes sure you’re with him each step of the way. While the ending and the subtitle “Part One” make it clear this is only the beginning, the complex piece stands apart in a world filled with superheroes and death-defying street racers.

"Feb 15, 2022",POSITIVE," DUNE (2021). With Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 reigning as two of the best science fiction films of recent vintage, director Denis Villeneuve attempts to go 3-for-3 with his ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert’s spice-world saga — or at least the first chunk of the hefty novel, as evidenced by the movie’s alternate title of Dune: Part One. Unlike Villeneuve’s previous pair, both of which are truly immersive experiences (particularly Arrival, the best picture of 2016 as shown here), this latest achievement produces a distancing effect that encourages respect rather than revelry. Its stateliness is both an asset and a detriment, as the picture looks absolutely stunning but occasionally feels too antiseptic for its own good. If nothing else, it stands head and shoulders over David Lynch’s 1984 dud (reviewed here), with a stronger cast, headier visual effects, and a more coherent storyline. Timothée Chalamet handles the pivotal role of Paul Atreides, believed to be “the chosen one” by the various factions jockeying for control of the spice-producing planet Arrakis. Paul’s parents are the noble Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and the devoted Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, arguably first among equals with a full-fledged performance), while his mentors include warriors Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). On the other side of the conflict reside the evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his crew, while more ambiguous in their intentions are Arrakis inhabitants Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya). Oh, yes, there are also sandworms on hand to devour the scenery. Even if Dune is occasionally chilly to the touch, there’s enough here of merit to warrant the upcoming Part Two. Extras in the 4K edition consist of making-of featurettes (including “Designing the Sandworm” and “Wardrobe from Another World”); a look at the various players; and pieces on three specific scenes. GAMBIT (1966). An agreeable caper comedy that can’t quite maintain its momentum throughout its 109-minute running time, Gambit was amusingly advertised with the tagline, “Go Ahead Tell the End (It’s Too Hilarious to Keep Secret) But Please Don’t Tell the Beginning!” That beginning (spoiler?) finds British cat burglar Harry Dean (Michael Caine) explaining to his cohort in crime Emile (John Abbott) how he plans to use a Eurasian dancer named Nicole (Shirley MacLaine) to help him steal a valuable relic from the richest man in the world, the Middle Eastern magnate Shahbandar (Herbert Lom). It’s a scheme that, as we see, plays flawlessly in Harry’s mind, even though the reality proves to be much more taxing. Nicole is brassy rather than docile, Shahbandar isn’t a meek sheik but rather a shrewd and suspicious businessman, and even Harry himself isn’t as smart or suave as he would like to believe. There’s that unwritten Hollywood rule decreeing that whenever two attractive stars are cast in a movie, their characters must fall in love whether it makes sense or not. Here it doesn’t, meaning that MacLaine and Caine are far more effective when bickering than when romancing. Gambit earned a trio of Academy Award nominations for its sets, costumes, and sound. A remake appeared in 2012 — written by the Coen Brothers and starring Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz, and Alan Rickman, it (unlike the original) was a critical and commercial flop. As for MacLaine and Caine, they reunited for two more films far inferior to this one: the following year’s Woman Times Seven (reviewed here) and the misbegotten 2005 update of Bewitched. Blu-ray extras consist of audio commentary by director Ronald Neame; film historian audio commentary; the theatrical trailer; and trailers for other titles on the Kino label. THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963). Forget the film school staples for a moment: If you cross off the usual suspects (Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Seventh Seal, Bicycle Thieves, etc.) from my list of the greatest movies ever made, this World War II adventure yarn would be what’s left standing near or at the very top. Certainly, it’d be a tight race between this, 1938’s The Adventures of Robin Hood, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark for the crown of the most enjoyable matinee-style popcorn picture that Hollywood has ever produced — the masterpieces that movie buffs can watch anytime, anywhere, and instantly feel uplifted by the experience. Based on a true story, this centers on an attempt by captured Allied soldiers to escape from Germany’s most secure POW camp; among the all-stars cast as prisoners taking part in the breakout are Steve McQueen (iconic as Hilts “The Cooler King”), James Garner (irresistible as Hendley “The Scrounger”), James Coburn (amusing as Sedgwick “The Manufacturer”), Charles Bronson (terrific as Danny “The Tunnel King”), and Donald Pleasence (touching as Blythe “The Forger”). McQueen’s thrilling motorcycle ride has long been the stuff of cinematic legend, but the movie is packed with countless memorable episodes of this caliber. John Sturges directs with verve, with Elmer Bernstein contributing a sensational score that clearly should have taken that year’s Oscar (shamefully, the movie’s sole nomination was for Best Film Editing). The Great Escape runs nearly three hours, yet it’s the fastest three hours ever spent in front of a movie screen or television set. 4K extras include audio commentary (from 2004) by Garner, Coburn, Pleasence, and other cast and crew members; film historian audio commentary; a retrospective making-of featurette; a piece on the real-life escape; and the theatrical trailer. JUICE (1992). Landing in the year between the more muscular pair of 1991’s Boyz n the Hood and 1993’s Menace II Society (the latter reviewed here), Juice feels relatively puny by comparison. Ernest Dickerson, the ace cinematographer on Spike Lee’s earliest films (including Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X), made his directorial debut with this drama that focuses on the everyday activities of four black teens growing up in Harlem. Q (Omar Epps) is the talented one (he hopes to become a professional DJ), Raheem (Khalil Kain) is the charismatic one, Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) is the follower, and Bishop (Tupac Shakur) is, as the rest soon find out, the loose cannon. Far down on the totem pole (among other indignities, they’re bullied by the members of a neighborhood gang), the friends feel they’ve finally acquired some “juice” (aka power) once they manage to obtain a gun. The four plot to knock over a convenience store, but since Bishop is the one brandishing the weapon, what would have been a simple robbery turns into a case of cold-blooded murder. The first half of the film covers familiar ground, but Dickerson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) gives it enough of a fresh spin that it remains involving. But following the robbery, the picture morphs from a candid look at urban life into a preposterous pulp thriller, as Bishop suddenly turns psychotic and starts blowing away friend and foe alike. Dickerson loses his grip on the material, leaving his capable actors at the mercy of increasingly embarrassing dialogue and developments. Extras on the 4K 30th Anniversary edition include audio commentary (from 2017) by Dickerson; a retrospective making-of featurette; a piece on the successful soundtrack (which hit #17 on the Billboard chart); and a vintage interview with the four male leads. RICH AND STRANGE (1931). While Alfred Hitchcock called his 1932 effort Number Seventeen “a terrible picture” (see the details, and the review, here), all accounts report that he had no such disdain for the film that immediately preceded it. Originally released stateside as East of Shanghai, Rich and Strange is indeed a thematically rich and occasionally strange movie, as well as one of Hitchcock’s best non-thrillers. Fred Hill (Henry Kendall) is bored with his lot in life and yearns for adventure, so when he’s informed that an uncle is leaving him a sizable inheritance, he and his wife Emily (Joan Barry) leave the drabness of their London flat and embark on a lavish cruise around the world. Although the experience offers the couple an opportunity to rekindle their romance, they instead drift into the arms of others: Emily establishes a comfortable rapport with a British gentleman (Percy Marmont) while Fred lusts after a princess (Betty Amann) who’s not quite what she seems. Although creaky at times, this is a sparkling comedy imbued with some thoughtful observations on love and marriage. While Rich and Strange was certainly too minor to have served as inspiration for other filmmakers’ movies, it is interesting in that its general plot outline brings to mind the rich texture of William Wyler’s 1936 Dodsworth (reviewed here), itself adapted from the Sinclair Lewis novel that was released two years before this picture, while the marvelous opening sequence has a whiff of Jacques Tati’s Monsieur Hulot about it. Shakespeare scholars will appreciate the film’s title (taken from The Tempest), but cat lovers will certainly not appreciate the comedic fate of the feline slinking through the proceedings. THE 7TH DAWN (1964). Seven years after The Bridge on the River Kwai, William Holden again played a combative American coping with hot weather and even hotter tensions in Southeast Asia. He stars as Ferris, a former guerilla fighter who spends the years following World War II growing his wealth as a Malayan plantation owner. His fellow fighter Dhana (Capucine), now a schoolteacher, has become his mistress, but the third part of their triangle, Ng (Tetsurô Tamba), left them for an education in Moscow. Ng has now returned to Malaya, and Ferris finds it difficult to maintain their friendship since his buddy is now a Communist terrorist responsible for the deaths of numerous British civilians and soldiers residing in the country. Susannah York co-stars as a woman with the unfortunate name of Candace Trumpey; her primary purpose is to try to bed the older Ferris at every opportunity and, later, steer further into his good graces by offering herself as a hostage to Ng in an effort to save an imprisoned Dhana. The sociopolitical angle carries the movie along for a good stretch, but once the characters are forced to slog through the jungle in the dull third act, viewers are forced to slog through the remainder of the picture. SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL (1959). Opinions will naturally differ on the politics behind this drama set during the Irish War of Independence, but there will be no arguments over the quality of James Cagney’s performance. One of the greatest actors ever, he’s typically superb here as Sean Lenihan, a kind and cheerful professor who also turns out to be a fanatical leader in the IRA. One of his school pupils is the Irish-American Kerry O’Shea (Don Murray), who repeatedly turns down offers to join the cause for Irish freedom since he saw enough bloodshed while serving in World War I. But as Kerry witnesses more atrocities being committed by the brutal British occupiers known as the Black and Tans — and after he himself is tortured by a particularly sadistic officer (Christopher Rhodes) — he realizes he can no longer remain on the fence. Murray essays the film’s largest role — it’s also the blandest role, as Kerry O’Shea will make the switch from doubter to devotee in predictable fashion. The richness is instead found in other characters: Cagney’s Sean Lenihan is a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure who snuffs out lives as a revolutionary as often as he saves them as a surgeon; Chris Noonan (Cyril Cusack) is a soft-spoken poet whose gentleness belies his position as an IRA leader; and Kitty Brady (an excellent Glynis Johns) is a barmaid who fully commits herself to the cause (and to the men who appreciate the bedroom favors she gives them) but who never gains Lenihan’s trust. It’s odd to see Michael Redgrave, that most British of British actors, playing an Irishman (an IRA bigwig most likely meant to be Michael Collins), but it’s not surprising to see a young Richard Harris playing the most volatile of IRA flunkies. SPENCER (2021). Anyone who’s seen director Pablo Larraín’s 2016 drama Jackie will have a general idea of what to expect from his latest at-bat. Hardly a standard biopic, Jackie (reviewed here) moved at its own peculiar pace as it zeroed in on the grief crippling Jacqueline Kennedy (Oscar-nominated Natalie Portman) as she mourned her assassinated husband. Spencer, showcasing a terrific performance by Kristen Stewart, similarly gets up close and personal with its subject, both in Larraín’s shooting style and in scripter Steven Knight’s attempts to analyze and understand the mindset of Diana, Princess of Wales, during a particularly difficult period in her life among the royals. It’s Christmastime 1991, and Diana is duty-bound to spend the holidays in the company of the royal family. She loves her sons William and Henry (Jack Nielen and Freddie Spry), enjoys hanging out with the Royal Dresser Maggie (Sally Hawkins), and has an amicable relationship with the head chef (Sean Harris). But she has little use for the rest of the lot, including her unfaithful and bullying husband Charles (Jack Farthing) and the household’s senior attendant (Timothy Spall). Although Larraín occasionally indulges his star too much — how many shots do we really need of Diana dancing her blues away? — this “fable from a true tragedy” (as it’s described at the start) succeeds as a turbulent character study of an emotionally compromised woman who’s as much a prisoner as she is a princess. THE VAMPIRE LOVERS (1970). Sheridan Le Fanu’s classic 1872 novella Carmilla has served as the basis for numerous vampire flicks, although it’s probably safe to state that this blood-and-boob-filled adaptation from Hammer Films boasts the largest fan base. The first entry in the so-called Karnstein Trilogy — Lust for a Vampire and Twins of Evil both followed in 1971 — this turned Ingrid Pitt into an overnight genre star by casting her in the central role of a vampire with decidedly lesbian tendencies. With her penchant for buxomly beauties, she first overcomes Laura von Spielsdorf (Pippa Steele), the daughter of a respected Austrian general (Peter Cushing), before setting her sights on Laura’s even more enticing friend Emma (Madeline Smith). There’s also an attraction between Carmilla and Emma’s governess (Kate O’Mara); meanwhile, the men she bloodily dispatches stir no feelings but are simply foolish enough to get in her way. The Vampire Lovers was one of the pictures that marked Hammer’s turn away from producing literate horror yarns in which the heaving bosoms were kept clothed and toward releasing more promiscuous fare in an effort to remain visible in the wake of new types of horror films like Night of the Living Dead and Rosemary’s Baby. The influx of nudity and extra gore didn’t help — the studio was basically done by the mid-1970s — but even Hammer’s lesser efforts in this, uh, vein are generally watchable. The Vampire Lovers resides above that lukewarm designation, but some clumsy plotting works against its total success. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by Pitt, director Roy Ward Baker, and scripter Tudor Gates; a discussion of the film and its source material; an interview with Smith; audio of Pitt reading excerpts from Carmella; and the theatrical trailer. THE WOODY ALLEN COLLECTION (1994-2003). Because no stateside outfit will touch Woody Allen at this point in time, the unknown Quiver Films ended up with eight titles to release in one Blu-ray box set. So the good news is that 1994’s Bullets Over Broadway, one of Woody’s best and an Academy Award winner for Dianne Wiest’s hysterical supporting performance, is finally on Blu-ray. The bad news is that you can only purchase it alongside such extremely lame endeavors as 1998’s Celebrity (Kenneth Branagh, Leonardo DiCaprio), 2001’s The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd), and 2002’s Hollywood Ending (Téa Leoni, Debra Messing). As for the rest, 1995’s middling Mighty Aphrodite contains Mira Sorvino’s Oscar-winning supporting turn, 1996’s Everyone Says I Love You is an enchanting all-star musical featuring Edward Norton, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, 2000’s Small Time Crooks is minor Allen with some very funny passages, and 2003’s Anything Else, starring Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci, is better than its reputation."
"Feb 12, 2022",POSITIVE," Every few years, a film arrives that changes the landscape of cinema. Back in 2008, Iron Man was released and, in turn, began the creation of the most profitable franchise of this generation – the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since then, the blueprint for significant studios was to release any intellectual property with potential box office value. But what if a studio decided to release intellectual property without much-beloved success? Warner Bros. answered that question with Denis Villeneuve’s Dune and, in turn, may have laid the foundation for the beginning of a new expanded universe not seen since a galaxy far, far away. Dune was first tackled in 1984 by the legendary David Lynch to unsatisfactory results for those unfamiliar with the property. Lynch was given a tall order as he attempted to complete the entire story in less run-time than Denis’s epic first part. Ultimately, the property was left dormant until Denis was allowed to take a swing. Dune was left motionless primarily for failing the tall task of telling its story on the big screen, as many have viewed the Frank Herbert novel as unadaptable. Denis not only steps up to the challenge but ignites a level of cinematic nirvana unseen in quite some time. Dune is quite significant in scale, but its most grounded basic premise tells the story of the House of Atreides and their leader, Duke Leto, as he is assigned to rule the planet of Arrakis by the Emperor. However, while taking over Arrakis, many factions are not fond of this new appointment and attempt to take down the family. During this, Duke’s son, Paul, has visions that ultimately will force him to decide whether or not to accept his destiny. Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Erich Roth honor Herbert’s novel in their screenplay as they fully immerse the viewer in this world. Rather than hand-holding and explaining every ongoing event, their script lets the film breathe and enables you to discover all the elements in this world. In comparison, Dune’s world-building falls in line with the early seasons of Game of Thrones. Yes, there are a lot of characters, and yes, a lot is going on, but patience pays off as, by the film’s conclusion, stakes are elevated, and you can draw a line on who to root for and against? Bringing the screenplay to life is one of the best cast ensembles of the year. While Lynch’s Dune gave us the gift of Kyle Mclaughlin, Timothée Chalamet’s Paul is perfection. But, of course, there are roles that some actors are meant to play, and Chalamet was destined to bring Paul to life as he runs through an array of emotions that bring to light whether or not Paul is meant to fulfill his destiny. Complementing Chalamet is the always reliable Rebecca Ferguson. While first coming off as a throwaway character, her impact on the film’s second half stands out with some of my favorite moments. While some of the cast gets minimal screen time, they each lay the groundwork for what is expected to be further expanded roles in the second entry in the series. The sheer scale of Villeneuve’s vision is aided by the brilliant work of cinematographer Greig Fraser. Point blank, it’s the most beautiful looking film of the year. Fraser’s work creates a world that surpasses the sci-fi world and enters the stratosphere of the old Hollywood epic. Throughout, I began to think of Dune in the same cinematographic space of Lawrence of Arabia and how Fraser’s work is that good. Hans Zimmer’s score elevates the technical marvel of Fraser’s cinematography. While always reliable, it felt that Zimmer attempted to replicate his scores from The Dark Knight and Inception for the past 13 years. This time around, Hans-y shifts the sounds of these scores and creates an epic sound that matches the sheer magnitude of Dune. It’s the best score of the year, and there’s little question as to whether Hans is worthy of an Oscar nomination and a second win. Fans of Frank Herbert’s Dune will be delighted that Villeneuve treated his acclaimed novel with care and respect. While the film is dependent on a second part being greenlit, it does not take away from the accomplishment Denis and the company created with this film. Hypnotizing and emotional, this spectacle is set to immerse cinephiles into Villeneuve’s Magnum Opus and one that is set to redefine the theatrical experience."
"Feb 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"Dune is an exceptional, big-budget sci-fi spectacle, with amazing production values, high-level acting performances, and grand visuals by director Denis Villeneuve."
"Feb 12, 2022",NEUTRAL," Near the end of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, there’s a brief moment where our hero, Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, sees a small rodent scurrying on the sand. Paul notices how the creature’s large ears accumulate moisture into a droplet, which it uses to sustain itself under the harsh desert conditions. Sometime later, hopefully, we will see Paul name himself muad’dib after the rodent when he leads the Fremen, the nomadic people of Arrakis. But unless you’ve read Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel—or the Wikipedia summary, as people find the book difficult to finish—the significance of this moment may elude you. And yet, Villeneuve and his co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts included the scene in their adaptation. Their devotion to Herbert’s text captures his layered investigation of imperialism, Middle-Eastern culture, ecology, industry, patriarchy and matriarchy, and political strategy in fine detail. Tackling source material considered unfilmable by some, Villeneuve leaves no theme untapped and does what seemed impossible by capturing the book’s depth in a major motion picture. It’s a perfectly cast and handsomely designed production, full of incredible sights. But given that Dune represents only half of Herbert’s story, the other half of which remains to be filmed or even greenlit at the time of this review, we’re left to wonder whether Chalamet will ever become muad’dib. The latest attempt to bring Herbert’s tome to the big screen shares in a history of troubled adaptations. Chilean filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky first tried in the mid-1970s, assembling artists like Moebius, H.R. Giger, and Chris Foss to create elaborate designs for a proposed 12-hour film that was never to be. David Lynch completed a screen version released in 1984, but he lost control to producer Dino de Laurentiis. Even if Jodorowsky or Lynch had been given limitless funds and creative freedom to complete their adaptations, the resulting films wouldn’t have been true to Herbert’s book. Both directors intended to explore aspects that interested them most. Jodorowsky seemed more driven by the potential for avant-garde filmmaking techniques and psychedelic artifice than doing the material justice. However, Lynch’s take, while beautifully staged, reduced the story to its roots in Joseph Campbell’s monomyth, developing the idea of Paul’s dreams leading to his emergence as a hero. Villeneuve is more selfless than his predecessors; he applies his aesthetic of lingering camerawork and mesmerizing visuals to serve Herbert’s vision, crafting a faithful translation. Writing this review, then, becomes a tricky task. For one, I cannot ignore that feeling of emptiness that Dune left me with when the credits began to roll. Should the film be blamed for this, or is that just the nature of this particular beast? Also, I cannot ignore everything I felt before that emptiness took over. Villeneuve does something incredible by visualizing certain scenes and characters the way I envisioned them when reading the book, which I cherish. Few science-fiction films have realized their source material so well (so far, anyway). The director, cinematographer Greig Fraser, and production designer Patrice Vermette render distinct worlds that reflect the story’s setting of several thousands of years in the future. The production resists the ostentation of Lynch’s version, preferring an elegant functionality to the costumes, sets, vehicles, and planetary designs. Yet, we see familiar sights, suggesting they originated from the unmentioned Earth. Small details such as bullfighting and bagpipes appear around the Atreides family, who hail from the ocean planet Caladan but have been tasked with overseeing Arrakis, a planet that produces “spice” needed for intergalactic travel—it also opens the mind and extends life. The Fremen, clearly drawn from Islamic and Middle-Eastern cultures, have a familiar spirituality that attracts Paul, recalling the titular enigma in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The film’s best scenes involve the curt Stilgar (Javier Bardem), whose social graces confound most members of House Atreides.  The story of Dune also remains true to the book, although the script makes slight alterations to enhance the depth of certain characters. Paul, of course, has more personality thanks to Chalamet’s slender frame, inwardness, and vulnerable gestures. His chummy relationship with his mentors, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), prove alternately endearing and parental. Oscar Isaac, too, brings a great deal of humanity to Paul’s father, Duke Leto, whose otherwise noble eyes also contain a parent’s unwavering love. The screenplay’s best alteration builds upon Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul’s mother and member of the Bene Gesserit—a group of powerful women who work in secret to shift power in the universe away from the unseen Emperor. Through haunting sound design and flashes of dream imagery laden with blood and fire, Paul hears the whispers of the Bene Gesserit and sees glimpses of his future path as a revolutionary alongside the Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya). Jessica hints that his future with the Fremen will “bridge space and time, past and future.” All of this talk of emergence and fate on a desert planet, and the viewer will begin to realize just how much George Lucas lifted from Herbert to write Star Wars (1977).  Still, in its current, halved form, Dune is an emotionally dissatisfying experience—mainly due to extratextual issues—albeit one that has the potential of becoming one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made. If “Part Two” happens, and it’s just as well-crafted as “Part One,” then cinephiles have a treasure awaiting them. But I feel about Dune similarly to how I felt in 2001 about The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, another open-ended chapter in a series. I recognize this film’s individual excellence, but its lasting effect may depend on what follows. At least with Peter Jackson’s trilogy, he filmed them all simultaneously, representing an enormous commitment on the part of New Line Cinema. With Dune, the studio’s commitment remains to be seen. In the meantime, Villeneuve’s treatment results in a million details that intrigue, from the way he portrays “the voice” in disorienting layers of sound to the way the mouths of Arrakis’ enormous sandworms resemble the iris of an eye. The director achieves another impressive trick by casting a roster of all-star performers who disappear entirely into their roles. Best of all, Villeneuve seems to understand the material better than any other director before him; he points every element of the cinematic apparatus toward the singular goal of realizing Herbert’s vision. It’s gratifying to see a filmmaker who understands Dune finally, but it makes my hope for a sequel even more desperate and, at this moment, worrisome. "
"Feb 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"Sure it is long and dense, but the drama of Dune is engaging and it does make the audience care about its characters and stories."
"Feb 12, 2022",POSITIVE," Dune is a superb sci-fi epic that shocks the senses. This review explores the movie on its own without reflecting its ability to adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel. Director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve crafts an experience that seeks to truly immerse the audience in its world, rather than just tell a story. It won’t be for everyone, but it’s quite hypnotizing if you give into it. 10191 is the year. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the son of a noble family with high expectations for his future. His family is tasked with ruling and protecting a dangerous desert planet, Arrakis. This planet has the “spice melange,” which can extend human life and create superhuman abilities.  However, Arrakis has dangers that the noble family isn’t entirely prepared for. The native Fremen people and incoming invaders are just a couple of the dangers. The heat is inhospitable and massive sandworms travel underneath the desert sand’s surface. Nonetheless, the noble family plans to serve and protect. Dune supposedly covers roughly the first half of the novel. The opening’s subtitle reads “part one,” which truly sets the tone that it isn’t going to deliver the whole story. It lays the groundwork for a universe that is so rich, it deserves more than one movie. Dune takes its time to get acclimated. It progressively introduces the characters and the stakes, but never gives too much away.  Dune is a sci-fi movie that places emphasis on family. Paul’s father Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) gives him insight into leadership. However, Paul’s relationship with his mother Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) is further emphasized. The mother-son relationship is truly tested as they’re forced into various dangerous situations. This dynamic is the story’s genuine driver to make viewers care about their journey. Dune is an intentionally slow-moving sci-fi epic. The movie seeks to absorb you into its universe before it advances. It does so with Villeneuve’s superb direction, Greig Fraser’s gorgeous cinematography, and Hans Zimmer’s otherworldly score. It’s otherworldly in both its nature and its quality. Every scene further hypnotizes deeper into its grasp, making the 155-minute runtime feel much shorter than it is. The characters’ depth is a tad lacking, yet Dune still manages to make their story matter. By becoming invested in their world, it simultaneously invests its audience in its characters. Paul is the least captivating of the bunch, although Chalamet does what he can with the part. Ferguson’s Lady Jessica is the most impactful performance here, showcasing incredible depth and nuance.  Dune is not the action spectacle that some folks may be expecting. It’s a slow-moving, yet entirely immersive sci-fi epic. See it on the biggest screen with the loudest sound system available. The movie will also be debuting on the streaming service HBO Max, but this is a film that begs for your total attention in a dark theater. Dune is an experience. Let it wash over you. I'm an avid film buff who's always on the search for the next best indie or horror movie. I'm most likely enjoying a nice cup of tea while writing film reviews or entertainment news."
"Feb 12, 2022",POSITIVE," A young man is destined for great things. It’s a set up so commonplace that we rarely give it a second look. Within fantasy and science fiction, it’s even more expected. Which is why Dune has always stood out from the rest. Frank Herbert’s novel is filled with political intrigue between warring houses and wondrous worlds that feel fully lived in. Yet at the center of it is Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his journey to find his own path through life despite many hands guiding him through it. As much a philosophical coming-of-age tale as an epic political science fiction and fantasy story, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Dune is a wonder to behold and fully realizes a universe that beyond its massive scale and otherworldly creations is subject to the same human problems that exist today. Those unfamiliar with Herbert’s novel may find themselves at a slight disadvantage when they begin watching Dune. Villeneuve goes the same route as Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings adaptations and does not hold the audience’s hand until terms like ‘Gom Jabbar’, ‘Kwisatz Haderach’, and ‘Shai-Hulud’ are beaten into their brains before moving on. Instead, Villeneuve lets these terms wash over the audience, sinking in if they do but moving on if they don’t. The term isn’t crucial to understand right away, it’s what it represents that matters most. Dune follows Paul as he and the rest of House Atreides leave their home planet of Caladan to accept stewardship over planet Arrakis and oversee the manufacturing of the galaxy’s most important resource: spice. Complications ensue when they arrive on the planet and find that the previous owners, House Harkonnen, have left them with a barely operable spice operation. While House Atreides attempts to get their mining operation back on its feet, plans are set in motion that will have massive ramifications to everyone involved. When people talk about Dune they always bring up the story’s devotion to spice. Why is spice so damn important? Well, the film gives a succinct explanation: it powers everything. Transplanted to modern society, that resource could just as easily be oil or water. Something to be hoarded and privatized. Villeneuve doesn’t spend too much time on the importance of spice other than reiterating how crucial it is that everything runs smoothly so the universe can run smoothly. Instead, where Villeneuve centers Dune is on Paul and the many forces attempting to shepherd him in different directions. He’s heir to the throne and will succeed his father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), but is also being trained by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), to harness the power of the ‘Voice’ and hopefully become the Chosen One, or the Kwisatz Haderach, as instructed by the all-female religious organization known as the Bene Gesserit. Then there are these dreams that Paul continues to have of a girl (Zendaya) on Arrakis that suggests a different path than the two he is being led on. There’s a reason Dune was largely considered unadaptable and it’s immediately evident when you try to explain the plot to someone. It’s a story with many characters, all of which have a significant role to play, even if their character seems minor. It’s the kind of intricate web where it’s almost impossible to follow along completely because everyone has their own motivations guiding them. When you take into account that the opening title card of this film reads “Dune Part One”, it’s clear that Villeneuve had to make the conscious decision to split the book into two parts when adapting it to film. There’s just no way to take a book that dense and turn it into one film without losing so much of its intent (see: David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation). Once a decision like that is made, then comes how the film will be framed. That’s the magic of Dune. There’s this grander narrative initiated behind-the-scenes by the Emperor of the Imperium that forces House Harkonnen and House Atreides at each other’s throats. Spectacle and scale extend out from this conflict, giving Dune its massive scope and astounding setpieces. These range from the first time Paul encounters a sandworm to armies fighting in close-combat to flying through a sandstorm. All accompanied by a dizzying score from Hans Zimmer that features so much variety without losing the film’s scope. These setpieces also lend themselves to a visually gorgeous film that feels like a companion piece to Blade Runner 2049 – Villeneuve’s other ambitious science fiction film. Though this one has less emphasis on lighting and the overall noir aesthetic of Blade Runner, it makes up for it with wide vistas and an equal emphasis on mood and scale. Shot by Greig Fraser, there’s an oppressiveness to a lot of Dune’s composition that mirrors Paul’s own struggle to get out from everyone else’s expectations of him. The production design also helps with that, surrounding each House with brutalist architecture and the planet of Arrakis itself forcing House Atreides indoors to the dimly lit rooms shielded from the sun.  Down a layer from the spectacle is the relationship between Paul and his parents and their separate plans for him. That’s where the film finds its heartbeat. It is not until Paul steps foot on the sands of Arrakis that he appears to have autonomy over himself. A lot of Dune is shot close to the character’s faces, often because they are alone in a room or feel separated from those around them. The relationship between Leto and Jessica is almost entirely told visually with the two of them rarely speaking to each other and yet appearing to love each other wholly and completely. Then there are the relationships Paul has with so many other characters. As royalty, he doesn’t really have friends more so than he has strong bonds with allies. Jason Momoa’s first appearance as Duncan Idaho immediately establishes the close relationship that he and Paul have, even though he is also Paul’s combat instructor. Every character that Paul interacts with immediately feels like there’s a lifetime of camaraderie, even if he might be kept at an arm’s length from the more serious discussions surrounding his life. Dune also works really well because not only does every character feel lived in and end up feeling significant: they’re also played by extremely charismatic actors who do so much in the role. The supporting cast overall is stacked with actors all providing great performances. From Stephen McKinley Henderson to Josh Brolin to David Dastmalchian and Dave Bautista to Javier Bardem and Sharon Duncan-Brewster, there are so many fantastic performances that all lend themselves completely to Villeneuve’s vision. That’s just the supporting cast, all of whom give it their all as if they’ll never get to do a movie like this again. Not only does the casting in the film feel true to Herbert’s novel, it elevates the significance of everything within it. Nothing is just a role that needs to be filled. It’s a character that needs to be lived in. This is to say nothing of the two most important roles in the film, Paul and Jessica. Chalamet isn’t quite revelatory as Paul but he fits the role snugly and does a fantastic job carrying a film that relies heavily on introspection and carrying the burden others have placed on him. It’s really when Dune begins exploring Lady Jessica and starts prying at her character where the MVP of the film’s cast stands tall. Rebecca Ferguson is a powerhouse in this, turning Jessica into a fierce, independent woman, capable of operating with just as much precision in the shadows as in the light. She can juggle the most emotional sequences with ones that demand her to be brutal and royal at the same time. It’s arguably her best performance in a career that has already seen many great roles significantly elevated by her presence. The key to Dune is that it depends on its humanity, so while the science fiction and fantasy elements are there and done well, it’s making sure the characters never feel like “we need an evil henchman” that gives Dune its power. The stakes are just as real for one person as they are the other. Loss is loss, no matter who is involved. It’s easy to follow along with each character’s plight because they’re relatable in some way. This is evident in the recurring idea in House Atreides of the desire to do good when the world seems to be working against you and the attempt to be yourself when external forces pressure you into fulfilling a role. Unfortunately the downside to everything with Dune is that it doesn’t end in a way that will satisfy most narratively. It’s part one of an intended two-part series. Where it leaves things hangs a lot of loose threads that will be entertaining to pick back up with a character who makes a meaningful choice at the end that will define his entire being. As a whole movie, it’s impossible for it to feel complete, but there are not much better ways to end a first part than where it does. At the end of the day, Dune is a triumph. It builds a world and strings together so many narrative threads and characters that it’s mind boggling how well it works. There’s an entire universe to explore, but Villeneuve manages to let it wash over you and fully immerse the audience in its political and religious underpinnings. It’s hard to call it his best movie when it dangles so many unfinished stories in the air, but it is certainly his greatest achievement in almost every respect. Part Two cannot come soon enough.

"Feb 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve brings his distinctly grandiose style to a classic that has been begging for a big-screen adaptation in the age of blockbuster franchises. And he makes the final product stand out in a big way. Dune: Part One hits theatres on October 21, and you can stream it on HBO Max in the US on the same day from 6PM ET. Dune: Part Two and an HBO Max original series, Dune: Sisterhood are due out in 2023. The story follows the young Paul Atreides as he relocates with his family from his ancestral planet Caladan to the desert planet Arrakis. His father, a duke, has been assigned to oversee the planet by the ruling Empire. Arrakis is where “spice” — a rare and extremely valuable substance used for space travel — is harvested. But upon arrival, it’s clear the Atreides family is a target, most notably of the rival Harkonnen family who want to control the spice and the native population of Arrakis, the Fremen. All the while, Paul is training to master the powers passed down by his mother, a member of the Bene Gesserit, a typically female sect known to many as witches. Paul may be the prophesied Kwisatz Haderach, a powerful messiah, who could be instrumental in the upcoming conflicts on Arrakis. Dune is chock full of major stars too. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul, and he’s joined by Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, and more. The 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune lays out the “making of” a Dune adaptation that never actually materialized. The cult auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky’s take on the source material attracted immense talent, and some initial financial backing, but as its aspirations grew, so did pushback. The project eventually fizzled out. What was left, however, was a huge legacy of creative work that made its way into other projects. Jodorowsky’s Dune has its fingerprints on everything from Star Wars to Alien to Raiders of the Lost Ark to Blade Runner to The Terminator and so many more. Even David Lynch’s own largely reviled 1984 adaptation of Dune has traces of it. It’s fascinating to watch Denis Villeneuve draw very directly from those aesthetics, blending concepts and visuals from both the non-existent Dune and the many films it did inspire. I’m sure someone will eventually edit together a string of inspirations for Villeneuve’s vision, but for now, it’s incredibly rewarding to tease apart the look of the world onscreen and why it’s so familiar. That aesthetic is broadly a grim one. We see distinctly fascist architecture. Ugly brutalist buildings made of concrete populate all of the Imperial worlds. Grotesquely organic-looking machinery also peppers the landscape. And all of that is juxtaposed with gorgeous nature shots, with vast oceans of water, sand, and stars filling the screen. It’s all mesmerizing and verging on sublime. And that’s the bulk of the film’s appeal, really. It’s world-building writ large. There’s a narrative, of course, and characters. But the political intrigue is relatively convoluted. We get bits and pieces of it, often incomplete and drowned out by the majesty of the natural world constantly threatening to eat up the nasty human world — in the case of the giant sandworms of Arrakis, quite literally. Dune is big in every sense. It’s event viewing and doesn’t shy away from the bizarreness of its source material, from the repugnant Harkonnen clan to the recycling of sweat and spit to cryptic visions of a coming messiah. As with his previous film Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve takes a “more is more” approach here, and that means the scale of this thing is truly epic in the classical sense of the word. But it also means the pacing can feel a bit chaotic, rushing through exposition one minute and then just casually hanging out on some sand dunes the next to soak in the beauty. This suits the world-building elements, no doubt. I feel like I could actually visit the planets Arrakis and Caladan. But more, I can believe that they are part of a much bigger, inhabited galaxy without seeing it. These places exist. Their people are real. The resources they fight over are indeed precious and finite. This is the great gift of Dune. It compels us to suspend our disbelief and become immersed in its universe. The Imax screen I saw it on surely didn’t hurt. But I have no doubt Villeneuve’s efforts will still pay off on HBO Max. Of course, by splitting the film in two, Villeneuve is also denying us a great deal of narrative resolution. It would be nice for Dune to feel a little more complete on its own. Villeneuve picks a smart point to end on, but we’re watching the pieces being put in place on the game board without actually seeing a whole lot of gameplay. World-building only goes so far, and at the end of the day, this is effectively the first half of a movie. Maybe none of that matters though, as the film certainly left me wanting a Dune: Part Two. Hopefully, Warner Bros. lets this story live on to its conclusion."
"Feb 10, 2022",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited adaptation of Dune is contender a for one of the most beautiful science fiction movies of all time that's only let down by a screenplay that lacks any real flair.  It’s here, it’s beautiful, and it’s so bassy it makes you vibrate in your seat: Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited adaptation of Dune has finally premiered on the sunny shores of the Lido at the Venice Film Festival, treating audiences to an astronomically impressive film that favours characterisation over bombastic action.
 The epic—billed in its opening credits as Dune: Part One—isn’t just a contender for one of the most stunning science fiction movies of all time but perfectly strikes the balance of leaving you positively parched for Part Two while never feeling like half a film. With the best Hans Zimmer score of the past decade and endless crisp tableaus of jaw-dropping cinematography, Denis Villeneuve has delivered and then some of his mission to give Frank Herbert’s pioneering novel due diligence on the big screen.
 “Dreams are messages from the deep,” reads the opening message of Dune, setting the tantalizing scene for the following 155 minutes of sheer cinematic prowess. If you’re not overly familiar with the source novel of the same name, Villeneuve has you in safe hands—easily sketching the characters, locations, and backstories for any Arrakis newbies without an annoying sense of spoon-feeding for any diehard Duneheads. The year is 10191, and House Atreides—comprising of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), are readying themselves to leave their home planet of Caladan. Flanked by their Master of Assassins (Stephen McKinley Henderson), weapons master (Josh Brolin), swordmaster (Jason Momoa), and doctor (Chang Chen), they are set to take control of Arrakis, a desert planet home to ‘Spice‘. This sacred hallucinogen not only enhances mental capabilities but is hinted to have potential uses for interplanetary space travel.
 Despite Duke Leto’s early assertion that there is “no call, we do not answer, no faith we do not betray,” House Atreides is rightfully nervous about the move. Arrakis is populated by millions of Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants who are mistrustful of those who continue to colonise their home in order to harvest spice. Fremen members include Chani (Zendaya), a mysterious young woman who continues to appear in Paul’s dreams, and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of one Fremen group on Dune.
 What’s more, Arrakis’ previous rulers—House Harkonnen—aren’t too pleased about being usurped from their role of power and are already ancient enemies of House Atreides. The blancmange-like Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his henchmen Glossu (Dave Bautista), and Piter (David Dastmalchian) scheme to ensure House Atreides are doomed to fail, partnering with an Emperor who is threatened by the growing power and prestige of the family.
 Running alongside these more political struggles for power is a more spiritual search for The One, or ‘Kwisatz Haderach’: someone who can access memories, see the future and exercise superhuman cognitive powers. A mysterious female group known as Bene Gesserit, headed by Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), have been cross-breeding different houses in order to try and locate The One. And if that wasn’t enough, the entire planet of Arrakis is in oscillating fear and awe of giant, subterranean sandworms that threaten to consume everything in sight every time they hear a thudding footstep.
 In undoubtedly his best performance since Call Me By Your Name, Timothée Chalamet shines as the central Homeric hero born with an albatross around his neck. He plays Paul Atreides with an athletic angst that stands strong in the film’s airtight ensemble, easily rising to the task of such a demanding, enigmatic role. As well as his trademark vulnerability, all furrowed brow and Byronic curls, Chalamet is forthright and fierce when needed: a believable fledgling leader that exudes his House’s trademark loyalty.
 Another highlight is Rebecca Ferguson, who serves as the film’s emotional core—not as a hackneyed weepy woman trying to protect her family, but a mysterious and spiritual figure who sees horror, fear and destiny in a way that others do not. Grande Dame of cinema Charlotte Rampling draws upon her long history of ‘cold fish’ roles to frighten everyone unlucky enough to cross her steely-eyed path.
 As the brusque weapons master to House Atreides, it’s a shame that Josh Brolin fades into the background; an early training scene with Paul feels merely expository to prove that the young boy can indeed fight when provoked, and the character has little significance beyond that in Part One. However, Jason Momoa proves for the umpteenth time his status as one of the most charismatic men in Hollywood, bringing a recognisable gentle-giant-that-bares-its-teeth energy to the screen. Only really making an appearance over two hours in, we’ll have to wait until Part Two to truly see how Zendaya chews the scene as the blue-eyed Chani and how Javier Bardem’s character will develop beyond an initial blank gruffness.
 Put simply, Dune is a visual feast—nay, banquet—that takes us from stunning locale to stunning locale before you even have time to drink in the exquisite composition. Villeneuve does an excellent job with world-building, making each location fleshed out and unique. Whether it’s the dusty climes of Arrakis with the air alive with specks of glinting gold or the windswept shores of the oceanic Caladan, the feeling is painterly, Turner-esque and truly breathtaking.
 Cinematographer Greig Fraser makes us choke on the dust and sand that fills the planet while never resorting to dull or muddy opacity. Thankfully, Dune avoids the ugly green-screen trappings of many modern films that rely heavily on CGI: it truly feels not like a two-dimensional dystopia but a frightening and possible version of the future, which is exactly what this world is meant to be.
 Filming also took place on location in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, adding real texture that technology often tries and fails to emulate. In particular, one scene that comes around the middle—where we witness spice harvesting interrupted by our first glimpse at a sandworm—is simply breathtaking. Costume designer Jacqueline Goya studied the ochre-toned paintings of Francisco Goya for inspiration in the characters’ clothing, balancing textural history with functional futurism. From the Reverend Mother’s Kamilavka-style headpiece to Lady Jessica’s gold-encrusted veil, each piece hides details about the characters.
 Evoking the eerie, pulsating rhythms that send sandworms into a frenzy, Hans Zimmer’s score is spasmodic, cinema-shaking, eardrum-bursting stuff. The chanting and wailing of female voices reflects the power that Lady Jessica and the rest of the Besse Gesserit have on the direction of the drama, as well as the feminine presence haunting Paul’s dreams.
 While Dune looks incredible, an area that perhaps suffers is the screenplay. Co-adapted for the screen by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Forrest Gump writer Eric Roth, there’s a real absence of literary flair considering the source prose. This is undoubtedly a choice to make the dialogue as natural as possible, but with such visual pomp and ceremony, more talky scenes often feel a little flat. Many characters deliver their lines in irritating, whispery vocal fry, often deployed by actors in an attempt to evoke a sense of hushed dramatism.
 Any poetic phrasing one might hope to see translated from the book seems to be gone, and what dialogue is written doesn’t seem to be utilized to its best effect. With a 400-page novel, you can take time to introduce your dystopia’s concepts and language, but with this film, sometimes the real significance of certain objects and concepts struggle to stick in the memory. A second watch might be needed in order to tell your Gom Jabbars from your Chakobsa.
 Dune is sure to satiate the scepticism of Herbert purists and win over fresh audiences alike. It’s not quite an emotional sucker-punch, but it’s cinema: loud, gorgeous and sorely missed. Denis Villeneuve has described this film as “an appetiser for the second part still to come, which is the main meal.” If that’s the case, then we’re all in for an absolute treat.

"Feb 3, 2022",POSITIVE," Of course, that didn't happen. Even the easy availability of free vaccinations didn't persuade a significant segment of the population to embrace science and community over conspiracy and hostility.  What's that have to do with me making my choices for the Best Movies of the Year, as I have done very year since (gulp) 1996?  But now there are reasons beyond convenience to stay home. I frequently go to the movies (the screenings are almost never crowded, and thus feel ""safe""), but who am I to tell you you should?  As a result of this ongoing pandemic reality, I've opened the doors to, well, everything. Though, of course, I've seen only a very tiny fraction of everything.  Most of the movies below did play at a Memphis movie theater or during the Indie Memphis Film Festival in 2021. But a few didn't. And most of those that did screen here probably found their largest audiences at home, via Netflix or Hulu or Amazon or some other streaming service. Opening the doors to everything is intimidating and humbling. I'm very much aware that I likely will encounter in the months to come many movies from 2021 that should be mentioned here.  An unconventional year calls for an unconventional approach. A Top 10 list can be found below, but what you mostly will find here are 13 categories containing most of my choices for the best new-release movies I saw in 2021. I picked ""13"" because this feels like an unlucky year. But it's actually been a good one for movies, if not for the theatrical movie business, and the evidence can be found in these titles. Nobody is making movies that feel more alive than those of Sean Baker. ""Red Rocket,"" the writer-director's follow-up to ""Tangerine"" and ""The Florida Project,"" introduces former MTV ""Veejay"" Simon Baker as Mikey Saber, an energetic but dishonest blowhard hustler on the skids who decides a small-town Texas teenager nicknamed ""Strawberry"" (Suzanna Son) will be his ticket back to the porn-industry big time; the alternately ludicrous and lubricious action occurs against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election, with Mikey functioning as a prophecy of the resilience of the winning candidate's delusional toxic-male narcissism. Working on location with a mostly amateur ensemble, Baker demonstrates yet again that his eye and instincts are unerring. ""Red Rocket"" deserves its R rating, but ""Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn"" — Romania's Oscar entry for Best International Feature — pushes into X territory: It opens with a sexually explicit videotape that lands a teacher (Katia Pascariu) in hot water when her consenting-adult bedroom acrobatics are shared online. With its contentious debates about privacy, its street scenes of pedestrians in protective masks, and its chaotic school conferences filled with preening mothers and leering fathers, Radu Jude's social/political comedy taps like an intubator into a culture gasping for breath. In February, the Japanese writer-director Ryusuke Hamaguchi delivered ""Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy,"" an original anthology film with three segments; he followed that five months later with ""Drive My Car,"" a three-hour Chekhov-infused adaptation of a short story by Haruki Murakami. In Hamaguchi's films, men and women turn to art to redirect the unsatisfying narratives of their lives; the filmmaker manifests this idea with images that are as uncluttered and direct as his stories are rich and his characters complex. Two of the most impressive streaks in cinema continued as Wes Anderson and Paul Thomas Anderson pulled from their youthful enthusiasms and experiences to craft films that function like prisms, refracting what feels like candid revelation into colorful, episodic narrative. Set in the 1970s San Fernando Valley, P. T.  Anderson's ""Licorice Pizza"" makes an instant movie star of pop-rock singer Alana Haim, while also resurrecting water beds, Wings and hairdresser-turned-Barbra Streisand boyfriend Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper). The vibe suggests ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" but goofy. Festooned to the edge of mania with visual marginalia and verbal rococo, ""The French Dispatch,"" meanwhile, is Wes Anderson's indulgent and meticulous homage to The New Yorker magazine, mid-century; the lapidary, peripatetic creativity — which includes animation, multiple frame ratios, and many digital effects — illuminates rather than obscures a hopeful but not naïve message about the agonizing joy of making art. Confesses a James Baldwin-like writer (Jeffrey Wright) in the film's heartbreaking yet energizing final episode: ""I chose this life. It is the solitary feast that has been very much like a comrade — my great comfort and fortification.” Fashioned by drummer-turned-director Questlove and editor Joshua L. Pearson into 117 ecstatic minutes from some 40 hours of footage, “Summer of Soul (Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised…)” teleports the viewer onstage with Sly Stone, Nina Simone, Mahalia Jackson and the other divinities who performed during the all-but-forgotten 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival; 50 years later, the event seems less a “Black Woodstock” (as it once was promoted) than a Utopian vision of Black art and community that a larger white establishment was too hostile or disinterested to validate. The “Utopian” judgment rarely was applied to the often dark, druggy and disturbing music of “The Velvet Underground,” but Todd Haynes’ documentary, sculpted largely from vintage materials, persuasively presents the Warhol-abetted, New York-incubated band as avatars of an enviable rock-and-roll authenticity. Meanwhile, Penny Lane’s revelatory “Listening to Kenny G” is less biodoc than inquisition into the value — as artist, as commodity, as metaphor — of the mega-successful but much-reviled smooth jazz saxophonist of its title. (Note: Peter Jackson’s epic “The Beatles: Get Back” would be included here, but I decided to follow the lead of the motion picture Academy, which excludes multi-part productions.) Updated by writer Tony Kushner for a modern era attuned to ideas of gentrification and racial identity but with its late 1950s setting and nonpareil Leonard Bernstein/Stephen Sondheim music intact, director Steven Spielberg's remake of 1961's ""West Side Story"" demonstrates that bodies in motion — especially when moving in partnership with a sympathetic and perceptive camera — remain the most thrilling movie special effect. A much less conventional opus (the songs are by the clever pop-rock duo Sparks), Leos Carax's catchy-yet-alienating sort-of-musical, ""Annette,"" asks whether a standup-comic ""Ape of God"" (Adam Driver) with a death on his conscience and a living puppet in his nursery deserves redemption. In what functions as director Pablo Larrain's companion to his ""Jackie"" (2016), which cast Natalie Portman as the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy, ""Spencer"" presents Kristen Stewart as a nerve-racked Diana, Princess of Wales, who endures a torturous Christmas weekend with her scornful royal in-laws while in a state of glam delirium. Something wicked this way comes? No, it's just the queen, trailed by her corgis. The wickedness is more deadly and the witches more literal in ""The Tragedy of Macbeth,"" a sinister Shakespeare adaptation from Joel Coen (directing for the first time without his brother, Ethan) that crowns Denzel Washington as the murderous title king and Frances McDormand as his damned-spot-stained lady. Presented in black-and-white and in the squarish aspect ratio of old movies, the film — indebted to the currently fashionable ""folk horror"" subgenre — arguably does little that Orson Welles didn't do in 1948 under the parsimonious oversight of Republic Pictures; but why argue with a new opportunity to experience the unbeatable combination of cinematic expressionism and Shakespearean expression? In Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog,” Benedict Cumberbatch is a 1925 Montana cowboy whose classics degree from Yale is only the most respectable of the extraordinary aspects he buries beneath a foul odor and a fouler temper. In Rebecca Hall’s “Passing,” centered on Harlem a century ago, a Black woman (Ruth Negga) ""passing"" as white disrupts the conventional domestic tranquility of a childhood friend (Tessa Thompson); the black-and-white photography exposes the absurdity of racial codification by reproducing every actor’s face in scales of gray. Finally, Shaka King’s “Judas and the Black Messiah” vividly reimagines encounters from history (""Power"" and ""Passing"" are based on novels) by revisiting the betrayal of Chicago Black Panther Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya, who won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his work here) by an FBI infiltrator (Lakeith Stanfield). Writer-director David Lowery, whose filmography includes 2017’s “A Ghost Story,” weaves another haunting and profound enchantment by tugging at the tapestry of Arthurian tradition in ""The Green Knight""; Dev Patel is Sir Gawain, whose quest —  highlighted by uncanny images that pierce the armor of space and time —  is essentially the literal date with death we all must make. Based in history rather than poetry, Ridley Scott’s “The Last Duel"" casts Matt Damon (who wrote the script, with Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener) and Adam Driver as a real-life medieval French knight and squire, respectively, whose soured friendship ends in a formal fight to the finish. Beautifully and brutally choreographed, the climactic combat is motivated more by the knight's ego than by his concern for the welfare and honor of his wife (Jodie Comer), whose rape by the squire is the cruel crux of a ""Rashomon""-like multiple-perspective story structure. With their most ambitious films to date, two very different filmmakers praise the loud but otherwise employ largely divergent but not entirely incompatible methods to inspire dread and wonder. Shot in Chile by the Cannes-conquering Thai writer-director Apichatpong Weerasethak, ""Memoria"" unfolds with a somnambulist's pace and a dreamer's logic. Tilda Swinton stars as a woman repeatedly startled by a sudden noise that no one else can hear; the climactic revelation is both awe-inspiring and deflating, retroactively and reductively recasting the woman's experience as more a puzzle than a mystery. With a budget of $165 million that could pay for dozens of the Thai filmmaker's projects, ""Dune: Part One"" is surprisingly patient and deliberate for a science-fiction would-be blockbuster. Adapted by director Denis Villeneuve from Frank Herbert's eco-conscious 1965 best-seller, the movie is mesmerizing for much of its three-hour length, especially during its first half, when it prioritizes statecraft and intrigue and augurs and artful arrangements of strangely costumed individuals and strikingly designed alien vessels; when the emphasis shifts to fights and chases, it loses a great deal of its grip. The mystery and trauma of time and the aging process inspired these very different works, each of which screened during the Indie Memphis Film Festival (as did several other films on this list). The first of these, written and directed by France's Céline Sciamma, is ""Petite Maman,"" which presents twins Joséphine and Gabrielle Sanz as 8-year-old girls whose friendship springs from a mystery that is part fairy tale, part ""Twilight Zone."" If Sciamma charms, Gasper Noé shocks (as always). Presented entirely in disorienting split-screen, ""Vortex"" casts Françoise Lebru and horror auteur Dario Argento as an elderly couple whose brains become as disordered as their book-and-memorabilia-crammed Paris apartment after the wife is stricken with dementia. (Honorable mention goes to ""Old,"" which is fearsomely compelling until a final unnecessary M. Night Shyamalan ""twist"" transforms a terrifying metaphor about the pitilessness of old age into what seems to be a pitch for a cable sci-fi series.) Framing its imaginative kills like transgressive artworks within mirrors and windows and gallery spaces, Nia DaCosta's reboot/sequel ""Candyman"" retains the Chicago setting of its influential 1992 predecessor but relocates the shocks to a bougie-artsy 2021 milieu where talent and education ultimately provide no escape or defense from the racist past or present; in this context, ""Say his name"" is more curse than affirmation. ""The Card Counter,"" meanwhile, is another of writer-director Paul Schrader's portraits of fracturing loner diarists (see also: ""Taxi Driver"" and ""First Reformed"") trundling toward penitential violence; Oscar Isaac is the title professional gambler, scarred by his experiences as a guard at Abu Ghraib. Colorful creatures sprung from their cells (in the plots of these movies) and from some type of mythology (in the origins of those plots) go on rampages of destruction and sometimes affection in this pair of tripped-out fantasy adventures.  Written and directed by Dash Shaw with animation directed by Jane Samborski, ""Cryptozoo"" employs watercolor, pencil and other techniques to painstakingly craft a not-safe-for-kids cartoon about a sort of ""Jurassic Park"" for ""cryptids"" from legend and folklore (mermaids, manticores, more). Derived from DC Comics, James Gunn's smart-aleck supervillain team adventure ""The Suicide Squad"" — not to be confused with 2016's one-word-shorter and many-times-awful ""Suicide Squad"" — is a labor of twisted love bursting with genuinely funny sick jokes and sicker characters (Polka-Dot Man shoots out lethal polka dots). As one creatively staged set piece follows another, Gunn's ringmaster's ability to keep the multiple personalities and plot threads distinct and the action coherent deserves a gold star the size of Starro the Conqueror (the giant alien starfish that squashes several cast members during the outrageous finale). If filmmaking for Julie functions as a form of demon-purging therapy, it's an activity that invites demons — or something dangerous and unknowable — in Iván Zulueta's ""Arrebato,"" a 1979 masterwork of Bava-esque colors, Bergmanesque dislocation and Cronenbergian raptures from Spain that was unseen in the U.S. until its restoration this year. Like ""The Souvenir,"" ""Arrebato"" contains a sophisticated junkie, in this case a maker of junky horror movies; masterfully played by Eusebio Poncela, he drives past elaborate Madrid movie marquees advertising ""Phantasm"" and ""Superman"" as he chases new ways of seeing — and being.

"Feb 1, 2022",POSITIVE," Mesmerising world building and a star-studded cast brings  a new aesthetic pleasing sheen to Frank Herbertâs classic sci-fi novel Dune,  director Denis Villeneuveâs latest successful sci-fi action epic that brings  art back to the blockbuster. Set in the year 10,191, Dune stars Timothee Chalamet  as Paul, son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) leader of the affluent House Atreides.  Haunted by visions of his destiny on another world, Paul is thrust into a  political war when the emperor transfers power of resource rich desert planet Akkaris  from the tyrannical House Harkonnen to House Atredis. When House Harkonnen,  under the rule of the gargantuan and methodically evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen  (Peter Skarsgaard) attack House Atreides, Paul finds himself on the run and in  alliance with the Fremen, the indigenous people of Akkaris led by Stilgar  (Javier Bardem.) Where Christopher Nolan dropped the ball with the  frustratingly confusing Tenet, fellow thinking-man blockbuster director  Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2099) continues to impress with  his big-game approach to filmmaking the perfect alternative to those frustrated  with the superhero genre. While Dune deals with many of the same themes that  you would find in a Marvel movie, the source material by Frank Herbert combined  with the excellent craftmanship that Dune employs results in a sci-fi  fantasy epic that is uniquely its own, a first chapter to a different kind of  space epic that has a maturity to its character that doesnât sacrifice from the  spectacle of its action-adventure elements.  With Grieg Fraser (Lion) as cinematographer,  along with production designer Patrice Vermette (Arrival), and  costume design by Robert Morgan and Jacqueline West (The Revenant), Dune must be the most aesthetically striking film of the year, a collage  of bold imagery that exceptionally presents its other worldly element. While  the term âworld buildingâ is used loosely, it is one that applies here and then  some, Villeneuve taking Herbertâs words and creating imagery epic and  beautiful, not to mention a sci-fi story completely engrossing in its tale of  fate, war, treachery and (of course) good versus evil. As with many sci-fi epics, there is a density to Dune that may take some not used to this style of sci-fi filmmaking a moment or two  to catch on, yet screenwriters Eric Roth (Munich), Jon Spaihts (Doctor  Strange), and Villeneuve himself, along with editor Greg Fraser (Zero  Dark Thirty) keep the story digestible and moving at a comfortable  pace.  An all-star cast of actors are terrific. Oscar Isaac  brings a gravitas as a king with the weight of a world on his shoulders;  Rebecca Ferguson is mesmerising as a queen who recognises her sonâs greater  destiny; Jason Mamoa is savagely good as a warrior of honour and violence; and  Peter Skarsgaard is a horrifying vision of gluttonise greed personified. In the end it is Timothee Chalamet who is the figurehead  of this sure-to-be franchise, and as Paul the Oscar nominee brings not only the  dramatic and action-man chops to the role, but an ethereal quality to a saviour  figure character that is easy to root for."
"Jan 26, 2022",POSITIVE," The world is a confusing place right now. We believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs. Do you believe that too? Help TGC bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work. Twenty years ago this month, Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring released in theaters. I was a freshman at Wheaton College and went to see it with a group of dorm friends. It was a magical, memorable movie-going experience; awesomely cinematic and transportive. In retrospect, I wonder if that trilogy was the last great “big” cinematic event. With the exception of Christopher Nolan’s films and Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life, few movie-going experiences have matched the awe I experienced watching Lord of the Rings. Will we ever have movies like that again?  Movie-watching is changing. The screens are smaller, the experience less communal. For all but the biggest-tentpole superhero movies, most people seem to prefer watching movies from the convenience of home. How will the evolving economics of Hollywood change the nature of the films produced? Time will tell. In the meantime, interesting and soul-enriching films are still being made. On that note, the following is my list of the best films of 2021. These are the movies that, in my estimation, were the most excellent, memorable, thoughtful, theologically interesting, and redemptive releases of the year. As always, viewers should use discretion in terms of content. Though I chose only movies that are in some way edifying—depicting goodness, truth, or beauty in ways Christian viewers can celebrate—several films on my list are rated R or TV-MA and should be viewed with caution and discernment. Few films gave me more joy this year than Kenneth Branagh’s semi-autobiographical film about a working class family in 1960s Belfast. Though The Troubles of Protestant-Catholic conflict are in the background in important ways—the foreground here is family: three generations of a Northern Irish Protestant family who have called Belfast home for ages. I love so much about this movie: its depictions of traditional married love; the awe and innocence of 9-year-old Buddy; the beautiful embrace of membership in community and place; the celebration of cinema and beauty (dancing!) even amid the reality of death. But perhaps most of all, I love how Belfast captures the sehnsucht longing that another Northern Irish Protestant—C. S. Lewis—once described. As permanent as it feels in our hearts, “home” in this life is always a phantom, and family a photo-book of ever-fading memories. Yet even as they slip away, these things point our souls in the direction of the permanent place and everlasting community for which we were made. Now in theaters or available to stream at home. Rated PG-13. I went into Dune with zero context, having never read Frank Herbert’s novel or seen the 1984 movie version. I worried I’d be lost in such a complex sci-fi universe—and I was, a little. But it’s a testament to director Denis Villeneuve’s command of the cinematic language that tracking with the intricacies of plot didn’t matter as much as the big-canvas power of awesome visuals, sound design, and deep immersion into a well-established world. Villeneuve doesn’t spoon-feed audiences with tiresome exposition—he simply says, “Put on your seatbelt and come along for a ride.” What a ride it is (read TGC’s review). More than any movie this year, Dune gave me hope that big screen, big movies, with big ideas, have a future. In theaters now. Rated PG-13. When it released in July, I called Edson Oda’s Nine Days “2021’s most spiritually curious film.” I’d still stand by that. A Spike Jonze-esque surrealist drama about “soul candidates” vying for a chance at life, the indie film explores the most fundamental questions of existence. Why do we exist when we didn’t have to? If an omnipotent God has the power to create life, why doesn’t he intervene when life goes so excruciatingly awry? Even if not all of the film’s ideas are logical or sound, enough of them are provocative and profound to warrant the applause of thoughtful Christian viewers. This is the rare film that takes pain seriously but sincerely leads audiences to appreciate the preciousness, and sacred mystery, of life. Available to rent. Rated R. If you’ve seen Paul Schrader’s First Reformed (which topped my list in 2018), you know the Calvin College-educated director has a complicated Christian faith. Though less overt in its religious concerns, Schrader’s The Card Counter—starring Oscar Isaac as the titular character—is no less steeped in theology and Christian ideas like atonement, forgiveness, love, and reconciliation. What is Schrader trying to say about these biblical themes? It’s a fascinating film to watch and discuss (read my TGC review) because the answer to that question is far from obvious. Available to rent. Rated R. Sometimes you understand what you love about a movie by thinking about it in contrast to another. This was my exercise in June, when I saw A Quiet Place 2 and Cruella back-to-back. The piece I wrote about the two films—how one examines the making of heroism, while the other ponders the origins of vice—was probably the most enjoyable film analysis I wrote in 2021. It made me appreciate how John Krasinski’s film—in addition to being just a really taut, well-made thriller—effortlessly depicted the goodness and legacy of heroic, sacrificial fathers and mothers. Hollywood doesn’t love celebrating the virtues of traditional, one-dad-and-one-mom families. But audiences do, because it’s beautiful to see. Watch on Paramount+. Rated PG-13. Rare is the film that subverts expectations and surprises you. But when movies like this come along, out of the blue, it’s a thrill. Pig was the surprise, subversive, grace-soaked film of 2021. Nicolas Cage turns in one of his career-best performances as Robin, a Portland chef whose career lost its course after his wife’s death. When his beloved truffle-hunting pig is stolen, Robin is sent to the brink. A film about how we respond to tragedy and injustice, Pig is both timely and timeless. As Mitch Wiley wrote in his TGC review, it’s “one of the most subtly theological films of the year.” Watch on Hulu. Rated R.  Parenting is scary. That’s the short summary of Mike Mills’s resonant film, starring Joaquin Phoenix as an uncle who must watch over his nephew (Woody Norman) for an extended period of time. I don’t think I’ve seen a film that captures so well the unique terror, confusion, exhaustion, and joy of 21st-century parenting. But even while C’mon C’mon is honest about the challenges of raising kids in a world fraught with peril, it makes a beautiful case as to why it’s worth it. At a time of plummeting fertility rates, films like this both reflect the reasons for a decline in child-rearing—and challenge us to reverse course, embracing children as a miraculous gift. Now in theaters or available to stream at home. Rated R. As its title suggests, this is a pretty intense film. Decidedly arthouse and unusual in every way, Robert Machoian’s indie film is nevertheless a powerful apologetic for marital fidelity and a father’s leadership in the home. Even if it’s weird, stick with it for its brief duration (85 minutes). Clayne Crawford plays David, a man fighting to hold his family together after his marriage starts to fall apart. Though the film starts bleak, it progressively gets more hopeful (in fits and starts)—displaying both the dangers of trifling with a sacred covenant, and the valor of fighting to restore it. Watch on Hulu. Rated R. On one hand, Sian Heder’s CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) is a standard coming of age story. High school senior Ruby (Emilia Jones) faces the tension of staying to help her family’s fishing business, or going off to college to make her own way. The twist here is that Ruby’s parents and older brother are deaf—and Ruby has always been the family’s translator to the wider world. If Ruby, who is a talented singer, leaves for college, how will they fare without her? The film is a tender celebration of the resilience of a family unit and the beauty of mutually sacrificial, self-giving love. Watch on AppleTV+. Rated PG-13. Benedict Cumberbatch had a good year. He earned accolades for The Power of the Dog (a film I didn’t love) and played a big role in the year’s biggest blockbuster, Spider-Man: No Way Home. But for my money, his performance in The Courier was the best. Dominic Cooke’s historical spy film tells the riveting true story of a businessman (Cumberbatch) recruited by British intelligence agencies to deliver messages from a Soviet secret agent. Among its many virtues, the film contains an all-too-rare depiction of sincere and lasting male friendship, and celebrates a bygone era when it wasn’t abnormal to sacrifice one’s personal interests for the sake of a larger community or cause. Watch on Amazon Prime Video. Rated PG-13. Drive My Car, Encanto, The Green Knight, Mass (TGC review), Licorice Pizza, The Most Reluctant Convert (TGC review), Our Friend (TGC review), Spiderman: Far From Home, Swan Song, West Side Story. “One of the coolest feelings a human can experience is to feel so small in a world that’s so big.” This sentiment is expressed by solo climber ​​Marc-André Leclerc, the eccentric subject of this fascinating documentary (which also features commentary by Alex Honnold of Free Solo fame). It’s a powerful look at the intoxicating transcendence of pushing the limits of our “so small” capacity in a “so big” world. Watch on Netflix. Rated PG-13. Luke Holland’s Final Account is an important documentary about the final surviving participants in the Nazi regime. The film is based on over 300 interviews—compiled over 10 years—with German and Austrian men and women who had varying degrees of involvement in the machinery of Hitler’s Third Reich. As I wrote in my TGC review, the film displays the beauty of repentance, as well as the ugliness of refusal to take ownership for sin. Watch on Netflix. Rated PG-13. Are we living in a simulation? That’s the central question explored in Rodney Ascher’s mind-bending musing on games, reality, and virtual reality. At times philosophical, theological, and often just plain nerdy, the documentary is a thought-provoking addition to the growing discourse around the metaverse and the nature of reality in the digital age. Watch on Hulu. Not rated. This documentary is essentially a filmed version of illusionist Derek Delgaudio’s stage show—which is a fascinating blend of magic, memoir, and a sort of spoken word poetry for the Age of Authenticity. However you describe it, the film is captivating from start to finish, as much for its “how’d he do that?” trickery as for its “who am I?” existentialism. Watch on Hulu. Rated TV-MA. I’m a sucker for history documentaries, and this is a good one. Based in part on newly declassified or recently discovered documents, Sam Pollard’s film looks at J. Edgar Hoover’s surveillance campaign to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. as he rose in prominence during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. It’s a sobering and instructive film on a number of levels. Watch on Hulu. Rated TV-PG. Painful to watch, but essential viewing, Robert Greene’s film follows six men as they together process the trauma of being abused by Catholic priests as boys. Utlizing drama therapy, the men reconstruct harrowing memories from their #churchtoo experiences that are interspersed through the film. The stories of church abuse survivors must continue to be told in films like this. And Christians must have ears to hear. Watch on Netflix. Rated R.  “Generosity is the beginning of everything.” That’s a line spoken by the widow of a hero who died in the 2018 cave rescue of a Thai soccer team. It’s a sentiment that captures the overall feel of this stirring, feel-good film—an account not only of a massive and impressive logistical operation, but a testimony to the beauty of volunteerism, cooperation, and heroic sacrifice. Watch on Disney+. Rated TV-14. My expectations are admittedly low for faith-based films/documentaries. Too often they are unsubtle and agenda-driven, rather than truly curious about exploration. Send Proof was a surprise (read my TGC review). The film—directed and narrated by Elijah Stephens—is a balanced look at various perspectives on Christianity’s supernatural claims, particularly the present-day occurrence of miracles. Available to purchase and stream.  The directorial debut of musician Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, Summer of Soul is a concert film of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival—assembled from “found footage” that spent the last 50 years in a basement. Beautiful on its own terms as a record of a moment in cultural time, the film also raises questions about how our understanding of history is shaped by what gets recorded, what gets lost, and by whom. Watch on Hulu. Rated PG-13. If you watch one film about truffle-hunting animals this year, let it be Pig (see #6 on my list above). But if you watch two (and I hope you do), make time for The Truffle Hunters. Captivating, joyful, and beautifully shot, this documentary follows a handful of aging Italian men who forage for white Alba truffles in Piedmont forests, with their beloved dogs. Available to rent. Rated PG-13. Brett McCracken is a senior editor and director of communications at The Gospel Coalition. He is the author of The Wisdom Pyramid: Feeding Your Soul in a Post-Truth World, Uncomfortable: The Awkward and Essential Challenge of Christian Community, Gray Matters: Navigating the Space Between Legalism and Liberty, and Hipster Christianity: When Church and Cool Collide. Brett and his wife, Kira, live in Santa Ana, California, with their three children. They belong to Southlands Church, and Brett serves as an elder. You can follow him on Twitter."
"Jan 24, 2022",POSITIVE," Imagine if Star Wars: A New Hope, Part One ended overlooking Mos Eisley as Obiwan says, “You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.” Director Denis Villeneuve’s much anticipated rework of Frank Herbert’s Dune was held back from theaters an entire year, and film production reportedly stopped while waiting for a release date. Unlike David Lynch’s 1984 Dune trying to cram an entire book into one movie (and cutting it to ribbons trying to make it fit), Villeneuve wanted to take the time to tell the story. Film technology has come a long way in almost forty years, too, so better tools are available to realize the beloved science fiction novel. The trailers tease the vast scope of the saga and how small mere humans are in comparison, but since we’re only getting part of the first book, how complete can Part One actually be? The new Dune is, for lack of a better word, incredible — not just Arrakis but the entire production design. The dragonfly-looking ornithopters, for example, have never before looked so plausible or realistic, even down to the labels on the instrument gauges; the level of detail is astounding. Even taking its time, however, key parts of the story are still glossed over, particularly the political intrigue and machinations; its always a little sad when modern audiences can’t be trusted with in-story reasons why characters engage in action sequences. What does appear on-screen is exhilarating, making the runtime feel much shorter than it is by the time the credits roll.  Unlike The Fellowship of the Ring telling a lot of story up to a known stopping point, Dune Part One feels more like a down-payment on the promise of more. Zendaya’s Chani is barely in it, Chalamet’s Paul is just getting interesting before the credits, and the film ends on a glimmer of hope when things are darkest. It’s the bottom of the first huge hill on a spectacular roller coaster launching into a dark tunnel just before bonking your head on a “to be continued” sign and being asked to leave the ride. Not a spoiler, but withholding “Part One” from the title is like leaving “Of Mars” off of John Carter; you’re not fooling anyone, folks.  It isn’t fair to compare the Lynch film — with a production aesthetic eerily similar to Krull if you really think about it — to the Villeneuve film’s stillsuits and spacecraft following a decade of superhero movie effects. Dune 2021 looks huge; bigger screens and speakers are going to show and boom more. There’s also a lot of emotion packed into it — you can’t stage a coup without breaking a few people’s backs — and these folks enjoy seizing the day and night. The worst part now is the wait — locking down the cast, getting new things built, and actually filming and editing the thing — but as of this writing, Dune: Part Two is slated for Fall 2023. Dune Part One is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images, suggestive material, and whoa… sandworms! You hate ’em, right? I hate ’em myself! To be fair, David Lynch filmed many, many hours worth of material for the 1984 film. However, it wasn’t his choice for most of that film to hit the cutting room floor. In fact, it was the studio who requested the cut down. It’s part of the reason David Lynch wanted his name removed from the final theatrical cut. The studio wouldn’t agree. He did have his wish granted for the extended TV release when his name was removed and replaced by one of the last uses of the ‘Alan Smithee’ pseudonym. It’s too bad the studio, in 1984, didn’t have the foresight to agree to a multipart film series seeing the amount of film left on the floor. It certainly would have made the film more cohesive (and longer). However, one change that I didn’t really like was turning House Harkonnen into mostly disgusting blobs when I believe they were intended to be much more regal in nature, in similar form to House Atreides. Considering Jessica was the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, that blob issue doesn’t really make sense. The funny thing is, a few months ago I listened to the Dune audiobook. I found the 1984 film pretty much followed the book in lock step all the way to the end, save more description in the book and less details in the film. The DL Dune film did tell the vast majority of the Dune story to completion without missing the major beats. As for this updated film, I’ve not yet seen it. Though, I guarantee it will be compared to both the 1984 movie and 2000 TV Miniseries versions. Whether it will be ‘better’ is really a matter of opinion. I actually liked the 1984 movie. I’m probably one of the few who did. The reason I liked it was its cerebral nature. It required you to think through the plot even after the film was over. In other words, it took two or maybe three viewings before you “got” everything that was going on in the film. There are a lot of subtle, but important details throughout that film that are easily misunderstood. our group was divided on Dune.
the two guys who read the books liked it.
none of the girls did. hate might be a better word.
the two guys who did not read the book kinda/sorta
found it boring. boring, slow, and pointless. I suspect one reason the females didn’t like it was the general treatment of females in that universe. Females in the Dune universe are more-or-less not treated as equals to the males. The men hold the power, the females are treated as servants, concubines and forced into arranged marriages. The female group, which held any power in Dune universe, the Bene Gesserit, were almost universally hated. The Bene Gesserit were tolerated only because of their foreseeing abilities. Dune is a hard read, to be sure. However, it doesn’t help the way that the female gender is portrayed in the story material. This situation also doesn’t much improve in the later novels. To be fair, Frank Herbert completely avoids the “Damsel in Distress” theme throughout the Dune novels, at least the the ones I’ve read so far. He instead treats the characters more matter-of-factly and realistically. Meaning, when Alia goes insane because of her inability to handle her inherited memories, she isn’t treated as needing saving. In fact, it’s just the opposite. They treat her as damaged goods. Instead, she is effectively moved out of the way to “minimize” her damage. Her position of power within House Atreides combined with her abilities, does cause many to treat her with kid gloves, but never as a “Damsel in Distress”."
"Jan 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Home › Recommendation › Films To Watch › The bonus features accompanying Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part One” delight longtime fans while enriching the experience of the novice. There are some works of science fiction that never seem to let go once they get their grasp on society. William Gibson’s Neuromancer was published in 1984, but it still felt just as vital and prescient when I read it in graduate school in the mid-2000s in its exploration of humanity’s interlocking life with technology. It pre-dates the Wachowski’s The Matrix (1999), which is more widely known and is a film which clearly drew inspiration from Gibson’s novel. Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 was published in 1953, yet the concepts of government control of what information should or shouldn’t be accessed remains prevalent as Senate Bill 1142 is set to go into effect in the 2022-2023 school year, a law allowing parents to report inappropriate library books and earn a fee if the books remain, while the librarian will be punished. As much as we’d like not to panic in our quest to understand life, the universe, and everything, the notions of these great forward thinkers linger in the air even more now than they did at the times of their writing. Enter Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune. Inspired by his observations of a conservation attempt along the Oregon coastline, he imagined a story of incredible fantasy that explored the intersection of nature, tribalism, and capitalism. Though attempts have been made to adapt this work, none seem to have done so faithfully until Denis Villeneuve (Arrival; Blade Runner 2049) with his 2021 release, Dune: Part One, coming available on home video. In the year 10191, the expansion of life has grown to the point of interplanetary travel throughout the universe and families overlooking entire planets as part of the new empire, led by Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV. In order to achieve space travel safely at near-light speeds, the ships require a key ingredient, called spice, found on the harsh planet Arrakis. This planet has been overseen by House Harkonnen for the last 80 years…that is until Shaddam transferred control from Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to House Atreides’s Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), whose family currently oversees the planet Caladan. Under direct orders, Leto moves his people to Arrakis, including his companion Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), making plans to develop a partnership with the natives of Arrakis, known as Fremen, so that there can be harmony where House Harkonnen used violence and discord to rule. But while the House that manages spice production has the opportunity to earn untold riches, Leto’s more interested in how he can best serve those around him, making him a formidable adversary in the emperor’s game of galactic chess. L-R: Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica Atreides and Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides in Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure DUNE, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Having never read the book, I will not be making a comparison between the two forms of the story. What I will do is offer a perspective on the film through the lens of someone who is not already versed in the Shakespearean tribulations that befall House Atreides and the potential rise of Paul Atreides as the One. L-R: Director Denis Villeneuve and Javier Bardem on the set of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure DUNE, a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Credit to Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (Doctor Strange), and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born) in adapting Herbet’s work because this film is a meal and it’s not even complete. Most screenwriters attempt to make their stories as accessible as possible, often using excessive exposition or taking additional steps to spell things out so that none in the audience are left behind. For the most part, Villeneuve isn’t interested in holding anyone’s hand in the film, presenting things naturally for the characters, placing them first above the audience. This reverence is apparent throughout the film, as characters discuss the faith system of the Bene Gesserit (of which Lady Jessica is a member), the prophecy of Lisan al Gaib (translated to “Voice from the Outer World”) that both the Bene Gesserit and Arrakians believe in, as well as just identifying but not explaining what a cyrsknife is, the true significance of the Gom Jabbar sequence, and many other moments. If the prior sentence seemed like a word salad, to an audience member without the reference point of the book, that’s what it feels like watching Dune for the first time. I say “for the first time” because, despite the feeling of separation as one tries to navigate the political and personal relationships of the characters, trying to understand the significance of some of the relationships to characters we barely spend time with and more, we *want* to come back. We *want* to understand. Villeneuve uses the full power of cinema to help connect relationships or intent so that, even if we can’t fully comprehend what’s happening, we’ll know that it has meaning, we just need to be patient to understand it. For instance, in an early scene where Lady Jessica is having breakfast with Paul, he asks for her to pass her some water and she tells him to use the Voice. They don’t explain what it is, but there’re plenty of context clues between what is spoken, the actors’ performances, and what Villeneuve shows us to understand what’s happening as Paul speaks and it’s more than Chalamet’s voice that’s heard speaking. We can infer from the tight focus on Paul that he’s focusing, we can infer some significance of the location as Villeneuve jumps to objects of historical significance in the room, and this allows us to consider that the voices we hear are the combination of Paul and the people tied to those objects. It’s a moment which implies that the training Paul’s receiving from his mother, the way of the Bene Gesserit, enables him to tap into his ancestors to use this gift. Did I make this realization on the first watch? Nope. But I could feel it meant something. Gratefully, it began to click with the second watch and the bonus features included with the home release confirmed it. In more than one home release review I’ve praised bountiful bonus features and mourned the entire absence of them. Whether a brief featurette or a short film, either of these enable the audience to learn something extra about a film they care enough about to purchase. Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One offers a feast of materials that compliment that meal that is the film itself. Good bonus materials will enhance the experience of the film through new insights into the narrative or by offering behind the scenes details. Dune: Part One does both *and* includes materials which elaborate on content that readers of the novel are more likely to be aware of, but that the movie didn’t take the time to discuss. Because of this, if you enjoyed the film, but didn’t read the book, I recommend jumping into the bonus features before rewatching the film. Not only is it a joyous experience (not sure I’ve ever seen so many cast and crew members absolutely giddy as they work or describe their work), but it’s incredibly informative. In the film, Lady Jessica is dressed down by Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) for having a boy when the Bene Gesserit are supposed to have girls, creating a suggestion that Lady Jessica made a choice rather than the usual 50/50 odds most parents face. Thanks to the two-minute featurette “Filmbooks: The Bene Gesserit,” I now know that members of the Bene Gesserit possess such control over their bodies that they are impervious to poison and can, yes, determine the genetics of their gestating children. On first watch, Reverend Mother’s line could be taken as disappointment at the accident of Paul, but, after watching the featurette, it’s easy to see that there’s more than disappointment, there’s frustration by Lady Jessica’s purposeful action of giving birth to a boy. This sets up a later reveal, courtesy of Paul’s psychedelic spice trip, that future Lady Jessica will join the Fremen and become a leader within it, displaying that while Lady Jessica is a loyal member of the Bene Gesserit, she has her agency — reckless or thoughtful is to be determined. Details like this are all over the featurettes, not just the filmbooks, offering bits of insight that benefit the novel illiterate and the cinematically impressed. If you reside in the latter, make sure to check out each of the technical featurettes. My personal favorites are “Designing the Sandworm” and “A New Soundscape,” as they overlap in their discussion of the sound design and mix present in the film. For those who have seen the film, you’re aware of the thumpers used on Arrakis to distract or attract the Sandworms. In “Designing the Sandworm,” not only are you walked through the process of how the creature was designed for the film from a physical and a physics perspective, but how they sound. In this case, it’s discussed how the sound of the thumper is intentional, mimicking the sound Paul hears when the Sandworm “speaks” to him. Watching the film once, the tool is merely understood as it’s explained to us, the audience, but, with this additional information, suddenly the Arrikian tool transforms into something far more deliberate and thoughtful. Going further, “A New Soundscape” explores not only how to capture the sounds of the fictional Arrakis, but the sounds of Dune itself, pushing composer Hans Zimmer (Gladiator) to find entirely new sounds and new instruments to create the score. As you’ll learn in the bonus features, both Villeneuve and Zimmer are enormous fans of the novel, so they strove to make everything as unique as possible. Zimmer even mentions watching a certain popular space opera/action film that opened with French Horns and, when seeing it, he wondered how humanity evolved so far away from us yet sounded just like us. It’s not a denigration on that particularly famous and beloved score or auditory cue, it’s an acknowledgement of how Zimmer wanted to approach Dune so that even the music felt unique and a bit foreign. Tidbits like this are strewn throughout the more than 71-minutes of materials included on the 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and digital editions. Keep in mind as you pick your home release edition that the bonus features may be included on these editions, but the 4K UHD disc itself contains no materials. You need access to the Blu-ray or the digital edition to enjoy the bonus features. The DVD edition only includes the eight-minute “The Royal Houses” featurette. L-R: Director/co-writer/producer Denis Villeneuve and Timothée Chalamet on the set of Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure DUNE, a Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary release. If you’ve seen the film, there’s a constant physicality to it that frequently makes the impossible feel as tangible as the device you’re reading this review on. Part of that is the intricate detail in every aspect of Patrice Vermette’s (Arrival) production design and Jacqueline West (The Revenant) and Robert Morgan’s (Maleficent: Mistress of Evil) costume design, as well as the fact that Villeneuve purposefully built as much as was reasonable in order to make the performances as authentic as possible. Only then did he use CG so as to marry the physical and the digital to create plausible sequences that trick the mind into belief. In the five-minute featurette “Constructing the Ornithopters,” it’s discussed in the process of designing the machines based on loose descriptions from the novel, showing how the cast and crew used these physical objects in their scenes, and then walking us through how the crew recorded helicopters to find the right camera angles so that they could then digitally replace them. Doing this may be a lot of work, yet the results speak for themselves as not once does the camera go somewhere inauthentic to reality, thereby supporting the illusion of cinema. As great as the bonus materials are, there is a small case of “buyer beware” that you should know about before deciding which version of the film to purchase. For context, I’ve seen the film in three forms: first in 4K UHD streaming via HBO Max (there was no local press screening offered), second in Blu-ray on my 63in plasma, and a third partial viewing in 4K UHD on my 43in 4K UHD television. I mention this because anyone who’s been a fan of Dune the property or who followed the entertainment news ahead of the theatrical release is aware that Villeneuve wasn’t happy about the HBO Max simul-release because he felt his film should be seen in theaters. It’s easy to be glib about this notion as COVID’s variants continue to plague us and the capitalist response continues to hurt the social one (right in line with Dune’s message, amusingly), but after enjoying all the bonus features, there’s a shift from viewing Villeneuve’s desire for theater-only viewing as an elitist one toward an artist’s plea. Everything about Dune: Part One is designed for the theater, from the IMAX cameras to the sound design and score. They knew that it would be viewed at home eventually, but the aim was to create as immersive a theatrical experience as possible. Why does this matter now? In revisiting the film via Blu-ray, I noticed that the more CG-heavy scenes felt flat by comparison to my initial 4K streaming watch. The lack of depth created even more distance between myself and the story (even though I was more familiar with the material) because I could sense the falseness in the art. To its credit, the home release mix is superb, my 5.1 Yamaha stereo producing immaculate sound, even in its geriatric age, which conveyed the otherworldliness that Zimmer intended. By contrast, when I went back to the 4K UHD disc and watched several of the scenes that felt off, the enhanced picture generated the sense of texture and depth which existed in my initial 4K streaming watch. The sound, coming through my far younger 5.1 Yamaha sound system, took full advantage of the TrueHD Dolby sound mix, convincingly making me feel as though as I traveling alongside Paul on his journey of self-discovery. In short, if you’re planning to purchase a copy and can watch it in 4K UHD, that’s the version you want. Anything short of that may result in a cinematic experience that won’t live up to the vastness of Dune. Dune is a narratively complex film. If I felt like I was capable of writing about that complexity with any authority, I would. As I haven’t read the book and what Villeneuve has given us is Part One, nothing I could write on its obvious correlation between global imperialism and the Middle East, capitalism, and conservation would hold water and water is a precious resource. Instead, all I can speak with any kind of certainty, for now, is that I *want* to see Part Two in order to complete the story and consider all its parts. If you’re interested in a deep dive of Dune: Part One and haven’t read Roxana Hadadi’s article “Dune Has a Desert Problem,” I can’t recommend it enough. That offered fascinating insights which I can’t possibly fully comprehend until after Villeneuve completes his adaptation. But before I saw Part One, I possessed zero interest at all in the film. Now, between a yearning to finish the story and Hadadi’s insights, Part Two has become an anticipated release in whichever form I am able to see it in."
"Jan 9, 2022",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert's Dune is… complex. Even that doesn't seem to communicate just how gigantic and seemingly convoluted the iconic book is. David Lynch famously adapted the 1965 novel into a feature film, which isn't fondly remembered by anyone and Alejandro Jodorowsky also tried to adapt the book into a movie in the 70s, but failed to complete the project. Dune has become notorious for being a difficult, perhaps unfilmable piece of science-fiction literature.  The latest to tackle the challenge is Denis Villeneuve. The director has already mastered complicated sci-fi with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, but can anything really prepare one to tell a story as massive as Dune? Villeneuve has certainly given it his all and the end result is a visually ravishing, but at times hollow film.  Dune follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) who is moved to the planet Arrakis. Paul has been plagued by strange visions of Arrakis as well as a mysterious girl with blue eyes, a characteristic of those who have lived on Arrakis and ingested the planet's valuable asset, Spice, for a long time. The House Atreides are an easy target on the ruthless planet and soon, they are betrayed, leaving Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) at the mercy of the desert. Dune, as expected, looks great. But looking good for a film of this scale feels like the bare minimum. The real challenge of adapting Dune is to make a coherent, entertaining film that not only makes sense, but never talks down to its audience and that's where Villeneuve succeeds, for the most part at least. The first 30 minutes of the film is clumsy and exposition-heavy; there is simply so much to set up, so much to cover that any filmmaker would buckle under that. Zendaya's soothing voice guides us into the world of Dune and introduces us to Arrakis, before we change to the point of view of Paul.  It takes a while for Dune to get going. Once the script, penned by Eric Roth, Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve, gets past the inevitable introductions, the story of political power struggles becomes compelling and Dune is constantly a thrilling watch. Some of the attempted humour falls flat and Dune takes itself way too seriously. Villeneuve's world often lacks warmth and even humanity as characters come and go without distinct personalities or agenda. Arrakis might be scorching, but Dune is at times cold.  Villeneuve's vision of Dune is clear and surprisingly concise. The story, while gigantic in scale, feels accessible and Arrakis feels both ancient and futuristic. It's mostly made out of sand and stone and unlike most science-fiction films, Dune's world is dirty and tangible, close enough to ours to feel real but fantastical enough to provide a sense of utopia. Arrakis can get visually a little bland and repetitive but cinematographer Greig Fraser captures the sand dunes and vast desert impressively.  The sound design of Villeneuve's film, including Hans Zimmer's monumental score, is eardrum-bursting, sometimes needlessly so. Increased volume doesn't always guarantee a more immersive viewing experience and Dune would be a stronger film if it didn't constantly try to outdo itself and be the biggest film of 2021. Villeneuve confidently guides the story but often gets too lost in it and Herbert's detailed mythology and loses the sense of intimacy he works to build. There are simply too many characters and too many actors, all of whom are on fine form.  All of Villeneuve's cast bring their A-game. Chalamet is confident, if at times comically brooding as Paul. Paul isn't an easy role as he's often frustratingly emotionless, like a blank slate but Chalamet is typically watchable. The film's biggest surprises are Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Momoa. Momoa especially is delightfully relaxed here and this is the actor's finest work to date. Ferguson gives a nuanced, complex performance as lady Jessica but most of the women in Dune are magical and while powerful, somehow lack agency.  Villeneuve's Dune isn't perfect, but it is impressive. It's clearly only half a story – the title reads Dune Part One on screen – but even as such, this is exciting work from one of the most assured, visionary directors working in Hollywood. "
"Jan 5, 2022",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s Dune, which was originally serialized in the science fiction magazine Analog between December 1963 and May 1965 before being published as a complete novel in 1965, has long been considered one of the cornerstones of modern science fiction literature, which accounts for why there have been so many attempts to translate it to the screen despite its being widely considered “unfilmable.” That “unfilmable” status, of course, is part of its allure, offering up the ineffable of challenge of cinematically rendering Herbert’s dense prose, expansive narrative, and heavy themes about power, politics, and messianic religion set 20,000 years in the future.  The Chilean-French provocateur Alejandro Jodoworsky was the first out of the gate in the early 1970s, envisioning a singularly bizarre spectacle that, had it ever made it out of development, would have featured a score by Pink Floyd and a starring role for the surrealist artist Salvador Dali. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien (1979), spent more than a year trying to bring it to fruition before abandoning it in favor of Blade Runner (1982), after which it was picked up by David Lynch at the behest of mega-producer Dino De Laurentiis. De Laurentiis got more than he bargained for, as Lynch’s innate weirdness and love of ambiguity ran headlong into the producer’s need for a viable commercial vehicle, and the result was a critical and commercial flop. Vestiges of Lynch’s grandly weird and perverse original vision remain scattered throughout the film, making it an experience that is both compelling and frustrating, an enigmatic provocation that melds wild art-film grotesquerie with post-Star Wars blockbuster ambitions. Sixteen years later, the Sci-Fi Channel produced a three-part miniseries in 2000 that was more faithful to Herbert’s novel and was considered a success, but the very fact that it gets so little mention attests to its ultimate lack of impact. And into this cinematic maw now ventures Denis Villeneuve, who is without doubt one of the most intriguing and compelling filmmakers working in the mainstream today. Although he first gained notice in Hollywood with the tense, violent crime-and-punishment dramas Prisoners (2014) and Sicario (2015), he has spent the past half decade working exclusively in the realm of heady science fiction (which has seen a significant resurgence at the box office), first with his elegant, emotionally rending alien encounter drama Arrival (2016) and then the long awaited sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017). Villeneuve’s proficiency with both intimate human drama and large-scale spectacle makes him an ideal candidate to tackle Herbert’s epic, which he and co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Passengers) and Eric Roth (A Star is Born, Forrest Gump) have wisely split in half (a second Dune film has already been announced, thus ensuring that this one doesn’t suffer the fate of Ralph Bakshi’s 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings, which covered one and a half of Tolkien’s three books, but wasn’t successful enough to warrant a concluding film). The general beats of the story will be familiar to those who have seen Lynch’s version (full disclosure: I have seen Lynch’s film at least a dozen times over the years, have never seen the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, and have not read any of Herbert’s Dune novels). Drawing on ancient epics and messianic religious myths, Dune’s story unfolds in an emperor-ruled universe structured around a feudal system in which planets are controlled by various royal families. There are two main rival “houses”—the Atreides and the Harkonnens—the latter of whom has been given the power to oversee the mining of the spice mélange, a special substance found only on the desert plant Arrakis, also known as Dune, where nary a drop of rain falls and the surface provides cover for giant, menacing sandworms the size of aircraft carriers. Spice is the most precious element in the universe because it expands the mind and allows for interstellar travel that would otherwise be impossible. Ruling over the two feuding houses is Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, who, unlike in previous adaptations, is kept entirely off-screen here, which renders him a shadowy and unknowable figure. His primary machination is setting the Atreides and the Harkonnens directly against each other by allowing the Atreides to take over spice production while secretly helping Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew Raban (Dave Bautista) plot a surprise attack with the help of the Emperor’s army to destroy them. The Atreides are led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a mystical female order that has been working for generations to produce the messianic figure known as Lisan al-Gaib, which may very well be Paul Atreides. While Lynch was much more fascinated by the vile Harkonnens, with their physical grotesquerie and leering ambitions, Villeneuve pays decidedly more attention to the Atreides, who he presents as models of humanity in a universe of cut-throat imperialism. Duke Leto’s treatment of Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, one of the leaders of the Fremen, the embattled native inhabitants of Arrakis, is telling of his fundamental decency (and the fact that the Fremen are cast almost entirely with people of color makes clear the film’s indebtedness to the realities of colonialism, past and present).  The problem, however, is that the weight of the film’s various subplots and narrative machinations leave only minimal room for character development, which makes Dune quite different from both Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, both of which were as intriguing dramatically as they were visually. Villeneuve was smart to cast Chalamet as the would-be messiah-warrior, as his slight frame and narrow face remind us that he is, as Herbert envisioned him, a teenager struggling under multiple burdens of expectation and troubling dreams—namely the ones that prominently feature of a Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya)—that he can’t decipher. However, Chalamet’s languid blankness often works against our investment in him, which leaves us with few options for emotional engagement. Interestingly, some of the peripheral characters, namely Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck and Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, are more interesting and engaging primarily because they have energy and anger and determination. Chalamet’s Paul starts to come into his own near the end, which is, of course, the point, but it makes the previous two hours slow going at times. There are no issues, however, with the visual elements of Villeneuve’s film, which are just as stunning and engrossing as you might hope. The digital effects blend seamlessly into the physical locations and sets, producing a world that is entirely convincing and provides an at-times breathtaking backdrop for Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser’s painterly compositions. Dune is a beautiful and austere film, composed primarily of sand and rock and metal (rarely is a primary color to be found). Villeneuve has an innate feel for the raw power of imagery, and he infuses the film with numerous moments that captivate the eye, whether it be the opening guerilla-style Fremen attack in which they literally explode from the sand, to the moment when Baron Harkonnen’s head slowly emerges from a vat of black oil like some creature from a horror film (Stellan Skarsgård’s corpulent physique, bald head, and slack face evoke nothing so much as Marlon Brando’s abstruse Kurtz in Apocalypse Now). Skarsgård plays the Baron as the opposite of Kenneth McMillan’s take in Lynch’s version, downplaying the bulge-eyed grotesquerie in favor of something more quiet and menacing, which Villeneuve emphasizes by often framing him out of focus in the background or at the edge of the frame. Thus, even though Dune isn’t entirely successful on a dramatic level, it has enough pull to draw us into its rich imagery and leave us wanting more; its sudden ending evokes the the serialized nature of Herbert’s novel while priming our hope something better is yet to come.

"Jan 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"Dune gives us a reason to celebrate the art of the Hollywood blockbuster for once, instead of condemning it."
"Jan 2, 2022",POSITIVE," You needn’t be much of a musical fan to find emotional and spiritual nourishment in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s feature directorial debut, hinged so shrewdly on a top-drawer Andrew Garfield performance. At once an adaptation of the late Jonathan Larson’s stage musical of the same name and a poignant tribute to the man’s curtailed life itself, Tick, Tick… Boom! soars on the strength of Miranda’s tenacious, visually dynamic direction, the diverse and toe-tapping tunes, and a wonderfully rambunctious lead turn from Garfield. For anyone who’s ever looked at their contemporaries and thought that they’re just not doing enough with their lives, Miranda’s film is sure to strike a mighty chord, wrapping its overpowering existential throughline around what is at its core a testament to Larson’s taken-too-soon artistic gifts. Michel Franco dishes up another fascinatingly provocative drama – though not nearly as rabble-rousing as his prior eat-the-rich thriller New Order – with this character study of a man (Tim Roth) who attempts to abandon his life and family while holidaying in Acapulco. Franco’s second collaboration with Roth after 2015’s mesmerising Chronic similarly asks a lot of audiences, both to stick with it through its airier moments – despite an 83-minute runtime – and to engage with subject matter that only becomes more discomforting as the pic wears on. Roth is typically excellent here, digging deep into a character who internalises so much until incredibly late in the story, while Franco’s filmmaking yet again dares to contort the audience into some squirm-inducing positions. Clint Bentley’s directorial debut may not offer up much in the way of surprises, but a familiar story well told can prove plenty entertaining in the right hands, as is most certainly the case with Jockey. It’s always enormously gratifying to see an extremely talented character actor finally get the push into lead territory, and here the opportunity arrived for the fantastic Clifton Collins Jr., who gives an outstanding, Oscar-worthy performance as ageing horse jockey Jackson Silva. Laudably straight-forward and unpretentious in both presentation and narrative, Jockey serves up just enough personal conflict without bogging itself down in treacly melodrama, while offering a perspective into a quarter of the sports world fairly under-served by cinema as a whole. Denis Villeneuve’s almost impossibly ambitious adaptation of the first half of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi opus Dune is one of the most meticulously crafted and downright awe-inspiring feats of blockbuster filmmaking ever made. For this critic’s tastes it is certainly a film easier to respect than it is to love, largely due to my own lack of emotional engagement with the story or characters – a problem I also had with the ’84 Lynch version – but so magnificent a feast is it aesthetically that it’s absolutely still a film I rush to recommend. The battery of eye-wateringly beautiful images and goosebumps-raising sounds combine with Villeneuve’s holistic world-building and a top-drawer cast to ensure that, despite its sparseness of feeling, Dune carves out a space for itself in the annals of all-time visionary sci-fi movies. Dune‘s narrative may be a lot less interesting than everything else around it, but there’s little arguing with the mastery of the filmmaking on offer. Ramin Bahrani rebounded from his massively disappointing Fahrenheit 451 adaptation with his most ambitious piece of work yet – a terrific, Oscar-nominated adaptation of Aravind Adiga’s 2008 novel The White Tiger. Without giving much of its narrative chicanery away, the plot centers around Balram (an excellent Adarsh Gourav), who uses his wiles to lift himself out of the impoverished Indian village where he was born. The Slumdog Millionaire comparisons are inevitable, and while Bahrani’s film similarly slaloms between stark social realism and frothy genre fare, this is far more concerned with indicting the Indian caste system and our character’s unfavourable place in it. Not a single living soul is going to watch Steven Soderbergh’s latest and call it anything but minor Soderbergh, but even the prolific director’s evident off-cuts usually prove to be more enthralling and entertaining than most filmmakers’ top-tier work. No Sudden Move is one such example, a low-key thriller elevated by the director’s extreme formal control throughout, the talents of an exceptional ensemble cast, and some deliciously barbed dialogue. Yes, the narrative is convoluted as is tradition for classic crime thrillers, but the cast is clearly having such a good time chewing through it all that you’d be forgiven for not really noticing or caring. No Sudden Move is far from top-tier Soderbergh, and even he would probably admit that, but it nevertheless glides on an uncommon, refreshingly calm rhythm for its genre. Lauren Hadaway makes a scintillating a debut as writer-director of this singular tale of pathological obsession, following a college freshman (Isabelle Fuhrman) who joins her university’s rowing team with the overpowering goal of becoming the best of the best. The Novice could be glibly compared to Whiplash, but this drama – which, through its intensity, sometimes verges on psychological thriller – is really quite different, eschewing a teacher-student dynamic in favour of focusing on the shattering mental and physical toll of striving for #1 above all else. If Hadaway’s direction occasionally verges on heavy-handed – especially the recurring visual motif of a crab which has specific relevance in rowing nomenclature – for the most part she creates a bracingly intense visual-aural landscape on which Isabelle Fuhrman delivers a stunning performance (one which scored her a Best Female Lead nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards). The Humans might well be the most unnerving non-horror film of the entire year, a home-for-the-holidays Thanksgiving psychodrama set largely inside a single New York City apartment as a fractured family unspools their various neuroses and traumas. Buoyed by a magnificent cast – especially a sublime Richard Jenkins – and Karam’s eerie, Kubrick-inspired framing and sound design, this is perhaps cinema’s purest recent distillation of how existentially horrifying year-end familial rituals truly can be. It’s easy to see how Karam’s unwieldy approach will turn many viewers off, but The Humans is one of the most tonally adventurous, skin-crawlingly uneasy films in recent memory. Daniel Craig’s long-delayed final sojourn as 007 didn’t quite live up to the brilliance of Casino Royale or Skyfall, but it slid confidently into third place and in turn delivered a fitting, shockingly emotional send-off for Craig’s James Bond. If you can forgive Rami Malek’s weak sauce villain and some needlessly convoluted story elements, there’s a remarkably well-calibrated Bond film to be enjoyed here, braced between the tried-and-true globetrotting formula and a clear attempt to move the series forward with the times. Thanks to Cary Fukunaga’s electrifying direction and the efforts of co-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge to tidy-up Bond’s sadly traditional sexism, No Time to Die feels like an exciting nexus point for the IP, that really anything could happen moving forward. With Craig giving fans the most cerebral, visceral James Bond portrayal to date, it’s fitting that he went out in unexpected, divisive, and deeply moving fashion. No Time to Die doesn’t hit the highs of Craig’s best Bond outings, but takes some hard swings to challenge audience preconceptions of what the franchise can and can’t do – and they mostly pay off. A film you almost certainly won’t see on any other top 50 list given its wildly divisive Sundance reception, Erin Vassilopoulos’ Superior ambitiously expands her 2015 short of the same name into a daring head-spinner of a feature debut. Without going into specifics – you’ll want to go into this one as cold as possible – Superior follows a woman, Marian (Alessandra Mesa), who flees her abusive boyfriend and hunkers down with her identical twin sister Vivian (Ani Mesa). What follows is a twisted, heady riff on identity that borrows lovingly from the David Lynch playbook albeit with its own gritty-yet-colourful sense of style, making the absolute most of the 16mm film it was shot on. The Mesa twins give outstanding performances in a film that’s as playful as it is twisted, constantly asking viewers to re-assess their perception of events through the regular switcheroo-ing of its two leads."
"Dec 31, 2021",POSITIVE," Directed by Denis Villeneuve, DUNE is an intelligent, emotional, and philosophical epic that trusts its audience to understand it. The Frank Herbert novel from the Dune series that it is based on is looked upon as being extremely complex and known as a book that is extremely hard to adapt. David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky have previously come to grief with successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring the story to the screen. Villeneuve has solved the puzzle by taking a principle, that he states in the film, to heart and using it. There is no answer to life (or anything else), there is only the experience. Villeneuve doesn’t get caught up in the terminology of a human society that has achieved interstellar travel through hallucinogenic drugs or the many themes or intricate plotlines, which, for all of that, aren’t really that complex. He simply shows the characters and their emotional lives against the backdrop of a royal power struggle, injustice, and a boy’s coming of age. The film stars Timothée Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name, Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep, Mission: Impossible – Fallout), Oscar Isaac (the Star Wars franchise) Josh Brolin (Milk, Avengers: Infinity War), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” Avengers: Age of Ultron), Dave Bautista (the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Avengers: Endgame), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (Spider-Man: Homecoming, HBO’s “Euphoria”), David Dastmalchian (Blade Runner 2049, The Dark Knight), Chang Chen (“Mr. Long,” Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Netflix’s “Sex Education”), with Charlotte Rampling (45 Years, Assassin’s Creed), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men, Skyfall). DUNE is the story of Paul Atreides, heir to the Dukedom of Leto Atreides. He is the son of Leto and Lady Jessica, who is a member of the Bene Gesserit order. His father is ordered to leave the family home of Caladan to take over the fief of Arrakis, formerly the charge of House Harkonnen by the Emperor of the Known Universe, Shaddam the Fourth of the House of Corrino. The Duke and his people know that this is a trap, but there is no way to refuse and if they can be successful, the gateway to increased power and riches. They come to Arrakis or Dune, because the planet is a harsh desert planet with only one resource, the mining of the spice Melange, which is the key to everything. Villeneuve obviously has a deep understanding and love for the story of DUNE. He refuses to accept the idea that the story is overly complex and defies understanding. He mostly shows rather than tells what is happening and it works brilliantly. He is even able to show the similarities between the Atreides homeworld, a planet with large oceans, and Arrakis. He uses the movements of the sandworms to suggest that the sand that covers the surface of DUNE is a lot like an ocean and he’s right. He shows the beauty of the scenery in each shot and uses it to set off the beauty and ugliness in the characters on the screen. He doesn’t consider Caladan the only place of beauty and Arrakis a Hellworld. Both places are beautiful in his directorial eye.  Other than a few subtitles announcing what planet we are currently on in the opening scene of each section, no real effort is made to use large amounts of exposition to explain what is going on. By focusing on the emotions of the characters – sadness, anger, regret, evil –  he renders most exposition moot. It’s all about the storytelling, as it should be. It’s remarkable in a film (and book series) that is so concerned with the power of the human mind and applications of mental power in the form of psychokinesis and precognition, that Villeneuve was so expertly able to use the power of suggestion that makes so much of what DUNE is really about clear to the viewer. I’ll give you an example. In one scene, and it was also a wonderful example of Timothée Chalamet’s acting talent and why he was the right choice for this role, the shot is merely looking into Paul’s face on Caladan. He’s thinking. At that moment, I got a chill thinking that he really looked like he could be the child of the two actors who play his parents and it had not as much to do with looks. While looking at his face, I could feel the merging of the two parents that created the child. The melding of DNA that makes a child who they are through syngenesis on the cellular level. But it was visible. Look, I know how this sounds, but it’s a spectacular moment where not a word is spoken and an achievement that I’ve never seen before. I believed he was their child with just a look and I felt that belief in a way that Frank Herbert and the citizens of Arrakis would have approved of particularly in a film that has the strong theme of psychokinetic power within it. The performances have such emotional depth. I will admit that I am not usually a fan of Rebecca Ferguson but in DUNE there are moments when her lack of emotional vulnerability is used for the good of the film. Her strangeness is a definite asset as well. That’s the character of Lady Jessica, emotionally reserved and strange. Oscar Isaac is particularly well cast as Duke Leto. His vulnerability and his strength of character make him fully believable as the Duke that men would be fanatically loyal to and who would attract envy from those who were less scrupulous. Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho was also a great casting. He’s that guy who you can’t help but like. Sharon Duncan-Brewster plays a gender-flipped Liet Kynes and has a similar quality. Stellan Skarsgård isn’t anything like the Baron Harkonnen of the Lynch adaptation. If anything, he seems like a negative space. A black hole of the self, which is a very interesting choice. Dave Bautista’s Beast Rabban is his most gleeful moment as Drax turned inside out into evil. Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) wrote the screenplay with Villeneuve and it seems like rather than hacking away at what was in the book, the screenplay has streamlined the action and the themes of the book. The special effects are ridiculously enjoyable and are the work of Oscar-winning special effects supervisors Paul Lambert (First Man, Blade Runner 2049) and Gerd Nefzer (Blade Runner 2049). The spaceships made my eyes pop and watching what looks like flying bricks defy gravity and soar and the realization of the ornithopters, which look like dragonflies, was incredibly satisfying for a fan of the book. In fact, there is at least one shot, during an attack sequence, that looks like a homage to the David Lynch film version and I liked that very much as well. Greig Fraser, ASC, (Killing Them Softly,  Zero Dark Thirty, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) creates cinematography that is stunning. Caladan is a cool and beautiful place. Geidi Prime, home of House Harkonnen, is dark and filled with shadows, Arrakis is filled with dangerous light. But it is the examination of faces where the film and its cinematography really excel. It’s like the camera is talking to you. I know that sounds pretty weird too, but it’s true. The costumes are simple but make statements as well. Costume designer Jacqueline West (The Revenant, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Quills) and costume designer Robert Morgan did wonderful work. Yes, the stillsuits have a codpiece, and Jessica’s wardrobe when they land on Arrakis is gorgeous. The costume for the Reverend Mother is probably the most complex of the costumes that I saw and is wonderful. I went through an exhibit of the costumes after the screening and I read that this costume was a nod to Frank Herbert’s interests in Tarot and chess. That’s the kind of detail that we are talking about with DUNE. Stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception) did good work with the fights and found a great way to show the concept of shield fighting, working together with the special effects department. It really works which is proof that it was work well done. A word about the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (Blade Runner 2049, Inception, Gladiator). As I left the screening, the final track was still playing in my head. I had no choice but to find the soundtrack on streaming and listen to it while driving home. It’s that memorable and that good. It does have nods to Middle Eastern music, choirs of male and female voices, odd percussion which is there to keep you off balance, but its center is long drawn-out vocal notes, which reminded me a bit of some of the work of Einstürzende Neubauten. It’s definitely one of his more experimental soundtracks and I love it. I have to admit that I am a really big DUNE fan, the books and the philosophy of the books, but I wasn’t set up to love the movie. Admittedly, I was a bit wary of it because my expectations are high and I understand the book and its content very well. My father was a big DUNE fan, like me, he even liked the David Lynch adaptation. The greatest compliment that I can pay to Denis Villeneuve’s DUNE is that I wish that my father was here to see it. He would have loved it every bit as much as I do. Denis Villeneuve’s DUNE is the type of epic filmmaking that many reach for and can’t grasp. Full of emotional resonance and with the philosophical core of the book coursing through the film’s veins like lifeblood, it puts other franchises to shame. It’s human and otherworldly at the same time. Villeneuve has attained a level of filmmaking that plants ideas in your mind like the Kwisatz Haderach himself. DUNE is the glorious, luminous, and virtuoso work of an exceptional artist."
"Dec 30, 2021",POSITIVE," Por años, los habitantes del desértico planeta de Arrakis han vivido bajo la opresión del autoritario mando de la casa Harkonnen, encabezada por el ambicioso y temible Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård). La familia feudal se encarga de la extracción y la comercialización de melange, una especia color escarlata – única en la galaxia y considerada sagrada por los nativos – que es utilizada principalmente como guía instrumental en los viajes interestelares. El monopolio que poseen estos fuereños sobre el codiciado producto no solo les ha otorgado cuantiosas riquezas, sino también una importante posición de poder capaz de intimidar al mismísimo Emperador.  Es por ello que esta figura suprema ha decretado que sea la casa Atreides, eterna rival de los actuales gobernantes, quien tome el control inmediato de Arrakis, expulsando por orden imperial a los Harkonnen del caluroso planeta cubierto por rojizas dunas de arena y custodiado por enormes gusanos que viven debajo de la superficie. Para Paul (Timothée Chalamet), el joven heredero del ducado establecido en las tierras de Caladan, la noticia le hace cuestionar la naturaleza premonitoria de sus sueños. En días recientes, el espigado marqués ha tenido una visión recurrente mientras duerme: la imagen de una chica de ojos color azul, habitante del planeta en conflicto, quien lo conduce sigilosamente por unos rocosos cañones hasta llegar al que pareciera ser su fatídico destino. Consternada ante el significado de dichas revelaciones, su madre Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) convoca una reunión secreta con la Reverenda Madre, una mujer cubierta por un velo oscuro que posee poderes sobrenaturales, para poner a prueba el espíritu y la fortaleza del joven protagonista.  Tras su arribo al nuevo planeta, la tribu de los Fremen atestigua el cumplimiento de una profecía ancestral. La llegada del Mesías que tanto han esperado, quien los guiará hacia un camino de paz y de libertad. La precaria situación que se vive en Arrakis pronto se torna aún más difícil para el duque Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) y su familia, luego de un sorpresivo ataque orquestado por sus archirrivales. Dispuestos a recuperar el poder que les fue arrebatado por órdenes del Emperador, los Harkonnen lucharán a muerte hasta asegurarse que no quede ningún vestigio de la estirpe enemiga.  Guerras, traiciones, juegos de poder, religión y misticismo se combinan a la perfección en Dune (Duna), la adaptación de la exitosa novela de ciencia ficción, escrita por Frank Herbert, a cargo del aclamado realizador Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Una epopeya en toda la extensión de la palabra que construye monumentales universos cinematográficos con una proeza y belleza despampanante. Una experiencia audiovisual hipnótica, desafiante y de gigantescas proporciones que require de la pantalla más grande posible para poder apreciar y disfrutar cada uno de sus detalles.  Completamente opuesta al estilo psicodélico y camp de la adaptación cinematográfica de 1984 dirigida por David Lynch, esta nueva versión recurre a un tono mucho más solemne y contemplativo. Un blockbuster con alma de cine de arte que se toma su tiempo en plantear la mitología e introducir a sus personajes sin la necesidad de recurrir a frenéticas secuencias de acción ni a innecesarios despliegues de efectos especiales a cada segundo. Su ritmo tan sosegado no resulta pesado. Al contrario, nos permite admirar cada minucia de sus impresionantes sets y de sus fastuosos vestuarios, los cuales nos transportan de manera efectiva hasta nuevos y distintos rincones de la galaxia. Las piezas musicales, compuestas por Hans Zimmer, son ceremoniosas y hechizantes con su conjunto de cuerdas y percusiones.  Cada uno de los miembros del elenco realiza un trabajo de primera. Tras su paso por la escena del cine norteamericano independiente, Timothée Chalamet demuestra que tiene la presencia y el talento para encabezar una super-producción de Hollywood. Oscar Isaac y Josh Brolin cumplen, mientras que Stellan Skarsgård hace estremecer como el villano del filme. Y a pesar de sus breves intervenciones, tanto Zendaya como Javier Bardem sacan el máximo provecho a sus personajes. No obstante, son Rebecca Ferguson y Jason Momoa quienes terminan robándose la película gracias a sus memorables interpretaciones. Ferguson es sensacional en su enigmático rol, mientras que Momoa inyecta humor y heroísmo al suntuoso relato.  Quizá lo único que juegue un poco en contra de Dune sea su decisión por mostrarnos solamente la primera parte del relato. Se entienden las dificultades para intentar resumir una novela tan extensa en una película de dos horas y media de duración y, al mismo tiempo, se agradece la determinación por querer narrar la historia sin tanto acelere. Sin embargo, a diferencia de otras sagas cinematográficas que han sido desarrolladas en múltiples partes, aquí la mayoría de las tramas no llegan a ninguna resolución. El final resulta abrupto y sin un cliffhanger que logre mantenernos al filo del asiento, esperando impacientemente la llegada de la próxima entrega (aún sin anunciar).  Dune es una épica colosal y cerebral que funciona como una alegoría del colonialismo y la religión. Una historia de constantes dualidades, de la lucha entre el bien y el mal – a veces dentro de uno mismo –, de luz y oscuridad, de sueños y realidades, de opresión y libertad, de vida y muerte. Una apuesta ambiciosa y evocadora que nos recuerda del gran poder que tiene el cine para transportarnos a universos desconocidos a través de su inagotable fuente de magia e imaginación. "
"Dec 24, 2021",POSITIVE,These are complex dynamics. It's a reason why Dune has been so tough to crack in this medium. I think Villeneuve has done it.
"Dec 23, 2021",POSITIVE," the characters did not ""draw us into"" anything.it was all landscape and unheard whispers of a plot.maybe it would be better seen on the ""small screen""with pause and volume control. but, no. we're done."
"Dec 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune was delayed an entire year and some change thanks to the pandemic, and even before that, there was feverish anticipation for another cinematic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel (David Lynch previously made a divisive version in 1984). Add into the mix director Denis Villeneuve, the French-Canadian filmmaker responsible for some of the most acclaimed sci-fi screen stories of the past few years, including the Amy Adams-starring Arrival and Blade Runner sequel 2049. And yet, Dune smashes those expectations. It’s a vivid, euphoric and visually dazzling cinematic experience that engages you on every level and in every moment. You won’t be able to ignore its hypnotic allure – and not just because every member of that cast is impossibly attractive. Dune is a notoriously complex novel which becomes progressively stranger in subsequent books, but Villeneuve and co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth stripped it back to its most elemental. While some novel purists may find it oversimplifies Herbert’s work, the filmmakers’ choice serves the dual purpose of making a high-concept sci-fi franchise more accessible, but also really letting the performances and filmmaking take centre stage. That includes Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser’s intoxicating visual tableaux, both sharp and otherworldly.  Set in a version of the future, the royal House Atreides is commanded by the Emperor to take over Arrakis, a desert planet that is home to the universe’s only supply of a spice that both prolongs life and enables space travel.  Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) understands his house is being played, aware of the dangers of a move against the cruel previous ruler of Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), but must obey anyway.  His partner is Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a woman from a mysterious order called the Bene Gesserit. Leto and Lady Jessica’s teenage son Paul (Timothee Chalamet) has been groomed to succeed his father, trained in combat by Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin). Paul has also been trained by his mother in the Bene Gesserit ways, which includes magical powers such as being able to command people’s will with your voice.  Paul sits at the intersection of rival groups’ centuries-long ambitions, manipulated into a “saviour” but is he more than a pawn? When he keeps having dreams of a young woman on Arrakis (Zendaya), they portent what’s coming. And what’s coming is just the start of the Dune story, with Villeneuve’s film covering only half of Herbert’s first book, with a sequel to be released in late 2023. But if the prospect of shelling out for a full-priced ticket for only half a movie grates, rest assured that Dune’s sensory experience, with a well-defined character arc, is worth every dollar.  It’s also why this is a film that must be seen and appreciated on a large screen in an environment that can showcase every lush element that has been masterfully curated, from Hans Zimmer’s penetrating score to Patrice Vermette’s textured production design. Dune doesn’t over-rely on CGI – even that giant worm works in the moments it appears – and has enough grittiness to its aesthetic. It’s futuristic but it’s a world that has been lived in, it’s rusted and worn – and that is a very difficult look to nail. There’s no wastage here, Dune earns every minute of its runtime. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue has purpose. And all the performances, but particularly those of Chalamet, a balance of youthful excitement with the burden of destiny, and Ferguson, are attuned with Villeneuve’s vision. There’s something baroque about Dune – not maximalism but certainly a sense that Villeneuve has crafted a film that is grand in scope, and which inspires awe. Both a great sports movie and unconventionally riveting romantic drama, Challengers volleys the audience back and forth to reveal what is riding on a tennis match, writes Leigh Paatsch."
"Dec 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Last year, I wrote about how hard it was to get two movie lovers to agree on a mutual top 10. This year, in the spirit of The Last Duel, Sean Fennessey and I decided to put our lists head-to-head—yet we still didn’t find room for the best Ridley Scott movie of the year, which will only make Sir Ridley crankier. The upshot of this exercise wasn’t just to spotlight as many worthy movies as possible, but to contrast different ideas about what constitutes cinematic value beyond taste. Even when there were instances of crossover in our lists, we seemed to be coming at the films themselves from different angles. Nayman: Back in April, I wondered whether anything would clear the bar set by Rose Glass’s uncannily well-executed debut. And unless you count the 40th anniversary rerelease and restoration of Andrzej Zulawski’s magnificently messed-up and terrifying Possession, no other horror movie came close. (However, let’s give a silver medal to James Wan’s Malignant for proving that the right way to spend all that Aquaman collateral was on a movie about a sentient tumor.) In a moment when critics and fans are caught up in debating the phenomenon and cinematic vocabulary of “elevated horror,” Saint Maud passed the audition as handcrafted, high-minded festival fare with Big Themes that didn’t sacrifice scares. It’s a beautifully made movie, as finely embroidered and darkly enveloping as a funeral shroud, and it’s carried by a heroic lead performance by Morfydd Clark as a woman whose belief that she can talk to God could be taken equally as delusions of grandeur or the pinnacle of humility. Glass knows how to ratchet tension, but also how to let scenes breathe. Topping it all off, Saint Maud sticks the landing with an ending that basically burns a hole through the screen. Ideally, horror movies show us things we can’t unsee; Glass’s money shot has been living rent-free in my mind’s eye for months now. Sean Fennessey: Adam, I had a kid this year—our first—and it’s poisoned my movie brain. Where once I could a watch an endangered child on-screen and hardly bat an eyelash at the fictional terror, now I recoil at even the suggestion of a little girl or boy in peril. I’m a cliché dad, prudish and fragile, and that’s OK with me (for now). But what I had not anticipated is how this can work in other directions. In Maggie Gyllenhaal’s often unsettling adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s novel, she crafts a portrait of mothers at the end of their wits that is perceptive and relatable and fearless. It’s a movie that withholds judgment, but shows women constantly confronting the joy, toll, and simmering frustration of motherhood. Gyllenhaal is a first-time writer-director and hers is the most assured debut of the year, anchored by four terrific performers (Olivia Colman, Jessie Buckley, Dakota Johnson, and Dagmara Domińczyk) tasked with four visions of motherhood—one in repose, one in retreat, one in recalcitrance, and one in anticipation. I’m pairing it with C’mon C’mon, another of Mike Mills’s gentle and episodic works of miniature opera. After tackling his father (2011’s Beginners) and his mother (2017’s 20th Century Women), Mills is focusing on his child and his relationship to parenting. He uses a proxy uncle character, played with the record-flip softness that Joaquin Phoenix likes to break out after every Joker or so, to animate the parental love for a young boy ping-ponging between precocity and arrested development. Shot in gorgeously creamy black and white across L.A., New York, and New Orleans, it’s a movie not without scares or drama, but ultimately warm and refreshingly free of guile. It made me feel as good about this stage of my life as anything that isn’t my daughter.  Nayman: I also had a kid this year—bringing our household’s grand total to two–which didn’t so much poison my movie brain (can’t poison something that’s already toxic) but cut into my movie-viewing time so significantly that I’ve missed enough key 2021 titles to make me wonder about making a list in the first place. For instance: I haven’t seen The Lost Daughter, C’mon C’mon, The Tragedy of Macbeth, or Ghostbusters: Afterlife. How can I properly assess the year in cinema without Ghostbusters: Afterlife? The other wrinkle to having two kids is that even when I have managed to catch up with For Your Consideration stuff, it’s largely been at home via DVDs and screening links, which is why I’m grateful that I actually saw The Power of the Dog in a movie theater, where the exquisite wide-screen compositions and stinging musical score could feel suitably overpowering. So yes, I’m adding my voice to the choral praise for Jane Campion’s latest, not least of all because I can’t remember watching a movie of this kind—big, intricate, and literary, with a cleanly diagrammed structure and heavily underlined themes (dial M for masculinity)—that wrong-footed my expectations so deftly. Some critics were annoyed that it takes the plot a long time to kick in, but that’s not just good scene-setting by Campion—it’s a way to show that for some of the characters, decisive action is a long time coming. I liked the way that what seems to be an emotional triangle between two brothers and a woman keeps revealing new vertices, and the last half hour is some of the greatest work yet from a filmmaker who plays havoc with expectations while honoring a larger and inexorable design.  Fennessey: With two notable exceptions, I saw every film on my list in a theater—a privilege I appreciate and don’t take for granted. That includes Hamaguchi’s epic tale of quiet contemplation, a movie about a man constantly on the move—in his vintage red Saab 900—but rarely able to move forward. Based on a rather terse Haruki Murakami short story, Hamaguchi’s rendition involves a theater actor and director channeling loss through a complex staging of Uncle Vanya that blends languages and symbols to cross cultures in Hiroshima. This is an audacious three-hour movie that is by turns restrained and remote, until an explosive finale that shifts the emotional turmoil from Hidetoshi Nishijima’s theater director to his driver and companion, played with a coiled power by Tôko Miura. Hamaguchi’s movie is beyond deliberate—it’s a study in pace and unknowable truths. But its mystery propels it forward to a feeling of autonavigation, the sense that life keeps hurtling toward you even if you want to run from it. Better to have seen it without the distractions of a life at home and a second screen in reach. Instead, let it drive right over you.  Nayman: It was a great year for Monsieur Hamaguchi, who also cowrote the no. 8 movie on my list—one directed by his old film-school instructor. The title of Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Wife of a Spy is very “it is what it is,” but starting with its brilliant, bristling screenplay and expanding outward through its director’s dexterous use of setting and shadow to evoke cloaked wartime motives, the film is as complexly pleasurable as any prestige thriller of recent years. Statuesque Satoko (Yu Aoi) is an actress married to successful importer-exporter Yusaku (Issey Takahashi), whose movements between Japan and Manchuria have piqued the interest of Kobe’s local authorities; when a woman in Yusaku’s circle turns up dead, she gets suspicious too. The chess board that Kurosawa keeps returning to in a series of symbolic close-ups summarizes the move-counter-move machinations of the plot, but what Kurosawa and his collaborators are really up to is more of a meditation on roles and performance. The devastating revelation of what Yusaku is really keeping hidden—or, perhaps, trying to expose—puts a political frame around the action while calling back to the apocalyptic horrors of Kurosawa’s previous genre masterpieces; superfans like myself can enjoy the shout-outs to Cure and Charisma while those unfamiliar Kurosawa’s cinema will simply recognize the touch of an old master.  Fennessey: There’s an awkward two-step happening in the dance of film discourse, swaying left to blindly stan actors and filmmakers no matter their cultural output or depth, and then swaying back right to adjudicate the moral and political valences of art above intention, or its absence. Movies are denounced before release based on a plot synopsis or ferociously defended in the face of criticism. Into this free-for-all parachutes Red Rocket. What to make of it? A gimlet-eyed portrait of a suitcase pimp returning home to Texas City, Texas, after a couple of decades working as a porn star in L.A., Baker’s movie at first feels like a provocation. His star, Simon Rex, is an ex-MTV VJ, alum of the Scary Movie series, and a post-Eminem shock rapper. He has a rubbery face and a whirling dervish spirit, all limbs and teeth and weathered skin. His character, Mikey Saber, wields a hustle that is cheery and destructive. He grooms young women, sells drugs, deceives his wife, and brags about it all to his lone friend. He’s disgusting. And yet, charming. Some of that is Rex, who is pure go-go-go, and some of that is the way Baker situates the character in a decrepit world where survival feels more important than decency. Saber is puerile but funny and ruthlessly determined—his story feels like a soft projection of all the hucksters and groping assholes who’ve blown into our political and social lives these past five (50?) years.  But is Saber really a stand-in for Donald Trump? That feels too elementary, and doesn’t do justice to the psychologically layered construction of the character, who desperately tries to win the audience (any audience) over even as he burns the world around him. Baker sets the antic pacing and boundary-challenging vim of Italian comedy against a gorgeously elegiac vision of a dying American center. (In the film, a doughnut shop operates in the shadow of an oil refinery—I’m not sure there’s a better metaphor for this country.) And while Baker doesn’t judge his characters, even when they’re monstrous, he’s manifested a unique confrontation for audiences, and perhaps the dreaded discourse, too. What to do with a problem like Mikey Saber? Get a close look at him. Maybe even hear him out. Just don’t stan him.  Nayman: “Just don’t stan him”—the eternal conundrum when it comes to M. Night Shyamalan, who arguably makes it easier on his haters than any major working American director even as he preaches blissfully to the choir. Back in July, I called Night’s mystery about, yes, a Beach That Makes You Old,  “a big swing that makes contact”—a reference to the oh-shit revelation in Signs that the only thing standing between Earth and an alien takeover was Joaquin Phoenix and his trusty wonderbat. Twenty years later, Shyamalan has lived down his reputation as a twist-monger, and he’s regrouped by taking and matching the pulse of a zeitgeist that had seemed to pass him by. The Visit found a genuinely inventive way to use found footage post–Paranormal Activity; Split and Glass simultaneously satirized and cashed in on the superhero cinematic universe trend. Old, meanwhile, takes on such trenchant, contemporary issues as the surveillance state, predatory pharmaceutical companies, and top 40 rappers called “Mid-Sized Sedan.” The moment when Mr. Sedan (Aaron Pierre) was identified as such by an ardent teenage fan was also the moment when Old won my heart, and I’m not likely to give it back anytime soon. In a period when even interesting filmmakers seem content to simply produce content, Shyamalan seems committed to keeping it weird. Thanks for the laughs, Night, and maybe, you know, hit me back …. just to chat. Truly yours, your biggest fan, etc. Fennessey: This was quite a good year for directorial autofiction. Joanna Hogg completed her memoiristic The Souvenir diptych with a righteous glee. Janicza Bravo’s Zola transposed the oh-shit virality of a stripper’s Twitter thread onto a larcenous fairy tale of cultural identity. David Lowery’s The Green Knight quested to the heart of his greatest fear only to discover a whole lot of cowardice, and some resolve, too. Wes Anderson even made a movie about a visionary curator wrangling all of his charges to create something bigger than all of them. Directors like to see themselves in their stories, in case you hadn’t heard (or asked M. Night Shyamalan). Nowhere was that more evident or vital than in the French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Løve’s Bergman Island. A skilled chronicler of millennial ennui and quiet longing, Hansen-Løve takes her story of a husband-wife pair of filmmakers (a perfectly cast Tim Roth and Vicky Krieps, finally rewarded with a worthy follow-up to Phantom Thread) to the Swedish island of Fårö, where Ingmar Bergman lived, worked, and died. In another director’s hands, this might amount to hoary homage. But this is a mash-up of movie-within-movie nesting doll symbolism, with Hansen-Løve creating an unofficial follow-up to her 2011 film Goodbye, First Love, and unraveling our expectations of conventional narrative in the process. When Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie arrive as exes reunited at a wedding more than halfway through the film, it transforms into something sensual but self-abnegating. You can almost hear Hansen-Løve asking herself, “Is this a good idea?” Few directors are willing to work out their feelings out loud, and Bergman Island is not a movie with thunderous conclusions. But it has something that few examples of autofiction can claim: humility. Nayman: You left out one key guy in your inventory of visceral autofiction. Say bonjour to Leos Carax, whose chaotic, seriocomic rock opera Annette is, among other things, a self-portrait of the artist—by the final scene, the wan, pencil-mustachioed Adam Driver (this year’s Best Actor) has become the spitting image of his director. I can’t say I found Annette’s mix of amour fou, fatal melodrama, puppet theatre, and pop-cultural pastiche completely successful or convincing. But no movie this year had higher highs, beginning with the opening, full-company sing-along that winkingly begs the audience’s permission to let the festivities commence, and peaking during a final duet between Driver and the titular child star that somehow echoes both Robert Bresson and Pinocchio. Is Driver’s caustic Bill Hicks routine as the “Ape of God” tough to sit through? Yes. Do all those pounding, tinny Sparks songs grow tiring after a while? Sure. Does Annette come out the other side of its annoyances and score the kind of bold, emotional coup we expect from the greatest movie musicals? For me, it did.  Fennessey: Forgive the double-up, but I don’t know how I could refuse. Consider the archival music documentary in which hardly any archival footage of the subject exists. That was the challenge Haynes conquered in his Velvet Underground film, adopting the ecstatic visual style of an Andy Warhol picture and the spelunking delight of an academic deep in his thesis to render a story about one of the more iconic, if not chronicled, bands of the 20th century and the New York artistic underground swelling around it. His Velvet Underground movie is downright electrifying, like watching culture get born in a tiny circle of noise.  Nayman: The same late-’60s spirit of Get Back and The Velvet Underground haunts Ephraim Asili’s ingenious collectivist comedy The Inheritance, whose characters are attempting to uphold revolutionary ideals in a modern context. “We are a shoeless home,” explains one of the inhabitants of The House of Ubuntu, a residence modelled after (and located nearby) the West Philadelphia MOVE commune that was made infamous in 1985 by a fatal and ulimately unpunished police bombing; the line is resonant in the sense that Asili’s characters are trying to follow in the footsteps of the past. Principled, intellectual, 20-something Julian (Eric Lockley) has inherited the house from his late grandmother, and filled it with friends, colleagues, and hangers-on committed to studying a treasure trove of artifacts that, taken together, comprise a syllabus of modern African-American artistry and activism: books, magazines, records, sculptures, murals, manifestos. Partially based on his own experiences in a Black Marxist collective and brimming with affectionately self-deprecating dialogue, Asili’s film serves doubly as a showcase for Julian’s hallowed texts and a sly, formally rigorous satire on the paradoxical compromises of group living—the way that even ideological solidarity can’t prevent people from getting on one another’s nerves.  Fennessey: I made a pact with myself a long time ago that when Paul Schrader adds another wounded creature to his menagerie of God’s Lonely Men, I will abide with its inclusion on a year-end list. This is made a bit easier when the films assume the same sense of grace and despair as 2018’s First Reformed—this year’s entry, The Card Counter, does just that. His latest examination of alienation, soul death, and the American lie follows a one-time Abu Ghraib prison guard-torturer named William Tell (ha), haunted by his past and seeking to escape one full house at a time via the roadside casinos of these United States. Oscar Isaac, with his boxy good looks and hooded stare, is a Schrader monk par excellence. When he stumbles upon a young guy (Tye Sheridan, wormish) looking to avenge his father’s death, Tell is forced to face down his trauma. This is not a subtle film and not a terribly good gambling movie, but there is a psychic blankness in the performances—ascetic control trumping actorly vanity—that had me once again plumbing the depths of the torture cell Schrader calls his brain. I can count on one hand the number of filmmakers who are capable of ripping out the insulation of our daily lives and dragging it into view for everyone to wince at. Schrader is 75 years old, and his social media presence suggests a somewhat loony crank, but I hope he’s got a few more films in him. As our pals on The Press Box podcast like to joke, the old guy’s still got it! Nayman: Speaking of old guys who’ve still got it: Paul Verhoeven takes pole position amongst 2021’s octogenarian success stories. As much as I enjoyed both The Last Duel and Cry Macho, neither Ridley Scott nor Clint Eastwood can claim to be working from a position of industrial weakness. They’re playing with house money, while, like Schrader, Verhoeven has to try to game the system every time out. He’s currently in his third decade of professional exile from the U.S.A., and since refashioning himself as a classy, classical art-house filmmaker, he’s made a few of the best movies of his brilliantly checkered career. Five years ago, the viciously terrific thriller Elle sniffed the Oscar race. Now comes this deceptively sleazy, intellectually searching fact-based period piece about a nun experiencing mystic visions in 17th century Italy. What Do You Do With a Problem Like Benedetta? As played by the superlative Virginie Efira, Verhoeven’s heroine is a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma—she claims to have a direct line to God, and one of the fringe benefits of her successful power grab at the local abbey is that she gets a private room to hook up with her fellow sister Bartolomea. Having been taught from a young age to hate her body, suddenly, she’s loving it. Is she a faker? An opportunist? A rebel with a cause? Or does the Lord work in mysterious ways? Certainly, Verhoeven does, mixing lurid, cynical exploitation with fluid storytelling and the principled irreverence of a satirist whose art always punches up against institutional dogma and scores a knockout—hopefully not for the last time. Fennessey: If the Beatles felt so big that they could not be confined to anything less than 468 minutes, imagine how long a film that purports to untangle the hidden connections that link national myths, artificial intelligence, collectivist fallacies, imperialism, China’s Cultural Revolution, and 2Pac should be. At least 10 minutes longer, according to Adam Curtis, who has been creating overwhelming recombinant visions of our cursed past and paranoid future for the BBC for the better part of four decades. His latest is his biggest, widest, and chewiest—a tapestry of conspiracy theory, lawyerly evidentiary presentation, archival wizardry, and Curtis’s trademark needle drops. Blended together across nearly eight hours, Can’t Get You Out of My Head remains my definitive document of quarantine power-watching. (The film has not officially been released in the United States, though it can be seen on YouTube.) I subjected my then-pregnant wife to the experience over two typically isolated days this winter and while I can’t say this is the kind of uplifting material you’d like to view as you prepare to bring life into the world, I remain tantalized by Curtis’s style and mission. Are some of his conclusions big-brained leaps of logic? Perhaps, but you don’t have to be convinced of anything beyond Curtis’s utter commitment to his truth. In less skilled hands, you’d have, well, a bad YouTube documentary. And maybe this is merely the steroidal version of subgenre that has wrought havoc on the minds of millions over the past decade. But Curtis’s deeply researched, literate, and cosmic sense of events suggests a world not of individual moments but a star system, flashes of light that when connected create a constellation of existence.  Nayman: The protagonist of Azor likes to give assurances: on assignment in Buenos Aires circa 1980 representing a high-end Swiss bank, Y​​van (Fabrizio Rongione) tells his clients that their money is safe. But the country is edging towards economic and political chaos, and Yvan’s boss and colleague Mr. Keys is nowhere to be found in a moment where Argentina’s ruling powers are known for “disappearing” anybody inconvenient to the regime. The missing-person subplot gives Azor a thriller hook, but beyond the machinations of its plot, the film achieves a kind of ambient creepiness in which every encounter, no matter how refined or banal, seems to point to sinister intentions. The film’s dark-hued, painterly images evoke New Hollywood thrillers like Chinatown and Night Moves, and, as in those films, it’s as if reality were rotting from the inside out. It’s a fine line between subtlety and stasis, and Azor’s slow-burn may be challenging for viewers who crave more consistent stimulation. But if marinating in paranoia is your idea of a good time, Fontana’s beautifully executed debut is as good as it gets. Fennessey: Sometimes bigger is better, goddamnit! This was a lousy year for conventional blockbusters, and I typically like to find one or two a year that rises to the level of visceral joy that only a shiny, noisy Hollywood production can create. I’m not sure Dune is a joyful film—that isn’t quite Villeneuve’s register—but I was transported by his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved, oft-adapted-but-never-nailed novel. The ambition and scope is invigorating. A longtime passion project, this is a movie where a filmmaker is attacking the source material head on with respect, admiration, and a visionary craftsmanship that perhaps even its author didn’t know was possible when he was writing. Herbert’s novel is a psychotronic tangle of heady imagery, and the film strips away the haze to focus on the arid desperation and religiosity of its characters without sacrificing the grandeur of sandworms, thopters, and the slug majesty of its villain Baron Harkonnen. Hollywood is going through a difficult transitional period with regard to big-budget movies—if it ain’t MCU/DCEU/Fast, it ain’t a sure thing. Unless—unless!—we entrust hundreds of millions of dollars to blindly driven auteurs adapting books they have loved since adolescence. Roger Ebert once wrote that movie theaters “unashamedly provided a proscenium for our dreams.” In Dune, Villeneuve dreams big and boldly. [Uses the voice] Go to sleep! Nayman: I’ve already written some thoughts on PTA’s freewheeling teen comedy. The only thing I want to add in this year-end context is that of all the top-tier auteurs who’ve released new work in 2021, Anderson seems to have been the most inspired by shooting under limited conditions. Part of what’s so beguiling about Licorice Pizza is how it seems to take place in a world where grown-ups aren’t really around—the San Fernando Valley circa 1973 becomes a playground for characters on the verge of maturity, whether growing up too quickly or not soon enough. The slightly uncanny quality of the location shooting can be chalked up to the director’s mandate to shoot closer to home (including some family cameos), but the vibes aren’t wholly cozy or nostalgic. Amidst all the hijinks, there’s a feeling of encroaching crisis, or maybe a bubble about to burst. Time keeps on slipping throughout Licorice Pizza, faster and faster, and Anderson and his ever-agile camera take it in stride. This is filmmaking that doesn’t break a sweat.  Fennessey: I have clear and undistorted memories of critical decision-making points in my late 20s and early 30s. Take this job, move to this city, befriend this person, go to that party, maybe pack it in tonight, three whiskeys is enough, sir. I live a more domesticated life these days, often homebound and unambitious, but occasionally I will think back on some of those choices. Did I miss out on meeting someone at that party who could have changed it all for me? Or have I played the notes of life as well as possible? I definitely blew it on more than one occasion, but I’m happy and healthy and … well, this all sounds like rationalization doesn’t it? What you’re reading right now is solipsism and I’m far from above it. Most people born after 1980, at least, aren’t either. Joachim Trier understands this: In the final third of his Oslo Trilogy, the Norwegian director trains his eye on Julie, an intelligent, vivacious young woman who frequently seems to make the wrong choice. They’re not cataclysmic decisions, but anytime a relationship or a career path makes some headway in her psyche, she flees. Renate Reinsve plays Julie, in what I believe is the performance of the year, as a woman with a deeply Millennial sense of false bravado—she’s a person roiling with feelings and beliefs but harboring self-doubt and confusion at every turn. I recognize Julie. If I am not her, I have met her, worked with her, had Zoom calls with her while she blithely presented her grand vision of the world to me. It is the confidence and passion of a person who was told that she can be anything she wants colliding with the reality that maybe, just maybe, she can. Trier and co-writer Eskil Vogt have an uncanny feel for this conundrum, crafting the movie into 12 discrete parts, a self-consciously novelistic approach that does, in fact, reflect how people tend to recall their youth. This movie knocked me over. Everyone should see it. Nayman: Sean, you already very accurately described Drive My Car as a movie that cruises right over you. And I know it’s a bit cliché at this point to roll over for Ryusuke Hamaguchi, but the guy is just such a controlled, intelligent filmmaker, and he’s on a hot streak. Where Drive My Car chugs along with brilliant linearity—leaping across weeks and years to chronicle an artist’s struggle to turn grief into inspiration—Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy turns curlicues about chance, fate, and heartbreak. It’s made up of three miniature 40-minute dramas, each featuring sexy, existentially angsty characters; each with a delicious twist; each whirling away in succession, one after another, like a perfect little anthology of short stories. No movies this year took more pleasure in the architecture and engineering of narrative. And no matter how precarious and intricate the structures get, they hold up, with Drive My Car’s chassis reinforced by Chekhov and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy dipping into speculative science-fiction in a finale that moved me more than anything else I saw all year.  Fennessey: Anyone who has read or listened to me over the years knows that Paul Thomas Anderson is my favorite filmmaker. I’ll admit I sometimes struggle to put to words why I remain ensnared by his films. I think the word is “ineffable.” Of course he’s a master filmmaker—he’s seen it all and knows what he likes. But what do I like? Perhaps it’s the overweening sense of intensity meeting the sneeringly hilarious disposition of his characters. (“There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.”) Maybe it’s the absolute delight he takes in capturing his characters in motion. It’s possible we share a sense of humor, and his frequency is coming over the airwaves loud and clear to me. He makes movies that feel Important, but I think that’s a feint. What we want from artists is purely individualized expression—PTA makes movies only he can make. Licorice Pizza feels like a perfectly reconstructed memory, like someone hopped in a time machine and brought a 35mm camera. Which is not to say it’s a documentary—it has all the clever set-ups, brisk editing, and euphoric climaxes of great filmmaking, like Hal Ashby got lost in the Valley and pulled over for a bite. He gets remarkable performances from Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim, two first-time actors representing the sensation of infatuation, if not consummation. He selects songs impeccably, as if touched by John Peel. He shoots L.A. like it’s Babylon, a place where people are born and eventually entombed in the glorious, dumb history of this company town. Licorice Pizza is a showbiz movie about all the reckless, dangerous ghouls who haunted the industry, and also a pie-eyed picture of kids just trying to make something of themselves. It’s hard to describe why I loved it. But I know that I did."
"Dec 19, 2021",NEGATIVE," Directed by Denis Villeneuve, Dune: Part One follows Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides as he’s forced to embrace his destiny as the leader of his family and an entire race of people. Filmmaker Villeneuve, working from a script written with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, delivers a fairly faithful adaptation that is, for the most part, visually impressive yet dramatically inert, as the movie, much like its source material, suffers from an arms-length feel that’s exacerbated (and perpetuated) by an emphasis on dull, one-dimensional characters and dialogue-heavy sequences transpiring predominantly within dimly-lit environs – with the far-from-enthralling atmosphere preventing the viewer from working up much interest in or enthusiasm for the protagonists’ deliberately-paced exploits. It’s clear, consequently, that Villeneuve’s larger-than-life approach doesn’t fare nearly as well as one might’ve hoped (or anticipated), as the picture’s myriad of meticulously-crafted set-pieces are unable, generally speaking, to pack the exciting, visceral punch for which the filmmaker is obviously striving (ie the movie is, ultimately, big on spectacle but frustratingly short on everything else). By the time the nigh endless third act rolls around, Dune: Part One has cemented its place as a distressing misfire that seems to confirm that Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel is just not suitable for big-screen treatment (ie Dune: Part One and David Lynch’s Dune are about on the same level in terms of entertainment value)."
"Dec 17, 2021",POSITIVE," “Dune” has been built up as a potential turning point of 2021 cinema since its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. In the weeks since its release in October (simultaneously in cinemas and on HBO Max), that chatter has accelerated. In the wake of a successful box-office haul, the confirmation of a sequel, and predictions and concerns about the current state of western cinema, “Dune” feels momentous. That momentousness is not all for good, and not all in good faith, but “Dune has become, as is the case with films of this kind, something of a symbol for things that exist beyond it. When I say, “films of this kind,” I don’t mean science-fiction – but commercially successful films. There’s a lot that’s hanging on “Dune” and whether it becomes a success. Not just a potential sequel, but depending on who you talk to it portends so much more. It could be a signifier of the ubiquity of Timothee Chalamet, who is headlining two major films this year from two very different directors. It could be a signifier of the future of science-fiction adaptations. It could be a signifier of what kinds of texts are adapted and readapted to the big screen. And it could be a signifier of the still complicated question about cultural representation and appropriation on the big screen. “Dune” is many things to many people, which makes sense for a film that announces itself as an epic with very big ideas. But also, because this is a film based on a novel that comes loaded with swathes of context and consideration that exist way beyond director Denis Villeneuve. In spite of that context, I went into “Dune” eerily ignorant of any it. It’s more happenstance than deliberate avoidance, but my knowledge of Frank Herbert’s novel (1965), the David Lynch film (1984) or the John Harrison miniseries (2000) was scant. My fledgling interest in the new adaptation was predicated more on my interest in Villeneuve’s work as a director, more than any firm opinion on the source itself. I managed to see “Dune” without even seeing a trailer. My entry-point to this story was filtered through the lens of Villeneuve. It’s only in the days since seeing the film that I’ve waded into the context, the complications, the ellipses and the tensions of that work. And in thinking about “Dune” – the film and the mythos – considering the contexts feels like its own adjunct to the filmmaking. The film takes place some-time in the very distant future, where humanity has regressed emotionally while prospering scientifically. Earth is not the centre of this nebulous future, and although it’s some time before we understand quite where we are we come to recognise that a sandy planet (Arrakis) is central to this. An imperial family (the Atreides) are caught up in this intrigue. The Artreides patriarch (Oscar Isaac) is a noble ruler, his son Paul (Chalamet), is callow and uncertain but potentially heroic. Paul’s mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is mysterious and potentially powerful. It’s a science fiction text with explicitly realised tropes. You understand who everyone is from early on. The wise advisor to Paul. The unnerving older-woman who’s up to something. The female ingenue that will complicate Paul’s journey. We know these kinds of worlds even if we don’t know this world. The desert planet becomes a topic of concern for the main players, desperate for its wealth of spice. And soon an attempt at extraction becomes a game of political subterfuge. It’s not so much that plot isn’t important to “Dune,” so much that the plot isn’t necessarily built on twists that are out of line with our understanding of these kinds of stories. The most significant narrative concern is Paul’s potential role as a messiah figure who might be able to put an end to the worst of the world by following his destiny. In this first part of the novel, this is all more set up than follow through as Villeneuve invites us into the world and it’s here that “Dune” is notably exemplary. A lot of this is on cinematographer Greig Fraser, who is conjuring grandiosity, mood, and tension in his collaboration with production designer Patrice Vermette. Dune looks good and the stills of it going around the internet echo that.  Even better, though, is the way it sounds, a genuine recurring note of dread and anxiety pulsating throughout with some chilling work from sound designer Mark Mangini It’s a technical wonder and even if its detractors argue that it’s style with no substance, it feels like the style is the substance when the main preoccupation is a world that seems to seduce these characters. It was curious providence that I was thinking of “Dune” in the same week that the Cave Hill campus in Barbados was holding the West Indian Literature Conference. The topic of Caribbean science fiction emerged during the conversation. The contours of western (and mostly white) science-fiction, the way that historically science fiction has been regressive on issues of race and gender. Why is it that futuristics imaginings are so limited by ideas of race? A number of major releases over the next few months are adaptations of pre-existing material, some of the original texts are decades old. Thinking of adaptation studies as a field, and the relationship between source and adaptation feels critical right now. Can adaptations really transcend their source? Can they ethically address issues that create complications today? Which works do we adapt? And why do we adapt them? These are questions beyond “Dune” and that “Dune” has fostered a return to this conversation is beneficial even if, like so much about “Dune,” it is complicated. Reading Herbert’s issue with race into Villeneuve’s “Dune” or reading them out Villeneuve’s “Dune,” is a complicated venture. Denis Villeneuve is intentional about his filmmaking. But he cannot be a director onto himself. And he knows this. After all, his recent “Blade Runner 2049” attempted another complicated task of outrunning the shadow of the past with his sequel to Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner”. I need to sit with the contours of “Dune”. I am moved and haunted by its formal sharpness. The sand. The shots. The music. I can marvel at the sharp precision of Hans Zimmer’s score even as I wonder at the use of ululations in a film that seems still cagey at really embracing with Arabic culture. But then, this is a “future” world. Our contemporaneous cultures don’t exist in the future. But they exist now. And even if “Dune” is set in the then, it exists in the now. How do we wrestle with those paradoxes? I’m not sure “Dune” has the answers for that, and it’s probably too much for a single film to answer. Villeneuve’s control of this world, and the sharp precision is wholly compelling enough so that the sheer scope and power of the spectacle feels enough. My ignorance of the context of “Dune” became a boon, for me. But with the recent announcement of the sequel, one wonders what the future of “Dune” might look if we engaged those queries. What kind of futures can we imagine for science-fiction?"
"Dec 16, 2021",POSITIVE," Since it was first published in 1965, Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi novel has had quite a shelf-life. As well as—deep breath now—five Herbert-penned sequels, there’s a series of prequels/sequels co-written by his son, a bad 1984 film directed by David Lynch, an indifferent 2000 miniseries, even a 1983 Iron Maiden song called To Tame a Land, because Herbert wouldn’t let them use the title. Like Herbert, writer/director Denis Villeneuve is great at world-building, although his narratives sometimes run away from him—see Blade Runner 2049. Could he be the one to finally tame the material? The first step he and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth made was to cut the novel in half—a bold move seeing as a sequel isn’t yet guaranteed. Still, with part one running at a bladder-straining 155 minutes, they probably could have gone for a trilogy. In the future, the stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis is passed from House Harkonnen (aka the baddies), led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), to House Atreides (the goodies), led by Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). This takes Leto’s family—including young Paul (Timothy Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, who’s only 12 years older than Chalamet)—to Arrakis, where they must win the hearts and minds of the local Fremen people, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). All this while mining a valuable hallucinogen known as “spice” and avoiding huge, marauding sand worms. Lawrence of Arabia never had it so tough. Put simply, it’s your common-or-garden hero narrative, with Chalamet as a Jesus/Luke Skywalker/Neo figure slowly realising his power in the face of interplanetary tyranny. If it’s a little speechy and slow to begin with, at least Herbert’s words are brought to life by a world-class cast including Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Charlotte Rampling, Dave Bautista and Zendaya. But it’s Villeneuve and his crew that really dazzle. Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser is an expert at capturing extraordinary landscapes (Zero Dark Thirty, Lion, The Mandalorian), and some of the shots in Dune are so beautiful that a certain type of bachelor will want to frame them and put them on his wall/make love to them. Hans Zimmer’s sure-to-be-Oscar-winning score, which swells from rumbling bass to clamorous whispers to the mangled wail of a bagpipe, gives proceedings a suitably stirring heft. As anyone who’s seen Sicario or Incendies knows, Villeneuve is one hell of a director. And he directs the hell out of this, creating moments of spellbinding spectacle such as the Atreides’ huge spaceship emerging whale-like from roiling seas, or the sky over Arrakis split by fire as the Harkonnens attack, sending Paul and Lady Jessica out into the desert badlands. Occasionally, the material does feel a little overly familiar. Aside from the Baron himself, who rubs his head a la Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) in Apocalypse Now and, thrillingly, can levitate, the Harkonnens are the kind of generic goth baldies we’ve seen a hundred times before in the likes of Dark City. The Fremen, meanwhile, are often cast as cliched mystical natives, which isn’t helped by the eruptions of indigenous wailing on the soundtrack. But the main reason for this over-familiarity is that film-makers have been ripping off Dune for years; Star Wars for instance borrowed its desert planet and visionary teen, turning the sandworms into a Sarlacc pit. No wonder Herbert was so touchy about protecting his IP. Although fatigue sets in just before the end—at which point we are informed, frustratingly, that “this is only the beginning!”—Villeneuve has achieved something beyond an impressive adaptation. With streaming taking over the world, and the future of cinema at stake, his is a vision so huge, so overwhelming, that it demands to be seen on an IMAX-sized screen, so it can swallow you whole like some kind of subterranean invertebrate. Dune may not be for everyone, but what it has in spades is an unshakable belief in its own world-building, from a drop of sweat trickling down the ear of a desert rodent to the massive shimmering tsunamis of sand. Now, how about that sequel?"
"Dec 16, 2021",NEUTRAL," Dune, the much-hyped new film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, finally heaves its bulk into cinemas this week, kicking up a cloud of dust – and not much else. The dystopian blockbuster has gone all out to impress with its popular source material, a well-regarded director (Blade Runner 2049’s Denis Villeneuve) and an impressive cast (also featuring Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem) but somehow it still commits the ultimate cinematic sin of being, well, a bit boring. Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of a powerful duke (Isaac) in the far future of humanity, who is given the stewardship of the dangerous and unforgiving desert planet Arrakis, aka Dune. The planet, for all its difficult conditions – including giant sandworms, its hostile native people, the Fremen, and the necessity of wearing suits that recycle sweat (yum) – also yields the precious substance spice, the properties of which extend human life and make faster-than-light travel possible.  However, the planet’s previous stewards, the Harkonnen (led by Stellan Skarsgård’s grotesquely fleshy Baron Vladimir), are not willing to let go of Arrakis’ riches without a fight. Meanwhile, Paul is haunted by visions of the future, including that of Fremen girl Chani (Zendaya), as he exercises special powers encouraged by his mother Lady Jessica (Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit group, who train their bodies and minds to achieve superhuman abilities. So far, so sci-fi standard – but semi-entertaining. However, Dune’s key issue is its pacing, with every one of the film’s two hours and 35 minutes seemingly stretched out with not quite as much plot as you would expect to fill them. The build-up to the story’s major action takes almost the entirety of this movie, with a Dune part two confidently referenced (although not yet confirmed). With the slow pace, although the film is nicely shot by Greig Fraser, at times it’s hard to escape the overpowering sense of it really just being an awful lot of dust and quite a few sandworms. Bursts of action and plot give a glimpse at the exciting epic that Dune could have been the whole way through, but it doesn’t help with the movie’s dryness when they’re lacking. For a film that takes its sweet time setting out its premise, it’s also frustratingly short on some contextual detail, such as more on the mysterious Bene Gesserit and the reasoning behind Lady Jessica’s overall mode of ‘fraught’ (although that would have made the film indeterminately longer, so maybe not). Dune is not particularly helped by its harsh soundtrack either, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, which is a lot of similar-sounding futuristic crash-bang-wallop that seems to repeat on a loop, ready to indicate moments of high tension – even if nothing much ends up happening. One undeniable plus of Dune is its cast, with every performer committed to giving of their all, despite a general lack of zing in the script to help the film rise above other nondescript standard sci-fi fare. Chalamet proves a strong and convincing lead as Paul, a slightly uneasy young man forced to grapple with his future as a leader – in more ways than one. Jason Momoa injects some much-needed humour as the gung-ho Duncan Idaho, also playing noble soldier to a T in more sombre moments. Sharon Duncan Brewster is also a standout as a gender-swapped Dr Liet Kynes, a complex ally to House Atreides on Arrakis as an imperial planetary ecologist, and also a Fremen. And a warning for Zendaya fans – she only properly appears in the movie’s final 10 minutes. Dune is so obviously gunning for its second part that Villeneuve has rather let that ambition play havoc with this film’s content and pace. It’s tough to know whether to reward that with a sequel or not, although audiences are likely to be invested in a hopeful pay-off of more action in part two. Keen fans of Herbert’s source novel will likely find more to enjoy in the series getting a refreshed cinematic outing after David Lynch’s 1984 version, but for others it’s hard to escape Dune feeling very slow, and very dry, as a sci-fi.

"Dec 10, 2021",POSITIVE," The extraordinary story, the epic visual feast and the sheer immersive scale and majesty of it all on the big screen. Then there's a stone-cold unfathomably flawless cast, the Hans Zimmer score, and the gifted maestro Denis Villeneuve orchestrating it all from the director's chair. From the Frank Herbert novel we are transported to a universe ruled by those who control the one commodity they cannot live without - spice. The House of Atreides are sent to govern, including the enigmatic son of the Duke, Paul Atreides, fuelled by his mysterious dreams and on the cusp of uncovering his powers."
"Dec 7, 2021",POSITIVE," When I was a child, I had deeply disturbing dreams of vastness, like my unconscious mind was tapping into the sheer, unfathomable scale of the universe, the entire sweep of not just geological but celestial time, and the dim awareness of how small and finite I was when set against all that was terrifying. It was all very abstract; there were no concrete images that I can now recall, only the impressionistic sense of huge, unknowable shapes moving, perhaps rotating, in yawning space, and my insectile, flawed apprehension of something absolutely beyond my mind’s ability to fully and accurately encompass. Maybe that doesn’t sound like much written down, but it was annihilatingly horrifying at the time, enough to jolt me awake in a welter of uncomprehending and fearful tears more than once. I remember one time I was out the front door, through the front gate, and halfway down the street in the middle of the night before I recovered myself enough to return, barefoot and shaken, to my bed. Now, Dune — in any of its varied forms — isn’t exactly about that, but it’s a little bit about it. It’s about finite lives lived in infinite space and time, it’s about free will and prophecy, destiny, and what Hardcore History’s Dan Carlin calls the two schools of history: the “trends and forces” school, where vast and largely rudderless social and economic movements, combined with pre-existing conditions, shape the course of our existence; and the “great man” school which puts the blame squarely on charismatic movers and shakers — your Adolph Hitlers, your Napoleon Bonapartes, your Paul Atreideses. It’s about colonialism and imperialism and oil, and the new film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve handles those themes better than any other iteration thus far, even if it still doesn’t quite thread the needle. But what Villeneuve does exceedingly well is at least touch on that vastness that scared me half to death as a little kid. Sense of scale is an interesting thing in science fiction, and it’s far better communicated visually than in prose. You could argue with no small amount of justification that the key image in modern science fiction is that first shot of the Star Destroyer in pursuit of the Rebel Blockade Runner in the original Star Wars (1977), how the Imperial Ship looms into the frame seemingly from behind us and just keeps coming, an enormous metal sperm whale running down a minnow. Gareth Edwards, who already had Monsters (2010) and Godzilla (2014) under his belt at the time, got a similar, if less iconic, effect in 2016’s Rogue One with the shot of the Death Star’s super laser dish being lowered into place. The king of this sort of thing is sci-fi artist Chris Foss, whose paperback covers communicate the sheer size of his ships and planet-bestriding robots better than any other artist. Chris Foss actually worked on Chilean lunatic Alejandro Jodorowsky’s aborted but hugely influential attempt to film Dune back in the ‘70s, and while little of his influence is readily discernible in Villeneuve’s film (and that’s a pity, as we’ll talk about in a bit), Denis’ big, brutalist spaceships and buildings certainly pack a punch, especially on the big screen (and you should, if you can, make the trip for this one). Oppressively immense walls of metal tower over us, and even the quiet, airy spaces of the Atreides castles on Caladan and Arrakis seem too large for human use. The Spacing Guild Heighliners that carry House ships and personnel between the stars are so big you begin to understand how an ant must feel when a human fingertip stabs towards it with murderous intent. And we haven’t even got to the worms yet. The plot of Dune is both well-turned earth and a bit byzantine, but to summarize: it is the year 10,191, and humanity has a universe-spanning civilization organized under powerful noble houses with an Emperor at the top of the heap. Computers are banned, but human potential has reached its zenith, with human computers called Mentats handling the information processing, and all kinds of wild Shaolin-monk-level martial arts and psychic powers thrown into the mix for good measure, the latter chiefly wielded by the Bene Gesserit, an order of all-female witches who have been manipulating bloodlines for countless generations in order to produce the Kwisatz Haderach — a universal superbeing capable of bringing order to the cosmos (and whom they want to control). All space travel is controlled by the Navigators of the Spacing Guild, whose own mental abilities allow them to fold space and chart a course between stars. They derive this power from ingesting vast quantities of the spice melange, a potent narcotic and life-extending anagathic. Without the spice, all space travel would cease to exist. Melange is only found on one world, the desert planet Arrakis, also called Dune. This is a pretty valuable piece of space real estate, essentially analogous to the oil fields of the Middle East, which is also why it’s home to tribes of fierce desert warriors called Fremen, who are essentially Space Bedouin and have been fighting off every noble house tasked with mining spice for ages now. When the film opens (we got there eventually), the Emperor has ordered the brutal House Harkonnen to cede control of Arrakis to their ancient enemies, House Atreides, led by the honorable Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). House Atreides decamps for Arrakis, with Leto; his concubine, the Bene Gesserit Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson); his heir, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and their trusted servants and advisors, including swordsman Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), general Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Master of Assassins Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), and royal physician Doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) all making the trip. They know they’re walking into danger but do not suspect that the Emperor has set them up for a fall, and House Harkonnen, led by the loathsome Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew, the brutal Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), are planning a terrible betrayal. But Paul, who is reticent about his destiny as the leader of House Atreides, has been dreaming of Arrakis, and a Fremen girl, Chani (Zendaya). Are his dreams actually prophecy? Is he the Kwisatz Haderach? And does the future of House Atreides lie in the deep deserts of Dune, with its warrior cults and giant sandworms? That took a lot of typing, and here’s the thing: that’s half the book. The film released this year is Dune Part One, with Villeneuve leaving a big old sequel hook dangling just before the end credits. However, the film, as directed by Villeneuve and written by him, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, does an excellent job of relaying all that info above in clean and elegant ways, and more besides. Some changes to the source material have been made, but largely for the better; whereas the writings of the Princess Irulan (Miss Not Appearing in This Film) frame the narrative in the novel, and that character as played by Virginia Madsen delivered the opening voice-over info dump in David Lynch’s 1984 film adaptation, here the duty falls to Zendaya’s Chani, who muses “Who will our new oppressors be?” before we even meet nominal hero Paul and his ostensibly honorable family. While the film goes to great lengths to illustrate Leto’s steadfastness and the nobility of the Atreides to the Fremen, they’re just another cadre of invaders who’ve come to plunder the planet. That’s smart, and Dune the film is full of similar smart choices; the workings of the personal forcefields everyone uses are portrayed in a single, perfectly illustrative shot when Gurney is training Paul. Similarly, a shot of an ornithopter’s wings beginning to beat as it takes off, framed through the still wings of another ornithopter on the landing pad, communicates more about the aircraft of Arrakis than a whole speech could. We still get a speech describing the function of the stillsuits that are vital for survival in the open desert, though, but given it’s delivered by Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet Kynes, and Imperial Ecologist who has, to use a vulgar term, gone native, that’s just fine. Duncan-Brewster is stepping into the slip-fashion desert boots of Max Von Sydow, the character having been gender-flipped since the ‘84 film and novel, and to be honest, might actually be an improvement on the Swedish legend’s turn. Narratively, two things stand out for me. One is the film’s clear and vital trust in its audience. Dune is a big, weird story full of bizarre customs and conceits, oddball characters, alien (in the broadest sense of the word) technology, and more, and yet while Villeneuve’s film is deliberately paced to evoke a sense of grandeur and gravitas, it rarely, if at all, stops the action to sit us down and explain things. Rather, it communicates with us visually, giving us the data we need to extrapolate a decent understanding of what we’re seeing. The occasional exposition extravaganzas are taken from the source novel, and that’s hard to complain about. For all that Dune has been sitting in the “unfilmable” basket for ages, this adaptation is a clear a distillation of Frank Herbert’s novel as you could hope for, without getting bogged down in reams of talking head “As you know, Bill” dialogue (looking right at you, early 2000s SyFy Channel miniseries). The other thing that impresses is Villeneuve’s gift for locating the emotion in any given scene, a vital task in a film of this scale. It would be so easy to lose track of that small, human element in all the big, sweeping, epic action, but Dune is all about the interplay and contrast between the human and the infinite. Sometimes it’s a glance between Leto and Jessica, a shot of Paul looking at his father, a joke cracked by Gurney or Duncan. Often, it’s simply letting Ferguson’s Jessica drop her mask for a second and see how terrified she is for her son, as when the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) tests him in the film’s opening scenes. The cast is great, simply wonderful across the board. I’m not sure if I can see Chalamet as the warrior prophet Paul later becomes, but he’s perfect as the unformed young man being put through the gauntlet. Momoa’s cocky charisma brings Duncan, a character previously poorly served on the screen, to remarkable life, and the same goes for Brolin’s gruff charm as Gurney, while Isaac brings a doomed nobility, Leto. Other performers sketch out their characters with limited screentime; Bautista, a genuinely gifted actor, is stripped of all but his physicality in the role of Rabban, although Skarsgård is memorably grotesque as the horrifically corpulent Baron Harkonnen. Still, I think we really missed out on seeing more of David Dastmalchian as Harkonnen Mentat Piter de Vries — obviously, the process of adaptation is one of deciding what to cut. Though, I think his character suffers the most in this version. I do love the feral intensity that Javier Bardem brings to Fremen leader Stilgar, especially in his brief scene with Leto, but I also think the film missed a trick by not casting MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) actors as the Fremen. I also don’t think the choice Villeneuve did make sinks the ship, but it’s a missed opportunity, and if MENA actors and activists are angered, it’s not hard to see why. While this Dune is less guilty of Orientalism and endorsing colonialism than its forebears, it’s not guilt-free, and while it’s a complex text and you can argue that the overall series ultimately works as a condemnation of colonialism and “white savior” tropes, it’s a bit weak for fans to complain when people are engaging with and critical of the text as presented in this form. (For the record, a few years ago when I was ruminating on how you’d do Dune, I landed on three ten-episode TV seasons, with MENA Fremen led by Alexander Siddig’s Stilgar, and a Hispanic House Atreides, largely due to the bullfighting theme, under Antonio Banderas’ Duke Leto). A part of me does, at any rate. When you’ve got the fingerprints of certified freaks like Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch on the clay, it’s hard not to wish that Villeneuve had let his own personal freak flag fly a bit higher. This Dune is the most accessible version of the source material, and that’s great, but I wonder if it plays it too safe. The film makes mention of melange being a sacred hallucinogen, but we don’t get any hallucinations apart from Paul’s very literal prophetic dreams (recall the nightmarish visions in Lynch’s version, which are not a million miles away in tone from the nightmares that plagued my childhood). Greig Fraser’s cinematography is gorgeous, as is the production design by Patrice Vermette and the costumes by Bob Morgan and Jacqueline West, but the color palette is so subdued as to be mostly beige — even the lush planet Caladan is in muted greys and dark greens. While the visual realization of the Dune universe is impressive, I’m reminded of the “Mexico filter” American filmmakers use to evoke suburban notions of life south of the border. For sure, it makes those blue-within-blue Fremen eyes really pop, but the lack of color and art and culture feels off and maybe a little paternalistic. Indeed, we’re talking about fictional cultures, fictional people, but they’re meant to remind us of or at least key off of real-world cultures and people, and if history has taught us anything, it’s that you’ve really got to be hard up against it to stop making art. It’s a niggle, not a deal-breaker, but it’s one I keep circling and poking at. When commentators complain that much of Dune looks like a perfume ad, I wonder if that’s partly down to the brightness being turned down on the cultures against which the action is set. Perhaps I’m being precious, complaining about such things in what is, to my mind, a clear five-star film, but I think it’s a fair criticism, and besides, when so much is executed so well, any flaws are going to stand out all the more. Rest assured, Dune is a triumph of a film, certainly the best major science fiction film we’ve had in years (and the only real competition comes from movies also directed by Denis Villeneuve). It’s bold, ambitious, and staggering in scope, but that very ambition pushes it in a certain direction while leaving others less explored. Perhaps when Part Two rolls around, and we can watch the whole thing as one sweeping epic, even my minor gripes will prove unfounded. For now, we have this, and it’s great."
"Dec 6, 2021",NEUTRAL," Dune is a triumph of mediocrity. What it does, it does well enough, but was it worth doing? It’s a cookie-cutter movie, a restatement of every trope that now impoverishes cinema: size rather than drama, action rather than character, adrenaline rather than engagement, imitation rather than creation. A book that sold 20 million copies because of ideas and vision becomes a movie with neither. Frank Herbert’s novels have been notoriously tricky to adapt, as David Lynch found in his earlier, much recut film version. The gifted Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve, after fine work on Arrival and Sicario, “solves” most of the problems by pretending they don’t exist. He has cut the book into pieces, to extend the life of the series (he’s already making part two). The first film retains some of the complexity of Herbert’s plot, but doesn’t bother with complexity of character – and without that, the characters just seem ridiculous, a set of medieval knights, barons and witches flailing around a desert planet in outer space, striking poses against big backdrops – an Arthurian legend with more sand than Lawrence of Arabia. The ethereal-looking Timothee Chalamet is Paul, heir to the throne of the Atreides clan on planet Caladan. Oscar Isaac is his father, the Duke, who rashly accepts his emperor’s command to take over mining operations on the planet Arrakis. Rebecca Ferguson is Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica, part of a secret order of crazy nuns led by Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam, who wields pain as a political weapon. Stellan Skarsgard is hilarious as the sleazy Baron Harkonnen – the flabbiest bad-ass since Jabba the Hutt – and Jason Momoa suits up with space armour to play Paul’s faithful warrior friend. The great and good are here in numbers – Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem, too – but with bugger-all to do. The hauntingly beautiful American actor-singer Zendaya plays the girl of Paul’s dreams – a warrior nymph from the blue-eyed sand warrior tribe, the Fremen. Basically, it’s the story of a messiah, born to rule in a world full of warring dukes and scheming ladies – something like France in the 12th century. Every once in a while, a giant worm pops up out of the sand and eats a space ship or a “spice”-harvesting contraption the size of a football field. “Spice” is a mineral so rare that empires rest upon its exploitation. Intergalactic navigation depends upon it. When the worm approaches, the cinema in which I saw it (one of the most technologically equipped in the country) started to vibrate. Even the seats shook with excitement – or Dolby wizardry. In an era of loud movies, this is perhaps the loudest I have experienced in four decades of reviewing. The strategy seems to be to beat us into submission: you will get excited, by physical intimidation if not by stimulation of your imagination. Dune is probably the first movie in history designed to appeal primarily through the posterior. It’s triumphantly arse-about, if you’ll excuse the expression. Herbert wrote Dune while experimenting with psychotropic fungi. He was trying to bring ecology into the realm of mythology while stoned on magic mushrooms. Villeneuve wants so desperately to break into the modern audience’s consciousness, to drag us away from our phones, that he resorts to an ever-present bass rumble that’s like a drone massage. Come on, feel the noise. Even then, in the best-equipped cinema in Sydney, much of the dialogue was inaudible. Greig Fraser has done a fabulous job as cinematographer, but what can you do with a movie that looks so good and sounds so awful? The book Dune inspired Star Wars. The creation of complete worlds, with their own languages and customs, was part of what excited George Lucas, but he added humour. Denis Villeneuve does this adaptation straight-faced: just another boring superhero instalment for the generations raised on Luke and Leia. You search in vain for the deeper ideas, the sense of a metaphor worth the name, a shard of meaning beyond the usual “a hero is born” guff. Good luck with that. The worm can have the whole thing."
"Dec 6, 2021",POSITIVE,"Villenueve has mistaken humourlessness for seriousness before now, but with a dream cast and a streamlined script, this Dune flies."
"Dec 5, 2021",POSITIVE," Early in Denis Villeneuve’s film Dune, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the teenage scion of a politically powerful family, is breakfasting with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), on their lush, rainy homeworld, Caladan. She tells Paul that his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), wants him dressed in full uniform today. Later, Paul stands on a podium alongside his parents and their key aides: weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Thufir Harwat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), the Mentat of House Atreides. Paul wears a crisply tailored black uniform with collar insignias and a gold braided aiguilette, his trousers tucked into knee-high boots. Banners flying, military forces ranked behind them, they watch an imperial delegate spaceship slowly descend. Its passengers disembark and process towards the podium. With great pageantry, the Herald of the Change (Benjamin Clementine) reads an official announcement from a scroll: the Emperor has granted House Atreides fiefdom over the desert world Arrakis, where the precious psychoactive spice melange is sifted from the dunes and used to power interstellar travel. Duke Leto ritually accepts the appointment — “We are House Atreides; there is no call we do not answer!” — and seals the deal with his ancestral signet ring. “Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!” shout the assembled troops. House Atreides cares about its traditions — its noble necropolis; its love of bullfighting; the proud burden of leadership, passed from father to son. Yet underlying their display of power and fealty is a sense of anxious foreboding. Later, Lady Jessica wakes Paul in the middle of the night and makes him dress again for another, private ceremony, a shadow twin of the first. Jessica, an acolyte of esoteric matriarchal order the Bene Gesserit, has trained Paul in her ways; and now her mentor, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), arrives in a different spaceship, in a different procession, to perform a ritual of testing upon Paul. The way Villeneuve repeats ceremonial motifs throughout the film is itself ceremonious. The descending aircraft; the ranked and waiting staff and troops; the formations and processions in formal dress; the fraught moments in which risk and safety teeter in balance; the simultaneous possibility and doubt that there’s something special about Paul. The chivalric gesture of holding a blade vertically against the heart, then horizontally across the head: performed first by Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), and then, at the film’s climax, by Paul as he begins a ritual duel. This isn’t a didactic film. Instead of explaining its feudal, courtly world, it immerses the viewer in that world’s formalist visual language. And the way it loops through fragments of Paul’s dreams and premonitions — which are relaxed, chaotic, un-ceremonial — builds a sense of anticipation… or dread. In one of his most terrible visions, he sees himself alongside Chani (Zendaya), the Fremen girl from Arrakis who has haunted Paul’s dreams. Now they’re the ones slowly descending in a spaceship; and they turn a pitiless, spice-blue gaze downwards as fighters swarm Caladan. Will Duke Leto’s ceremony of peaceful power transfer become Paul’s ceremony of lethal crusade? Humans are drawn to ceremony because it folds together contrasting ideas of time and space to create heightened, meaningful experiences. Ceremony takes place in an intense present moment, yet its events and gestures are traditional and unchanged, connecting participants to the long-ago past by the continuity of the repetition. Ceremony is also intensely spatial: it meshes the subjectivity of human experience with the objectivity of place. It can be sublime in the Romantic sense, in that ceremonies often take place somewhere special that transports us from the everyday, provoking overwhelming wonder and an awareness of our smallness in the grand scheme of things. Cinematographer Greig Fraser does amazing work here with bold contrasts of light in a film that would have been tempting to flood with warm gold at magic hour – indeed, Paul’s visions of Chani are a bait-and-switch, a teenage dream, a perfume commercial. Inside the Atreides stronghold in the Arrakis capital, Arrakeen, and in a later sequence in an environmental research station, light wells penetrate deep velvety shadows. When a poison dart sent by the displaced former spice barons – the pallid, insectile House Harkonnen – seeks Paul in his bedroom, he hides in stillness and light like a desert mouse: sheltering in a projection of vegetation thrown out by an educational film he’s been watching. (Villeneuve returns to this motif of the mouse, muad’dib, which, as fans of the novel will know, becomes Paul’s nom de guerre.) Ceremonies can also be mysteries in the sense of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece, understood only by initiates. Dune marshals the mood of such hidden power, represented here by the Bene Gesserit: I really enjoyed the film’s use of sound design to render “the Voice”, which commands its listener. The Bene Gesserit have basically weaponised ceremony: they have spent thousands of years secretly trying to breed the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who can fold time and space practically, as ceremony does magically. The eugenic and colonial politics of Dune are troubled, and this film has caught criticism for choosing soft, broad ‘representationism’ over either the source novel’s cultural specificity or a more radical revision. But it’s through Villeneuve’s emphasis on ceremony that we can sense the allure of cultural imperialism: it’s a practice that invites participation. While the Romantic sublime was essentially solitary, lonely as a cloud, participating in ceremony can also be powerfully communal: a surrender of the separate self to a larger shared experience. Cinemagoing is also a ceremony: a shared surrender to darkness and dazzlement. And what are film tropes and genres but rituals, which draw their power from the way they call to their own past as they unfurl along paths made smooth from repetition and anticipation? We don’t often express our spectatorship that way, though. We’ll talk about how some films feel more cinematic because they marshal spectacle on a grand scale, or because their deliberate framing, blocking and editing make small details and moments feel special and significant. Sometimes, we’ll say a moment in a film is “cool” or “awesome”. Plenty about Villeneuve’s Dune is big and spectacular, but its small motifs and gestures were what stayed with me. I don’t think it’s accidental that hands are so prominent here: Paul must place his hand in a box of pain; he touches the shifting Arrakis sands as spice sparkles in the air; he and his mother share a hand-signed language; hands offer and wield crysknives. I’ve never understood the hype about Timothée Chalamet, but I really enjoyed his performance in this film. Perhaps something about his acting feels at home in formalism, yet grates smarmily on me in a naturalistic mise-en-scène. Or maybe I, too, have been lured by the satisfaction of big-screen pageantry."
"Dec 4, 2021",NEUTRAL," 
    To wade into the Dune mythology not knowing a whole lot about Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel — and with no agenda barring Incendies director Denis Villeneuve’s badass track record
    and the minor mythology of T. Chalamet’s runway-ready hair — is to bear witness to a fractured and bewildering future world. The machinations are a mind boggle but one thing is certain: every
    big-ticket shot, rolled out with determined intensity in this first instalment of Villeneuve’s planned two-part tale, means mega business.
 
    The commodity up for grabs is an invaluable, super-enhancing “spice” that, among other enviable things, makes interstellar travel a reality. Its home planet of Arrakis is a desert hellhole, but
    that’s not about to stop the covetous Duke Leto of House Atreides (Isaac), ruler of the planet Caladan, or his paramour, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), and their son and heir, Paul (Chalamet). The
    plan, orchestrated by their double-crossing Emperor, is ostensibly for the Duke and his tremendously armoured troops to unseat the ruling House Harkonnen and grab Arrakis and its spice haul for
    themselves. Unfortunately for the Duke, the Emperor doesn’t plan to stop there, as any corporate raider could have told him.
"
"Dec 4, 2021",POSITIVE," In a galaxy ruled by an evil Emperor, a young man is told he is the inheritor of a legacy that could change the course of history. On a harsh desert planet a war between good and evil begins, while powerful forces – some of which have access to powers akin to magic – begin to meddle and manipulate. Fanciful names and titles abound, while our hero has a name common on Earth today. Hang on, there’s no robots – this isn’t Star Wars after all. Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune was such a huge influence on Star Wars (mix Dune with Flash Gordon, throw in some decent special effects and you’ve pretty much got the winning formula) it’s no surprise it’s had two big budget adaptations over the last forty years. David Lynch’s 1984 attempt remains his one major misfire, a confusing and at times embarrassing mess. Can Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) finally bring it successfully to the big screen? Short answer: yes. In fact, go for the biggest screen you can. Where Lynch’s version focused on the strange and perverse nature of the galaxy circa 10,191 (and that date is counted from a point already thousands of years in our future), Villeneuve goes for sheer size and impact. This is a future where humanity is dwarfed by both its creations and the worlds it dwells on; if you’re after a drinking game you could do worse than take a shot every time we see a giant spaceship touch down (close up of landing gear optional) followed by a massive access gantry being lowered and a handful of tiny people walking down. It’s definitely impressive to experience, even if it’s slightly at odds with the source material. The future of Dune, which Lynch conveyed but Villeneuve skips over, is one where a religious war long ago wiped out thinking machines. There are no robots or computers. Everything has to be done by someone. So combat is mostly hand-to-hand with shields and knives; the future of humanity itself will be steered by an individual bred across generations for the role. Enter Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). While he chafes (lightly) against the confines of being a royal son, his father is overseeing a shift in galactic politics. The Emperor has given House Atreides rulership of the desert planet Arrakis, AKA Dune. It’s the only known source of spice, a hallucinogenic drug that, amongst other things, makes it possible for humans to guide interstellar travel. The previous rulers of Dune, House Harkonnen, aren’t happy, which is the point; the Emperor wants them to fight (and Harkonnen to win) to prevent either side from becoming powerful enough to challenge him. The Fremen, natives of Dune, have other plans. This backdrop of galaxy-wide intrigue and scheming is a major part of the appeal of the source material – it’s a big story about big issues – and Villeneuve gets that across in every scene. There’s room for human touches too, mostly Paul’s warmth towards his family and teachers, who are all-too-aware that in this universe human feeling gets you killed. But this is an epic in every sense of the term, and if it’s occasionally a little one-note in the thudding portentousness of it all, that’s a price Villeneuve is clearly willing to pay. Under the weight of the sheer epic sweep of this film, the story itself falters on occasion. Lynch’s version possibly told it better, or at least was more interested in it; while the plot itself is never muddled, many of the supporting characters here blend into the background more than they should. On the other hand, the insect-winged ornithopters used for travel on Dune look amazing. If narratively this isn’t as fully realised as it could be, visually there isn’t a dull frame to be found. This film focuses on the first half of the novel; a sequel telling the second half of the story (and possibly providing more of the backdrop) was greenlit a week or so into its release overseas. There’s perhaps a little too much emphasis on Paul’s mystical visions of the future here, pointing the way towards an ending that we’ll now get to see for ourselves in (supposedly) October 2023. It will be a long wait, but considering the epic scale of everything else about Dune, that seems only fair. Anthony Morris is a freelance film and television writer.

"Dec 3, 2021",POSITIVE," If history is anything to go by, it's been easier to fold space and time than to film Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi classic Dune, an epic far-future tale of feuding space dynasties, secret sisterhoods and New Age prophets that cleaves to – and critiques – the genre's classic hero narrative. Many have tried and perished in the sandstorm. Wild-eyed Chilean surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky had grand designs – a 14-hour version he hoped would star Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger and Orson Welles – that proved way too ambitious to realise. Ridley Scott toyed with the idea before giving up and moving on. David Lynch – a filmmaker in sync with Herbert's psychic visions – made it all the way to the screen with a memorably grotesque piece of pop art in 1984, only to have it chopped down to the point of near incoherency. The latest filmmaker to put their hand in the pain box, Canadian writer-director Denis Villeneuve, seems like a bit of an odd choice by comparison. He's the kind of filmmaker dubiously marketed as a 'visionary' by studios, even as his recent sci-fi forays – Arrival (2016); the deeply unnecessary Blade Runner 2049 (2017) – seem better suited to show off flatscreen TVs in designer apartments than evoke any kind of sweeping mystical future. So it's a pleasant surprise to report that his take on Dune, which finally descends upon cinemas this week, is an engrossing, well-mounted adaptation that makes good on his potential as a sci-fi craftsman – not exactly enough to qualify as a visionary work, but an ambitious and largely satisfying space opera that rises like an oasis against the desert of Hollywood's current superhero cinema. Boosted by Hans Zimmer's speaker-rumbling score – with its metronomic thump and guttural alien chants – the film is burnished and commanding, full of immense wide shots that dwarf the screen, jagged spacecraft that seem to emerge from misty oil paintings, and an admirable commitment to big, earnest movie myth-making. But Dune's prettiest effect might be its cast, especially its young leads, baby-faced androgyne Timothée Chalamet and galaxy-eyed princess Zendaya – two kids who're enough to suggest a brighter, or at least hotter, cosmic future. Chalamet is Paul, teenage heir to the noble House Atreides, a mall-goth glowerpuss who divides his time between learning mind tricks from his witchy mother, Lady Jessica (a soulful Rebecca Ferguson), and putting off the politics of the family business with dad, house boss and resident dreamboat, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). It's the very distant future – never mind the swords, faux-medieval trimmings and bagpipes – and the galactic Emperor has dispatched House Atreides to take custody of Arrakis, the desert planet rich in the spice that is essential to space travel. The appointment isn't going down well with the Atreides's bitter rivals House Harkonnen, a planet of sinister creeps who bathe in black slime, keep giant spiders as pets, and whose leader, Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), seems modelled after Marlon Brando's performance in Apocalypse Now (1979). Exploited for its natural resource, Arrakis – also known as Dune – is inhabited by the indigenous Fremen, a band of blue-eyed nomads who include Zendaya's Chani, the desert warrior who's been turning up in Paul's dreams. These premonitions also suggest that Paul might be a kind of space messiah; much to the concern of Lady Jessica's clan, the Bene Gesserit, a shadowy, distaff order of psychic witches who've been trying to summon forth a chosen one – via an Atreides daughter – to bridge space and time, past and future. ""So much potential wasted on a male,"" hisses the order's Reverend Mother, played by Charlotte Rampling in a neat echo of her all-female-cult queen in John Boorman's Zardoz (1974). It's certainly a lot to swallow for the uninitiated: a fact that undid Lynch's truncated version, in which poor Virginia Madsen (as imperial Princess Irulan, heir to the galaxy) had to dispense reels of exposition over the eerie, spectral opening moments. Villeneuve has the relative luxury of two chapters – be warned, this is only Part One – and he uses this to his advantage, allowing the narrative to breathe against the scope of the images. Shooting partially on location in Jordan, Abu Dhabi and Norway, Villeneuve, Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Rogue One) and production designer Patrice Vermette (Sicario; Arrival) give the story a sense of scale and lived-in detail, welding the wide-screen vastness of Lawrence of Arabia (1962) to the scrappy grit of the first Star Wars (1977), a film whose desert sequences were famously inspired by Herbert's writing. The vistas are enhanced by all the special effects a reported $165 million dollar budget can buy: combat holo-shields that glitch and glimmer, insect-like ornithopters that swoop through sandstorms, and titanic spacecraft that seem to have teleported right off the pulp paperback covers of the 60s and 70s. But the showy effects are also offset by an attention to less expected, human-sized details: Jason Momoa's easy, movie-star charm as Duncan Idaho, a swordmaster who Paul adores; the way the great Stephen McKinley Henderson, as human computer Thufir Hawat, parades a parasol during a military inspection; or the beverages distilled from sweat, tears, and spit – presumably not available in the Dune combo at the candy bar, unless you incur the wrath of a disgruntled teenage employee. What Villeneuve and his co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born) will do with Dune's overarching narrative – with its Messianic leader and looming holy war – is harder to assess, given the obviously unfinished nature of their story. At least initially, Paul is a character in conflict with his destiny – as an heir to a patriarchy that ravages an ecosystem; as a potential saviour to a people – and Chalamet plays him with a suitably furrowed brow. Villeneuve has also tweaked Herbert's novel to open the film not on the imperial princess's tale of Paul, but on Chani – effectively framing events through the eyes of the Fremen. Elements drawn from Arabic culture and Eastern mysticism run throughout Herbert's work, which tangles with themes of colonialism, ecological neglect and the corruption of power, though this mixing of cultures – a staple device of science fiction – sits less well with the current moment, where such creative license, however nuanced, is viewed with suspicion. The new Dune has drawn some intelligent criticism for flattening the nuances of Herbert's text, downplaying the source material's grounding in Middle Eastern culture even as Hans Zimmer's recourse to Arabic vocal tones – often used to underscore an emotional moment of pause for the protagonists – leans on a Western audience's notion of the 'mysterious' for dramatic shorthand. All of which might have been less noticeable had Villeneuve been more attuned to the psychic power of images in the way Lynch, and certainly Jodorowsky, understood – the kind of filmmaking that might transcend a real-world analogue and transport an audience to something genuinely strange or alien. His Dune is too polished and cautious to risk putting a foot wrong – which makes sense, given this project's history, but also means there's nothing here willing to court ridicule, and by extension, genius. (If we can't have pugs and space slugs, couldn't we at least have gotten Timothée Chalamet doing the worm in place of the sand walk?) But it more than captures the attention, and sometimes even inspires awe. If this is the beginning of a resurgence in ambitious, operatic space fantasy, then bring it on.

"Dec 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Part 1 (aka Dune) instantly joins the ranks of the great, big-budget, mass-market sci-fi extravaganzas, including 2001, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Blade Runner, all of which it either references, pays homage to, or is clearly influenced by. In the case of Star Wars, the references become quite heady, because Star Wars is so clearly influenced by Dune, the novel, that Villeneuve’s imagery re-builds upon imagery influenced by his source material. Is this a sandcrawler that I see before me? What Villeneuve does so well here is make all this familiar stuff feel so fresh, and a huge part of it involves Hans Zimmer’s score, which is ominous, threatening, suitably alien, and omnipresent. It really sets the tone, and it’s really unique. I’m no musician, but I reckon its singular arresting sonic motif combines (or is inspired by) the bagpipe and an Islamic prayer call. This ain’t Also sprach Zarathustra, nor – very definitely – is it John Williams. No, this is darker all around; Zimmer’s intense, at times frightening score is clear about that. It’s dark and it’s serious: there is one clear joke, delivered by the one character who seems allowed to make jokes. Everywhere else, all is somber. In a way, it feels like Star Wars for grown-ups. What took me by surprise was how much action there was. The first act is world-building but acts two and three are both pretty much relentless action set-pieces. It may be ‘hard’ sci-fi, but it’s totally accessible. It’s also really fun, gorgeous to look at, vibrant, stimulating, and huge. It’s extremely gratifying to see this kind of massive entertainment being made with such inventiveness and intelligence (the adaptation of a notoriously challenging text is superb and deserves an Oscar nomination for Adapted Screenplay). It’s Villeneuve’s best film, and I greatly look forward to Part Two.

"Dec 2, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of the science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, begins with an ambush. Armed figures patrol a desert devoid of human life, guarding machines that mine swirls of sand for a rare and mysterious commodity called “spice.” Then attackers emerge from the sand beneath their feet, and the desert erupts in gunfire and explosions. The ambush is part of a campaign that is not successful; in voiceover, an enigmatic character named Chani (played by the actor Zendaya) reveals that “our warriors couldn’t free [the planet] from the Harkonnens,” the occupying force responsible for the mining operation. But the scene establishes a motif that recurs throughout the film: a landscape that appears static and unchangeable shifts under one’s feet. 




Dune is, by almost any set of criteria, a difficult novel to adapt into film. (Alejandro Jodorowsky’s failed attempt and David Lynch’s campy and largely unsuccessful 1984 adaptation provide evidence of the pitfalls.) The story takes place within looming spaceships and across ecologically distinct planets, including its main setting, the desert world of Arrakis, which is inhabited by enormous sandworms that regularly gobble up mining rigs and aircraft. (These worms produce the spice—a cross between a fossil fuel and a powerful hallucinogen—needed for everything from space travel to religious rituals.) Given the importance of alien fauna and futuristic technology to the story, it’s hard to avoid the slapstick of failed special effects—for example, in a climactic scene in Lynch’s adaptation, you can see bits of green screen floating in Kyle MacLachlan’s hair as he attempts to ride a sandworm.
Many of the book’s defining moments take place within its characters’ minds, in their apprehension of subtext, strategizing, or moments of enlightenment—another difficult hurdle for film. In Dune’s first section, members of the Atreides family engage in political machinations to avoid the downfall of their house after they are put in charge of Arrakis, and in its second, Paul Atreides (played by MacLachlan in Lynch’s version, and by Timothée Chalamet in Villeneuve’s) joins Chani’s society, the Fremen, and contends with his growing powers of prescience and his prophesied role as humanity’s savior. As the latest adaptation of a sprawling science fiction classic written in the 1960s, Villeneuve’s film meets a long-standing fan base primed to dissect any errors, and the context for its central themes—particularly religious war and totalitarianism—has changed significantly since it was first published.
Villeneuve handles these challenges well: His film, which tackles the novel’s first half, is comprehensible while retaining its alien quality, its dense, esoteric world depicted in a level of detail that feels compelling without being opaque (or, as in Lynch’s adaptation, cheesy and over-the-top). The narrative has been adjusted to place it closer to contemporary postcolonial theory (“They ravage our lands in front of our eyes…. Why did the emperor choose this path? And who will our next oppressors be?” Chani asks in the film’s opening scene), clarifying its political allegiances. The film’s greatest success is its understanding of scale: clusters of humans in vast landscapes of their own making, isolated from the past and future. These landscapes, and the structures humans build on top of them, appear stable and immutable—until something under their feet changes.

The appeal of science fiction comes from extrapolating the future of intelligent life from existing patterns in society. These stories can feel as endlessly fascinating as staring into a fun house mirror, marveling at how your face appears reflected across an unfamiliar topography. Where would I fit in if Earth became sentient and rejected humans? What would I do if an alien planet made the dead come back to life? But this need to extrapolate is also science fiction’s limitation. Many of the human patterns available to authors as the foundations of their worlds are arbitrary—the product of historical contingency, material fact, or luck—or the manifestations of power misunderstood as axioms, especially where they involve race and gender. “Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change,” Octavia Butler wrote in her 1980 essay “The Lost Races of Science Fiction.” “But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest.” The challenge of science fiction is in finding a premise expansive enough to avoid reproducing those errors.
Herbert’s Dune draws on a wide range of references—the idea for the novel began as a magazine article about Oregon’s sand dunes; Herbert also read sociology, poetry, Marxism, the history of 19th-century wars in the Caucasus—and both the novel and film are studded with bits of culture from recent human history, familiar things sealed against the passage of time: bagpipes playing at a military ceremony, bullfighting, the name Duncan Idaho (Paul’s combat trainer, played by Jason Momoa), snippets of Christian verse, religious habits that echo those of medieval nuns worn by a mystical order called the Bene Gesserit. In one scene, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), the powerful companion of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), wears an updated version of chopines, the 16th-century platform shoe that holds associations with nobles and courtesans. These details make the world of Dune feel more convincingly real: 20,000 years into the future, not everything has been replaced, and random artifacts of Earth’s history remain.
Beyond those details, the axiom at the center of the story is relatively simple in its pessimism. People will do incredible things and commit incredible acts of destruction for a charismatic leader; such leaders will use their followers to consolidate power. The political system of Dune, an exponentially more technologically advanced society than our own, is space feudalism built on extractive colonialism. Assassination attempts are common, oppression is an acceptable tool, and dinners matter a great deal. The film ends with Paul pursuing a path that will not fundamentally alter the system that destroyed his family, that instead will merely give him a better place in its hierarchy, while visions of a bloody religious war to be waged in his name loom in the future. (Villeneuve’s adaptation leaves this conflict for a sequel, which will be released in 2023.)

Still, the story takes place at a moment when its motivating axiom and the structures that reinforce it begin to lose their soundness. In an early scene, an elder of the Bene Gesserit, having put Paul through a potentially fatal test to see if he might be the messianic figure the order has worked to produce, rebukes Jessica for her concern about her son’s fate: “Our plans are measured in centuries,” she says, a scale that makes the life of any person other than the predestined leader insignificant. But the film soon contradicts this longer view: Once Paul and Jessica flee and join the Fremen in the desert, every unit of time matters, and no life is insignificant, even after death—bodies are recovered to preserve the water they retain, essential for survival on the desert planet. Fate is not abstract but an immediate existential problem—a familiar shift in perspective for those living in a time of historic floods, storms, droughts, and fires. This aspect of Dune reminds me of a line from an essay by Garry Wills on a new translation of the Bible, in which he argues that from the rushed, “traffic-jam” prose of the Gospels, one can glean how “every aspect of the New Testament should be read in light of [the] ‘good news’ that the world will shortly be wiped out.” Paul’s arrival on Arrakis bears the same apocalyptic assurance for the Fremen.
Perhaps this is what makes Dune still feel relevant: It offers a view from inside a planetwide cataclysm, when tenets that seemed unshakable fall, and their alternatives—some terrible, some utopian—become newly tangible. “When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock,” one character tells Jessica. Paul’s arrival signals to Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), a state official who secretly occupies an influential position in Fremen society, that her dreams of terraforming the desert planet might become reality: “Arrakis could have been a paradise…but then the spice was discovered. And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away,” she tells Paul and Jessica. Under the current imperial government, the undertaking was considered too costly and endangered a lucrative market; with the disruption the Atreides bring, altering the planet’s climate becomes conceivable.
For all its futuristic technology and sandworms, Dune is deeply humanistic, which does not mean it necessarily celebrates humanity, but rather in the sense that Greek tragedies of hubris and self-annihilation are humanistic. Its contribution to the sci-fi canon is the idea that the new order that replaces the old is never purely liberatory; it cannot be indifferent to its revolutionaries’ self-interest. The ideals that orient change are human inventions and always, on some level, are made in the image of their creators. Jessica describes the messianic figure her order seeks as one transcending biological limitations, possessing “a mind powerful enough to bridge space and time, past and future. Who can help us into a better future.” Villeneuve’s Dune shows its protagonist before he assumes that power, and it maintains a sense of ambivalence, an outlook that asks how the future a revolution produces will be better than what came before.
 Dune is, by almost any set of criteria, a difficult novel to adapt into film. (Alejandro Jodorowsky’s failed attempt and David Lynch’s campy and largely unsuccessful 1984 adaptation provide evidence of the pitfalls.) The story takes place within looming spaceships and across ecologically distinct planets, including its main setting, the desert world of Arrakis, which is inhabited by enormous sandworms that regularly gobble up mining rigs and aircraft. (These worms produce the spice—a cross between a fossil fuel and a powerful hallucinogen—needed for everything from space travel to religious rituals.) Given the importance of alien fauna and futuristic technology to the story, it’s hard to avoid the slapstick of failed special effects—for example, in a climactic scene in Lynch’s adaptation, you can see bits of green screen floating in Kyle MacLachlan’s hair as he attempts to ride a sandworm.

Many of the human patterns available to authors as the foundations of their worlds are arbitrary—the product of historical contingency, material fact, or luck—or the manifestations of power misunderstood as axioms, especially where they involve race and gender. “Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change,” Octavia Butler wrote in her 1980 essay “The Lost Races of Science Fiction.” “But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest.” The challenge of science fiction is in finding a premise expansive enough to avoid reproducing those errors.
Herbert’s Dune draws on a wide range of references—the idea for the novel began as a magazine article about Oregon’s sand dunes; Herbert also read sociology, poetry, Marxism, the history of 19th-century wars in the Caucasus—and both the novel and film are studded with bits of culture from recent human history, familiar things sealed against the passage of time: bagpipes playing at a military ceremony, bullfighting, the name Duncan Idaho (Paul’s combat trainer, played by Jason Momoa), snippets of Christian verse, religious habits that echo those of medieval nuns worn by a mystical order called the Bene Gesserit. In one scene, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), the powerful companion of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), wears an updated version of chopines, the 16th-century platform shoe that holds associations with nobles and courtesans. These details make the world of Dune feel more convincingly real: 20,000 years into the future, not everything has been replaced, and random artifacts of Earth’s history remain.
Beyond those details, the axiom at the center of the story is relatively simple in its pessimism. People will do incredible things and commit incredible acts of destruction for a charismatic leader; such leaders will use their followers to consolidate power. The political system of Dune, an exponentially more technologically advanced society than our own, is space feudalism built on extractive colonialism. Assassination attempts are common, oppression is an acceptable tool, and dinners matter a great deal. The film ends with Paul pursuing a path that will not fundamentally alter the system that destroyed his family, that instead will merely give him a better place in its hierarchy, while visions of a bloody religious war to be waged in his name loom in the future. (Villeneuve’s adaptation leaves this conflict for a sequel, which will be released in 2023.)

Still, the story takes place at a moment when its motivating axiom and the structures that reinforce it begin to lose their soundness. In an early scene, an elder of the Bene Gesserit, having put Paul through a potentially fatal test to see if he might be the messianic figure the order has worked to produce, rebukes Jessica for her concern about her son’s fate: “Our plans are measured in centuries,” she says, a scale that makes the life of any person other than the predestined leader insignificant. But the film soon contradicts this longer view: Once Paul and Jessica flee and join the Fremen in the desert, every unit of time matters, and no life is insignificant, even after death—bodies are recovered to preserve the water they retain, essential for survival on the desert planet. Fate is not abstract but an immediate existential problem—a familiar shift in perspective for those living in a time of historic floods, storms, droughts, and fires. This aspect of Dune reminds me of a line from an essay by Garry Wills on a new translation of the Bible, in which he argues that from the rushed, “traffic-jam” prose of the Gospels, one can glean how “every aspect of the New Testament should be read in light of [the] ‘good news’ that the world will shortly be wiped out.” Paul’s arrival on Arrakis bears the same apocalyptic assurance for the Fremen.
Perhaps this is what makes Dune still feel relevant: It offers a view from inside a planetwide cataclysm, when tenets that seemed unshakable fall, and their alternatives—some terrible, some utopian—become newly tangible. “When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock,” one character tells Jessica. Paul’s arrival signals to Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), a state official who secretly occupies an influential position in Fremen society, that her dreams of terraforming the desert planet might become reality: “Arrakis could have been a paradise…but then the spice was discovered. And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away,” she tells Paul and Jessica. Under the current imperial government, the undertaking was considered too costly and endangered a lucrative market; with the disruption the Atreides bring, altering the planet’s climate becomes conceivable.
For all its futuristic technology and sandworms, Dune is deeply humanistic, which does not mean it necessarily celebrates humanity, but rather in the sense that Greek tragedies of hubris and self-annihilation are humanistic. Its contribution to the sci-fi canon is the idea that the new order that replaces the old is never purely liberatory; it cannot be indifferent to its revolutionaries’ self-interest. The ideals that orient change are human inventions and always, on some level, are made in the image of their creators. Jessica describes the messianic figure her order seeks as one transcending biological limitations, possessing “a mind powerful enough to bridge space and time, past and future. Who can help us into a better future.” Villeneuve’s Dune shows its protagonist before he assumes that power, and it maintains a sense of ambivalence, an outlook that asks how the future a revolution produces will be better than what came before.

"Dec 1, 2021",POSITIVE," Despite reading Frank Herbert‘s 1965 novel many moons ago and viewing David Lynch’s bizarre 1984 adaptation during my youth, Dune was still a title that felt foreign to me when entering the theatre to bare witness to Denis Villeneuve‘s much-discussed imagining.  Sure, I can clearly see the inspiration this operatic story had on the science-fiction tales that came in the years since – namely a little series known as Star Wars – and the narrative surrounding the spice business at the core of the story lacks subtlety when held up to the petroleum industry of the now, but Villeneuve’s vision, in all its robust glory, is its own beast, and in adapting the novel with his own unique vision he’s made familiar material feel somewhat untapped. Dune (or Dune: Part One, as it’s so specifically stated during the opening credits) is a film so vast that we are thankful we have a confirmed sequel to look forward to as, perhaps to the frustration of many a viewer, this is a product that very much feels narratively unfinished.  It’s heavy on exposition that in some ways it feels designed as a precursor for a bigger, grander story to be told, one that Villeneuve and co-writers Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, A Star Is Born) and Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange) consistently tease throughout, with certain influential characters deliberately shadowed; anyone hoping Zendaya will have a constant presence best check their expectations as the starlet’s screen-time barely adds up to 5 minutes in total. Speaking of Zendaya, her character, Chani, is what seemingly drives the story forward for its protagonist, young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the ducal heir of the House Atreides, a royal family of sorts who have taken over ruling duties of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet known for its produce of “spice”, a valuable substance that bestows its users heightened vitality and expanded consciousness.  Under the ruling of his father, the stern Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his various aides – namely weapons master Gurney (Josh Brolin) and swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, one of the few actors on hand able to inject a genuine sense of fun into proceedings) – Paul is instructed in the ways of combat and self defence.  At odds with this are the teachings from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, simply luminous), a member of a divine sisterhood whose representatives possess advanced physical and mental abilities, attributes she is sharing with Paul, in spite of the fact that these only be shared with other women. Holding the power he has honed from his mother’s teachings – specifically something called “the voice”, a vocal tone that manipulates the minds and wills of others – signifies a future of greatness for Paul, and the visions that haunt him throughout, though unclear to him as to what they represent, connects him to the mysterious Chani and a tribe of warriors that will seal his fate; whether that be aligned with his salvation or doom is yet to be determined.  His father’s move to Arrakis indicates Paul’s vision holds weight, and the majority of Dune‘s significant run time – it clocks in around 156 minutes – bases itself around positional politics and a heft of double (and triple) crossing that, if you’re not paying attention, finding a narrative entry point may be a somewhat murky experience. Thankfully, so much of Dune works purely on an aesthetic level.  Though it’s a particularly muted looking film in terms of colour, it remains no less gorgeous in its visual sumptuousness as to what Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser (Rogue One, The Batman) create and display on screen, and the performances, though understandably heightened, never indulge in unnecessary melodramatics.  It’s a larger than life film, and though it easily could have rested on spectacle, it manages to have substance in its detailing of tyranny, rebellion, and respecting one’s culture.  A true achievement in every sense of the word. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Dec 1, 2021",POSITIVE," DUNE **** (155 minutes) M
Yes, it’s been worth the wait. Having been delayed for over a year thanks to Covid, Dune lands with grace, beauty and on a scale so awesome and majestic and immersive it often looks like they flew out and shot the thing on alien worlds. As jaw-dropping as the sweep of the film often is, writer/director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies; Prisoners; Blade Runner 2049) has done a superb job using the epic scope and grand designs that power the film’s rich visuals to frame an engrossing, intimate, character-strong story of dynastic ascendancy, colonization and interplanetary rivalry. The desert planet Arrakis contains a special spice in its sands. For the indigenous people, the Fremen, it has great health benefits. For those who come to plunder it, the spice gives them the power to traverse space. For mysterious reasons, the not-so-nice and rather ugly miners from House Harkonnen have upped stumps and left Arrakis in their gargantuan, brick-like ships and gone back to their dark, grotty home planet, Giedi Prime. Replacing them to harvest the spice are their enemies from House Atreides, a far more attractive bunch of people who reside on the far more attractive, postcard-friendly planet of Caladan. Awarded the planet by the Intergalactic Emperor – there always has to be an Intergalactic Emperor, just like in Star Wars – the Duke (Oscar Isaac) has a different agenda than his predecessors. Yes, they need the spice, but he wants kinder, gentler dealings with the local Fremen, whose powers and knowledge he wants to harness to secure dominion over the planet against the ever-present threat of the Harkonnen hordes. By his side is son Paul (Timothee Chalamet), a gaunt, eager young lad who would rather be at the rough end of operations with space jock and trusted pal Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). Duty, however, demands he keep within his ceremonial and diplomatic roles. After all, he is in line to take over House Atreides. Paul is also trying to master an inherited gift called The Voice, a mind control power not-at-all dissimilar to The Force from Star Wars. (A coincidence, surely. A-hem.) On top of that, Paul radiates a strong vibe that has those around him suspecting that he could be The One, again a concept not-at-all dissimilar to what we saw in Star Wars.  So, off they scoot to Arrakis the hot desert planet, again an idea not-at-all dissimilar to Luke Skywalker’s home planet Tatooine. (Anyone else sensing that it’s possible George Lucas might have read Dune before coming up with Star Wars? Just a thought.) We didn’t needed yet more proof that Australian cinematographers are world leaders in the art, yet here we have Greig Fraser (Last Ride; The Boys Are Back; Zero Dark Thirty; Foxcatcher) filling the film with luminous images that often make it look like they went off-world and shot the film in space. (Has somebody already said that?). With stately compositions that are often painterly, he captures both the jaw-dropping scale of the story and its intimacy, as when Paul connects with a tiny, big-eared kangaroo mouse that inhabits the hot sands of the planet. Lovers of movie spacecraft will love Dune for its design work and the marvellous extremes therein. On the one hand, when we’re in space we get an assortment of odd-shaped spaceships with smooth features and an imposing presence. On the ground, however, it’s a fabulously different design deal. Everyone flies about in things called ornithopters, which is like a helicopter, but instead of rotor blades there are these long, foldable wings that make the machines look like giant mechanical dragonflies. They’re beautiful to behold, yet they have the visceral nuts-and-bolts feel of a loud flying machine, with everyone having to yell to be heard through clunky headsets. It’s a stark contrast to the ships we see in orbit, a brilliant example of great movie design work. It’s the emotion and intrigue that matters most, of course. Along with staging some stellar action sequences – including a great rescue set-piece involving a sandworm – Villeneuve does a superlative job imbuing the drama with a fruity Shakespearean feel as the actors move about massive sets clearly inspired by the Brutalist school of making things look grand and commanding and a bit oppressive. The beleaguered Fremen have long been forced to fight for their survival in the face of a never-ending succession of invaders who come to plunder their home for resources without giving them a  cut. In this regard you can’t help but warm to the performance by Oscar Isaacs, who gives the Duke a real sense of regal decency. He knows the power of his vast forces, yet his intentions towards the Fremen is based on respect and partnership. And desperate though he is to get spice production up to speed he gallantly puts life before profit, as one scene boldly illustrates. It’s a really deft touch that really grounds the Duke as a man of honour. For his part, Timothée Chalamet does a fine job in the lead as Paul tentatively feels his way into the role he is destined for, reluctant though he might be to accept such huge responsibility. The film is, of course, based on Frank Herbert’s award-winning 1965 novel, a universally hailed work long regarded as one of the most influential in modern sci-fi, as George Lucas would no doubt attest. Those whose formative years were in the 1970s, the novel also holds the distinction of being the most popular unread novel of the decade. Everybody owned a copy but nobody ever got through the first few chapters because the story was so dense. After the incomprehensible garble of David Lynch’s 1984 film (whichever version you sat through), and the very good, if occasionally plodding 2000 mini-series Frank Herbert’s Dune starring William Hurt, it is heartening that this Dune has as one of its producers Frank Herbert’s son Brian, who has written many novels in the Dune canon. If only they’d worked in a cameo for Kyle MacLachlan or even David Lynch to complete the circle. Perhaps they’ll pop up in the sequel, which is already in pre-production."
"Nov 30, 2021",NEGATIVE," When it comes to remakes and reboots, Hollywood has a natural tendency to stick what works. From comic book adaptations like Spider-Man, to dramas-turned-musicals like A Star is Born, to action-fests like King Kong, to period piece dramas like Little Women, to like-action transfers like Beauty and the Beast, to slasher-thrillers like Halloween, to iconic Westerns like True Grit. The rationale is obvious – if it’s made money before, there’s a good chance it’ll make money again. Dune goes against the grain. Yes, it’s based on the best-selling 1965 science-fiction novel from author Frank Herbert but when first adapted for the screen in 1984, it was both a critical and financial failure. America’s two leading film critics of the time, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, described it as “the biggest disappointment of the year” and “needlessly complicated”. It made just $30 million USD at the local box-office (below its budget) and even director David Lynch admitted it was “a total failure”. The most noticeable difference in this new adaptation from French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival) is that it’s a two-parter with the second instalment slated for release in late 2023. Having five hours to work with, as opposed to just two, provides a far greater opportunity to explore this interesting world and flesh out the many characters within it. Utilising the latest technology in terms of both visual and sound effects also provides a leg-up over its cheaper-looking predecessor. The plot is hard to surmise succinctly but to do my best, Dune is a multi-way power struggle set in the distant future (the year 10191 to be precise). The desert planet of Arrakis contains the most valuable substance in the universe – a “spice” used as fuel for interstellar travel. Three key groups are looking to control it – the alliance-building House Atredies, the villainous House Harkonnen, and the native population of Freman. Oh, I should mention the planet is also home to some giant, people-eating worms! Whilst the film boasts one of the largest big-name casts of the year, this is Timothée Chalamet’s show. He’s front and centre throughout and his impassioned, note-perfect performance is the key reason why audiences will invest their emotions. He plays the stylish Paul Atreides, heir to his family’s throne and a powerful young warrior who is discovering and harnessing newfound skills, both physical and mental, that will be pivotal in deciding the future of Arrakis. Following on from his Oscar nominated performance in Call Me by Your Name and scene-stealing efforts in Little Women, I’m convinced the 25-year-old Chalamet is one of the best actors of his generation. Villeneuve has been publicly critical of a decision made by Warner Bros. to release his film simultaneously in cinemas and HBO Max in the United States. That view could be seen as arrogant and near-sighted (given everything that’s happened with COVID) but having seen the finished product, it’s easier to see why he wants it seen in packed movie theatres. Dune is as much an experience as it is a movie – an orgy of immersive visuals, music and sound that pull you into its enthralling world. I bought my first Hans Zimmer soundtrack three decades ago (Backdraft) and Dune will be the next addition to the collection. The 64-year-old composer is the master of adrenalin-pumping scores (Interstellar is a masterpiece) and this is another beauty. Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Lion) also deserves a shout-out for the distinctive contrasts he creates (interior v. exterior shots) and the use of tight facial close-ups in pivotal scenes. It resembles a poetic Terrence Malick film in places."

As in deathly serious, since I wasn’t the only one laughing at the screening when the film kicked off by announcing, “Dreams are messages from the deep.” I’ve not seen the other “Dune” adaptations and have really only bothered with any part of the franchise until recently, so I can’t say how well other attempts at bringing Herbert’s book to the big (and small) screen holds up. So it might just be my ignorance talking when I say that the 2021 version is one of the best, most skillful attempts at bringing an intricate, infamously dry world to life I’ve seen.  Let’s face it, it’s hard to picture anyone but the most ardent fans enjoying a discussion about the economics of spice, palace intrigue, and religious and political philosophy. But Villeneuve is determined to have his cake and get moviegoers to eat it too, because he actually manages to fill us in on the world of young nobleman Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), whose family is sent to manage the affairs on Dune, a desert planet containing the all-important spice, only to experience death and disaster at the hands of their enemies, the Harkonnens. That’s where things get kind of awkward, because humanism doesn’t exactly inform Herbert’s philosophy. The world he created is unapologetically elitist, and the Atreides family are the good guys mostly because they’re the more reasonable colonizers. The movie doesn’t try to avoid this at least, openly pointing out that Paul and his parents, the Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) are basically the new oppressors, especially to the desert people known as the Fremen. Leto has just enough time to prove how much they want to be nice before things go to hell, and Paul and his mother Jessica are forced to flee into the harsh desert environment of Dune in order to survive. Just how it comes to that is where the movie falters. In the book the Harkonnens were dangerous, calculating enemies who could believably triumph against the honorable Atreides family. They were going to undergo a few changes regardless, since main villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), embodied the worst villain tropes taken to an extreme - fat, decadent, and a predatory gay man with a nauseating predilection for teenage boys. It’s noteworthy then, that the only characteristic that survives from the original is the fat part, with the Baron an almost featureless floating blob, and the rest of the Harkonnens equally as lacking in development, and with their bald heads and all-black clothing, clearly on the side of evil. It’s not much for a genre that’s often defined by the opposition, but those who choose to view “Dune” in the environment they were clearly meant to will have a lot to enjoy. Many films have claimed to be strictly for the theatrical experience, but “Dune” is one of the few who can honestly make that claim, and its sound design is on par with “The Quiet Place.” Dialogue is raised and lowered as we’re meant to perceive it, and the all-encompassing world has the effects to go with it, leaving my chair literally rattled beneath me during some sequences. In other words, come to theater and you’ll live quite deliciously throughout the two and a half hour runtime. And if the villains are a bore, there’s plenty of side characters, which include Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa as the warriors Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho, respectively, to liven things up. Even the character of Paul bows to 2021 standards. It’s hard to picture the book version kicking off his morning with a joke, but thankfully Chalamet is allowed to bring some badly needed levity every now and then without having to fulfill the usual shirtless wonder requirements, with Isaac stepping up to give us a little thirst trap. Let’s hope it carries on to the next film, because there’s no guarantee that there’ll be one. It’s been a long time since the days of simultaneous filming and “Lord of the Rings,” and whether there’ll be a part two, hopefully with more Zendaya, isn’t a done deal, at least until Warner Bros. sees the box office receipts. That’s disappointing, because this is clearly a set up, one which introduces us to a world and tears it down. When Zendaya’s Chani says, “This is only the beginning,” it’s a meta prophecy in itself and the hope of studios everywhere."
"Nov 29, 2021",POSITIVE,Villeneuve's Dune is a triumphantly cohesive assembly of a very difficult to adapt novel by Frank Herbert.
"Nov 20, 2021",POSITIVE,Dune is easily one of the best visually & audibly crafted films of 2021. Hans Zimmer's score is perfection. Narratively? hmmm not so much.
"Nov 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune: Part One is a stunning piece of work in that context, one that could well be for the ages."
"Nov 19, 2021",NEGATIVE," There’s more of Timothée Chalamet in Dune, in considerably less whimsical mood, and more Oscar Isaac too – just as saturnine as in The Card Counter, but behind a severe fatherly beard. This long-awaited blockbuster is cinema’s third stab at Frank Herbert’s supposedly “unfilmable” science fiction epic. Outré visionary Alejandro Jodorowsky tried, but it never happened, while David Lynch did pull it off, but to somewhat murky effect. Now comes Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) with a Dune for the CGI age. His version certainly takes the novel seriously, and itself, too. It’s unfailingly sombre, as if determined not be written off as merely Star Wars sprinkled with sand. Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, scion of a planetary dynasty given the contract to extract the priceless material “spice” from the deserts of arid planet Arrakis. That pallid youth Paul may be the foretold Messiah who will one day bring about the liberation of Arrakis’s desert-dwelling Fremen – could this be any more of a “white saviour” fantasy? Still, it seems that Villeneuve won’t get round to grappling with that problematic issue until Episode 2, if it ever gets made (the most ominous closing words in recent cinema: “This is just the beginning”). This film gets as far as landing Paul and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in the desert: ’til then, we get a lengthy caravanserai of austere set pieces, a beautiful platform for Patrice Vermette’s extraordinary designs, and various striking performances. Stellan Skarsgård is the levitating villain Baron Harkonnen; Charlotte Rampling is her icy best as an intergalactic Mother Superior; Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa are burly bruisers with beards."
"Nov 19, 2021",POSITIVE," Craft-wise, Dune is a marvel; filled with impressive visual effects, imaginative costumes, and an otherworldly score by Hans Zimmer. But the cinematography falls victim to that all too modern trap of being drastically underlit and murky. All this is in service of a plot that feels shockingly threadbare for a film that's about intergalactic political intrigue and civil war. This is mostly due to this being Act I of a larger narrative, but if The Lord of the Rings managed to deliver three films with three act structures and fully rounded stories I see no reason why Dune can't do the same. There's clearly an interesting world here, one that provides an all-too-timely critique of wealthy elites vying for control of natural resources in order to gain political power, but Dune takes three hours to get to really get started and then it ends.  Perhaps it will ultimately work better when seen in it's full context once Part II is released, but Dune as it stands is a curiously weightless affair, all sturm and no drang, a vaguely intriguing setup that is shockingly unsatisfying. One can't help but feel that the narratives been robbed of its context, serving as little more than an appetizer for another, better film.  It's a first act without a climax, a sweeping visual spectacle that ultimately lacks the substance to justify its grim self-seriousness. Here's hoping Part II makes it all worth it."
"Nov 19, 2021",POSITIVE," El canadiense Denis Villeneuve (La mujer que cantaba, Tierra de nadie: Sicario, Blade Runner 2049), responsable de la realización y coautor del guión de Duna (Dune, 2021), tuvo la fortuna de poder revisar cada aspecto negativo de la película que David Lynch filmó en los años ochenta del siglo anterior, Dunas (Dune, 1984). De entrada, es claro que atiende el más grave: la caótica narrativa. Propone, así, una narrativa convencional que obedece con rigor a la causalidad. La historia ahora resulta mucho más clara, si bien, en esencia, no es muy diferente de la planteada en la cinta de Lynch. Bueno, sí hay una diferencia fundamental, porque Duna es medio Dunas. Ya veremos por qué. Duna se inspira en la novela homónima de Frank Herbert y da cuenta de la instalación de los Atreides, en el año 1019, en el planeta Arrakis. El duque Leto (Oscar Isaac) acepta la invitación del emperador para hacerse cargo de la administración de las instalaciones que producen una especia tan valiosa como codiciada, pues es el combustible que permite los viajes interestelares. Leto se instala en el desértico Arrakis con su concubina, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), y su hijo, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Si bien los lugareños (los freman) ven en éste al posible mesías que habrá de regresar la esperanza al género humano (¿es el balance de la fuerza?), las contrariedades pronto se multiplican para los Atreides. Entre otras cosas porque los freman ven con recelo a los recién llegados y porque los Harkonnen –encabezados por el barón Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård)–, otrora explotadores de la especia, no pretenden renunciar a las utilidades que ésta genera. Villeneuve ofrece un espectacular viaje galáctico por paisajes contrastantes: va de las frescas playas marinas al abrasador desierto. Explota con fortuna los planos abiertos, que son pertinentes lo mismo para registrar escenarios monumentales que para dar cuenta de la fuerza de las huestes presentes en Arrakis y más allá. Apuesta por una puesta en escena que es futurista en el diseño de espacios, naves y algunos vestuarios; es discreta en el maquillaje y en el manejo de la luz, cortesía del australiano Greig Fraser (responsable de la cinefotografía de Rogue One: una historia de Star Wars). Después de casi cuarenta años y doscientas entregas de Star Wars es evidente el avance tecnológico en la cinematografía y la asimilación de un estilo de iconografía. La banda sonora no es discreta: con el afán de apoyar la narrativa y la emoción, de darle grandeza a la propuesta, en todo momento se roban la atención las músicas y los efectos sonoros de Hans Zimmer, quien le pone galleta a su labor y entrega un soundtrack menos potente que estridente. Villeneuve se apega a los dictados del cine fantástico (Dune no es ciencia ficción, es fantasía) para dar cuenta del ascenso –otro– de un mesías que sigue con exactitud el viaje del héroe propuesto por Joseph Campbell en su memorable libro El héroe de las mil caras (va del mundo ordinario al especial y regresa con el elixir del conocimiento). A pesar de la monumentalidad de la puesta en escena, la ruta de este héroe resulta insípida y diminuta (entre otras cosas porque la puesta en cámara no alcanza dimensiones épicas, porque Villeneuve no es brillante en el registro de la acción). En esencia, la cinta cuenta cómo el niño Paul llega a contradecir un designio materno, pues dos horas y media después, el chamaco le dice “no” a su madre. Es decir, somos testigos de cómo el beautiful boy se convierte en el beautiful young. En la filmografía de Villeneuve no es poca cosa, pues la madre no es irreprochable, y si en La llegada (Arrival, 2016) es un titiritero egoísta, acá es sospechosa, no en vano Leto le pregunta si, llegado el momento, va a anteponer el hijo a sus propios intereses. Y si bien hay un guiño al Apocalipsis (Apocalypse Now, 1979) según Francis Ford Coppla (el barón emerge de un líquido oscuro, como lo hacía Willard en la cinta de marras), en Duna no hay mayor profundidad que consignar, mayor abyección que relatar. Al final, la apuesta de Villeneuve por el espectáculo audiovisual entrega buenas cuentas en lo visual (y ni tanto: en este renglón no me parece una película particularmente memorable) y menos buenas en lo sonoro (la cinta aturde). No obstante, queda a deber en el terreno sustancial. Ahí está el mayor reproche a la cinta de Villeneuve: el mucho ruido no alcanza a ocultar las pocas nueces; el oropel no esconde la vacuidad. Estamos ante una superproducción que no desarrolla con rigor tema alguno. Para acabarla, la cinta no concluye ni termina, simplemente se interrumpe. Porque ya se ve en el horizonte Dune 2. A menos que se me escape algo muy profundo –y, por ende, muy oculto– después de ver Dune según Jodorowsky, Dune según Lynch y Dune según Villeneuve voy llegando a la conclusión de que Dune es una tomadura de pelo. De Dunas (Dune, 1984) de David Lynch suele recordarse el estrepitoso fracaso de crítica y público: no gustó al segundo y no convenció a la primera; fue una superproducción de 40 millones de dólares –de aquéllos– que en taquilla fue deficitaria y ni siquiera recuperó su costo. ¿Las razones? Fue un proyecto más pretensioso que ambicioso que, de cara a las evidencias, no cayó en las mejores manos. Si bien es posible detectar en diferentes pasajes de la cinta la rúbrica del cineasta, la narrativa resulta accidentada, y la sustancia – para decirlo en términos de lo que propone la historia– se diluye en las arenas de Arrakis. De la experiencia Lynch salió fortalecido (dos años después se reivindicó con una de sus obras maestras: Terciopelo azul); Dunas quedó para en su filmografía –para ponerlo en términos de mortificación lyncheana – como una odiosa deformidad, una inocua pústula. El guión de Dunas es cortesía de Lynch, quien se inspiró en la novela homónima de Fank Herbert. La acción se ubica en el año 10191 y sigue las vicisitudes de la familia Atreides: papá duque Leto (Jürgen Prochnow), mamá Jessica (Francesca Annis) e hijo Paul (Kyle MacLachlan). El duque es comisionado para hacerse cargo de Arrakis, un planeta que es importante para el imperio –del que los Atreides forman parte– porque produce una codiciada especia (y de cuyo valor sabemos más de lo que vemos). Por allá acechan los peligros, pues los antiguos administradores, los Harkonnen, han dejado algunas trampas y están dispuestos a volver. Entre traiciones y huidas Paul encuentra su destino: es el mesías que el universo ha esperado por años. Lynch propone una cámara discreta y una puesta en escena monumental para crear la arquitectura y los escenarios de los planetas donde transcurre la acción. Asimismo, concibe una realeza retro, que vive en palacios con aires añejos y viste como la nobleza de siglos pretéritos; hay deslices al futurismo en el diseño de los trajes que usan en algunos planetas. Los maquillajes son indispensables para la caracterización –como habitualmente sucede en las películas de Lynch–, y llama la atención en particular el odioso barón Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan), un obeso sujeto –que no puede con su peso, por lo que levita artificialmente– cuyo cuerpo está cubierto de enormes ampollas. En la ruta hay guiños a la iconografía y la lengua musulmanas, lo que hace aportes al fenómeno religioso que está en el fondo y la superficie de Dune. Los efectos especiales, que hoy parecen rupestres, contribuyen a construir un futuro verosímil; funcionan bien aunque por momentos no se ven tan bien. Las músicas, cortesía del grupo Toto, se escuchan con frecuencia, y lo mismo apoyan la intriga que empujan con tibieza el tono épico que pretende habitar la cinta. El dispositivo, con todo, es atractivo. El problema está en otra parte: en la narrativa. Lynch engarza las escenas, sobre todo al inicio, de tal forma que no resulta sencillo entender la lógica del relato. El cineasta evita seguir las prerrogativas de la narrativa convencional, que se sustenta en la causalidad, y apuesta por los derroteros de la casualidad, por lo que las sorpresas se multiplican generando confusión. Así, la primera hora de la cinta avanza de forma caótica (ya decía Jodorowsky que las primeras cien páginas de la novela de Herbert lo eran) y es un tanto tortuosa. La película inicia con lucidores pero inútiles prolegómenos, con largas presentaciones de personajes. Despega tarde, y cuando llega el momento de lo relevante, a Lynch le ganan las prisas y recurre a explicativas voces en off, recurso que llama la atención negativamente, pues no lo usa sistemáticamente y su función, como salvadora de la narración, resulta transparente. Para acabarla, Lynch es pueril en el registro de la acción, por lo que ésta resulta insípida. Al final la ruta del héroe (que es consecuente con la que Joseph Campbell describió en su reputado libro El héroe de las mil caras y que George Lucas registra religiosamente en su Guerra de las galaxias), la que sigue Paul, también lo es, y este mesías genera más indiferencia que esperanza. Al final surge en la mente aquella máxima de “zapatero a tus zapatos”. Lynch no parece estar cómodo en el thriller y en la épica. Si bien hay pasajes valiosos, en los que cobran valor algunos matices psicológicos –más que espirituales– de sus personajes, la propuesta resulta fallida. El tema, que pasa por el crecimiento, por la realización del potencial, por la asunción del destino y la consecución de las metas, se extravía en el oropel. Acaso Dune se acomoda mejor al estilo de Steven Spielberg (recordemos cómo, reconociendo sus propias posibilidades, Stanley Kubrick pensó en él para Inteligencia Artificial). En conclusión, Lynch, que ha dicho en repetidas ocasiones que no tuvo el control del corte final y no terminó haciendo la película que tenía en mente, parece rebasado y entrega una cinta de escasa inspiración y ostentosas carencias: sin duda, su peor película. Como Perdidos en La Mancha (Lost in La Mancha, 2002), Jodorowsky’s Dune (2013) de Frank Pavich es una película documental sobre una película de ficción que no existe. Como aquélla, dirigida por Keith Fulton y Louis Pepe, despacha con solvencia y gracia una experiencia fallida: es exitosa en su intención de relatar el fracaso de una obra que no fue, y el oxímoron que inevitablemente surge resulta tan memorable como emocionante. Fulton y Pepe siguen las contrariedades de Terry Gilliam en su afán de filmar El hombre que mató a Don Quijote (que fue realizada finalmente casi dos décadas después; pero ésta es otra historia, sobre la que ya volveremos); Jodorowsky’s Dune se ocupa, como anuncia el título, de los afanes del artista de origen chileno para realizar una película cuya inspiración proviene de Dune, la novela de Frank Herbert. Pavich lleva a cabo una crónica rigurosa de las diligencias que Alexandro Jodorowsky –como otrora firmaba– llevó a cabo para levantar su primer proyecto después de una larga temporada laboral en México. Acá, recordemos, dejó en el teatro un séquito de admiradores –se diría que una secta que le rendía culto– y debutó como cineasta con Fando y Lis (1968); posteriormente realizó El topo (1970) y La montaña sagrada (1973). Justo después de esta última entró en contacto con el productor francés Michel Seydoux y se dio a la tarea de escribir y preparar Dune. En el documental de marras Jodorowsky relata su acercamiento a la novela, cuyas primeras 100 páginas, dice, son confusas, y comenta cómo fue ubicando y contactando a los artistas que contribuirían en diferentes rubros de su propuesta: Moebius, un star francés del cómic, quien dibujó el storyboard de la totalidad de la película; H. R. Giger y Chris Foss, que se encargarían de diferentes aspectos del diseño de arte, como las escenografías y las naves espaciales (y que, años después, colaboraron en Alien); del casting que tenía en mente, y entre los actores que quería para su proyecto figuran David Carradine, Orson Welles, Salvador Dalí y Mick Jagger; para los efectos especiales su primera opción fue Douglas Trumbull, quien había participado en 2001, odisea del espacio (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968) de Stanley Kubrick, pero después de un desencuentro de egos se decantó por Dan O’Bannon (quien posteriormente participaría en el guión de Alien); para la música habló con la gente de Pink Floyd y de Magma. Jodorowsky’s Dune tiene la virtud de hacer un ameno making-of (detrás de cámaras) de un proyecto en el que no llegó a haber cámaras. El relato del fallido Dune resulta atractivo porque, para empezar, es educativo: ilumina las diferentes etapas que sigue una película, los pasos para ir de la letra a la gráfica. Más que la historia, somos testigos de cómo el diseño comienza a cobrar relevancia, de cómo va tomando forma el universo imaginado. En la ruta resulta bastante emocionante cómo, por medio del uso de la animación, en algunos pasajes el storyboard se convierte en imágenes en movimiento. Con todo esto alcanzamos a hacernos una idea de cómo pudo verse y oírse la película. Cabe apuntar que tanta desmesura era prometedora. Además de dar cuenta del proyecto, Pavich tiene la virtud de hacer un “retrato de cuerpo entero” de Jodorowsky, un ser humano vigoroso (es asombroso descubrir que, al momento de la grabación, contaba con 84 años), un artista de enorme figura, de gran imaginación y contagiosa vitalidad. Todo en el es entusiasmo, desmesura, grandilocuencia. Confiesa que su primera ambición con Dune era llevar al espectador a la experiencia del LSD; posteriormente se va revelando que la aventura que recoge la cinta pretende empujar una expansión de la mente, un crecimiento espiritual (whatever that means), como sucede con El topo y La montaña sagrada, dicho sea de paso. Y como la cinta da cuenta de la gesta de un mesías, él se ve a sí mismo como un profeta. Su Dune sería, así, parte de su religión. Al borde del paroxismo, en algún momento confiesa cómo se apropió del texto, subraya que cambió el final del libro, pues cuando haces una película “no debes respetar la novela […] es como cuando estás casado, tú tomas a la mujer; si la respetas, nunca tendrás un hijo […] debes violar a la novia y entonces tendrás tu película. Yo estaba violando a Frank Herbert, pero con amor”. Al final se entiende por qué Jodorowsky era visto en México como un gurú, por qué muchos actores lo idolatraban y estaban dispuestos a cualquier sacrificio. Pues trabajar con él era doloroso, ya que pedía a su cast y crew grandes esfuerzos físicos y emocionales, como puede verse en Fando y Lis, en la que maltrata con fruición a Sergio Kleiner y hace que Silvia Mariscal sea manoseada y reciba los embates cachondos de tres varones lujuriosos, entre ellos Juan José Arreola, quien dejó en un texto prodigioso el relato de su experiencia con Alexandro el Grande, Alexandro el Sabio. De no ser por esta disposición ilimitada que le manifestaban los actores, ¿cómo se explica que David Silva se prestara al ridículo y diera vida al personaje abyecto que interpreta en El topo? Jodorowsky, en este documental y fuera de él, se mueve entre la genialidad y la charlatanería. Su personalidad resulta fascinante e irritante; su enorme ego demandaría una serie de varias horas… y en IMAX. (Con sus películas, por otra parte, me ha pasado algo similar a lo que me sucedió con las novelas de Hermann Hesse – que también gustaba de hilar deslices a la fantasía pretendidamente espirituosa)–: el atractivo y la fascinación que experimenté al leerlo en la juventud se volvió en desencanto al releerlo años después.) Al final Jodorowsky comparte su reacción cuando vio Dune (1984) de David Lynch: conforme avanzaba la proyección, confiesa, se “volvía más feliz, porque la película era terrible”. Más allá de sus comprensibles motivos personales, no hay nada que reprocharle a la apreciación que hace el chileno: en efecto, el Dune de Lynch no es mala, es malísima."
"Nov 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Movie review: ""Dune,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothy Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, John Brokin, Dave Bautista. Screening in theaters and streaming on HBO Max. It’s been several decades since I read “Dune,” the novel that started it all. I’m referring, of course, to the 1965 science-fiction epic that won both a Hugo and a Nebula award. That book introduced us to the sprawling universe dreamed up by Frank Herbert that revolves around the character of Paul Atreides, the desert world of Arrakis and the mysterious spice that is desired by all. And not for the first time do I mourn the passing of my brother Randy, who had read the whole series, including the various prequels and sequels, some written by the author’s son, Brian Herbert. My brother, a serious student of all things “Dune,” could have explained to me everything that director Denis Villeneuve got right, and maybe what he got wrong, in his adaptation of that first novel, which is both playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max. Here’s what I can say: Unlike David Lynch in his utterly bizarre 1984 adaptation, Villeneuve wisely chose not to try to capture the entire novel even in a two-hour-and-35-minute movie. Instead he opts for a “Star Wars”-type cliffhanger. And, while there’s no confirmed release date as yet, “Dune: Part Two” is said to be already in pre-production. So what does that leave us? Well, a film that is sweeping in scope, rich with the kind of computer-graphics that we’ve come to expect and characters that – for the most part – feel fully fleshed out. I say for the most part because at least one character, Baron Harkonnen as played by an almost unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgärd, comes across both as gross and as simplistically evil as Jabba the Hut – again from the “Star Wars” series. Based on a screenplay penned by Villeneuve and two others, Eric Roth (who won an Oscar for writing “Forrest Gump”) and Jon Spaihts, “Dune” is set in a universe controlled by great Houses – basically family dynasties – all having pledged loyalty to the Emperor Shaddam IV. But like most such arrangements – both in fiction and in real life – jealousy, greed and distrust are rampant. At issue is the mélange, or spice, that is found only on Arrakis, a world of shifting sand dunes and peopled by loose-knit but hardy tribes of people called the Fremen. The spice is in demand because it makes interstellar travel possible, giving the House navigators the ability to travel safely through time-space. And – though highly addictive – it can add years to one’s life, besides providing heightened vitality and awareness. “Dune” opens with Duke Leto Atreides (played by Oscar Isaac) given what seems to be a gift from the emperor: exclusive rights to Arrakis’ spice production. These rights have long been owned by House Harkonnen, which has ruled over the desert world with brutal force – provoking an ongoing guerrilla war with the Fremen. Duke Leto knows that the emperor, afraid of House Atreides’ power, is setting him up to fail. But loyalty and pledges being what they are, the duke – the epitome of an honorable man – can’t refuse. He heads to Arrakis fully intent on working with, instead of against, the Fremen. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Leto’s son, Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet), the young scion who has been trained in mystical powers by his mother, Lady Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood. Paul has dreams, which may – or may not – foretell the fate not only of him, not just of his family but of the entire empire … a fate that is tied to Arrakis, to the Fremen and to the spice. I’ve mentioned “Star Wars” more than once here, and by intention. Stories of characters who slowly realize their inner powers, and who end up as chosen people, date back millennia. Today they range from Avengers tales to Harry Potter adventures to, maybe most closely, George Lucas’ Luke Skywalker saga. Blend that with references to real-life history, especially those bearing barely disguised references to Islam and the force of fanatical jihad, and you have this new, improved version of Herbert’s original vision. Or at least half of it.

"Nov 16, 2021",POSITIVE,Constantly captivating and everything from its big moments to its small details feels unique.
"Nov 15, 2021",NEUTRAL," The over-hyped reboot of David Lynch’s 1984 catastrophe gathers the stars of today to revive the desert story. Thanks to the use of modern technology and cinematographer Greig Fraser’s eye for the spectacular views you get an ambitiously stunning piece but for all that comes in between leaves the taste of a bland wet fish. The adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel sees Timothée Chalamet play Paul Atreides, the son of a powerful duke (Oscar Isaac) and Rebecca Ferguson’s Lady Jessica, a member of the Bene Gesserit group. Set on the planet of Arrakis, Paul struggles with the powers he has been blessed with from his mother. With the House of Atreides taken over the governing of the sand dune covered planet that is not only rich in the life-giving and fuel for travelling at the speed of light, spice, it’s also swarming with sandworms and the hostility of the Fremen – the native people of the planet. Enter the bad guy, Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Vladimir, a blob of a being that refuses to give up the very lucrative Spice trade to the Atreides, hence the battle commences. Not only does Paul have a battle for his life on his hands but the constant visions of his future love, Zendaya’s Chani, has him shaken to the core. For all its epic blockbuster dominance with an A-list cast of champions and the crème de la crème of filmmakers at the helm, nothing can snap it away from the fact this is almost a carbon copy of Lynch’s adaptation. It’s nothing but a stretched out, slow-paced, sweepingly stunning venture that induces a dire yawning effect on one’s soul. That writing should really be blatantly on the wall, if Lynch’s version can cover the whole story over approx 3 hours in his director’s cut – it tells you a lot about how much emptiness awaits in Villeneuve’s 2 and a half hour PART 1 of the story. Oh yes, that’s right, this only covers half of the full story. Lacking in an immense amount of detail and the motivations of peoples actions such as an inkling of Lady Jessica’s past, Villeneuve has really missed a trick in building something of substance rather than languishing on the epic journeys of sandworms and aerial shots of the remote desert. With a cast that includes Chalamet, Isaac, Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling, Dave Batista, Jason Momoa and so many more, there is no shortage of a great performance on every level of futuristic optimism. Zendaya only hardly gets a mention, for all the publicity she only appears for the shortest amount of time towards the end of the film. Like with any endless desert, there’s an illusion, a mirage flickering in the distance of what you truly desire the most, but in reality, Villeneuve’s passion project is lacking any emotional connection, depth or sense of any meaningful urgency."
"Nov 14, 2021",POSITIVE," What little I know about the universe of Dune is limited to one read-through of the first Frank Herbert novel long ago and a couple viewings of David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation that is substantially reduced from the novel yet still fascinating and bizarre (as one might expect from the filmmaker). I recognized the heavy influence the story has on Star Wars and countless other science-fiction tales over the decades, as well as the not-so-subtle metaphors that the “spice” industry has to the petroleum business right here on Earth. As adapted by director Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, this new big-screen version of Dune (or Dune: Part I, to be precise) makes a few adjustments in the storytelling, but it seems the goal was to shoot the novel, enhance the story with spectacular, often breath-taking visuals (in addition to the special effects, director of photography Greig Fraser has truly outdone himself), and a cast of quite familiar faces—which is useful to have when attempting to keep track of dozens of characters. Assuming most know the story better than or care about it less than I do, I won’t dive into specifics beyond the existence of a kind of royal family of humans, which includes Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, having a good week between this and The French Dispatch), the only son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson). Lady Jessica is part of a mystic order made up entirely of women, but despite that, she’s been teaching Paul the ways of her kind, including something called “The Voice” (basically co-opted into Jedi mind powers by George Lucas). Still, having this power makes one special, and Paul seems destined for greater things almost from the minute we meet him. He is hounded by disturbing dreams/visions/premonitions about a desert planet and a young woman who is either his salvation or his doom. Whatever this place may be and however dangerous, Paul knows he will end up there eventually. And sure enough, his father is given the responsibility of ruling a desert planet named Arrakis, which yields a product called “the spice,” one of the prized elements in the universe but one that when breathed in unfiltered causes a great deal of harm to those not from Arrakis. Jason Momoa plays Duncan Idaho, warrior, friend and advisor to Paul, who ends up leading the first wave of settlers and soldiers to Arrakis. One gets a sense that most of the Duke’s charges are human, but that Earth is a distant memory; perhaps every character was once human, somehow transformed or evolved with help from the spice. It’s certainly one of many unanswered queries about the world of Dune that probably doesn’t matter, but still makes me curious. Other familiar faces in the mix include Josh Brolin as the Duke’s right hand, Gurney Halleckl; Sharon Duncan-Brewster as the gender-swapped ecologist Dr. Liet Kynes; and Chen Chang as Dr. Wellington Yueh, who plays a bigger role in events than even he would like. Among those representing the Arrakis natives are Dave Bautista’s rebellious Beast Rabban Harkonnen; Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, who seems to represent those who live in caves in the desert (the metaphors never stop); and the woman of Paul’s dreams, Chani (Zendaya), whom we only really meet outside of Paul’s mind briefly, near the end of the film. Seeming to be the architect of a massive attack on the Duke once he arrives on Arrakis is the grotesque Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his obedient sidekick Piter de Vries (Villeneuve regular David Dastmalchian). The list of characters goes on and on, and it’s entirely possible that the sheer volume of exposition and double- and triple-crosses will keep many from finding a clean entry point into this story. But so much about Dune works on a purely aesthetic level, and the performances are all heightened without too much melodrama or pomposity (unless it's explicitly called for). The production design provides an ornate yet lived-in feel to every aspect of the locations, and there are times when I simply wanted to stop the film just so my eyes could slowly move over every inch of the screen. But Dune isn’t all about the spectacle. It’s about the perils of entitlement and tyranny, even with the best of intentions. It’s about internal and cultural rebellion and betrayal. And it’s those elements that personalized the experience of watching this movie for me, added to the sweeping visuals, and made those magnificent sand worms seem so damn threatening. Villeneuve getting to complete his vision for Dune isn’t a given, and it would be a genuine shame if he didn’t get to make his Part 2. This is a sumptuous experience, larger than life yet intimate, unnerving and as much an intellectual achievement as it is a visual one. Did you enjoy this post?

"Nov 13, 2021",POSITIVE,"I can't stress that enough, how good it looks."
"Nov 12, 2021",POSITIVE,"A fascinating world of the future is created in this film, full of visual delights and an intriguing story."
"Nov 11, 2021",NEGATIVE," For years, reading and re-reading a dog-eared paperback copy of “Dune” was a badge of honor for many members of the Hippie generation, especially those prescient men and women utterly dedicated to the environment, boldly unafraid to warn about the dangers of technology, and uncompromisingly curious about the magical properties of certain kinds of mushrooms. These were writer Frank Herbert’s people, and they were followers of him and his 1965 novel “Dune” in a devoted manner that few books have enjoyed. Traditional readers of science fiction – some call “Dune” science fantasy – were also high in their praise of the author’s masterwork. Not even the lackluster 1984 film version written and directed by David Lynch could dissuade them of the importance of “Dune” as one of the greatest science fiction novels ever published; perhaps the greatest for some fans. It’s a plodding movie; a bit of an intellectual mess, but not a complete waste of time. Other filmmakers, including Ridley Scott, had considered doing their own version of Herbert’s book. The director closest to having something concrete to present to financiers was Alejandro Jodorowsky; he being the visionary artist behind the films “El Topo” and “The Holy Mountain.” His project eventually fell apart, one of the reasons being his belief that the only way to make “Dune” properly was as a theatrical presentation that ran at least ten hours and perhaps even fourteen. If you haven’t seen it, the 2013 feature documentary about the fascinating process, titled “Jodorowsky’s Dune,” is a delight. In 2000, a three-part cable television miniseries of the novel, called “Frank Herbert’s Dune,” aired on what was then known as the Sci-Fi Channel. It was later released on DVD. Now we have French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve’s ‘Dune,” which he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth. Villeneuve made the decision to shoot only half of the novel, subtitled Part One, with the hope that if the 156-minute movie was a box office success, Warner Bros. would allow him to film the second half of the book. “Dune” has succeeded in attracting ticket buyers as well as viewers on HBO Max, and Part Two has been approved. It will be released on Oct. 20, 2023 in theaters only. Villeneuve’s “Dune” literally ends with no resolution. For some moviegoers, this will be a deal breaker. Why watch a film that has no ending? I’ll compare it to the popular futuristic “Flash Gordon” serial that played in theaters in 1936. Come back next week to see what happens to Flash and his outer space-traveling friends. People always returned. Regarding “Dune,” you have two years to wait. On its surface, the primary story being told in “Dune” is relatively clear-cut. Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides, the family ruling the oceanic planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of a brutally harsh desert planet called Arrakis. Arrakis is the only source of something known as “spice” (or melange) which is a priceless substance that enhances human vitality and is essential for interstellar travel. It’s a remarkably powerful element. However, Shaddam’s intent is to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor’s troops who are part of a organization that makes decisions and advances armies when necessary. The influence of House Atreides threatens Shaddam's control. Duke Leto has decisions to make, and he sees benefit in allying with the native Arrakis population, the Fremen. Does Part One work on the screen? Yes and no. Villeneuve tells the story deliberately, with a reliance on dialogue that occasionally borders on pontification. Characters talk as if they speaking for posterity. Voice tones are stentorian. It’s Shakespearean without Shakespeare’s flair for language. Speeches drift into being ponderous. For me, it became a matter of “move it along, folks.” The cast, which includes Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, and Stellan Skarsgard is good, but they’re trapped in a deliberate way of talking that becomes arch. Where “Dune” succeeds is in its visuals. Arrakis is bleak, so why not emphasize its bleakness? The planet is covered in sand dunes. Sand blows everywhere. Visibility is filtered through a brown haze. Arrakis looks like what it should. The dark gray space ships resemble large concrete blocks. It’s definitely a form of interstellar travel different from the gleaming objects we’re used to seeing in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Star Trek,” or “Star Wars.” I congratulate Villeneuve for daring to create a stylistic interpretation devoid of vibrant colors. The film’s superb ambient sound is robustly effective. Much of “Dune” revolves around Paul (Timothee Chalamet), who is a young prince of House Atreides and is Herbert’s Messiah figure. Paul’s romance with Chani (actress-singer-dancer Zendaya), a Freman, lacks the necessary emotion that energizes the moviegoing experience. I was wowed by the Bene Gesseret, who are females that can control people with their voice. Give them their own movie. I was also grateful that Jason Momoa brought some life to the screen as Atreides’ swordmaster, Duncan Idaho. Momoa is energetic while everyone else seems overwhelmed by the alleged importance of the project. As for the epic psychology and philosophy that helped fuel the passion for the book, well, those are difficult elements to film. And they were for Villeneuve and his screenwriters. The novel is less about technology and more about protecting the environment. The heart of this “Dune” is art direction and sound production. It looks terrific, but it feels a bit empty, as if Herbert’s bold and invigorating ideas are still, like the movie’s sandworms, lurking in the shadows.

"Nov 11, 2021",NEGATIVE," Civil War imagines a crumbling USA torn apart by militias, a crazed president, and murderous ideological rage. The problem is, director Alex Garland never tells us anything about those ideologies. Because then he might be seen as “taking a side.” There are innumerable cinematic Jesuses, most of them bland, pious, and blue-eyed — until an Italian communist decided to preach the old gospel in a new way. Netflix’s new series Ripley, the latest iteration of Patricia Highsmith’s murderous con man from The Talented Mr Ripley, is an arty, inert snooze. Its flat portrayal of the title character doesn’t come close to the novels or other fantastic adaptations. With a breakneck pace, Dev Patel’s directorial debut, Monkey Man, delivers on its bloody, brutal promise: a John Wick film in Mumbai that attempts to reclaim Hindu mythology for the underclasses of Indian society.  Based on Cixin Liu’s megapopular sci-fi novels, 3 Body Problem is an engrossing spectacle about alien invasion. It’s a welcome 21st-century twist on the old War of the Worlds premise. Showing that rich women in 1969 are “living in a bubble” is like demonstrating that, as ever, water is wet. But even if Palm Royale was meant to deliver messages of great satirical significance, it’s too weak to carry them. Do you ever hear about a new movie like the Road House remake starring Jake Gyllenhaal, assume it’s terrible, mentally prepare your vicious takedown of it — and then watch it? And it’s actually. . . good? Yet another “return to normal” Oscars — briefly disrupted by a statement from Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer criticizing Israel’s assault on Gaza — only demonstrates just how boring even a “good one” can be. Critics love Wim Wenders’s Perfect Days for its depiction of a happy and humble Japanese toilet cleaner. But it’s really a fantasy of escape — one that seems to appeal mostly to the affluent. The new HBO miniseries The Regime imagines the last days of a crumbling modern-day autocracy. The series is obviously intended to draw parallels to our own slowly collapsing empire, with Kate Winslet as a grandly imperious and unstable head of state. The story of Bob Marley’s reggae music and his politically infused Rastafarian beliefs is fascinating. Not that you’ll learn anything about them from watching the new feel-good biopic Bob Marley: One Love. Ethan Coen’s Drive-Away Dolls is a delightfully raucous lesbian road comedy. Don’t listen to the wet-blanket critics — this film is good news in dull times for American movies.  Largely set in occupied France during World War II, the new Apple TV+ series The New Look zeroes in on Christian Dior’s rivalry with Coco Chanel — but it falls flat when it tries to handle Chanel’s infamous Nazi sympathies. Loosely based on the 2005 film, the new Mr. & Mrs. Smith TV reboot uses the action-comedy genre to represent how impossible life is for so many people today, with two misfit unemployables turning to assassin work out of desperation. The second season of Ryan Murphy’s Feud follows Truman Capote’s infamous breakup with the East Coast socialites he called “the Swans,” showing how his charm and talent as a raconteur couldn’t save him from being banished by wealthy elites. Jonathan Glazer’s haunting new film The Zone of Interest follows the life of an Auschwitz commandant in 1943 as his family goes about their business with the horrors of the Holocaust just on the other side of a wall. It’s mesmerizing and unsettling. The “Barbie snub” has kicked off an online kerfuffle about the 2024 Academy Award nominations. The decisions of the Academy are generally cynical and silly — but perhaps we should appreciate the fighting spirit awakened annually by the nominations. The 2023 film American Fiction, starring Best Actor nominee Jeffrey Wright, aims to spark discussion through a darkly comedic portrayal of a long debate about representations of black Americans on film. It’s a worthy directorial debut by Cord Jefferson."
"Nov 6, 2021",POSITIVE," This updated, fresh, fully conceptualized adaptation of Frank Herbert’s bestseller is a swashbuckling futuristic interplanetary epic. Writer/Director Denis Villeneuve finally brings a long pandemic delayed version of a very complicated tale that leaves the audience hanging. Villeneuve puts his big screen talent to great use in stylized costumes and settings on a huge scale. There is a cast of thousands working in difficult locations engaging in thunderous intergalactic CGI battles. There are different kinds of cool futuristic flying machines, some of which look like giant metal flying wasps. John Spaihts and Eric Roth co-wrote the screenplay with Villeneuve. Production Designer, Patrice Vermette, had plenty to work with in this enormous undertaking which we saw at the Chicago International Film Festival. And this is one more Hans Zimmer triumph bringing intensity with pounding drums and loud flourishes to accompany the action sequences.  Paul Atreides, (Timothée Chalamet) is the central character. Born into royalty. Paul learns he was born with a purpose he does not fully realize himself. “A great man doesn’t seek to lead, he is called for it.” And this film is Paul answering the call. But he will have to overcome fear to succeed.  Paul is the son of The Duke Leto Atreides, (Oscar Isaac) the ruler of his planet and Lady Jessica Atreides, (Rebecca Ferguson), his concubine. Paul is being trained by Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) to be a warrior. Gurney is a friend but tough and twice the size of his pupil. Even though Paul appears somewhat frail, Chalamet shows he can handle the fight choreography and pack a punch. Gurney is Paul’s protector. Providing more friendship and protection for Paul and his family is muscle-bound Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), who gets to show off his strength when it’s needed.  Jessica takes Paul to a soothsayer (Charlotte Rampling) who puts him to the test to see if he is the one destined to be their leader. Despite Chalamet’s slight build, he shows great promise in this action role. When he has to display his ability with fight choreography, he acquits himself well.  There is palace intrigue when the Emperor double deals with the huge, weird, grotesque, bloated floating bald villain, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). See our interview with hair, makeup and prosthetic designer, Donald Mowat, who about working on all of the characters. He explained that a special crew took 5 days to put together the Baron’s trappings which had Skarsgard in makeup for 6 hours to prep for his scenes. The Baron is literally the heavy in this film, and especially disgusting when he emerges from an oily tub of goo. Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) plays the Baron’s nephew and chief henchman who gleefully does out pain on his uncle’s enemies.  The Emperor orders the Duke and his family to oversee the mining operation of the melange to bring production of the cinnamon-like spice up to speed. It is the most sought after commodity in the galaxy for survival. Arrakis presented other challenges not only for the cast and crew but for Villeneuve. They shot that part of the film in Jordan. Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (Rogue One, Zero Dark Thirty) had his work cut out for him with the huge vistas, the scale of the buildings and capturing those emotional closeups of the characters along with the hand-to-hand combat. Visual Effects Supervisor, Paul Lambert makes scary the monstrous sand worms that slither and explode through the surface on Dune. The battles are over who will control the spice. The indigenous people who live there are called the Frenem. They just want to live their lives on their land which has been taken away from them. It’s a familiar trope in history as well as in these times. Paul keeps having dreams about one of the Frenem in particular named Chani, (Zendaya). Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is the leader of the Frenem. Being exposed to the spice causes their eyes to glow a royal blue. This was added as a special effect as contacts don’t work well around blowing sand. Paul has to step up as battles between the Baron and his Hakonnen army fight with Atreides. Mother and son have to flee for their lives. Paul (Chalamet) grows in stature as a man and hero. Ferguson has so many elegantly, regal looks in this film. Her face sometimes appears freckled, or clear and fair, and even tattooed in the film. She is passionate in her performance. She as Lady Jessica and Isaac as the Duke are believable as a romantic couple. At one point the Duke even says “I should have married you.” Chalamet proves as an actor that he can play a hero and a heartthrob.  As a stand alone movie, this was a more than adequate space action adventure. With all its characters, this story is so complicated, it might make you think Villeneuve added a little too much spice. There simply is no ending. Zendaya even telegraphs as much at the end. We felt a little cheated after sitting through what amounts to a two and half hour tease for a possible series. So keep your sandals handy. Safe bet you’ll be back in the desert in the future, presumably trudging through Dune 2. "
"Nov 6, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Dune is big, but a big disappointment. The movie just exists to set things up."
"Nov 6, 2021",POSITIVE,"I saw it Tuesday night, and I want to already see it again this weekend. To watch a two-and-a-half-hour movie like that, says something..."
"Nov 6, 2021",POSITIVE," Our deepest apologies for the later than usual dispatch this week. One of us got a little headstart on Halloween celebrations and fell asleep before she filed her review. (*stage whisper* It was Cate!) But thankfully, all is right with the world and we’re right here ready to talk movie to you.  Despite what the rhythm of this newsletter or our professional roles might suggest, we are two people who love to watch a new movie along with the rest of the world. In honor of that, this week we’re bringing you two new releases that piqued our interests enough for us to get these reviews out the door faster than we usually do.  First up: Zosha on her quibbles and kvetching about the aims and achievements of The Last Duel. Then we’ve got Cate on the fantastical world Dune, and its stunning wastelands brought to life.  It is hard to quibble with The Last Duel. I should know, I have been doing it since the second the lights came up on my entirely empty matinee screening (bless. up.). It was a film I expected to be a slog, only to find it surprisingly interesting, and ultimately maybe even a little too self-seeking.  But let’s back up. In case the only thing you know about this movie is either that a) it’s that medieval one with such high-brown names as Jodie Comer, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Adam Driver, and Ridley Scott, or b) it’s two and a half hours long, let me elaborate a little more: The story is told in three chunks, all circulating around Marguerite de Carrouges (Comer) who claims to have been raped by her husband’s former best friend and squire Jacques Le Gris (Driver). Le Gris and Mr. de Carrouges (Damon) had years of bad blood forming between them, culminating in the titular (and real) final judicial duel fought in France in 1386 to “have” “God” “verify” the veracity of Marguerite’s claims.  Each chapter focuses on the experiences of the individuals (we go from Jean Le Carrouges → Le Gris → Marguerite), and Scott clearly delights in letting his actors find new interpretations of their positions around each other. Which one actually publicly swore to bury the hatchet and be friends again? Who actually was well-mannered, or stood to best protect France? It all depends on who you ask.  As The Last Duel folds in more accounts, background, and details, it is immediately clear that the film will at least not be what I was afraid it would be from the trailers — something like a “he said/she said” where even we don’t get to “know” the truth. No, anyone who’s read a feminism can see that the two men were willfully ignorant in their own ways of how Marguerite suffered at their hands, and that her third chapter provides The truth (something the interstitial bolds for you).  I can’t tell you the movie’s not strong. Comer and Driver are great as always; Comer, in particular, finds small ways to modulate her performance that feel all in keeping with one character, rather than refracted through two others. Damon and Affleck play their parts admirably, even if sometimes they seem a bit out of tune with the rest of the movie: Damon is always good when petulant (see 30 Rock, and maybe also his life) and here he is the key of “brutish.” Affleck is more of a fuckboi party guy as a French noble than he ever was as Batman, and while his aloofness is sometimes out of sync with the gravity of the movie as a whole, it’s not unwelcome, and he’s quite good at making what could be a caricature into a human part of the plot.  But somewhere nestled in there is part of the problem with The Last Duel, my problem with it I keep turning over in my head. Pieces that don’t fit together neatly seem intentionally so — for instance, Affleck’s count lives above consequences, in an entirely different movie from the other leading men; a sloppy edit here seems designed to lead into a counterscene down the line — and it’s hard to argue with that. I get it, I do. I just don’t know what it all adds up to when things feel discordant. While I “saw” where the movie was taking me, I really did wonder exactly how the final duel might turn out, given all the plant of the stakes for Marguerite should her husband lose the duel, and ultimately hoped that the final act might surprise me with some twist I couldn’t see coming (even, frankly, if it had to get a bit brutal to do so). It didn’t, ultimately. The Last Duel is so interested in affirming its message that it doesn’t manage to rise above it, at least for those who take the central conceit as truth in our everyday lives. I am reminded of the complaints I had about True Detective: I wanted more than an exploration of misogyny and tired masculine energy. But what if that’s not the story that they wanted to write?  Movies don’t have to surprise me with twists. It’s all well and good if competent story tellers want to tell something that (to me; stay out of my mentions) feels a bit rote and obvious. But I do hope for some challenge, something that doesn’t feel like it’s underscoring a point I hoped our zeitgeist had moved past acknowledging as novel.  For those who feel like seeing a woman’s account of sexual assault told (and, ultimately, believed in its own roundabout way) on the big screen is a win, The Last Duel is certainly smart enough to satisfy. For those who see its game and hope it has something more to say than what it is, here’s hoping this isn’t the final word. In general, epic fantasy is not a genre that I am particularly drawn to. I will watch anything that looks compelling enough, but Dune was a film that I was, for the most part, happy to ignore. It’s not that it didn’t seem like it would be a good film — rather, without knowing anything about the story or the history of the property, I didn’t feel drawn to participate. But it was the featurettes that originally sold me. Hesitant to dedicate 155 minutes to a sprawling story that probably required homework, I watched all eight of the extras available to HBOMax subscribers before diving into the film. What they showed me was a fully realized world that allowed for an immersive fantasy experience. And not just that, but a cast and crew that was truly passionate about bringing the story to screen.  I won’t bother to try to summarize the plot of the movie (Chosen One in space) — the first of a planned two-part installment. But I will say that Dune was worth the time. I went into the story completely cold and was enthralled by the highly visual storytelling and the attention to the details of the world being created. The performances were solid across the board, but it was the cinematography and production design that really sang. Vast landscapes and barren wastelands were rendered beatific under Greig Fraser’s lens. I have never seen sand look so stunning.  The film’s entire universe is sharply industrial, calling to mind stark dystopian futures imagined in the distant past. It sets up its colonial politics quickly and sharply — assigning value to its characters and places – and establishing its moral universe with ease. And it’s hard to discuss Dune without talking about its politics, because as with Game of Thrones it is largely a political drama set in a world different from our own.  The film gestures at a coming holy war from which the “Lisan al Gahib” will save its characters. But while the cast itself is fairly diverse, it is a white character, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) who is central to this myth. The Freman, the indigenous people of the colonized planet Arrakis, are all people of colour who speak a range of languages and are in tune with their world, protecting it from pillage of the spice that is produced there and extracted by off-worlders. It is a true adaptation of the source material, sure. But in 2021, it feels like an egregious oversight. Especially because so many of the best characters are people of colour who die in service of protecting Paul. They are funny, smart, interesting people whose only purpose in the story is to ensure his survival. Compelling as this world remains, it stings. Most of the characters on the movie’s sweeping posters are dead. It’s especially egregious given the ways that the story erases the source material’s intentional coding of the Fremen as inspired by the Muslim world. The original text’s orientalist leaning may have its own problems, but it is clear about its influences. Villneuve’s Dune flattens those influences out into semi-appropriative generalizations. It’s an impulse that makes sense given the tenor of our times, but perhaps might have been better served by leaning further into them and situating them more clearly in history — fleshing them out so that they can more closely comment on both our current time and the time in which the story was written.  So much of Dune is a scaffolding for what we now know will come after. It is an exercise in setting the stakes and prepping the audience for the rest of the story. Under Villneuve’s watchful eye, what comes next is likely to be just as epic as this installment, and will smartly subvert its white savior narrative. But tropes wouldn’t need subverting if they weren’t there in the first place. As beautiful as this movie is, it still falls into some of the same narrative traps that beleaguer Western storytelling about the other. Thankfully, they’ll get the chance to try again. ZOSHA: Fox Weather doesn’t deny climate change, it just denies it. Shaggy paved the way for every slasher stoner. A list about who rises who falls week-to-week in Succession that’s just incredibly precise criticism. On Dune’s white savior and Islamic historical roots. A smart review of a book on body image. Plus me on a podcast talking about an all-timer, Sleeping with Other People. CATE: Dune’s desert problem, and it’s endless world-building, Chucky as a new queer icon actually, the legacy of that iconic pink dress from My Date With The President’s Daughter, the new cast of black girls in teen dramas, reconsidering Ma, the chaos of The Morning Show, and the return of HBO’s Insecure.

"Nov 6, 2021",POSITIVE," If you walk into the movie Dune cold, you may find yourself lost in a hot desert. Based on the first half of the first book in a series covering 19 volumes, Dune takes time to set the stage, and director Denis Villeneuve shows little inclination to speed things along. It proves a good choice for hardened fans but a risk for those accustomed to jumping feet first into action. Longtime fans remember how upon its release in 1965, Dune felt unique with its attention to environmental issues faced by inhabitants of a planet in a galaxy yet to meet the Star Wars dimension. Author Frank Herbert envisioned a barren world with blazing sun, predatory creatures and locals who knew how to recycle their most precious resource: water. They could survive, but not without a fight since their planet also provided a highly desirable and economically necessary substance called “spice.” Herbert granted readers the intelligence to use spice as a metaphor for anything they want. Into this mix comes the outsiders, the colonists ready to follow orders from leaders caught up in a series of power struggles. Classic fantasy traits found in Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and more, these plot elements keep Dune on the list of most-read and must-read science fiction. With all this history behind them, director Villeneuve and his co-writers come to the project with deferential respect, plus the tools and skills to visually create a world that once seemed impossible to show on screen. He brings in a well-chosen cast, with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya highlighting youthful appeal. Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, and Oscar Isaac skillfully add their own big-franchise flourishes from the Marvel and Star Wars universes. Overall, the new Dune 2021 introductory chapter looks gorgeous, but even at two and a half hours, it feels like it’s just taking baby steps with characters. Stopping at a point with neither a cliffhanger nor wrap up of key issues, Dune as a franchise will require many years of patience. Personally, I expect to demonstrate some of that patience. After all, I once named a pet Alia after a Dune character I hope to meet again in the next installment.

"Nov 5, 2021",POSITIVE,"Lavish and almost monochromatic, Denis Villeneuve's film's biggest triumphs are its massive look, its production design, and Hans Zimmer's inventive, intentionally alien-sounding score..."
"Nov 5, 2021",POSITIVE," In yet another remake from the 80s, Dune makes its way back onto the nostalgia train and into the pop culture collective memory. For the record, this is the second film but the fourth adaptation of Frank Herbert’s award-winning novels. This is the second movie remake for director Denis Villeneuve and he does not disappoint as a filmmaker. There is grand and sweeping cinematography mixed in with intimate performances from seasoned actors. Dune had everything it needed out of the gate and gains so much momentum on the strength of its direction. Y’all, it does the original vision justice. Denis Villeneuve holds the line in another sci-fi remake. Listen, he’s got a style, it worked in Blade Runner 2049 and it is even more refined in Dune. Highly contrasted between the extremes of light and dark in each shot. There’s a high level of creativity and intention all throughout the film. It would be easy to just glaze over the undertaking by calling it ‘a love letter’. Nah fam, there were so many obviously deliberate choices and painstaking details that the movie really does just vibrate with the resonance of Villeneuve’s signature style. Casting is loaded but not at all overdrawn. A lot of heavy hitters in this cast. While Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya are top-billed and do the damn thing in their roles, my goodness, everyone else carries this first outing. Everyone understood the assignment. Rebecca Fergusson as Lady Jessica is a complex balance of the affection and ferocity of any and every mother. Charlotte Rampling alone, as the Reverend Mother completely ate every moment of her less than five minutes of screen time. The bruisers of the film – Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, and Dave Bautista provide the edge and gruff to contrast the deeply woven (and intentional) feminine strength that defines the main story arc; but never counteract it. Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, and Javier Bardem bookend the cast as the patriarchs fighting for interplanetary supremacy and survival of their peoples. Each and every character is portrayed in the fullness of their humanity, and the actors leave nothing on the table. Also, shout out to David Dastmalchian for being in everything and being memorable in every role. Denis Villeneuve is a Dune Stan and he is not shy about it. In several interviews and featurettes, he goes in about Herbert’s work being instrumental in his personal development. He went so far as to say he made this movie for himself since there would be no greater critique. In response to that, his interpretation of Dune is visually stunning. It is clear from the first moment that every penny possible went to making sure the visuals were without flaw or failure. The logistics alone required to bring this world to life make this a must-see in cinema history. That said, there are some cultural moments that didn’t sit right with me. For those of you seasoned in the Dune-iverse, quite a few bodies hit the floor in the first part of the book and the original movie. Which is great for getting the story arc off to an explosive start, but literally all of the primary speaking roles for the Black and Brown actors are killed off! When the movie opens it says, “Dune: Part One”, so why oh why can’t these actors have been characters that live? It was so sad to watch the life leave their bodies in such a rich narrative landscape. Quite honestly, it’s a little triggering with all of them but for the one that goes out with some dignity. Another thing, the OG Dune was very much inspired by various cultural influences, most notably language and aesthetics sourced in Arabic. None of that seems as important or revelatory in this interpretation, but this is only the first installment of a series. Hopefully, there are more people in the room to create longer-lasting opportunities for actors of color in this franchise. Suffice to say, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is a phenomenal movie and it demands to be seen."
"Nov 5, 2021",POSITIVE," Aunque el paso del tiempo haya ido retorciendo y añadiendo matices a su significado, si algo se ha mantenido en relación al concepto de “blockbuster” desde que se acuñó a mediados de los 70, ese es el modo en que ciertos sectores del panorama cinéfilo han negado categóricamente que un producto de estas características pueda tener un poso autoral y aspiraciones artísticas que vayan más allá de entretener al gran público. Nada más lejos de la realidad. Con su excepcional ‘Tiburón’, Steven Spielberg abrió paso a un nuevo modelo de cine, convirtiéndose más tarde en el referente del “blockbuster de autor”, que refinó en títulos como ‘A.I. Inteligencia Artificial’ o ‘Minority Report’. Un testigo que, salvando las distancias, ahora blande un Christopher Nolan a quien podríamos catalogar de gran adalid contemporáneo de esta corriente, y como muestra fehaciente de que en la pantalla de un multicine hay cabida para mucho más que entretenimientos vacuos y ruidosos —los cuales, por otro lado, no tienen nada de malo—.  Su enorme versatilidad temática y visual ha hecho de la ciencia-ficción un género especialmente proclive a un tipo de producciones que han encontrado en Denis Villeneuve su último estandarte. Tras su irrupción en el juego con la excepcional ‘La llegada’ y su confirmación en la notable ‘Blade Runner 2049’, el francocanadiense ha dado su gran golpe sobre la mesa con ‘Dune’: una Space Opera reconvertida en arte a través de un espectáculo glorioso, arrollador y épico, de una escala e intensidad que difícilmente vuelvan a replicarse, al menos a corto plazo, en la gran pantalla. Pese a que su difícil digestión no reste ni un ápice de brillantez y genialidad a sus dilatados 155 minutos, ‘Dune’ es un largometraje tremendamente hostil hacia el espectador. Más allá del casi imperceptible lastre de repetir los esquemas dramáticos heredados de las historias arquetípicas de “el elegido” —componente mesiánico incluido—, la vis más autoral de Villeneuve se impone hasta distanciarnos radicalmente de unos protagonistas que, a priori, deberían ser el alma de toda película. Desde el Paul Atreides de Thimothée Chalamet al duque Leto Atreides de Oscar Isaac, pasando por la Lady Jessica de Rebecca Ferguson —todos ellos impecables—, los personajes son tratados sobre el papel y a través de la cámara con una frialdad y un distanciamiento que les priva de casi todo su calor humano, incluso en sus momentos más heroicos y emotivos. En lugar de proyectar su mirada con mayor intensidad sobre ellos, el director opta por centrar buena parte de sus esfuerzos en articular un ejercicio de worldbuilding descomunal que, a pesar de la necesaria síntesis —especialmente notoria en las básicas relaciones entre facciones—, despliega frente al respetable un universo tremendamente rico que confirma que estamos ante una pieza sci-fi más interesada en los conflictos místicos y geopolíticos que en los emocionales. El peculiar y contrastado ritmo de ‘Dune’ tampoco ayuda lo más mínimo a asimilar su contenido. A pesar de sonar antagónico, la cinta se revela contemplativa y frenética al mismo tiempo, cocinando su drama a fuego muy lento pero sucediendo sin pausa escenas cargadas de una intensidad abrumadora. Esto hace que sus dos horas y media pasen sobre ti como una apisonadora, enriquecida por un tratamiento formal que convierte lo que podrían ser flaquezas en rotundas victorias. Sin su cadenciosa narrativa, ‘Dune’ no hubiese sido capaz de alzarse como uno de los despliegues audiovisuales más fascinantes de los últimos años. La maravillosa dirección de fotografía de Greig Fraser y un diseño de producción apabullante tanto en lo que respecta a vestuario y props como en lo referente a sets y localizaciones, están al pleno servicio del Denis Villeneuve más esteta hasta la fecha. El cineasta, manteniendo intacto su código genético, vuelve a hacer gala de un gusto exquisito para la composición y la cinética, y de una habilidad innata para dar forma a los grandes planos generales más impresionantes que podamos llevarnos a la boca actualmente; moldeando pasajes de una belleza arrebatador que deslumbran aún más cuando apuestan por lo onírico. Complementando un diseño de sonido magnífico, envolviendo el conjunto y poniéndole un broche de oro macizo, Hans Zimmer atruena el patio de butacas con la que bien podría ser su mejor banda sonora desde ‘Interstellar’. Incansable, incesante, y proyectada como un mantra que te sume en un estado casi hipnótico, la obra del alemán es la prueba definitiva de que ‘Dune’ no enamora apelando al corazón, sino a lo más primitivo y visceral; atacando sin piedad retinas y tímpanos para dejarte clavado en la butaca, casi sin resuello, pero necesitando más y más. Haciendo honor a la verdad, y pese a mi entusiasmo hacia un largo que no puedo esperar a revisar, es de rigor subrayar la ejecución de unas escenas de acción —concretamente las de combate— impropias de una pieza como esta. Dejando a un lado la ausencia total de contenido explícito, algo sorprendente dada la violencia intrínseca de la trama, la planificación y el montaje de estos fragmentos están faltos de inspiración y se antojan demasiado pobres. Si bien luce lo suficientemente estimulante al usar el fuera de campo mediante recursos como desenfoques o reencuadres, cuando la cámara se sitúa en medio de la acción y decide capturarla sin filtros, esta se muestra tan artificial como ineficaz. La sensación de riesgo y tensión se diluyen por completo, convirtiendo estas set pieces en meros trámites para justificar el destino de ciertos personajes o para hacer avanzar la trama. Esto no sería un mayor problema si no afectase directamente a un apagado tercer acto que condensa su torpe y anticlimático clímax —valga la redundancia— en pocos minutos que no entienden de emoción, y que abren las puertas a una ‘Parte Dos’ presentada sin tratar de maquillar en absoluto su clara naturaleza episódica. Tropiezos de última hora aparte, es innegable que la ‘Dune’ de Denis Villeneuve es una película destinada a polarizar radicalmente la opinión de los espectadores. De no abrazar su propuesta y ser absorbido por su atmósfera, te expulsará de forma casi instantánea convirtiendo su metraje en una tortura. Pero de ser cautivado por sus muchos encantos, será complicado no caer rendido ante una Space Opera gloriosa, capaz de convertir en algo positivo adjetivos como “grandilocuente” o “excesiva”; una maravilla que podría ser la última de su especie en una industria que, cada vez, juega más sobre seguro."
"Nov 4, 2021",POSITIVE,Dune is an exotic thriller taking new and older fans into a world of imagination.
"Nov 4, 2021",POSITIVE,"This is a movie that aimed to essentially wrangle a monumental and deeply intricate work of science-fiction into a popular Hollywood product, with an end result that is perfectly adequate, and safe."
"Nov 4, 2021",NEGATIVE,A must-see for sci-fi fans.
"Nov 4, 2021",POSITIVE,"I really loved Dune. The action set pieces were phenomenal, but the focus was almost always on the characters."
"Nov 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Harkonnens. Messiahs. Deadly, insect-like hunter-seekers. A secretive all-women order of spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians that’s bending history to its will. A spice harvested from an arid desert that enables space travel. ’Thopters. Interstellar war. Giant sand worms.  The world of Dune is a wild one, a tale spun by Frank Herbert in the tumultuous 1960s that mixes fear of authoritarian rule and environmental collapse with fascism, racism, and hallucinatory imagery. The 1965 novel, which eventually garnered widespread acclaim, was followed by a universe of sequels for its rabidly devoted fans. The trappings of its imagined, distant-future world feel wondrous, unfamiliar, and strange.  Or they would, if we hadn’t been steeped in Dune fever for so many years, even prior to the recent arrival of Denis Villeneuve’s extraordinary and resolutely abstruse film adaptation. Even the most Dune-averse person can hardly avoid the long tail of Herbert’s saga, whether they realize it or not.  The story has been referenced by pop stars like Lady Gaga, who made a sly nod to Dune in the “Telephone” music video, and Grimes, whose debut studio album, Geidi Primes, is a concept album based on Dune. Fatboy Slim’s song “Weapon of Choice,” the one with the music video starring Christopher Walken, is one big reference to the book (“Walk without rhythm / It won’t attract the worm”). Video games like Fallout and World of Warcraft contain references to Dune, as do plenty of TV shows from Scooby-Doo to Rick & Morty to SpongeBob SquarePants. There’s a crater on the moon officially named Dune, and some of the features on Saturn’s moon Titan have been named for planets from the series. Then there’s all the original storytelling Dune has inspired. The most notable example, perhaps, is George Lucas’s Star Wars trilogy, which shares so much with Herbert’s series that Herbert and a few colleagues organized the farcical “We’re Too Big to Sue George Lucas Society.” If you’ve watched the Star Wars films, Dune’s reluctant, petulant, fated hero living on a desert planet in the shadow of a looming empire and the battle for the fate of the galaxy will feel a little familiar. This long line of descendants shows the expansive influence of Dune on a wide swath of pop culture. But it doesn’t really explain why it’s so compelling. What is it about Herbert’s books — especially the first one — that exerts such a magnetic force on everyone from 13-year-old sci-fi readers to megafamous musicians? As a Dune newbie (a Dune-bie?) this year, I dug into Herbert’s novel, previous attempts to make a good movie out of it, and the way that people interact with the sprawling world it envisions. What I realized is that there’s no one reason Dune’s fans love the world Herbert created. Its enduring significance traces back to its history as a cultural phenomenon, its difficult-to-adapt story, its capacious complexity, and, perhaps more than anything, the room it leaves for the audience to have an experience all their own.  Dune predates Star Wars by more than a decade. The first installment of Herbert’s story was published in 1963 as a serial, then collected into a novel in 1965. (The version I read this summer was 896 pages long, including a lengthy and limpid appendix.) Herbert went on to write five more novels: Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), and his son and other science fiction writers have continued building out the narrative for eager fans. That’s a lot of Dune. Most people just read the first novel, though; fans sometimes note that the quality drops off precipitously afterward. So that’s the one to know about.  Dune is set in the year 10191, which is actually about 20,000 years into our future; the year is roughly calculated from a time in which humanity overthrew and destroyed all human-made intelligent machines, like robots and computers. Now people live an interstellar existence, without any AI to threaten them, and the extinction of human-made intelligence is so far in the past that it doesn’t come up as more than a distant historical fact for Dune’s characters. It’s as if the Roman Empire fell 10,000 years ago, instead of just under 2,000. The novel begins the epic saga of Paul Atreides, a 15-year-old son of a duke. House Atreides, one of the “great houses” in the Galactic Padishah Empire, has recently been tasked by the Emperor to move from their lush, green home world of Caladan to the desert planet Arrakis. Arrakis is colloquially known as Dune, and most recently overseen by the ruthless House Harkonnen; the Emperor mysteriously ordered Harkonnen to vacate rule of Arrakis, and Atreides is set to take over. Arrakis is a barren and seemingly barely habitable planet, but it’s important for one big reason: It’s the only place to mine a spice called melange (or just “spice”), which among other things makes accurate interstellar travel possible. A fierce people called the Fremen live in the desert there, wearing “stillsuits” that harvest precious body moisture for drinking. They don’t control the spice, however; until recently it’s been harvested by the cruel Harkonnens. Predictably, sending House Atreides to Arrakis in place of Harkonnen doesn’t exactly endear Atreides to the Harkonnens. But the possibility of violence between those houses is all part of the Emperor’s big plan. Meanwhile, there’s Paul. His mother, Jessica, is the longtime mistress of Duke Atreides, and they love one another passionately. But there’s a deeper story here, too: Jessica is one of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient sisterhood of women who pull the strings of history. (This part of the story is incredibly cool.) For thousands of years, they’ve been cultivating the conditions necessary for the rise of the Kwisatz Haderach, a male leader who can bridge space and time with his mind, heal the divide between the Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen, and ascend the Emperor’s throne. Most importantly, he would be under Bene Gesserit control.  The Bene Gesserit’s efforts have involved 10,000 years of careful cross-breeding to create a young man whose genetics will permit him to become the Kwisatz Haderach; they’ve also seeded a belief in a future leader, comparable to a messiah or savior figure, within the ancient religion of the Fremen. As part of this long game, Jessica was supposed to bear the duke a daughter, who could then be bred to a Harkonnen man and produce the Kwisatz Haderach, bridging the enmity between the two houses.  The complicating wrinkle is that Jessica loved the duke, who wasn’t aware of the Bene Gesserit’s plan — and he wanted a son. So she bore him a son instead: Paul. (Among the many powers of the Bene Gesserit is the ability to decide these sorts of things.) From his childhood, Paul learned the ways of the Bene Gesserit from his mother, and Jessica has become convinced he is, in fact, fit to be the Kwisatz Haderach.  When House Atreides moves to Arrakis, palace tumult and betrayal ensues. Jessica and Paul find themselves in the desert outside the palace walls, among the Fremen. It seems the way for Paul’s ascent has been laid. But to truly take the reins of power, he’ll need to harness the power of the Fremen, and that path won’t be easy.  It’s all very exciting and sweeping, at least in plot-summary form. Herbert’s writing is another matter, pretentious and ponderous at times — it’s obvious that Dune was originally published as a serial. But the story, and the mystical web it weaves, has been immensely attractive to readers for decades. The novel has sold more than 20 million copies, and it’s often cited as one of the greatest science fiction books ever written.  Jodorowsky hired incredible artists to come up with frame-by-frame storyboards and concept art, and he had wild plans to change the story in multiple ways, from depicting Duke Atreides as having been castrated to filming a totally different ending from the novel. He had incredible casting ideas, too, envisioning Salvador Dalí as the Emperor (Dalí wanted to be paid $100,000 an hour) and Orson Welles (the director of Citizen Kane) as Baron Harkonnen. Jodorowsky’s teenage son was slated to play Paul. He trained for two years in martial arts and other fighting techniques to prepare for the role. It all came to naught, unsurprisingly. Big studios were not going to make such an expensive, unwieldy, hugely risky film. All that remains of Jodorowsky’s grand plans are several enormous copies of the book of art and storyboards. But in 2013, the documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune told the story of the movie that never was, with Jodorowsky’s full participation, and it weaves a mystical tale all its own. The film is well worth watching, if only to spend some time with a man who went on a Don Quixote-like mission and is still full of passion for his quest decades later. Also unsurprisingly, Hollywood’s desire to capitalize on Dune’s literary popularity didn’t abate. Through some typical industry twists and turns, the film rights landed in the hands of producer Dino de Laurentiis, who tried to figure out what to do with it. Initially he hired Herbert himself to write the screenplay, but the result was far too long. Then Ridley Scott signed on, but he ended up deciding, instead, to make Blade Runner in 1982.  Eventually, David Lynch got a call about the project, and though he had offers to direct other movies — including Return of the Jedi (just imagine!) — Lynch agreed. At the time, Lynch was a young director with a knack for the surreal and bizarre, and he’d made two films: Eraserhead (1977) and The Elephant Man (1980). (Jodorowsky says in the 2013 documentary that he was surprised and even delighted by the hiring news, since Lynch seemed like a good fit for the material.) So Lynch got to work. Dune, the Lynch version, came out in 1984, and starred fresh new face Kyle MacLachlan as Paul. (McLachlan would go on to frequently collaborate with Lynch, most notably on Lynch’s seminal TV show Twin Peaks.) It also stars Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Virginia Madsen, Linda Hunt, Max von Sydow, and Sting, among others, with music by Toto. The movie is ... bad. It’s cumbersome, overloaded with explanation, and not particularly well-acted in many spots. Now a cult classic, it does have certain charms, and isn’t quite as bad as Lynch seems to think it is; he disowned the film upon release, even removing his name from some versions, and hates talking about it. It bombed at the box office and became a bit of a punchline. And other than a workmanlike but forgettable 2000 miniseries on the Sci-Fi Channel, Dune would not be adapted again. It’s also one of those pure cinematic experiences that remind you why you go to the movies. Expertly cast — Oscar Isaac as the Duke Atreides, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, and especially Timothée Chalamet as Paul and Zendaya as Chani, the daughter of a Fremen leader — the film feels like the book come to life, but without some of Herbert’s more ornate and purple prose. Instead of following Lynch’s lead and using voiceover to let us in on his characters’ inner monologues — an important part of the novel — he allows the actors to clue us in via facial expressions and body language. And the imagery is, frankly, quite stunning. With Herbert’s bloated flourishes stripped away, the breathtaking imagination of Dune’s world can come to life. No matter that the characters, with the possible exception of Jessica, are essentially cogs in a machine without much of a rich inner life. Villeneuve knows how to shape that kind of story and fill it with wonder and awe. The film moves slowly at times, and that’s entirely on purpose. Cinema is primarily a visual medium, and Dune provides a terrific opportunity to lean in and experience what that really means.  The long, long, long and storied history of bringing Dune to the screen has, in a sense, been exactly what the film adaptation needed to put some wind in its sails. People have been talking about adapting Dune for so long, or trying and failing, that its legend has grown. Even if you’ve never read Dune, or have no real grasp of what it’s about, you may have considered reading it at some point. The buildup is part of the appeal. And that’s a big part of why some people are so invested in the new film.  But there’s still more to Dune’s allure than just all the pent-up anticipation for a good film. Dune looks like a story about a chosen one, a hero, who will save the world. That’s a common trope in science fiction and fantasy. Of course, as with many stories, it’s a little more complicated than that. Paul, for instance, is not the de facto Kwisatz Haderach; throughout the novel, there’s the distinct feeling that he could turn out to be a dud, and the Bene Gesserit make it clear that they have other candidates in waiting elsewhere. They’ve been hedging their bets. After all, Paul is not a chosen messiah of the universe, at least not by some transcendent deity; he’s the product of a program of eugenics. More importantly, though, Paul succeeding as Kwisatz Haderach will in no way guarantee a rosy future for the universe — a fact of which he is well aware. He can see the future, or the possible future, and talks of seeing people waging a bloody “jihad” (the novel’s terminology) in his name. (Villeneuve’s version opts to call it “holy war.”) Future books chronicle the fallout from his ascent to power, revealing the staggering fact that the “holy war” will take the lives of 61 billion people. Planets are pillaged and sterilized. Whole religions and groups are wiped out, all in service to Paul’s vision for the future of mankind. That’s all very complicated, and has led some to argue that now is, at minimum, an awfully weird time to be adapting a novel with this kind of hero. Add to that Herbert’s characterization of the Fremen — typical of the period, but no less uncomfortable to contemporary ears — in distinctly Orientalist terms, as well as the possibility of interpreting Paul as a “white savior.” Many contemporary fascists and figures of the alt-right (including the prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer) are avowed fans of the book, perhaps seeing it through a distorted lens as a triumphant story about a leader who violently overturns a depraved empire and creates an ethnostate. Meanwhile, plenty of folks on the left love it as well, for entirely different reasons, and sometimes in spite of itself. “Even if we find a real hero (whatever or whoever that may be),” he wrote, “eventually fallible mortals take over the power structure that always comes into being around such a leader.” That all means there are a lot of different ways to think about the book. You can read it as a warning tale about fascism or, if you want, a story about the inevitability of the triumph of fascist ideology in any world. You can read Dune as a screed about the uselessness of religion, or an argument about the incredible usefulness of it. It’s a book about the cost of fixing environmental disasters, and about individual destiny taking precedence over the collective.  So much malleability undoubtedly adds to Dune’s appeal. Science fiction aims to give us ways to confront our own world from another angle; Dune provides that in spades. The idiosyncrasies of its author and its politics leave a lot of room to swim around in. So Dune is still relevant, if you’re willing to slog through some narrative mush. The keenest reason that Dune endures may simply be baked into its structure. The chapters of the novel are introduced with quotations from texts about the history of the world, written by a character to whom we haven’t yet been introduced — and we slowly realize that she, whoever she may be, may be playing an angle of her own. The novels are among the pantheon of science fiction and fantasy novels with a capacious historical imagination, extending way into the future and the past.  And in the world of Dune, the readers (and viewers) themselves kind of exist. Our oft-imagined future — in which the machines take over and we have to fight them — is in the very distant past of Dune’s characters. They give us a way to project ourselves into the future, as a species, and think about what might happen. That’s a common storytelling technique in fantasy and science fiction. Think of how The Lord of the Rings universe hangs on J.R.R. Tolkien’s exquisitely detailed histories of a world that far predates our own. Or how Star Wars takes place  “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” Or how my personal favorite (and another classic work of the genre), Walter Miller’s A Canticle for Leibowitz, mixes past and future in its explosive, apocalyptic tale. (Someone needs to adapt that one into a movie!) Dune, and stories like it, spins a legend that extends far before and after the events of the book, and that makes the reader feel like they’re part of something. In that way, these types of stories are not unlike the sacred texts and oral mythologies that form the basis of religions. Perhaps that explains why they’ve given rise to such rabidly invested fans. Dune is, in some ways, about the dangers and powers of religion, and how it can be manipulated to accomplish dubious ends. But it’s also, in a sense, its own religious text. Who wouldn’t be excited to see that come to life?

"Nov 3, 2021",NEUTRAL,Dune relies on its epic scale to convince you something cool is happening.
"Nov 3, 2021",NEGATIVE," Frank Herbert’s novel Dune from 1965 has long been considered unfilmable, although director Denis Villeneuve seems the natural choice given the grandeur and technical finesse of his films Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and Arrival (2016). Both proved themselves to be the best kinds of sci-fi stories, ones that remind us of what it means to be human. Unfortunately, Villeneuve’s vision for Dune falls short in that regard. Dune centers around House Atreides, which has been assigned to govern the desert planet Arrakis by the Emperor. The amount of exposition often required for sci-fi can be disorienting, and Villeneuve tends to “tell” rather than “show” here, which grows tiresome across the film’s runtime of more than two and a half hours. In a newly written scene, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) explains political machinations and his feelings for his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), even though the actors are skilled enough to convey depth of feeling with a single shared glance. When the Atreides family first arrives on Arrakis, a character informs us that temperatures can reach up to 140 degrees, but something as simple as seeing someone flinch back from burning sands would have been more effective. Instead, we see Paul strolling around outside to have a chat about date palms. Not only is this narrative hand-holding cumbersome, it bogs down the pacing. Rather than a fifth prophetic vision of Chani (Zendaya), that wasted time could have gone to better developing characters. So much of Dune’s story is in their inner worlds, with their subtle maneuvering of each other. However, Villeneuve strips down key scenes from the novel, distilling Dune into a grittier Star Wars. He implies that Paul’s arc is a hero’s journey, complete with almost magic-like abilities, rather than a set of intellectual and diplomatic skills honed by years of training. When Paul flies a thopter and dramatically lets go of the controls—a scene you won’t find in Herbert’s Dune—the move parallels Luke’s when he embraces the Force to destroy the Death Star. Dune’s failure is especially disappointing because greatness hovers just outside of its reach. Awe-inspiring thopters and spaceships add to the film’s fantastic worldbuilding, as does the visual drama that thrives in bombastic scenes such as when House Atreides falls to enemy forces. But Dune is meant to live in the cerebral, intimate moments rather than merely be set pieces for duels, battles, and scenes of shimmering sand. Hans Zimmer’s score is similarly so grand it announces itself, distracting more than supporting the story. Conversely, the cinematography could do more. Director of photography Greig Fraser, in his first collaboration with Villeneuve, washes out the colors, making for bland grays and desert landscapes that are too neutral or tinted too monochromatically yellow. You can’t help but wonder what this would have looked like in Roger Deakins’ hands, after his spectacular, haunting desert visuals from Blade Runner 2049. You also can’t help but wonder if Villeneuve played it safe with Dune, after calling attention to the financial failure of Blade Runner 2049. Dune might be more commercially viable, with all of its explanatory spoon-feeding and extra explosions, but it makes for far less compelling cinema. Rebecca Ferguson is simply phenomenal as Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother and Duke Leto’s consort. Her face conveys the complexity of her inner world, so it’s a shame her character isn’t given more to do in the film. Although fully capable with her own set of abilities, she mostly stands witness to or as a support for her son’s messianic rise. She has created him and who he will become in more ways than one, but ultimately, she’s helpless to direct (or stop) it. She also interacts very little with other women, other than to argue with the Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) about how she bore a son instead of a daughter, or when hiring a housekeeper in Arrakis. Because the film cuts out most of the political intrigue of the novel, we get much less of Jessica’s cleverness or explanation of her Bene Gesserit heritage, although more on that later. Sharon Duncan-Brewster is welcome as Dr. Liet Kynes, gender-bent from the novel. Kynes stands as a part of two worlds, a bridge between cultures. Although she represents such an interesting conflict in the novel as a half-Fremen who has “gone native,” that’s barely hinted at in the film. Like most of Villeneuve’s characters, it’s hard to get a handle on her as a person, although she appears to have more agency than Jessica.  Zendaya’s Chani hints at interiority, but isn’t given much to do other than pose in Paul’s prophetic visions, evoking a perfume ad or a scene out of a Malick montage. While it’s true that she barely appears in the book during this first section, it remains disappointing, given that Chani could also offer depth to the plight and lives of the Fremen desert people of Arrakis. She does so minimally at the beginning before disappearing for most of the film.  Although Villeneuve has long defended Dune from the criticism that it perpetuates the White Savior trope, his directing choices speak louder than words. Yes, people of color have been cast in several roles—including those in Duke Leto’s immediate employ—but the foot soldiers of House Atreides seem to be almost entirely white, as are the film’s saviors of Paul and Lady Jessica. Nothing in the book would indicate this, and it would be easy to diversify, so how is this not a textbook example of white saviorism? Furthermore, given that Herbert was influenced by the Indigenous people of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) when writing the Fremen, it’s baffling that he excludes MENA actors from its ranks. Instead, Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, portrays one of the only speaking Fremen roles. In addition to questionable casting, Villeneuve flattens the existing depth of the novel which heavily features overt Muslim references. Not often does source material from the 1960s feel more progressive than its modern adaptation, but Villeneuve’s Dune proves it can happen. Writer Roxana Hadadi points out how Herbert’s “meticulously researched and vividly imagined depictions of MENA people” fail to make it to the screen, and also missing is the way Herbert castigates Paul’s role as a messiah and critiques how the “Western Man” inflicts himself upon the environment. The Fremen were originally written to be a technologically and socially sophisticated society, whereas Villeneuve’s Fremen are closer to what we might see in Lawrence of Arabia (1962), complete with ululating women and inconsistent accents. I would argue that Paul’s rise in the books is only possible because of the Bene Gesserit indoctrination, which has manipulated the religion of the Fremen for generations to prepare the way for their own Chosen One. However, Villeneuve lessens the impact of the Bene Gesserit’s influence in the film, and it’s unclear that they have had a hand in paving the way for Paul. This not only takes away the strength of the Bene Gesserit, which is a powerful all-women organization that deserves more screen time, but also paints the Fremen as more easily manipulated by a messianic figure. Perhaps most galling to watch is the way the film’s characters of color lack complexity and sacrifice themselves so that white heroes can live. In the “turning point” of the novel, Kynes dies from an explosion of sand and spice in the desert, just as he realizes that “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.” However, in a complete 180-degree turn, Kynes willingly gives her life so that “the Hero”—Paul—can go free.  Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa)’s death is similarly tweaked. Whereas Herbert had written the character to be already injured, Paul closing the door behind them while Idaho fights on, Villeneuve’s version sees Idaho shutting the door himself as Paul, absolved of any guilt, sobs on the other side. Finally, Doctor Yueh (Chang Chen)’s part has been so reduced, he’s barely in the movie at all. In the novel, he’s a nuanced tragic figure with a detailed history and meaningful relationships with the Atreides family, which makes his betrayal all the more impactful. In the film, no one appears to bat an eye when he brings the house down. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) falls into the trope of being an imposingly large and fat villain. Some inoffensive techniques are used to highlight his grotesqueness, such as a squelching mud bath or his gleeful bloodthirst. But the film wanders into fatphobia in other moments, inciting disgust in the viewer by showing Harkonnen eating a lavish meal (complete with chewing noises) or when the camera lingers on his neck rolls and protruding stomach. Meanwhile, every other character in Dune is either fighting fit or thin as a rail. Film adaptations of beloved books ask two questions: Does it succeed as a faithful translation of the story to screen, and does it succeed as a film on its own? Unfortunately, Villeneuve’s film does neither for me. Given his artistic and narrative choices, it comes off altogether more regressive than Herbert’s novel from sixty years ago, lacking the nuance and social commentary that could have been elevated by a modern and visual discourse."
"Nov 2, 2021",POSITIVE,"It has been many years since I read the first Dune book, but it seems to me that this movie captures the spirit of that haunting, powerful book. Perhaps the movie is popular for the same reason the book is popular."
"Nov 2, 2021",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve‘s highly anticipated film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel “Dune” gives the impression that it is crafted with two major goals in mind: to please diehard fanboys and sci-fi loving critics (in that order). The end result is a visually dazzling spectacle, a true feast for the eyes that will satisfy (if not excite) anyone who loves cinema. Look, I’m not the audience for this, and I didn’t really enjoy it. But I sure as hell respect it. The plot is confusing, especially to those unfamiliar with the source material. There is a lot to take in, and it’s not an easy story to follow. Thankfully the film is so visually dazzling, because Greig Fraser‘s impressive cinematography is engrossing even when the rest of the movie is not. The first hour is an arduous undertaking, with lots of confusing plot exposition and needlessly slow pacing (the material is stretched thin so there will be plenty of story left for a sequel). The story is bleak, and the film is full of disturbing images. The whole thing is really weird in a way that may make it difficult to cross over into mainstream audiences, especially with folks who don’t enjoy science fiction. Even the costumes (which are a knockout; major applause for designers Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan) have a nightmarish quality that could prove challenging for some. Chalamet is terrific as Paul. He’s a very skilled actor, but doesn’t yet feel like a true leading man who can carry an entire big budget movie on his shoulders. He’s getting there, but his performance benefits from the supporting cast.  You are so awesome! I don’t believe I’ve truly read something like that before. So good to discover another person with some unique thoughts on this subject. Seriously.. many thanks for starting this up. This site is one thing that’s needed on the web, someone with a little originality! You made some good points there. I checked on the web for additional information about the issue and found most individuals will go along with your views on this site."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"It's visionary and futuristic, and it's the kind of classic Hollywood epic that doesn't get made very much anymore: with enormous sets, over 2,000 costumes, deft juggling of many characters-their motivations, secrets and ideals."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve — the properly acclaimed director of films including “Sicario,” “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049” — read the book as a teen and says he was struck by what Herbert had to say about nature and colonialism. Now Villeneuve, who has a gift for moody-and-entrancing filmmaking, has delivered an adaptation of “Dune” that is both visually arresting and a feast for the ears. Unfortunately, its story — about a war for a resource-rich planet and the beginning of a journey of a young man who may bring great change to the galaxy — falls short of being engrossing. You never become consumed with the trials and triumphs of its characters as you do with its sights and sounds. The world-building for which Herbert is praised comes to life nicely, but, more than five decades after the novel’s release, some of his story elements seem a little silly. That said, Villeneuve’s “Dune” is a huge improvement over the 1984 adaptation by the often brilliant David Lynch. Hey, if you think the new “Dune” is burying you with exposition in its first few minutes, take time to revisit Lynch’s borderline-unwatchable affair. And to be fair, there are enough moving pieces in “Dune” that it’s a tough one to boil down to its essence. However, we’ll give it the old space-academy try. Set about 8,000 years in the future, the tale revolves around the sand-covered, oppressively hot planet Arrakis, which is known as Dune by its indigenous human, the Fremen. Arrakis is rich in a resource called Spice, a mind-expanding substance that, most importantly, allows those piloting spaceships to navigate through the stars. And oh by the way, extracting the spice is no easy task because the sands of Arrakis are home to giant worms interested in consuming both man and machine. The galaxy-ruling Imperium had allowed the machiavellian House Harkonnen of the planet Giedi Prime — led by the duplicitous and manipulative Baron Vladimir (an almost unrecognizably grotesque and vile-sounding Stellan Skarsgård) — to run the profitable spice-mining operation for a long time. Recently, though, an unseen emperor has booted off the Harkonnens and awarded stewardship of the planet to the kinder and gentler House Atreides of the planet Caladan. House Atreides is led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac of the “Star Wars” sequel trilogy), whose son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), is in line to become ruler of his people one day. That’s a destiny Paul believes may not be right for him — a feeling compounded by visions he’s having of a young Fremen woman whom he eventually will come to know as Chani (Zendaya, “Spider-Man: Far From Home”). Meanwhile, Paul’s unwed mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) — a warrior priestess and a member of the mysterious Sisterhood known as the Bene Gesserit — believes her son may face a different but still hugely important destiny. Penned by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts and Oscar winner Eric Roth (“Forrest Gump”), this adaptation covers only roughly the first half of the book, with Villeneuve reportedly hoping to make a trilogy of films, with the second movie covering the second half of “Dune” and a third being an adaptation of Herbert’s first sequel, 1969’s “Dune Messiah.” And yet there are at least four other key characters to follow in this first chapter: Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, “Avengers: Infinity War”), the duke’s warmaster and the man responsible for training the sometimes disinterested Paul; Atreides Swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, “Aquaman”), who arrives on Arrakis in advance of the rest of the clan to try to establish relations with the Fremen; Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista, “Guardians of the Galaxy”), the Baron’s imposing enforcer; and key Fremen figure Stilgar (Javier Bardem, “No Country for Old Men”), who seeks to ensure environmental protection for his people for generations to come. While only Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,” “Little Women”) and Ferguson (“Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep,” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”) get a meaningful amount of screen time and no actor dazzles, “Dune” is a star-packed affair. No doubt Warner Bros. Pictures — which is releasing it this week both in theaters and on streaming platform HBO Max — is hoping that entices folks unfamiliar with the saga to take this galactic plunge. However, and even with all the incredible work by the behind-the-scenes artists including cinematographer Greig Fraser (“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”), visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert (“Blade Runner 2049”) and supervising sound editors Mark Mangini and Theo Green — both of them also “Blade Runner 2049” alums — this film feels designed for those who’ve wanted to see a better “Dune” come to life on the screen. Villeneuve may have been wise to pump up the action more than he has. Sure, we see Duncan take on scores of Harkonnen thugs early in the affair, and Paul engages in an individual fight to the death in its firnal stretch. Obviously, though, turning “Dune” into, say, “Star Wars” clearly isn’t something that interested him. And while it isn’t the finest work he has offered this world, we hope he is able to complete his vision for Herbert’s beloved saga."
"Nov 1, 2021",NEGATIVE," Paul can’t sleep. Due to a wicked combination of terrifying nightmares and enlightening visions, his nights are distorted; a young man destined for high purpose (leader of galaxies?) who isn’t exactly ready for what is about to come. I don’t think the casual moviegoer is ready for Denis Villenueve’s “Dune,” an epic science fiction drama opus that seemingly drags us through the bombastic sand for over two and a half hours without any real conclusion. While everyone should go into this film understanding it’s only “Part One,” a better payoff after such a long journey would have pushed this cocktail down smoother. Alas, we are left with Timothee Chalamet’s highly uninteresting Paul, another young hero-to-be who spends 98% of the movie trying to find out if he really is “the one.” When his powerful father (Oscar Isaac) acquires a planet for the galaxy’s most sought-after resource known as spice, it attracts the attention of other forces and thus launches a war. Spice, the drug that can extend life and gives humans other special powers, is the very thing that should have been left inside Pandora’s box. At least for poor young fellas like Paul, who can fight well even if he doesn’t know all there is about his mother (Rebecca Ferguson, pumping oil into an underwritten part). There’s also an evil empire run by Stellan Skarsgard’s monstrous world-ender named Baron, who dispatches heavy hitters like Dave Bautista’s Beast Rabban to destroy entire colonies of people. Javier Bardem and Sharon Duncan-Brewster have vital roles that unfold slowly, while Jason Momoa gets to do his hero-legend best as Duncan Idado, the mentor to Chalamet’s Paul. Josh Brolin has a role that seems to be something early on before basically disappearing. Chalamet is a talented Jewish-American actor — something shown in “Beautiful Boy” and “Little Women” — but he can’t breathe much life into this particular hero role, often looking overwhelmed by the scope of the film and reacting instead of creating something with his performance. It’s akin to John David Washington’s work in Christopher Nolan’s misguided “Tenet,” a large-scale film with a thinly written lead part, resulting in an actor looking lost at sea rather than comfortable in the character’s skin. It’s this listless performance that keeps the film detached from casual moviegoers, who are the ones that hope to give Villenueve’s film some legs as the holiday season approaches. To say a lot is going on in “Dune” is an understatement. It’s exhausting just to fully describe the plot alone. While its pacing is uneven and the editing less than stellar, it puts a lot on the plate for the moviegoer to take in. It does look very nice. If anything, it’s endlessly dazzling to the eye, creating otherworldly visuals that blend the exotic with the wicked. The sound from Hans Zimmer kicks off the walls in the first hour and really clicks into the Villenueve’s overall aesthetic. But eventually, you want all of this loud purpose to become something, and it never does. By the end of the film, however, I wanted more–but not exactly how you think. I needed even more time with these characters to decide if I should care about their fate moving forward. One wouldn’t call that a good thing with such a blockbuster-type swing. What was served ultimately isn’t interesting enough to care about, especially for a story that is so incomplete. For over two hours, we are led down this derivative rabbit hole thinking something ultimate is going to happen at the end. But all we get is a lame fight that tells us nothing we didn’t already know about the characters. The only character in “Dune” that ever clings to any sort of real life is Momoa’s Idaho. When he’s onscreen, the entertainment factor hits a high note and a character that is so easy to invest in soaks up our eyes and attention spans. But it’s not Duncan’s movie, and Paul isn’t nearly as interesting. He’s just a lost boy in search of purpose and an elusive woman from his dreams (Zendaya, who seems to be shooting a perfume ad on Mars). In the end, Villenueve’s film comes off as an overstuffed concoction of “The Matrix” with heavy riffs from “Blade Runner: 2049” and “Game of Thrones” as well. While that may sound like a lovely cinematic T-bone steak in the playbook, the movie doesn’t exactly stick the landing–hindering its ability to come off as complete as those previously mentioned pieces of work. With so much going on and little of it intriguing the non-book novice mind, the movie never amounts to much more than a museum of sexy imagery. Gorgeous actors with thinly written roles and a plot that is too familiar. While it can be a copout to write that a movie would have made a better television series, “Dune” fits the criteria to a tee. Perhaps the story, and its confused-looking hero, could have burrowed their way into my senses with more screen time. Warner Brothers has spoken of a sequel, but nothing is guaranteed at this point. There’s a chance this one movie is all audiences could get, and the ending won’t please that many souls. It just won’t."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune is a singular experience. It’s not a remake of David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation, but it does have some love for that magnificent failure. And it’s not drawing anything from Alejandro Jodorowsky’s planned but never filmed adaption, but it also has some love for that magnificent acid trip, that bewilderingly could-have-been. And it is pretty much ignoring the 2000 TV series that I completely forgot existed until recently. That thing was bad. Like, made it through 12 minutes and scrubbed it from my brain with steel wool bad. Anyway. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. This adaptation isn’t a full adaptation, it’s more of an adaptation of the first half of the novel. And this really is the only way to adapt that giant novel. Split it up into separate films, more space and time to tell the story. Hopefully we get the second film. This film has a satisfyingly ending but it leaves us wanting more, needing more. It ends at a good spot, but it aches for the lack of closure. Dune, at its most stripped down and over-simplified, is the story of teenage Paul Atreides, the heir of House Atreides, possible Messiah and maybe the culmination of centuries of genetic manipulation. I was going to go farther down the rabbit hole and had actually written out a pretty sweet synopsis but then I realized part of the joy of something like Dune is jumping in feet first and letting the experience happen. And for those people that have never read the novel or watched any of the adaptations and are going in with a near awareness of anything Dune, I envy you. The world building in Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is near perfection. And it’s been a long time since I’ve seen world building done this well with minimal exposition. Lord of the Rings had a bigger upfront exposition dump than Dune. The Dune universe feels new and exciting but also familiar. The source material has influenced so much of what came after that it could run the risk of feeling derivative. Dune’s fingerprints can be found on movies as varied as Beetlejuice and Star Wars and Alien. But, somehow, against all odds, after 56 years of influence and more homages than I’m going to count, Mr. Villeneuve and his team have made something that feels wholly original. This is the first movie that I’ve seen that actually makes the desert feel like an ocean of sand. Everyone, going as far back as Lawrence of Arabia, has tried and some have come close, but no-one has ever made a desert feel like Dune does. The sandworms don’t just disturb the sand where they move, they leave wakes. When they dive back down, the sand moves like water, it splashes and moves almost like a liquid. The shots of the sand, of the never-ending dunes, are like something rarely seen in blockbusters. Dune is something rarely seen anymore – it’s an epic. Like, a true epic. The scope, the scale, it’s like something from another time. Characters are dwarfed by their environments. Even in smaller rooms, they still feel, well, small. Isolated. And Dune is an extraordinarily beautiful movie. Like, gasping for breath, tears at the corners of the eyes beautiful. I don’t have the words to convey how beautiful this movie is. The shades of the sand, the white heat of the sun, the reds of blood, the colours of skin, everything is tangible and beautiful and awe-inspiring. And then there’s the performances. Oh, my. Every single performance, from above the title to background extra, every single performance is perfection. It must say something about Mr. Villeneuve’s directing style that Dune can look like it does and still have these jaw-droppingly good performances. Also, the film may be about Paul Atreides, and Timothée Chalamet is all kinds of awesome, but the heart of the film lies with Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson. Her powerless grief and her determination and her love for her family is so heartbreakingly real. So, is Dune worth seeing in a theatre? Yes. A million times yes. The sounds, the visuals, the performances, the Hans Zimmer score, everything about Dune is darned near perfection. And it truly never feels like it’s 2 and a half hours long. It’s a testament to its pacing that I feel like most of the audience I saw it with didn’t want it to be over. They wanted Dune: Part 2 now and would have gladly sat there for the end of the story."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE,"I Thinks Arribal and Blade Runner 2029 are one step above, but still Dune is definitively up to the challenge, the only thing left to do is wait and see if Part 2 can enhance all the elements developed so far and give a satisfying closure to the story."
"Nov 1, 2021",POSITIVE," While David Lynch stuffed Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel into 137 compromised minutes, Denis Villeneuve takes his time telling the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) fulfilling his destiny on the spice-mining planet Arrakis…and takes his time some more. But while this and arguably any faithful adaptation of Dune inherently lacks the action-packed pacing of a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings film, it one-ups those sagas in the special effects department, particularly with slick, borderline photo-real spaceships and aircraft that rank above the best such work since, well, Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049. Lensed by the great cinematographer Greig Fraser (Killing Them Softly; Rogue One), the stunning production design by Patrice Vermette (who’s worked on every English-language Villeneuve film except Blade Runner 2049) shines to its fullest potential, bringing life on Arrakis and a handful of other planets to vivid life. But Dune is more than just drool-worthy imagery. The diverse ensemble is expertly cast, from Chalamet’s kind-hearted, cooly confident yet inexperienced Paul, to Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac as his noble but vulnerable parents, Lady Jessica and Lord Leto Atreides. Elsewhere, supporting players both good — House Atreides military leaders Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) — and evil — bitter Atreides rivals Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a convincingly gluttonous Stellan Skarsgård) and his psychopath nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) — so thoroughly exude their respective qualities that they couldn’t possibly be confused for the other side. And while Javier Bardem and Zendaya make decent impressions with minimal screen time, their indigenous Fremen are destined to have a significantly expanded role in Part Two. On the storytelling front, the expanded approach allows the script by Villeneuve, Eric Roth (The Insider; Forrest Gump), and Jon Spaihts (Prometheus; Doctor Strange) to ably build out this complex universe, set up House Atreides’ betrayal at the hands of the Emperor, and establish Paul’s messianic potential. They’re also careful to ladle in a few helpful summary lines of dialogue along the way, which prove extra beneficial amidst an unbalanced sound mix that muffles numerous utterings sure to confuse viewers unfamiliar with the source material or Lynch’s film. Speaking of the 1984 version, it’s only so beneficial to compare it with Villeneuve’s film, though several differences, especially at the beginning, are intriguing decisions and it’s nice of ol’ Hans Zimmer to pay tribute to Toto’s heroic “Main Title” theme on a particularly epic desert shot near the film’s end. Still, this Dune is very much half of the story, concluding with certain major players just introduced or yet to appear, and Villeneuve noticeably laboring to figuring out where to divide the chapters. Quentin Tarantino didn’t have that issue with Kill Bill: Volume 1, but Dune is a different beast with distinct ambitions. As such, it’s almost unfair to review it as a standalone work, but as the introduction to a larger project, it sets the stage well and gets far more right than wrong."
"Oct 31, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune is awkwardly paced and has the problem of very much feeling like half of a movie, but everything else on screen is so good that it's worth sitting through the exposition because you get to spend more time in this world. Director: Denis Villeneuve
Summary: Feature adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. The problem with adapting something like Dune for the big-screen, again, now is that Dune is baked into the DNA of so many things. This book has inspired almost all of science fiction since it came out, so making it feel original was always going to be the biggest hurdle. How do you make the foundation of science-fiction feel original when everyone else has been building off of it for decades? This is the problem that Enders Game ran into when it got its big-screen adaptation, and it's a problem that seems to linger over Dune in the present day as well. There will be book fans that are just waiting for someone to make a comparison to Star Wars so they can scream about the book coming out first, but the movie is here now, and the comparisons are undeniable. The book Dune inspired the movie Star Wars and the movie Star Wars clearly influenced the movie Dune. All of these things are so tangled up that it's almost impossible to let Dune stand on its own. It's a massive book, and the movie has to dedicate a large portion of its runtime to worldbuilding. This is going to be the moment where some people are going to really say that where Dune stumbles is in how much of the beginning of the movie is really dedicated to setting up the world, the conflicts, the various political alliances, and petty squabbles. If that sort of thing isn't your jam, then you might have a problem with this movie. However, Game of Thrones did prove that you can do slow-moving political intrigue and grab a dedicated audience. Still, Game of Thrones also proved that sticking the landing is extremely important. Unfortunately, for Dune, we can't really judge whether this movie will stick the landing. It's half a story that only feels like it's just getting started by the time the credits roll. It does mean that director Denis Villeneuve can go buck wild in part two, but that also means that part two needs to actually happen. There really isn't a good stopping point in Dune like in Lord of the Rings, which is going to be a common comparison. There isn't a normal three-act structure here, and that might lose a lot of people, but if you're on the wavelength that Dune is putting down, you're going to be very into it. Villeneuve is one of the best directors working right now, and one of the things that he is the best at is truly making beautiful movies. Him and cinematographer Greig Fraser [Vice, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Zero Dark Thiry, The Batman] make the rolling sands of Arrakis beautiful in a way that we haven't seen in a long time. He manages to make the rocky mountains of Caladan, his home planet, feel lived in and welcoming while Arrakis feels desolate because it is a place where the sun can kill you. These worlds, combined with the music by Hans Zimmer doing some of the best work he has done in years, really make everything feel big, beautiful, and epic. This is a massive movie with a lot going on and a lot of ground to cover, and it very much feels like it. The cast is here doing great work on all fronts. There really isn't a single weak member of the entire cast. A couple of people feel underutilized, but that is either a story thing that couldn't be avoided, or they are going to get a lot more screen time in part two should it happen. Paul is not the most likable main character in literature, and for a good reason, Timothée Chalamet does the best he absolutely can with a role that isn't easy. Rebecca Ferguson just needs to be in all of the movies for the rest of forever because she is the best thing in every film she's in. This is probably the most screen presence that Jason Momoa has had besides the early Game of Thrones episodes. Maybe the role is just suited to him; maybe there's more to him than what we've seen in his performances so far; it's hard to tell. Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, and David Dastmalchian make for some excellent villains that we will continue to see more of in the next movie. However, the Fremen really gets the shortest end of the stick when it comes to screen time. Despite the movie very much playing up Zendaya's presence, and she does appear in a fair amount of dream sequences, we don't spend a lot of time with her in this movie. So if you're going in expecting to learn about her or any of the other Fremen, then you really need to wait for the sequel. The only exception is Sharon Duncan-Brewster, who does get a fair amount of screentime. The character she is playing, Liet Kynes, is actually gender-swapped from the original novel. You can feel her conflict with being one of the links between the Fremen and House Atreides once they land on Arrakis. The giant sandworms, which have been hard to show on screen in the past with technology limitations, are not shied away from here. We see the worms in all of their glory, and they are terrifying and amazing. However, while all of this good and some questionable stuff does exist, the real test of whether or not Dune will work is going to be whether they stick the landing in the sequel. That final question will hang over this entire movie, and if it doesn't get greenlit, history will not be kind to this movie. Villeneuve seems confident that it will happen, but we still don't know one way or another until final box office numbers roll in. Dune makes some baffling decisions when it comes to its pacing and the amount of exposition, but once the movie gets going, it is spectacular to watch. Fingers crossed that we're going to get a part two."
"Oct 31, 2021",NEUTRAL," There has been a heated debate raging throughout the halls of Twitter - yes, which is not real life - about the ""right"" way to watch Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune."" The movie, which is distributed by Warner Bros., is a part of the studio's day-and-date deal with HBO Max, where their entire 2021 slate would premiere on the streaming service the day it goes to theaters. This raised a lot of eyebrows and some warranted concern about the future of movie theaters, but when the deal was made life was much more uncertain than it is now (and some days, it still feels pretty uncertain). Though movie theaters are hallowed grounds, sometimes convenience and peace of mind will have to win out, which is where the HBO Max option comes into play (Warner Bros. has already committed to a theatrical window first for 2022 and streaming thereafter). Objectively speaking, ""Dune"" is best suited for movie theaters, but where you watch it won't change your ultimate thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote on the movie. It might enhance a movie you leave loving, sure, but at the end of the day, a story has to win above all. TimothÃ©e Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson). They are in charge of overseeing the production and protection of the ""spice,"" which is harvested on Arrakis. But, ""Dune"" isn't just about the all-important spice. It's about politics and takeovers and about Paul being taken seriously and not looked down upon as some young kid. But, again, none of the plot seems to be important to anyone. Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling and Dave Bautista round out the all-star cast. Chalamet shot to worldwide fame with ""Call Me by Your Name,"" the 2017 romantic drama, which earned him an Oscar nomination. His performance was staggeringly good, showing a depth seasoned actors should envy. He hasn't stopped working since, appearing in ""Beautiful Boy,"" ""The King,"" and ""Little Women,"" but ""Dune"" is his first attempt to ascend to a blockbuster movie star. Chalamet is a good actor, who has earned all the comparisons to James Dean or Leonardo DiCaprio, but Paul isn't as interesting of a character as Chalamet has played. Moments of Paul's struggle give Chalamet time to emote, but the character feels like a bit of a blank slate. Some who love this story will be invested in the characters and their journey, but ""Dune"" will start and stop at the technical scale for most. In that sense, ""Dune"" is a major success, using the wide-open space of Arrakis to draw us in and live in the world. It's hard to not find yourself lost in the vistas Villeneuve has created, but the movie's downtime is often a reminder of the lacking story. The movie doesn't quite sink to the level of empty spectacle, but if the narrative had more of a pulse, ""Dune"" could have been something special. ""Dune"" was made with the hope there would be a second (it's not a spoiler to say the movie is open-ended. Villeneuve has made it abundantly clear it hopes to make a second part). If the movie is successful by the various metrics used today to measure success, the story will be continued. If plans for part two fizzle out, then ""Dune"" was a big, expensive and presumptuous piece of expository filmmaking."
"Oct 30, 2021",NEUTRAL,"The art design and cinematography are beautiful, but the lack of characters to care about or a clear storyline result in a plodding film that it is all too easy to tune out. And Zendaya, though promised in the trailer, is barely in the film."

"Oct 30, 2021",POSITIVE,"&#8203;&#8203;Big screen entertainment is back with a bang. Dune is the reason why we fall in love with the movies. This sci-fi extravaganza with deep human connect, deserves an IMAX viewing."
"Oct 30, 2021",POSITIVE," Hey, at least this spectacular, fervidly anticipated adaptation of Frank Herbert's densely packed 1965 science-fiction novel “Dune” fares better than David Lynch's abortive 1984 version, an exposition-laden project so impenetrable and confusing that Mount Prospect's Randhurst Theaters printed up special cheat-sheets to help patrons understand the plot and characters. No need for that with Denis Villeneuve's more inventive and less incoherent movie that die-hard fans deserve to experience on the big silver screen, not on HBO Max. Where Lynch crammed the entirety of Herbert's book into a 137-minute yawn-fest, Villeneuve has smartly opted to follow Peter Jackson's “Lord of the Rings” adaptation by presenting “Dune” in two parts, with a possible third film hinging on the success of its predecessors. So, Part 1 becomes a 155-minute first act that constructs fascinating alien worlds where flying machines with three pairs of mechanical wings take off like flittering dragonflies, where monstrous sand worms burrow under the desert like gopher snakes, and where political battles between the house of Atreides and the house of Harkonnen set the stage for war involving a magical, life-affirming spice called mélange, more valuable than fossil fuels here on Earth. After the initial flash and dazzle wanes, Part 1 hits two narrative speed bumps created by Villeneuve's noble intent to be as faithful to Herbert's work as directorially possible. Most of Part 1 does little more than set up events and situations that will only pay off, hopefully, in Part 2. No cliffhangers here, as in “The Empire Strikes Back.” More disappointing and surprising, given Villeneuve's track record for immersive dramas (“Prisoners,” “Sicario,” “Blade Runner 2049”), is how empathy-challenged his characters can be. They arrive, they deliver stilted dialogue, they fight, they die, and yet, they never touch us with who they are and why we should feel invested in their welfare. An honors grad from the Perpetual Furrowed Brow School of Acting, “Star Wars” veteran Oscar Isaac plays Duke Leto Atreides, boss of his planet and father to young Paul Atreides (a thin, low-wattage Timothée Chalamet, his fixed, pensive face framed in curls). The story sets up Paul to become a savior figure, instrumental in constructing an alliance with the Fremen, an Indigenous desert people on the planet Arrakis who can provide needed military assistance to the Atreides. Paul possesses an annoying ability to be suddenly seized by interruptive glimpses from the future, most involving a shrouded mystery woman (Zendaya) who utters fortune-cookie lines such as “You need to face your fears!” Paul apparently gets his ESP chops from his mom, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, providing the movie's most layered, charismatic performance), a member of the mysterious Bene Gesserit sect. She's a terrific telepathy trainer, too. The always-watchable Jason Momoa pumps up an impressive supporting cast as the cheerfully combative soldier Duncan Idaho. Charlotte Rampling brings appropriate weirdness to Paul's tough-love aunt, Gaius Helen Mohiam, who insists he put his hand in a pain-inducing box and hold it there, otherwise she'll stab his neck with a poisoned needle. A barely recognizable Stellan Skarsgård scores with the slimy, sensational villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a bloated Jabba the Hutt/Ernst Stavro Blofeld mashup compelled to kill everyone else in the movie. On the topic of killing, the PG-13-rated violence in “Dune” feels self-consciously sanitized, as if Villeneuve envisioned it to have an appropriately harder, R-rated edge but was contractually obligated to make it kid-friendly. Initially, Part 1 should rack up solid box office returns, fueled by Herbert fans and others anxious to see how Villeneuve's interpretation compares to Lynch's and to the Sci-Fi Channel's three-part miniseries released in 2000. But, lacking a satisfying story and connective characters might limit those crucial repeat viewings, causing the earnings to fall and plateau out."
"Oct 30, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s desert opera Dune faces the twin challenges of being based on a novel long thought to be unfilmable but also following other movies that have already borrowed key ideas from the book. A futuristic world divided into vassal states ruled by an emperor and threatened by rebellion from the margins, a precious commodity that determines the fate of humankind, a landscape at the mercy of the natural elements, a sisterhood of mystics involved in genetic engineering, a messianic leader called “The One” – filmmakers have dipped into Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune and its sequels over the years in the absence of a direct adaptation of the texts.  The one version that did make it, directed by David Lynch in 1984, suffered from clunky exposition, indifferent performances and poor visual effects. The novels also inspired a television mini-series in 2000. Villeneuve charts his own course and puts his singular stamp on the source material. His Dune distils the myriad themes of Herbert’s first book into the coming-of-age story of a young man on the brink of vast knowledge and influence. Dune’s deliberately evasive plot requires some knowledge of Frank Herbert’s novels to be fully comprehensible. In the distant future, the emperor plots to destroy one storied clan with the help of another.  The emperor reassigns control of the remote planet Arrakis from House Harkonnen to House Atreides. Arrakis is the only source of the all-powerful element called “spice”, which can bend space and time and is crucial for inter-galactic travel. The emperor hopes to destroy the ruler of Atreides, Leto (Oscar Isaac), who is a threat to his power, by putting him in charge of a potentially ungovernable part of the galaxy. The desert in Arrakis is home not only to the precious spice but also gigantic sandworms and a rebellious tribe called the Fremen, who believe that their saviour will arrive any minute now. Even before Leto, his partner Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), can take control of Arrakis, there are forewarnings of a different destiny. Paul is unusually gifted, which both enthrals and alarms his mother, a member of the Bene Gesserit clan of sorcerers.  Paul has repeated visions of the future – a nifty way of reminding viewers that a sequel to Dune is underway. The 155-minute film ends on a cliffhanger. Like the massive sandworms that are more sensed than seen, Dune conceals the full meaning of its esoteric themes. Instead, Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth have crafted an obscure object of desire – a movie that relies on ravishing visuals and a diverse cast to make its way through literal and figurative sandstorms. A further layer of portentousness is supplied by Hans Zimmer’s overwhelming choral-heavy background score. The retro-futuristic production design by Patrice Vermette includes forbiddingly high walls, cavernous spaces, and structures that resembles concrete blocks dumped in the middle of nowhere. When Paul and Jessica flee a raid on Arrakis, they find themselves in a vast sea of sand where lurk sandworms, the Fremens, and the blue-eyed woman who has been haunting Paul’s dreams. Greig Frasier’s stunning wide-scape cinematography and the monochrome costumes by Robert Morgan and Jacqueline West complete Villeneuve’s vision of a world stripped down to its basic elements. More than the action sequences, including the eye-popping attack on Arrakis by House Harkonnen, it’s Villeneuve’s world-building that stands out and lingers in memory. The big-name cast includes Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin as Leto’s lieutenants, Stellan Skarsgard as the Baron of House Harkonnen, Dave Bautista as the Baron’s nephew, Chang Chen as the doctor at House Atreides, Sharon Duncan-Brewster as an ecologist at Arrakis, and Javier Bardem as the leader of the Fremens. Zendaya plays Chani, the woman who haunts Paul’s visions. The leisurely-paced movie gives each of these actors a scene or two to call their own. But the central relationship is between mother and son and the most decisive moments are between Rebecca Ferguson and Timothée Chalamet. While Ferguson is compelling as the mystic with secrets of her own, Chalamet’s delicate beauty and brooding charisma make him the perfect fit for a hero who is only just coming into view in a movie that just about begins to make sense by the end.  Although cinemas have finally opened in Maharashtra, Dune will not be among this week’s releases. Distributor Warner Bros will release Dune all over India on October 22 but in Maharashtra only on October 29. This has been done to prevent competing with the backlog of titles that have been waiting for the big screen, including No Time To Die, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Venom: Let There Be Carnage."

"Oct 29, 2021",POSITIVE," That day has finally arrived with the latest incarnation of “Dune” – a sweeping epic under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, the man behind the “Blade Runner” reboot and “The Arrival.” Villeneuve has crafted this world in ways audiences haven’t seen. It’s a vast improvement over David Lynch’s 1984 convoluted adaptation and a step forward from the SyFy miniseries. In this version, Villeneuve opted to cover mostly the first half of Herbert’s novel, using this film to establish this world and its many characters. “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet), whose family gets caught up in a battle for control of the planet Arrakis. Although basically a deserted wasteland, control of Arrakis is seen as essential because it serves as the only source of a spice that is capable of extending human vitality and is vital for interstellar travel. Paul’s father, Leto (Oscar Isaac), is chosen by the Emperor to oversee a transition of power on the planet from previous leader Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), but the transition is actually a front to allow Harkonnen to stage a violent coup of the planet. Much like “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, “Dune” takes a rather standard plot and uses it to create an expansive world that explores deeper themes than the story might suggest. Villeneuve understands the task at hand and takes his strong work from “Blade Runner” and “The Arrival” and builds on it here. This is a film best seen on as large of a screen possible, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves into this spectacular world. The story also introduces audiences to an expansive set of characters, with Villeneuve (one of three people credited as screenwriters) slowly establishing these characters in the same manner he establishes the world where they live. Chalamet finds the right tone as Paul, the film’s reluctant hero. The cast also includes Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin – all critical to moving this story along. “Dune” builds to a final act that leaves a lot left on the table. Fortunately, Warner Brothers announced earlier this week that “Dune Part 2” is a go and is scheduled to hit theaters in 2023 with Villeneuve set to direct again. Now that audiences know that the second film is coming, it’s even easier to appreciate the craftmanship and storytelling in “Dune” – the perfect table primer for Herbert’s novel that only scratches the surface of what is to come."

"Oct 29, 2021",POSITIVE," It feels like ages since David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune, an epic space action film based on the 1965 science fiction novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, was released. Often referred to as a mature version of Star Wars, the Dune franchise is big. The books are known for their complexity and are filled with lore, exposition and backstories that many fans felt was impossible to translate into a big-screen film. While Lynch's version received a mixed response, especially in terms of pointless direction and flawed execution, I still enjoyed the film. So nearly four decades later, having the director who gave us movies like Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017) handling this timeless sci-fi story is appropriate. The 2021 version of Dune by French filmmaker Denis Villeneuve lives up to its potential with grand visualisations thanks in part to modern filmmaking technology. Unlike the 1984 version where Lynch squeezed the entire story into a single movie, Villeneuve decided to make the latest version a two-part adaptation, allowing more room for the story to breathe. But despite the 156-minute runtime of part one, Dune feels more or less like an introduction or giant movie trailer rather than a proper movie. Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a gifted young man and the heir of House Atreides, an aristocratic family that rules planet Caladan. He is born into a destiny beyond his understanding. Entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and vital element in the galaxy, Paul must travel to a dangerous planet and fight enemies to ensure the future of his family and his people. Everything we see in the latest Dune feels otherworldly. The cinematography, the designs, the settings, the set and the costumes are stunning. If you were impressed by the visuals of Blade Runner 2049, you can expect the same perfection here. You're not just watching characters on another planet but it feels like you've been transported to that planet with them through the landscapes, the architecture of homes, the interiors of spaceships, or the cities they visit. And that's not to mention the inventive nature of warfare and the history of politics with different civilisations audiences are treated to. Everything feels like a living, breathing, tangible world. That's how immersive it is. The cast members in Dune are solid across the board. Chalamet, who stars as the young Paul Atreides is just as dreamy and tortured as you could want a heartthrob to be. I also loved Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson as Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica. Meanwhile, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen, the natives of Arrakis, is also a great addition. And then there are the villains such as Stellan Skarsgard, who is effectively grotesque and sinister as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Since this is only the first half of the movie, Zendaya who plays the character Chani is not featured in the film that much. Instead, she appears mostly in the form of a mysterious girl who keeps showing up as a vision in Paul's prophetic dreams. She's mostly a music video character in the movie and some Zendaya fans may be a little disappointed to learn that. However, I'm sure we will get to see more of her in the sequel. It's understandable why all the reviews from fans and critics praise the technical aspects of this film because it is deserved. In terms of visuals and production value, Dune will no doubt be a contender in the upcoming awards season. However, if we judge the film by its plot, I'm afraid the first part of Dune doesn't have much to offer. The overall story and development feels bland and slow. It's clear the studio is setting this up as a potential franchise and much of what happens in this film has no conclusion. So storywise, there's nothing much to be told here other than to serve as an introduction to each character and what's going on in the galaxy. This is a very long movie and feels a bit dragged at times. I think that is part of what disappoints me most about it. It gives us the feeling they are purposely saving the good and exciting stuff for the sequel. I mean, why do we have to sit through two-and-a-half hours if we're going to have to wait for the sequel for the better stuff? Nonetheless, this is an absolutely technically brilliant and visually stunning film with a top-notch cast and deep sci-fi concepts. However, without a second part, Dune feels half empty."
"Oct 29, 2021",POSITIVE," Una de las claves del éxito de la trilogía original de Star Wars residió en algo tan elemental como el don de la oportunidad. Las películas de Lucas ilustraron, como sólo los grandes logros de la cultura popular han sido capaces, su instante preciso; ese extraño y crucial momento de transición entre el antiguo régimen de producción fordista y el nuevo lugar en el que ahora estamos dominado por una galaxia globalizada en la era de la información en red. La representación del ideal hipertecnológico se completaba con un sagaz juego de ocultación, contestación y consuelo donde la realidad cruel del muy higiénico modelo productivo era sustituida por versiones idealizadas de modelos de producción previos. Se presentaba el brillante futuro, pero desde la nostalgia y el confort de un pasado benévolo y sin conflicto regido por ideales románticos. A su manera, Dune, de Frank Herbert, escenificó a mediados de los años 60 la misma contradicción escapista. Se hablaba de un universo en crisis en el que ya se se preveía el mayor de los desastres ecológicos, se anunciaba el control mundial de los oligopolios energéticos, se intuía el poder mistificador de la mala información servida por evangelistas visionarios y aún daba tiempo para ilustrar las consecuencias del colonialismo explotador, deshumanizado y anti-ilustrado. Pero todo ello cobraba vida en un escenario mediavalizante de duelos a primera sangre, honor a salvo de los mercados de valores y tribus sostenidas por el único no-contrato social de la tribu. Era consolador saber que frente a la factura de los conglomerados energéticos, quedaban los Fremen. Han pasado las décadas y, cosas de la ciencia-ficción, seguimos en el mismo punto. Los abismos que describiera Herbert siguen ahí y, como diría el filósofo, nos devuelven la mirada. Denis Villeneuve lo sabe. Y a todas las crisis precedentes e imperecederas, incorpora él la del propio cine. No sólo se desmorona el mundo, sino que de su mano se va al traste la única posibilidad decente que creó el siglo XX para la consolación y hasta la contestación tal vez. Las plataformas y su celebración entusiasta del entretenimiento bulímico de lo idéntico nos dejan sin esa 'melange' o 'especia' que durante tanto tiempo soportó la imaginación y el sueño. La nueva versión de Dune consigue no sólo convertirse en la única homologable hasta la fecha acabando así con una maldición se diría que milenaria, también se alza en la pantalla como una provocación para el espectador. El director entiende que no se trata de contar una historia (aunque también) como de recrear un universo con aspecto de trampantojo tan fiel a la meticulosa irrealidad ideada por Herbert que se diría completamente real. No en balde, todos los lectores de Dune saben que hay que empezar por los apéndices, allí donde el autor detalla desde la biología que ampara a su planeta Arrakis a cada uno de los vericuetos de la religión mesiánica que anima a sus habitantes. Es decir,  lo que importa es la capacidad del cine y la pantalla gigante de convertir la palabra no tanto en metáfora como en simple y dura realidad, y a un Shai-Hulud en el más espectacular de los gusanos gigantes. En definitiva, es real lo que percibimos como real. El director se plantea la historia de la lucha por el poder entre la Casa Atreides y los Harkonen, con los habitantes del arenal en funciones de catalizadores del drama de explotación y libertad, como un mito contemporáneo narrado en trance. Todas las soluciones tanto narrativas como, digamos, técnicas son las correctas. El enrevesado argumento lanzado 'in media res' con su innumerable procesión de personajes obedece a la lógica de una historia que, en verdad, quiere ser cosmogonía.  Y la puesta es escena, soportada por el ya ritual sonido catedralicio firmado por Hans Zimmer, se maneja con la misma claridad en la acción y en el sueño. No queda otra que rendirse a una maquinaria de entretenimiento madura y perfectamente consciente de sí que coloca el cine popular ante la evidencia de su transformación y crisis. El resultado es  una película que discurre por la pantalla con la certeza de una aventura que lo mismo cuestiona la realidad que invita a escaparse de ella. Es una película incómoda por lo que tiene de contestación a la evidencia. Ni se dispone en tres actos ni plantea una resolución a nada (habrá una segunda parte) ni, dado el caso, siquiera consuela. Es una aventura sin aventura. Es, en definitiva, una película en crisis perfecto reflejo de cada uno de los abismos que la habitan.... que, en efecto, son los nuestros. Es una de las críticas más chorras que he leído, y mira que he leído chorradas engreídas disfrazadas de críticas de películas. Pero la transición del modo fordista de producción mediante Star Wars me ha dejado patidifuso. Y me confirma que NO hay que ver películas que les gusten a estos gafapastas elististas. Si les gusta, seguro que es un muermo como ellos."

With a hearty Hans Zimmer fanfare, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune has officially arrived on American screens, after a convoluted journey through the shifting sands of pandemic release dates. At once sensorially lavish and narratively restrained, this latest adaptation of science-fiction author Frank Herbert’s beloved 1965 novel offers many fine aspects to slake the thirsts of parched cinephiles, even if what it accomplishes remains largely in the service of setting up the characters and plot points of a proposed second installment. Villeneuve’s advance publicity has long stressed that this is a passion project created by a longtime Dune fan. If so, this would explain why the movie, for all its giddy visuals and vibey glamour, cannot escape a certain DeMille-like, Bible-epic stiffness. Devoted to the ambitious production of overawing grandeur, this Dune never quite coheres into something more profound or compelling than its carefully wrought parts, but does deliver a pageant splendid enough to entertain those of us who are unfamiliar with Herbert’s chapter and verse. Multiple directors have foundered in their attempts to picturize Dune: Alejandro Jodorowsky’s proposed version would have been a lysergic trip with mad stunt-casting (Salvador Dalí as the Padishah Emperor! Orson Welles as Baron Harkonnen!) but never managed to get off the planet; Ridley Scott remained stuck at the screenplay stage for his Dune project before moving on to helm Blade Runner. David Lynch’s sprawling 1984 widescreener, originally clocking in around three hours, was released in a much shorter cut, rejected soundly by audiences and critics alike, and largely disavowed by its director. While its Eraserhead-meets-Flash Gordon design proves potent, Lynch’s film strains to adapt Herbert’s four-hundred-page novel to a single feature, becoming overladen with characters and bogged down by the verbal exposition of court intrigue. Villeneuve’s Dune, in comparison, avoids this problem by adapting only the first half or so of Herbert’s original story and keeping narrative explanations to a minimum, sometimes to the point of obscurity. (No big loss—after decades of online fandom, all the lore you’ll ever need is only a thumb-flick away.) Villeneuve’s iteration concerns itself less with the intricacies of Herbert’s deep world-building than with effectively communicating the story’s broadest themes. The galaxy-spanning Imperium’s domination of the desert planet Arrakis, from which it extracts a valuable resource called “spice,” has always been clear enough in its resonances with real empires, and so Villeneuve’s look-book draws liberally from nineteenth-century imperialism, twentieth-century industrial exploitation, and twenty-first-century desert warfare. The film’s palette of racial casting could be taken as an attempt at colonial realism: the uppermost rulers of the Imperium, members of two aristocratic houses, are mostly played by white actors, and their functionaries and native subjects are largely brown and Black. The film opens with Zendaya, as one of the sand-dwelling Fremen of Arrakis, asking “Who will our new oppressors be?” Herbert’s original text, inspired partly by T. E. Lawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom, derives its motifs from Islamic culture to construct the fictional Fremen and their beliefs, and the film offers lots of well-composed images of unabashed Orientalism to make sure these parallels stick: light streaming through geometric grilles, fortresses rising like ziggurats, long lines of dusty, robe-swathed masses, fragments of swirling calligraphic script. Many of these were already cited as common elements of contemporary science-fiction films in Astria Suparak’s illustrated lecture “Asian Futures Without Asians,” which she’s been presenting since early 2021. Suparak demonstrates, through copious examples, how persistently—and incoherently—Western science-fiction films borrow from superficial aspects of Asian culture, via costuming, architecture, and set design, in order to impart what is imagined to be a sense of the exotic and futuristic. It’s hard not to think about her thesis while watching Dune. Even if its Islamic borrowings might be expected owing to the source material, all kinds of unrelated Asian cultural artifacts are randomly strewn about this Duniverse—bindis, chimes, mandalas, parasols, silken robes, even Mongolian throat singing—intermingled with a cold European medievalism to round out its project of conveying the fantastical through a bewildering collage of familiar tropes. At times these cultural mash-ups are deliriously wacky: there’s a powerfully somber sort of camp at play when Villeneuve throws in a martial bagpiper to lead a procession of the House of Atreides, men in macho metal armor and women delicately jeweled and veiled, as they debark upon their arid satrapy. An impressive roster of performers has been assembled for Dune’s collective star power, but they are given little space for any complex acting: not unusual for a space opera. By centering the story on Timothée Chalamet’s wispy Paul Atreides, an Imperial scion with psi powers who may be the messiah of Fremen prophecy, Villeneuve’s film becomes predominantly a coming-of-age tale. In this it most closely echoes Star Wars, clearly a key reference for Villeneuve, so much so that large swaths at times resemble a big-screen Mandalorian. If George Lucas’s film evoked Triumph of the Will, banners and all, then so too must Villeneuve’s. The blue and red energy shields in Villeneuve’s Dune zhoosh like lightsabers; his dragonfly ornithopters whizz through the atmosphere like X-wing starfighters; his holograms are as staticky as analog video. This queasy sense of déjà vu is heightened, of course, by the fact that Lucas’s film already strip-mined Herbert’s novel for many of its core elements, a fact that savvy viewers noticed when Star Wars came out in 1977. Reviewing the film on its release, critic Reyner Banham, better known for his hip takes on architecture, clocked its source immediately. Noting that the nomadic, hooded denizens of desert planet Tatooine wear “curious loops and lengths of plastic tubing protruding here and there from their garb,” Banham declares that “this was not just a fancy of the costume department. Practically all the audience within our earshot flashed on the fact that this was a reference to Frank Herbert’s Dune ecology, where the desert folk, the Fremen, wear special gear that conserves and recycles all their body water.” Eager to survive his own epic production, Villeneuve likewise opted for a strategy of recycling and reuse.

"Oct 29, 2021",NEGATIVE," The Pitch: Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel Dune gets its second big-screen treatment. The first was a notorious misfire directed by David Lynch, who famously disowned the final film; the newer version is from Denis Villeneuve, who has experience with sci-fi both emotionally intimate (Arrival) and storied in its nerdy history (Blade Runner 2049). Though the politics and world-building of the Dune world can seem obtuse — the names alone present a challenge for the less sci-fi-inclined — its story will also have a familiar ring for anyone who’s absorbed a few of the many works the novel influenced. In other words, yes, it’s a chosen-one narrative: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a young man of noble birth, accompanies his parents (Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson) to the desert planet Arrakis, where they plan to take control of the planet’s valuable spice-mining operation and bring stability to the region. Instead, they’re thrust into a trap, and Paul is forced to seek out the Fremen, the planet’s oppressed natives — who have been appearing in Paul’s possibly-prophetic dreams. The Spice Will Flow: Dune has one of those sci-fi plots where relatively simple turns happen in complicated and exposition-laden ways; a lot of the movie consists of sorta-good guys touring various facilities or getting ready to go places, as Paul broods about the possibility that he may be some kind of grander savior. The fun does come from the weirdo world-building; the vocabulary, the production design, the transportation to a new world thousands of years in the future. That was the case in Lynch’s misbegotten but compelling take, and this version certainly has more forward momentum than that. Villeneuve is a talented image-maker, and finds surprising variety and texture in a generally dusty, barren color palette. This is the rare big-budget special-effects movie that feels both expensive and immersive. It needs to, because as drama or even as a stylish exercise, it’s a little underwhelming. Among the Stars: Chalamet is a talented actor who can do drama or comedy — but there isn’t much of either in this movie, and he’s left projecting both a moody blankness and the sense that he may not be a leading man for the ages, at least not in genre material. Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin have fun playing two battle-hardened mentor figures to Paul — the one who smiles and the one who grimaces, respectively — but they don’t actually share much screen time with him. It falls to Chalamet’s frequent scene partner Rebecca Ferguson to anchor the more emotional side of the movie, and she does what she can; she’s the character who most feels like a dimensionalized human being. Oddly, the film’s muted humanity isn’t in service of greater metaphorical attention — even though it’s about a powerful group creating chaos in a far-away land through imperialist meddling. The movie is too vividly realized to be boring, but it spends a lot of time scrambling out of the gap between pulpy fun and serious allegory. It’s also hobbled by the fact that it’s very much, as the opening credits say, Part 1; no real resolution is offered by the end of its 155 minutes. It’s just half a movie. Size Does Matter: Villeneuve has been outspoken about his feeling that his movie should be seen theatrically, on the biggest and best screens possible. He’s not wrong; the filmmakers have obviously labored (and the studios have obviously written hefty checks) to bring Herbert’s detailed world to life in convincing, often spectacular detail, and sci-fi fans who feel comfortable going out to the movies mid-pandemic will certainly reap spectacular visual rewards. At the same time, it’s not unthinkable to watch Dune at home, because — with only half the story told, an abrupt stopping point, and all of that world-building and exposition — it does play a bit like a massive-budget miniseries; like some HBO show that less dedicated viewers might well let languish in the queue after a couple of episodes. This format-blurring doesn’t feel opportunistic or even intentional; just evidence of how difficult it is to wrestle this sprawling material into a workable feature. The Verdict: It’s hard to discourage any sci-fi fans from seeing Dune, preferably in a well-appointed movie theater. It’s also hard to imagine any non-fans truly loving it."
"Oct 29, 2021",POSITIVE," Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) runs to stay out of the maw of a sandworm, in Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science-fiction epic “Dune.” (Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures.) The first sign that Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” might have a shot at getting it right — at succeeding where avant-garde directors like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky failed — comes at the very beginning, when two words appear under the title: “Part One.” This is an instant signal that Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) is going to take the time necessary to tell Frank Herbert’s sprawling science-fiction epic properly. No need to cram everything into one movie, as Lynch did in 1984.  And, even though the plot revolves around a mind-altering spice, Villeneuve soon shows he’s taking a down-to-earth approach to the visuals. Gone are the hallucinatory wonders of Lynch’s pre-“”Blue Velvet” imagination, or the fevered phantasmagoria of Jodorowsky’s doomed ‘70s project (as described in the documentary “Jodorowsky’s Dune”).  Villeneuve, who shares screenplay credit with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, starts with the basics: It’s the year 10,191, and two mighty clans are in conflict. On the bad guys’ side is House Harkonnen, led by the pustulant and corpulent Baron Harkonnen (Stellen Skarsgard), which has operated the spice harvesting on the desert planet Arrakis — collecting the drug that navigators need to “fold space.” The good guys are House Atreides, with Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) grooming his son, Paul (Timothee Chalamet), to one day succeed him, helped by the Duke’s loyal aides: Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Harrison). Someone else has been training Paul: His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, the holy order that’s officially acting as peacemakers as House Atreides takes over Arrakis’ operations from House Harkonnen, under order of the emperor. Then the Mother Superior (Charlotte Rampling) comes to test Paul’s abilities and his bravery. These skills will become important, when Duke Leto is betrayed, having walked into the trap set by the nasty Baron. Paul and Jessica must travel the deserts, careful not to attract the skyscraper-sized worms that roam the dunes outside the castle walls. so they can meet the Fremen, the desert-equipped natives. Paul has seen one Fremen, Chani (Zendaya), in his dreams.  Being the first of a planned two-part adaptation, those dreams are about all you see of Zendaya, and Javier Bardem’s appearance as the Fremen leader, Stilgar, is scant in this chapter. On the other hand, there are characters in this first installment who won’t be around for Part Two. (Not saying who.) The script includes some of the palace intrigue, without letting the narrative get sucked into it, as happened with Lynch (and, for that matter, Herbert). One clever touch is how Villeneuve tacitly compares Arrakis to Afghanistan, where desert dwellers watch as foreign superpowers, some with better intentions than others, come looking to impose order on a secretive native population.  The look of Villeneuve’s Arrakis is breathtaking, combining the best of modern CGI images with the sweep of an epic like “Lawrence of Arabia.” Every detail, from the giant sandworms that explode from the sands to the desert “stillsuits” the Fremen wear to collect their sweat, is executed to movie perfection. First and foremost, “Dune” is a coming-of-age story, with the young Paul growing into the role destiny has assigned — to lead his world into a giant cosmic battle to come. In that context, Chalamet is inspired casting. Chalamet’s Paul can be impetuous at times, like when he begs his pal Duncan to take him along on a reconnaissance flight. But this Paul also can be thoughtful, observant, and heroic. Some heroism won’t come until the second chapter, but there’s enough potential, in Paul and in this franchise, to suggest this “Dune” can go the distance. Opens Friday, October 22, in theaters everywhere and streaming on HBO Max. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material."
"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE," Two big event movies—one for the mainstream audience, another at least a big event for the director’s admittedly pretty-large fanbase, both delayed many months by COVID—arrive this in theaters this Friday. The plus-sized one is Dune, or rather Dune: Part One (as it’s actually titled onscreen), because the producers decided to see how this first half does before green-lighting a second half that will likely also cost close to $200 million. No doubt they’re haunted by the shadow of David Lynch’s 1984 version, a Dino De Laurentiis behemoth that was a critical and commercial disaster.  Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve’s (Incendies, Prisoners, Sicario) version is an immediate improvement, its projected five-hour length requiring no confusing crush of verbal explication like the ’80s film fell prey to. Those who feared it would bog down in the ponderousness of this director’s last couple films should be relieved: While stately, Dune doesn’t plod like Arrival or Blade Runner 2049, and the perhaps too-tastefully-spare earthtones aesthetic that semi-strangled the latter is perfect for this story of stark desert landscapes. (On the other hand, it’s a pity the desert-space-opera milieu now inevitably recalls Star Wars, esp. its underwhelming prequels, as presumably Lucas borrowed ideas from Dune, rather than the other way around.) Really, the only significant minus here is that this being Part One, we’re all too aware at the end of being left smack in the middle of a larger narrative arc. Indeed, this is a first-rate action fantasy that is serious without being too pompous, and fantastical-enough without getting silly. The right to mine “Spice,” a “sacred hallucinogen” and valuable power source found only on desert planet Arrakis, triggers deadly conflict between the good guys of House Atreides (ruled by Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson and their son Timothee Chalamet) and the bad guys of House Harkonnen (led by Stellan Skarsgard’s evil Baron and nephew Dave Bautista). Long abused by such outsiders, the native Fremen of Arrakis nonetheless perceive that Chalamet’s Paul may be their “chosen one,” savior, Luke Skywalker, or whatever you wanna call it.  Also factoring in are Josh Brolin, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, and others, many of whose characters will not live to see Part Two. Wisely, Villeneuve withholds any clear view of those giant Arrakian sandworms until next time—perhaps fearing the world hasn’t yet have recovered from the absurdity of seeing Kyle MacLachlan “ride” them 35 years ago.  Indeed, nothing here is laughable, including the villains: Eschewing baroque excess, the director spares us anything like 1984’s Sting in a gilded loincloth, or pustule-covered Kenneth McMillan as a floating homophobic nightmare. He provides spectacle, but also subtlety. This Dune may be the most intelligently done and satisfying thing of its general ilk, on this kind of scale, since the Lord of the Rings trilogy—let’s hope it gets to be completed.  If Dune is much better than many expected, Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch makes the opposite impression: It’s an anticipated delight that turns out to be a disappointingly flat, one-time-too-many regurgitation of the director’s usual bag o’ tricks. This time the various twee anecdotes and starry character rollcall get hung on the notion of a Kansas-funded Paris magazine bureau whose history is recalled in the wake of its longtime editor’s (Bill Murray) death.  There are three major “articles”: One about the discovery by an art dealer (Adrien Brody) of a brilliant abstract painter (Benicio del Toro) in a mental asylum; another about a middle-aged journalist’s (Frances McDormand) dalliance with a student revolutionary (Chalamet again) in those turbulent Sixties; and finally the search for a Police Commissioner’s (Mathieu Amalric) son, kidnapped by a criminal syndicate (including Edward Norton and Willem Dafoe). Jeffrey Wright, Owen Wilson, Elisabeth Moss, Anjelica Huston, Lea Seydoux, Henry Winkler, Christoph Waltz, Liev Schreiber, Stephen Park, and others are among those luminaries who mostly turn up just long enough to be recognized and arch an eyebrow.

Yet the only performer in these cluttered ranks who got a smile out of me was Tilda Swinton, amusingly swank as a socialite art aficionado. Anderson’s aesthetic is in full flower, with the wildly artificial design contributions and camera schemes utterly characteristic—yet this time without charm. I’m not sure what went wrong here, beyond the obvious fact that he’s overmilking basic French stereotypes minus much novelty or wit. Nor even a basic raison d’etre, as The French Dispatch is (as the final credits duly point out) a tribute to the glory days of The New Yorker.  A style and sensibility this rarefied really needs the elusive flame of inspiration. Without it, Anderson is just imitating himself (as well as Tati and Roy Andersson). Some diehard fans will no doubt be delighted anyway, dammit, but this is one stale box of bon-bons.  On the other hand, those looking for something Gallic and still reasonably fresh can indulge at length this Sunday at the Roxie Theatre with a one-day return of guest programmer Don Malcolm’s sporadic The French Had a Name For It series. This entry pays tribute to the leading popular male stars of two successive eras, via a pair of double bills taken from the decade in which they overlapped. The afternoon provides two early vehicles for Jean-Paul Belmondo before his (and Godard’s) 1960 breakthrough with Breathless: then-newbie director Claude Chabrol’s ’59 domestic intrigue Web of Passion aka A Double Tour, and venerable Children of Paradise helmer Marcel Carne’s attempt to grapple with “troubled youth” the prior year in The Cheaters aka Les Tricheurs.  In the evening, there are two melodramas showcasing the late-career appeal of archetypal Gallic proletarian male Jean Gabin: As an aging gangster in Jacques Becker’s 1954 heist film Hands Off the Loot! aka Touchez pas au grisbi, and as a doomed trucker in Henri Verneuil’s 1956 People of No Importance aka Des gens sans importance. More information here. There will be more revivals on tap in a three-day edition of “The French Had a Name For It” Nov. 12-14.  The Subject Phil (Jason Biggs) is a successful, award-winning documentarian who’s attracted controversy in the past for arguably exploiting his subjects, as a transplanted white middle-class Midwesterner filming at-risk minority lives in the Manhattan inner city. He’s particularly stressed at present, as he attempts to wrap up one project while fending off media inquiries re: a gang-related Harlem killing he not only witnessed, but videotaped. As if all that weren’t enough, he’s got a high-maintenance girlfriend (Annabella Acosta as Jess) who does not cope well his hiring a pretty, fawning, flirtatious young woman (Carra Patterson’s Marley) as personal assistant. This first directorial feature for Lanie Zipoy, scripted by playwright Chisa Hutchinson, wrestles provocatively and intelligently with some thorny ethical as well as social issues. It’s got strong performances, particularly from Biggs (putting American Pie behind him at last) and Aunjanue Ellis (If Beatle Street Could Talk, Lovecraft Country) as Leslie, the mother who blames him for her son Malcolm’s (Nile Bullock) death. The exact circumstances of that event finally come to light in flashbacks as these two characters, both united and bitterly opposed by grief, confront one another.  But as forceful as that material and its execution is, The Subject is structurally flawed—awkwardly divided between a first half that ranges a little too freely between different relationships and time frames, then a second half that is very much a theatrical two-hander. While that first hour probably wouldn’t have worked on stage, the second doesn’t feel like it was written for film. They’re both powerful in their ways, but taken together, the very different dramatic techniques clash. Even so, The Subject (which isn’t opening in any Bay Area theaters, but is available on TVOD/Digital platforms as of Fri/22) remains worth seeing.  No FutureA more smoothly engineered if no less agonizing look at maternal loss and blame is this potent sophomore feature by the writing/directing team of Andrew Irvine and Mark Smoot. Will (Charlie Heaton from “Stranger Things”) and Chris (Jefferson White) were childhood friends whose promising band and everything else got consumed by mutual drug addiction. Now the band is dead, and both young men are struggling to stay clean. But Will has acquired a job, a house, a girlfriend (Rosa Salazar); he’s successfully moved on. That cannot be said for Chris, who has to live under his mother Claire’s (Catherine Keener) roof, as well as the weight of her anxious concern. Seeing no future for himself, he orchestrates an exit.  Guilt and grief unite Will and Claire in the wake of that death—each feels the other understands their loss in a way no one else can. Still, he continues to hide some particularly bleak truths from both her and Becca, creating psychological traps that only grow more hazardous when the relationship between grieving friend and mother crosses into a different kind of intimacy.  Grim as much of its content is, No Future is not just a dirge. The excellent performers (which also include Jackie Earle Haley as Will’s semi-estranged father) find nuance and empathy in this very well-judged drama. But it is not a redemption tale. Addiction here is a spiral from which no escape is ever final, and the expectation of a happy ending is something best left to fairy tales. No Future is being released to limited theaters and VOD platforms this Fri/22.  48 Hills welcomes comments in the form of letters to the editor, which you can submit here.

"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE,"The magical boy's mother, played with astounding nerve by Rebecca Ferguson, is the true hero of the film..."
"Oct 28, 2021",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited take on Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi classic is very much its own thing – operatically ambitious and visually overwhelming. Even if it fails you, as it did me, you’ll still know you’ve been to the movies. And that’s where you should see it – at the movies, as in the pre-pandemic meaning of the word, i.e., at a movie theater, preferably on the biggest screen you can find. Villeneuve takes Herbert’s book very seriously and that seriousness translates into a kind of intrinsic immensity that goes far beyond mere production design. The plot is simultaneously very simple and very complicated. The complicated part mostly has to do with visions and ancient prophecies concerning, well, The One (sorry “Matrix” fans), i.e., a long-destined messianic figure. Villeneuve doesn’t get into this too deeply because his movie, long as it is (155 minutes), is actually titled “Dune: Part One.” The simpler part concerns a power struggle among various factions known as Houses. Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), leader of House Atreides, has just been given a dubious promotion: he is the new ruler of Arrakis, a desert planet mostly populated by an indigenous people known as the Fremen and deadly underground monsters known as sandworms (yes, think “Tremors” – or maybe try not to). Yet, Arrakis is also a powerful fiefdom because it’s the only place you can find spice, a miraculous substance that can do everything from fueling space travel to fueling life. Naturally, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), head of House Harkonnen, which previously ruled Arrakis, isn’t happy to be replaced. So, he plots the downfall of everything Atreides. Which includes: Leto’s well-connected consort, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson); his right-hand men, hot-shot pilot Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and veteran warrior Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin); and, most importantly, Leto and Jessica’s son, Paul (Timothee Chalomet). Paul is the hero of “Dune,” the one who may be The One. To their credit, the actors aren’t intimidated by the vastness of the production. In the film’s few quiet moments, they are actually quite good, especially Chalomet, who’s burdened with carrying the movie’s through line (and therefore setting up “Dune Two,” if there is one; it’s been discussed but not greenlit). So, as a fan of the original novel and even an admirer – albeit in an ironic way – of David Lynch’s doomed 1984 version, why wasn’t I more taken with Villeneuve’s earnest effort? Part of it was the unrelieved, well, earnestness. On the one hand, it’s a relief not to have to deal with the incessant quip-i-ness of the Marvel epics and, to an extent, the “Star Wars” reboots. On the other, you sometimes want to scream, lighten up. Further, while Villeneuve has a firm grasp on “Dune’s” mythic elements, he’s less assured when it comes to things like characterization. He doesn’t give his cast much breathing room, and it’s to their credit that the actors find as many moments as they do. Still, they can’t generate an emotional investment that simply isn’t there. When Chalomet strides across the endless desert sands, you admire him. When Peter O’Toole does the same thing in “Lawrence of Arabia,” it’s different. You know you’d follow him anywhere. SaportaReport, founded in February 2009, is a trusted voice in metro Atlanta. Through the years we have become Atlanta’s authoritative civic website.

"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE,"  If its slow pacing will irritate some and its emotional distance prove problematic, at least there are none of the wince-worthy moments that marred David Lynch’s 1984 version. Fans of the novel should be overcome with gratitude that a world-class director took on this material with respect and insight.  It’s an astoundingly faithful film adaptation; whatever narrative issues the film possesses are those of the novel. First things first…even at 2 hours and 35 minutes this is only half the “Dune” story.  It ends with young Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) a fugitive from the brutal Harkonnen  clan who have killed his father and seized control of the desert planet Arrakis and its vast wealth of spice. When last we see him he’s been taken in by the Fremen, the cave-dwelling locals. Spice — for any reader who somehow managed to avoid the book as a young person —  is a hallucinogen mined from the sand dunes of Arrakis; its properties make space navigation possible and will fuel the mystical revolution that will undoubtedly dominate a second “Dune” movie.  Well, it works just fine.  Going in I feared that the reedy Chalamet would be just too damn wimpy for the key role of Paul, but you can feel the character grow and mature from scene to scene. We barely get to spend any time with Zendaya as Chani, the girl-warrior who will become Paul’s paramour (though seen throughout in Paul’s visions, she doesn’t show up as an actual character until the last 15 minutes); but she looks great and exudes the appropriate don’t-screw-with-me desert attitude. There are so many characters here that few get much screen time.  Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson have real presence as Paul’s parents, while players like Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem barely get a chance to register. A happy exception is Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, Paul’s military mentor and friend; I don’t know if it’s good acting or if I just like watching Momoa, but he really makes an impression."
"Oct 28, 2021",NEGATIVE," Certain fans of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel Dune will be all about the sandworms. “How,” they will be asking, “will director Denis Villeneuve be portraying the 1,300-foot slugs that burrow like hungry subways beneath the parched surface of the planet Arrakis?” Others will be eager for Villenueve’s take on Herbert’s colonialist metaphor, about feudal clans exploiting a resource-rich, underdeveloped planet that every military power in the galaxy wants to control. Others still will wonder, and not for long, how this new film version of the 1965 book approaches the Messiah story underlying Herbert’s futuristic fantasy, something the director and his co-writers (Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) place front and center and use to adorn a movie that badly needs the juice. Is Paul Atreides “The One”? Portrayed by Timothée Chalamet, Paul is the hero of this epic, heir to the House of Atreides, a young man uncertain of his destiny who foresees his own death—and whose behavior and innate knowledge conform to the prophecies of the Fremen, the oppressed desert people of Arrakis. Conceived by an unmarried mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul has dreams that are haunted by a Fremen girl, Chani (Zendaya), and his vision that “Someone will hand me a blade”—as he intones with a premonition of betrayal that suggests being denied three times before the cock crows. The weapon he imagines is a “kris” knife, which etymologically does not derive from “Christ” but is mentioned often enough to make one wonder. Paul’s awakening to his destiny is the most interesting thing about “Dune,” and Villeneuve knows it. Jessica had been ordered to have a girl child (she has the ability to select the gender), but in defiance of the Bene Gesserit—the all-female religious order and shadow political force to which she belongs—she gave birth to Paul and raised him in The Way, whose adherents possess uncanny powers both mental and physical. Jessica, who on occasion wears Buddhist-inspired robes the color of saffron—the same color as “Spice,” the life-extending, mind-enhancing drug mined by “outlanders” on the Fremen’s planet—has prepared Paul as best she can. But his Calvary will be Arrakis. With all this on his mind, and on ours, the battle for the planet gets underway, as does a movie that clocks in at about 158 minutes, only half of which are bearable. Herbert’s beloved novel, which was adapted by David Lynch in 1984 and turned into a Sci-Fi Channel miniseries in 2000 (a planned 14-hour version by the Chilean-French filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky went unmade), has enough material that should preclude the kind of dead space that inhabits so much of this “Dune.” But with plans to continue the story into a second movie, Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) starts spinning his wheels in the sand about halfway to a sandwormy destination. It is terribly disappointing. Villeneuve’s effort contains all the needed mythology, astonishing production design (by Patrice Vermette) and superb cinematography (by Greig Fraser) to be utterly captivating, and it is for a considerable amount of time. There is also an over-large helping of musical bombast from Hans Zimmer, though it can be welcome during moments of narrative inertia. And there are a couple of terrific performances, most memorably by the astonishing Ms. Ferguson but also by Chalamet, Stellan Skarsgård as the monstrous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and Jason Momoa, who has the sort-of Han Solo role as swordsman Duncan Idaho. Javier Bardem is both dreadful and comic as Stilgar, a Fremen tribal leader. But both Josh Brolin as weapons master Gurney Halleck and Oscar Isaac as Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides, seem anemic, and the reason may be the reviewer’s bias: I would object as much as anyone to English actors playing these “American” roles, but neither Isaac nor Brolin has the vocal gravitas to pull off the kind of high-minded hokum that the screenwriters have provided them. As a result, they fall flat. Isaac does, however, strike a memorable pose, direct from “The Pietà,” after being left naked and betrayed at the figurative feet of the obese-yet-levitating Baron. The New Testament references are everywhere in “Dune,” but never mind that it largely takes place in a desert. It only feels like 40 days.

"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE, The long-awaited sci-fi adventure film “Dune” finally hits theaters this week after several release delays. Director Denis Villeneuve adapted the film from Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 novel. Villeneuve has been a fan of the book since he was a teenager and says “Dune” may be the most personal in his filmography yet. KPCC’s John Horn talked with Villeneuve about the making of the film and why the theatrical experience is so important to him. “Dune” is in wide release and available to stream on HBO Max. It’s rated PG-13.
"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE," Hot as it may be on Arrakis, the desert planet that draws the universe’s most powerful interests to its mineral-rich but inhospitable sands, Villeneuve’s film is a solemn slow burn. This “Dune,” a cool-headed colossus, erects a massive, brutalist architecture of otherworldly science-fiction to craft a big-screen spectacle of thundering splendor. It is, to be sure, rather cool to the touch. Villeneuve does atmospheric exteriors more than he does emotional interiors. In muted monochrome shades, rich textures and deep sonic soundscapes, his specialty — already familiar in the deep shadows of “Sicario,” “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049” — is invoking a severe ominousness. So “Dune” is a more somber trip into the desert than, say, the ferociously frenetic “Mad Max: Fury Road.” Its tale of oppression and messianic fervor, though, does — like the book — recall “Lawrence of Arabia.” Instead of Peter O’Toole and his aflame blue eyes laying siege at Aqaba, we have Timothée Chalamet seizing power, potentially, on Arrakis. There. Is. Another. Herbert’s opus, forged out of the Cold War and dawning environmental dread, begat a cottage industry of sequels but has before now made curiously little headway into wider popular culture. David Lynch’s much-derided 1984 film, which even he disavowed, didn’t help. This version, which debuts Thursday evening in theaters and on HBO Max, is a second stab at turning “Dune” into a wide-screen event. And considering the dozens of entries in the book series, “Dune” could just as surely as the “spice” in the Arrakis sands be mined for more. “Dune” is optimistically subtitled “Part One,” adapting just the first half of the 1965 tome. The easiest criticism of the film is that it doesn’t rise to a climax but withers away in the dunes. That bothered me less. I was transported enough to just hope “Dune” — which is well worth seeking out in theaters rather than at home — does well enough to lead to a part two. Villeneuve has streamlined the book in a script by him, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth. That has lost some of the novel’s eccentricities, but it has also made coherent an ambitious epic. Here, “Dune” is an operatic parable of power and exploitation, with an ecological resonance that’s only grown more relevant. With a princely sense of destiny, Chalamet plays Paul, whose father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) is head of House Atreides, one of several governing fiefdoms. The spice on Arrakis, which makes interstellar travel possible and has other mind-expanding capabilities, has long been harvested by the fascist House Harkonnen, as overseen by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (played by a grotesquely swollen Stellan Skarsgard, with nods to Marlon Brando in “Apocalypse Now”). But for unknown reasons, a switcheroo has been ordered.  Harvesting spice is no easy task, though. It’s oppressively hot. There are mammoth sandworms. And the local Fremen (among whom is Zendaya’s Chani) resent their “out-worlder” overlords. Leto hopes to begin a friendly collaboration with the Freman but quickly finds their operation sabotaged at every step. When things turn violent, attention turns to Paul, who has been trained in swordplay by Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and mentored by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, fabulous) in “the way” — a mysterious mind-controlling power. The Freman believe he could be a prophesied savior. Whether “Dune” will tweak the white savior set-up will ultimately, though, have to wait for a possible sequel. The plot is enough for even a sandworm to digest. All the world building leaves only so much room for anything very intimate in character development. “Dune,” like most of Villeneuve’s previous films, is a little hollow beneath its immaculate surfaces. But those surfaces! With Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Patrice Vermette’s production design, “Dune” is so sublimely rendered that you could easily follow it with the sound off, sans Hans Zimmer’s hulking score. With an immense sense of scale ranging from mosquito to (Jason) Momoa, “Dune” renders an age-old tale of palace intrigue and indigenous struggle in exaggerated cosmic contours. Like any drift of sand, “Dune” feels sculpted by elemental, primal forces. “Dune,” a Warner Bros. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material. Running time: 151 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

"Oct 28, 2021",NEGATIVE," Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, Dune, has long been considered unfilmable, but director Denis Villeneuve, adapting with John Spaihts and Eric Roth, almost makes it work. Villeneuve’s Dune is good in a lot of ways and bad in a couple critically important ways. It’s a mixed bag of a film that is in turns boring and frustrating and thrilling and epic that is also curiously flat despite its obvious expense. Villeneuve’s visual style is marked by a preference for drained color palettes, but usually he offsets his monochromatic tendencies by choosing one or two colors to pop off the palette to enliven the frame, such as the orange and violet of Blade Runner 2049, or the green of Arrival, or the yellow Enemies. Here, though, there is no signature color, only a signature lack of it, as the desert planet of Arrakis is rendered in muddy browns and greys. Truly spectacular visual design elements—costumes, architecture, spaceships—are rendered uninteresting by the visual style. This world of “great houses” and intergalactic empire and latent rebellion does not feel grand or exciting, it feels utilitarian to the point of being dull.  That visual sameness does not help the story, which is terribly paced. Part of Dune’s defiance of cinema is the sheer scope of the story, which Villeneuve & Co. have split into two parts (Part Two was just greenlit for 2023). In some ways, they do a decent job of breaking the story down into an understandable structure. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the heir of House Atreides, son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his concubine, the witchy Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is part of a religious order called the Bene Gesserit. Paul carries not only his father’s aristocratic and political legacy, but also his mother’s magical legacy, and Dune is a little bit concerned with this family that is not only part of something larger than themselves—politically and magically—but also sincerely caring of one another. Leto and Jessica are each aware of the pressure they are putting on Paul and the things they are asking of him at just 15 (at no point does Chalamet look 15, but it’s not as distracting as, say, Ben Platt in Dear Evan Hansen). But Dune has far too much plot track to lay, so there is no time to really explore this family dynamic. This is the biggest problem with Dune. Even splitting it into two parts, it’s too much for one movie. The story is horrendously inefficient, leading to the bad pacing and the feeling that the film is both overstuffed and boring for long stretches. Take this creative team and cast and make a ten-part TV series, and maybe we’d get somewhere with it, but as is, it takes almost 90 minutes to get through the setup, and even when the film ends at just past two and a half hours, it feels like very little of real import has happened. That’s not to say that NOTHING happens, just that the story isn’t told economically and the run time to stuff happening ratio is deeply out of whack.  But Sarah! Part Two is coming! Sure, but this isn’t Part Two, this is Part One, and Part One doesn’t work as a film. Adding a second, entirely separate film later isn’t going to make Part One work, either. Part Two will just be a second, entirely separate film, because that is how films work. Films are contained units. That’s what makes them films, and not episodes of television. But there are moments where Dune comes together and shows what it could be if the story engine ever gets into working order. The attack on the Atreides household is thrilling. The political maneuvering between houses is not engrossing, but the stuff about Jessica’s order of magical ladies being mad at her for bearing a son and not a daughter is interesting (if treading dangerously close to eugenics). Paul has visions that he is either misinterpreting or deliberately defying, either way it casts a shadow on his potential role as a chosen one because he kind of sucks at it, getting things wrong all the time. How much can you trust your messiah, when your messiah’s visions are always a little bit wrong? Big, interesting idea!  But speaking of Paul as a chosen one, hoo boy does Dune walk right into some ugly Orientalism and white savior complexes. Paul might be special not only to Jessica’s magical ladies, but also the Indigenous desert-dwellers of Arrakis, the Fremen. The actors playing the Fremen are all BIPOC, and Javier Bardem, who Hollywood thinks is BIPOC. Fair-skinned Timothée Chalamet thus stands out sharply among them, making him the latest cinematic white savior. I do think there are some seeds planted here for Paul to not quite be that down the line, but the optics for this film, at least, are bad. Worse still is the Orientalism, which exists in Hebert’s books, but goes completely unchallenged in the year of our lady 2021.  Arrakis and its primary resource, “spice”, is a clear allusion to the Middle East and natural resources such as oil or the literal spices of the spice trade. House Atreides is meant to govern Arrakis as interloping outsiders, controlling the spice for the “Imperium”. And just in case you miss the allusions to real-world Western resource exploitation of the Middle East, Hans Zimmer’s score leaps out with a MENA-flavored ululating woman singing on the soundtrack to drive the MENA influence home. (There is also, hilariously, a bagpipe theme for the Atreides that includes actual bagpipers in space.) It’s just amazing that people have been discussing the Orientalism in Dune for 50-plus years and the new film adaptation has nothing to add except using the trappings of the MENA influence without, you know, casting any MENA actors in significant roles. Dune has enough going for it—good acting, cool spaceships, a character named “Duncan Idaho”, the objectively hot cast—that it is sure to have its fans. It’s also self-serious and pretentious enough to appeal to those who take “grey” for “drama” and like their entertainment to be aggressively dour so that it feels important. Occasional glimpses of verve, particularly from Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem, show what Dune could be if the characters are given more room to breathe amidst all the plot, but they are fighting against a tide of exposition and setup. As a singular narrative, Dune doesn’t work, and the addition of a second movie later is never going to fix that. We can only hope that Part Two will stand better on its own than Part One does. "
"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE,"A big-scale blockbuster that satisfies as a massive spectacle, edgy political thriller and emotional drama."
"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE," I’m going to attempt to explain the plot here, but don’t hold me to it. There’s this planet called Arrakis, which produces a substance called “spice,” which is somehow both able to fuel spaceships, sustain life, and give you a trippy high. (Try that, Elon Musk!) The people of Arrakis—who have freaky-beautiful blue eyes and are able to withstand extreme desert heat—have been oppressed and hunted for their spice. For some reason, the unseen emperor calls off the fierce Harkonnen kingdom, led by Stellan Skarsgård (outfitted in enough gooey, bulbous, gelatinous prosthetics to make Jabba the Hut weep), and asks the decent Duke of the House Atreides (Oscar Isaac) to oversee Arrakis. The Duke has an official concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), whom I thought was his wife until, like, the last 20 minutes of the film. She loves the Duke, but is also beholden to the long line of witches that she hails from. The Duke and Lady Jessica have a son named Paul, which is a really lame science fiction name when you get right down to it. Paul is played, dreamily, by the dreamy Timothée Chalamet. What a time to be alive!

"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune is a spectacular feat of adaptation, taking source material long considered unadaptable and rendering it in sumptuous vibrance. It is perhaps the most loyal adaptation to the source material that I have ever seen, practically a scene-by-scene adaptation. If there’s a scene from the first half of the novel that has lodged itself in your mind, it’s in the movie. Yet that’s also a weakness of the film because it is so completionist that it has no sense of what its own rhythm should be as a different medium. And so a memorable page or two of the book when translated onto screen requires several minutes. This distortion of page to screen accumulates, and the film begins to drag throughout its first half even as it slams in scene after scene and so there’s little sense of the passage of time. As a consequence, the movie feels both too rushed and too long all at once.  I struggle to describe the movie this way because it didn’t feel like a drag to me, precisely because it was like slow soaking in the old friend that the novel is to me. That is, the experience to me wasn’t of watching a movie, but of getting to admire the book as a book from new and delightful angles, like slowly re-reading it and savoring it from a different perspective. But to someone who isn’t enamored with the book? Who hasn’t read it? I cannot speak for them, but I’m suspicious that the movie doesn’t work particularly well actually as a movie. But let’s set aside that question and just revel a bit in the glimpses of such gorgeous sights that slow meander allows. Of guild ships like planet-swallowing whales, disgorging thousands of ships like dust motes. Of impossible vertical craft floating downward like feathers despite looking carved of stone, monoliths of grace. Of lumbering sand crawlers plucked up into the air by balloon. Of ornithopters, at once as delicate as dragonflies, and stolid groaning machinery of steel and grease. The locations feel the same way. Palaces built like medieval fortresses, all rough rock and bulwarks, foot-thick stone doors that glide open at the touch of a finger. It’s a world that feels lived in and real, while creating a distinct visual aesthetic that grafts feudal forms onto science fiction magic that enables impossible function. Not since the original Star Wars films have I felt a science fiction world combine jaw-dropping uniqueness, with a gritty and dirty reality of familiarity. And yet it often feels like a world where the people were left out. Other than a crowd shot upon landing, Arrakeen is all but empty. It’s all stone and baking clay, like one of those ancient Egyptian cities abandoned to the sands a thousand years ago. And so when inevitable battle erupts with fire raining down, it feels like spectacle with little consequence. For a world of vast vistas and endless sands, the direction makes it curiously small. Protagonists will walk for a day in the middle of nowhere on an entire planet and conveniently find one of two people they know. They’ll walk another day and find the second one. So much of the richness of the novel is in the inner dialogue and thoughts of the characters, especially Jessica and Paul. Paul’s constant interior struggle with being able to see infinite futures while being forced to navigate the present simply does not translate onto the screen. That leaves an emotional hollowness to the exercise, wherein we have a perfectly rendered world in its literal sense, without the inner life that makes the story more than a rote exercise of good guys and bad guys. This is especially true when the film tries to communicate his visions as anything more than confused glimpses of the future, or parlor tricks where he knows something he shouldn’t about a stranger. More so too with needing to translate the omnipresent inner dialogues of non-central characters, like every other Fremen character turning their head and hissing in subtitle, “OMG he’s the one,” while everyone pretends nothing is being said. Let’s talk about the Fremen. There’s a fundamental orientalism to their portrayal that the movie cannot get away from. They are exotic and in their exoticism they are terrifying and dangerous. They’re weird and alien and not real people. A lot of this is the source material. More of it is the simple fact that the movie adapts the first half of the novel, while it’s the second half that contains living with the Fremen and seeing them as themselves as opposed to the unseen demons out in the deserts. The novel — like all novels, like all art — is an artifact of its time and context. But to retell the story means updating it on the margins to accommodate the ways it resonates with a modern audience. Science fiction reflects reality, and so when we’re presented with an occupying imperial force of wastelands filled with riches, we can’t help but draw the lines of our own generational experience. We can’t help but map this onto the 50 years of American and Russian empire in the Mideast that we’ve watched unfold since the publication of the original novel. Especially with the brutal departing empire ruled by a dude with a Russian name, at odds with the dudes with American-sounding names and a belief in their own protagonism. Again, by being unable to portray the inner conflict and dialogue, and being unable to humanize the Fremen, the three-dimensionality of the novel collapses down to a simple story of good guys and bad guys, of the rise of a hero. But Herbert famously wrote these novels as a critique of the heroic ideal. They rope you in with Paul’s heroic journey, all the while setting you up to see the ravaging whirlwind of his passing, of the nightmare holy war of a hundred billion dead just to set up another goddamned empire. Maybe that’s what Villeneuve is trying to set up. Maybe he has every plan of filming Dune Messiah and Children of Dune to complete the critique. But it’s not apparent from this first half of the first novel that it would be possible to meaningfully do so. All of that being said, I absolutely think you should watch the movie. It’s masterful in visuals, in acting, in building a world that I want to see a dozen more hours of on my screen. But the irony is that as good as it is, it’s doomed by the fundamental unfilmablity of the novel. That makes it an astounding complement to the novel, but I don’t know that it actually stands on its own.

"Oct 28, 2021",NEUTRAL," Denis Villeneuve, who directed and had a hand in writing this latest adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction epic “Dune,” has a resume that qualifies him twice over. Villeneuve’s done sci-fi (“Arrival,” 2016; “Blade Runner 2049,” 2017). He’s also done desert (“Sicario,” 2015). If only he’d made a movie about sandworms, he’d have a hat trick. Sandworms live beneath the desert surface of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. The planet’s inhabitants, the Fremen, worship them. The creatures can grow up to 1,300 feet in length, and you don’t want to be nearby when they’re around. Except that you do, because sandworms produce a substance known as spice. It’s “by far the most valuable substance in the universe,” a character in the movie says. Spice is so valuable because interplanetary navigators need it to pilot their spacecraft. Spice has psychotropic qualities, which makes it of interest not just in outer space. Even if you haven’t read “Dune, and the book has sold 20 million copies since first being published, in 1965, “Fremen” and “sandworms” and “Arrakis” and “spice” might sound vaguely familiar. The book has become that much a part of the culture. That’s thanks in part to how compelling Herbert’s vision of an entirely arid planet is for an ecologically conscious age. (If anything, climate change makes that vision that much more powerful.) It’s also thanks to “Dune” having previously been made into a 1984 movie — directed by David Lynch, no less, and a famous failure — and a 2000 cable miniseries. Now it’s Villeneuve’s turn. Or turns: This is billed as Part One, with Part Two yet to be filmed. “Dune” is showing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max. It’s definitely a big-screen movie. As a viewing experience, think of it as a sci-fi “Lawrence of Arabia” — the Arrakis scenes were shot in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates — and, in fact, the Fremen are like high-tech Bedouins, minus any camels. Timothée Chalamet makes for a very sulky Paul Atreides, the hero of “Dune.” Chalamet would never be mistaken for Peter O’Toole — though if you ingest enough spice it does turn your eyes blue. Paul is the son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who rule the green and well-irrigated planet of Caladan. Arrakis is hellish by comparison. Spice mining is fabulously profitable, though, and the Emperor has decreed that House Harkonnen hand over the planet to House Atreides. The Harkonnens are as evil as the Atreides are good. “You’ve never met Harkonnens before,” Gurney Halleck, the duke’s right-hand man, warns Paul. “I have. They’re BRUTAL.” “Brutal” may not be all caps in the script, but the way Josh Brolin delivers the word — and no one in movies today has a better growl — it sure sounds that way. As Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his nephew, Beast Rabban Harkonnen, Stellan Skarsgård and Dave Bautista leave no doubt as to the accuracy of Gurney’s description. The baron’s appearance, achieved through some combination of CGI and lots and lots of latex, is even scarier than his behavior. This is a useful place to note that what’s worst in Herbert’s story is its reliance on such hackneyed elements as dukes and barons and emperors. In keeping with such nonsense, there’s also lots of swordplay. Seriously, it’s the year 10191, people can travel across the stars, and they’re still fighting with swords? Game of thrones meets game of dunes. In one respect, Villeneuve expands on the book and deepens it. He makes us see the grievous cost of spice extraction: what it means to exploit economically an entire planet, that the damage done is moral as well as environmental. It’s the worst of 19th-century whaling joined to the worst of 20th-century oil drilling. All the silly talk about the Emperor this and the Imperium that conceals how both are predicated on imperialism. It takes about an hour for the Atreides to pack up and move — and there’s still an hour and a half to go. We meet the Atreides’s master swordsman Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). We find out that Lady Jessica belongs to the Bene Gesserit, a secret sisterhood with mystical powers (which had to have been somewhere in the back of George Lucas’s mind when he dreamed up the Jedi). The Bene Gesserit has big plans for Paul, and he doesn’t like it. Charlotte Rampling, as the order’s reverend mother, has a grand time in her one scene. As the actors’ names accumulate, you may have noticed what an impressive cast “Dune” has. And we’ve yet to mention Javier Bardem, as the Fremen leader Stilgar, or Zendaya, as a young Fremen woman. Which makes it rather strange that Villeneuve’s preferred shot is of small figures in vast spaces: marching across plazas, moving through the desert. Even the rooms where people sit and talk are the size of hotel lobbies. (If they still have swords in 10191, they surely have hotels, too.) It’s not just the sets and shot set-ups that are grandiose. There’s nothing light about “Dune,” not the writing, not the pacing, not Hans Zimmer’s sledgehammer score. Subtlety and nuance aren’t Villeneuve’s thing. Once on Arrakis, there’s a thrilling battle sequence — and a pretty exciting rescue — but that’s what Villeneuve does, big set pieces. He has a fine eye, but it mainly just enables his weakness for visual bombast. Everything is leaden, solemn, portentous. When the writing’s not wooden, it’s clumsily demotic. “It’s so quiet,” the Duke says to Duncan. “Yeah, that worries me, too.” Hey, guys, smoke ‘em if you got ‘em. There’s one amusing moment in the movie — just one — and it involves Bardem spitting. Dune, the planet, suffers perpetual drought. “Dune,” the movie, feels waterlogged. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. Written by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth; based on the novel by Frank Herbert. Starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem. At Boston theaters, suburbs, and streaming on HBO Max. 155 minutes. PG-13 (strong violence, some disturbing images, suggestive material). In English and Fremen (yes, it’s a made-up language, but it’s in a made-up movie), with subtitles."
"Oct 28, 2021",NEGATIVE," Thirty-five years after David Lynch’s ill-fated adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune crashed and burned on the big screen, director Denis Villeneuve has tried his hand at bringing the stunning epic to life. The film is a coming-of-age tale of sorts. It follows Paul Atreides (a stoic Timothée Chalamet), heir to the noble House of Atreides. Paul’s whole world shifts from under him when the emperor orders his father Leto Atreides, the Duke of Atreides (Oscar Issac), to invade the dangerous desert planet Arrakis and begin cultivating the highly coveted spice. Spice allows for interstellar space travel and acts as a fountain-of-youth-like substance as well as a psychoactive.  The emperor’s orders put the House Atreides in direct conflict with the diabolical House Harkonnen, who had been cultivating spice for a generation and getting filthy rich as a result. As Paul begins to prepare himself to stand beside his father in this new world, he uncovers some strange things about himself and his mother, Lady Jessica (an outstanding Rebecca Ferguson). Before he even lands on the planet, Paul also begins dreaming of a mysterious young Arrakis-born woman named Chani (Zendaya), who may very well be the death of him.  There is nothing wrong with Villeneuve’s Dune per se. The film is absolutely stunning to watch. The narrative breaks down Herbert’s text so that the average movie-goer, without any knowledge of the novel or this world, can enter it quickly — understanding almost instantly what’s at stake. However, because it’s so fateful to the novel, there are very few surprises, nor does it feel like a work in which Villeneuve took full authorship.  As a result, there is an evident rigidity; most of the actors never stretch beyond what’s on the page. Instead, the film acts as a map, giving us context of this future world, the sandworm-filled blazing terrain of Arrakis, and the Fremen people whose land and spice have been pillaged and abused by colonizers for generations.  Though this is Paul’s story, he and many of the characters around him are just barely interesting. Jason Momoa, for example, is a marvelous actor, but his Duncan Idaho, the swordmaster of House Atreides, is reduced to a sword-slinging hulk of a man without any other motivations other than to protect and serve. The audience is never allowed to see anything other than Duncan’s brother-like affection for Paul. In fact, before Paul crosses paths with Chani, the most enticing character in Dune is Lady Jessica, who has her own stakes in her son and as mistress to Duke Leto, which are entangled with the “Muad’Dib,” the Fremen’s messiah.  Since Dune only covers the first half of Herbert’s novel and it’s even titled Dune: Part One on-screen, a second (and hopefully more entrancing) film seems inevitable. If all of this world-building and brooding is to be worth it, then Dune: Part Two must exceed well-beyond its predecessor. "
"Oct 28, 2021",POSITIVE," The late author, whose science-fiction novel “Dune” first was published in 1965, would appreciate the way director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”) handles his complex story of power plays, relationships and the commodity known as spice. This first film – I don’t know how many more there will be – introduces viewers to the central characters involved in the Great Houses who want to control the harvest of spice. Spice is used for incredible achievements, from enhancing mental capacity to space travel. The arid Arrakis, the titular “dune,” is the only planet where spice is mined. The Emperor removes the House Harkonnen control of Arrakis, and gies it to House Atreides. Duke Leto’s son is Paul (Timothée Chalamet, “Call Me By Your Name”), whose special abilities with prophetic visions come Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, “Doctor Sleep”) who is part of a group of women called the Bene Gesserit. Jason Momoa (“Aquaman”) plays a warrior for the House of Atreides and a mentor and confidante to Paul. But that’s not all. The story is much more engaging and accessible than in the 1984 “Dune” debacle. It’s also wonderful to see – especially the gargantuan sandworms and the planet they inhabit. It’s a sight to behold and also to hear: Oscar winner Hans Zimmer has composed another wonderful score for a movie that will appeal not only to “Dune” fans but also to fans of epic films from “Lord of the Rings” to the “Star Wars” franchise.

"Oct 27, 2021",NEGATIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve’s stunning take on Frank Herbert’s Dune pulls off the near-impossible by not only living up to its pre-release hype but also surpassing expectations. This PG-13 adaptation is a visually spectacular, mesmerizing introduction to this world of spice, sandworms, and warring noble families. Dune begins by announcing what’s about to play out is only part one of the story. This first of hopefully many installments lays out the pivotal characters and power dynamics that pit rival Great Houses against each other in a battle to control the harvesting of spice. The precious commodity can extend lifespans, enhance mental capacity, and makes space travel possible. As Herbert wrote, “He who controls the spice controls the universe.” House Harkonnen’s control of Arrakis, the only planet where spice can be found, is taken away by the Emperor and handed over to House Atreides as the film gets underway. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), leader of House Atreides, is leery of the Emperor’s motivations but has no choice other than to move his family, along with the Atreides army, from their home planet of Caladan to the inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis. Duke Leto’s son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), inherited special mental abilities from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of an exclusive sisterhood known as the Bene Gesserit. Paul has prophetic visions of Arrakis and specifically of a girl (played by Zendaya) who lives there prior to his family’s journey to the isolated planet. From the moment he steps foot on Arrakis, it’s apparent he feels a deep connection to the planet and its oppressed indigenous population, the Fremen. Shortly after taking over the spice harvesting operation, Duke Leto’s suspicions that his House has been setup by the Emperor prove to be true. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard in a grotesque fat suit), leader of House Harkonnen, plots to reclaim control of Arrakis and sets in motion a war between the Houses with the future of Arrakis – and the empire – at stake. Denis Villeneuve assembled an incredible ensemble for this epic sci-fi film, led by powerful performances by Oscar Isaac, Timothée Chalamet, and Rebecca Ferguson. In fact, even with a two and a half hour running time, the opening chapter of the revived Dune cinematic franchise features so many compelling performances and interesting characters that quite a few wind up with less screen time than they deserve. Zendaya’s Chani is featured in Paul’s dreams but overall isn’t given much to do in this outing. (Chani is set up to become a key player in part two as is Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, one of the leaders of the Fremen.) Jason Momoa turns in a scene-stealing performance as one of House Atreides’ fiercest warriors and one of Paul’s closest friends and advisors. And Josh Brolin’s terrific, as always, in his few scenes as Gurney Halleck, a Warmaster for House Atreides and trusted confidante of Duke Leto. The film’s driven by incredible performances, however the key to Dune’s success lies squarely on the shoulders of Timothée Chalamet as the would-be messiah who drives the narrative in Herbert’s first two Dune novels. Paul spends Dune: Part 1 growing into his powers, and Timothée Chalamet’s a commanding presence as he captures Paul’s transition from the love and protection he enjoys on his home planet to a young man forced to deal with loss and betrayal on Arrakis. Hans Zimmer’s pulsating, unrelenting score feels like its own character and Greig Fraser’s stunning cinematography demands the film be seen on as large a screen as possible. The special effects, in particular the rendering of the sandworms, are spectacular and the planet of Arrakis looks astonishingly real. Given the depth and breadth of Herbert’s Dune universe, I expected to feel a little lost trying to figure out the politics and key players of this 2021 adaptation. Fortunately, Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth’s adaptation is so precise, so well-constructed that any fears of getting lost in this fantastical world proved to be unfounded. The film’s only real shortcoming is the lack of a satisfying ending. We can only hope Warner Bros. will quickly announce they’ve greenlit Dune: Part Two so we’re not left wandering the Arrakis desert beside Paul for long."
"Oct 27, 2021",NEUTRAL," Cementing his standing among cinema’s finest sci-fi auteurs, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve aims for pop fantasy spectacle with his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s Dune (★★★☆☆), and succeeds on a massive scale. It’s the film’s scale, in beauty and grandeur and impeccable detail, that’s most impressive. From towering spacecraft to the swirls of sand and spice swallowed into the gaping maws of sandworms, Herbert’s universe of interplanetary conflict between the Houses Atreides and Harkonnen is rendered in bold strokes of scope and dimension. Even across a muted palette of desert tans and stony grays, the sweeping tableaux and visual effects look amazing. The film sounds massive, too, with dense sound design, and composer Hans Zimmer contributing an appropriately haunting score that goes heavy on the Close Encounters-style horn blares and Zimmer-style braaams. Jóhann Jóhannsson’s score for Villeneuve’s Arrival employed a similar sound. As with that stellar first-contact drama, Villeneuve conveys a fascination here with those moments of first contact between disparate sects and species. Also, abetted by the dynamic lensing of cinematographer Greig Fraser (The Mandalorian), he continues his effective use of tight, lingering close-ups on faces both foul and alluring. In the latter regard, the film constitutes a parade of some of the most structurally sound mugs in the business. Oscar Isaac is a sober, serene Duke Leto Atreides, dutifully accepting his house’s role as newly-named stewards of the desert planet Arrakis, and Rebecca Ferguson, always good and especially good here, is a shrewd, serene Lady Jessica, Duke Leto’s loyal concubine and trusted advisor, and a member of the supernatural sisterhood of Bene Gesserit. Jason Momoa makes a gallant Duncan Idaho, lending the House Atreides’ fittest warrior the actor’s usual bonhomie, if not much else. For nuance, we have Charlotte Rampling, who, even enshrouded in a heavy veil and headdress, commands her close-ups with sinister authority as the not-at-all-serene Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. The movie’s well-hyped young leads Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya bring persuasive gravitas to their roles as Paul Atreides, heir to the House Atreides, and Chani, a warrior of the Fremen, whose home planet Arrakis is mined for its all-important “spice.” Fans of Chalamet will be pleased to see their man not only ready for his closeups, but covered from every other angle, whether waking up in bed or bounding into action to battle his enemies. Zendaya stans, on the other hand, might leave disappointed, as the Emmy-winner, while supplying stretches of the film’s voice-over narration, doesn’t appear onscreen all that much. The plot, adapted by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, builds towards Paul and Chani’s eventual collision, and developments suggest, along with the “Part One” opening title, that their story will continue in further adventures of Dune (Part Two is in the works). After an awesome start, establishing themes exploring the exploitation of a planet, its people, and resources, the movie’s pacing wanes under the weight of its repetitive dark mood, finally arriving at that to-be-continued conclusion. Therein lies the film’s greater disappointment, the sense that all this visual splendor and seriousness of tone was merely set-up for whatever real action awaits down the line. Whenever that does come to pass, we can only anticipate that the next installment will do more than introduce worlds and characters, and explore beyond their brilliant surfaces to reveal deeper meaning.

"Oct 27, 2021",NEUTRAL," Era una de las películas más esperadas de los últimos tiempos por el prestigio de su director, por el megapresupuesto, por la amplitud del elenco galáctico (Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem y siguen las firmas), pero sobre todo porque la obra homónima de culto de Frank Herbert tiene millones de fans y ha seducido (y complicado) a otros cineastas como Alejandro Jodorowsky y David Lynch. El resultado, sin ser del todo decepcionante (el esplendor visual es innegable), abre unos cuantos interrogantes respecto del futuro de lo que está planteado como una saga."
"Oct 27, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune overwhelmed me. And it's not that it's the best movie I've ever seen, though it's very good...brings forth brilliant visual beauty while also maintaining that sense of philosophical denseness that drives the novel. The spice must flow."
"Oct 27, 2021",POSITIVE," 
Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune is beloved by fans of brainy science fiction, and it's notoriously difficult to adapt to film. The 1984 version was a box office bomb that nearly derailed the career of up-and-coming director David Lynch. The Syfy Channel miniseries was more faithful to the book (and its sequels) but lacked the budget to make a space epic look epic.
 
Now, at long last, comes a new big-screen adaptation from Denis Villeneuve. As was Lynch in 1984, the Québécois director is up and coming, and he even has experience updating beloved sci-fi properties with his helming of Blade Runner 2049.
 
Villeneuve made the bold decision to adapt just half of Dune, leaving the other half for a sequel that has yet to be green-lighted. Did the book defeat him the way it defeated Lynch? Find out in theaters or on HBO Max, where the film streams for its first month of release.
 
It's not easy being a teenager in the far future. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the offspring of a feudal duke (Oscar Isaac) and an acolyte of a Jedi-style religious order (Rebecca Ferguson). His mom thinks he's a long-prophesized messiah, and the visions he keeps having suggest she's not wrong.
 
Political machinations force the House Atreides to relocate to the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune, which is the source of what's called ""spice,"" a psychotropic drug that makes interstellar travel possible. To mine this precious substance (think oil), the galactic empire has colonized the planet, repressed its Indigenous residents and found ways to evade the voracious sandworms that roam the desert.
 
Paul is fascinated by the desert people, the Fremen, who also suspect that he's the messiah. A stealth attack by the Atreides' longtime enemy sends him and his mother on a perilous journey where death or transformation awaits them.
 
Herbert's novel is a major feat of world building. Whether or not readers cotton to his weighty political and metaphysical notions, they'll come away with vivid memories of immersion in his feudal-futuristic universe.
 
Cinema is all about visual and aural immersion, and Villeneuve takes full advantage of those capabilities. His Arrakis is stunning on an epic scale, with sweeping, wind-sculpted forms — often viewed from the air — and a bleached palette that recalls the sci-fi cinema of the '60s and '70s. This film is more austere than Lynch's outré, steampunk vision, but it has a dreamlike quality that's indelible in its own way.
 
A story about the interplanetary battle to control a drug, Dune is an inherently trippy experience, and it's pleasant to let the sights and sounds of this version wash over us. From gadgets to costumes to production and sound design, the movie is an engrossing tour of Herbert's world. When it comes to those little things called characters and plot, however, we may find ourselves less satisfied.
 
The biggest stumbling block to any Dune adaptation is the sheer weight of the exposition. When I saw Lynch's version on its opening weekend, theater ushers handed out printed cheat sheets before the film, complete with a glossary — probably a first and last for a would-be blockbuster.
 
Villeneuve's version comes with no such external aids, but it's stuffed with dialogue designed to deliver maximum information. Combine that with Herbert's elevated, portentous diction, and you have a script that poses a challenge to even the most talented thespians: How to bring these archetypes alive?
 
As Paul's mother, Jessica, whose machinations drive large parts of the story, Ferguson shows us the doubt and terror between her spoken lines. Isaac emotes powerfully with his eyes. Javier Bardem brings depth and grit to the Fremen leader Stilgar.
 
But it's Jason Momoa, as Duncan Idaho, who gives the film brief and much-needed shots of charisma and — dare we say — even humor. One could be forgiven for wishing he were the hero instead of Chalamet's Paul, who comes off as callow and unformed. While the script hints at the conflicts complicating Paul's ""chosen one"" status, they remain on the drawing board.
 
With any luck, a sequel will flesh out those conflicts and give us a deeper look into the mysterious world of the Fremen. Breaking off at a point that is far from conclusive, this Dune feels more like a very long pilot episode than a stand-alone film.
 
That could be a problem for casual viewers; anyone seeking a fun space shoot-'em-up will be sorely disappointed and probably bored. The very elements that make Dune intriguing and refreshing for a high-budget genre movie also make it exhausting. But would I watch a sequel? Yep.

"Oct 27, 2021",POSITIVE," “Dune” is every bit the science-fiction epic demanded by one of the most beloved classics of the genre, Frank Herbert’s enduring 1965 novel that has inspired imitators throughout pop culture, as well as several poorly received film adaptations. Stately, gorgeous, exciting and ethereal, Denis Villeneuve has made a magnificent spectacle anchored by compelling performances. Summarizing science-fiction plots makes them sound ridiculous, but a successful film like this one convinces you of its crazy world. “Dune” did an excellent job, not just of convincing the viewer this unfamiliar futuristic world was real, but of explaining things to those of us who haven’t read the book obsessively. It was not difficult to find an entry point or to follow the power struggles between House Atreides, House Harkonnen, the native peoples of Arrakis, and the competing demands for “spice,” the most valuable substance in the universe, which is harvested on the sandy dunes of Arrakis. Plus, everyone wore different armor and someone would usually yell “it’s the Harkonnen” or whatever, and frankly, I was relieved to be able to hang. The film looked amazing, the actors were great and the complex story was rewardingly well laid out. It is faithful enough for the devoted “Dune”-head, but accessible enough for a normal person. The costumes are magnificent, from elaborately beaded face jewelry and cryptic religious garb to military jackets and armor to gorgeously draped cloaks and, most importantly, “stillsuits,” a complex, wearable apparatus that keeps you alive in the harsh desert by harvesting body moisture for drinking.  Other awesome onscreen creations included a helicopter-like vehicle called a ’thopter, which flies like a dragonfly, and one of Dune’s most dangerous predators, the dreaded sandworm. This massive creature is arguably the most deadly thing on a planet that is pretty much entirely deadly, and it is given visual grandeur accordingly.  Denis Villeneuve, who also directed “Blade Runner 2049” and “Arrival,” is a visionary, and this film is stupendous to experience. He has created an aesthetic for the future that has recognizable historical elements and architecture that are expressed in stunning new ways. Imagine a medieval castle as a massive spacecraft. Stone and sand mix brilliantly with futuristic tech, as do swords instead of guns. This plot-heavy saga is not as rich emotionally as it is visually. While I could have learned more about the Duke’s motives and feelings, at the center, Chalamet is given room to show us Paul’s arc as he grows from a brilliant but unsure boy to a determined man. Given the density of the source material, this film is just part one of two planned installments. Therefore, even though it is two-and-a-half hours long, it is incomplete. So, overall, the film is somewhat unsatisfying, by design.  Above all, this is a cinematic marvel, a film to get you back into the movie theaters. While you can stream it on HBO Max, I highly recommend you see it on the big screen, if you are inclined to go to the movies in our current (improving!) pandemic situation. It is made to inspire awe and almost constantly does so. Mysterious, beautiful and entirely epic, “Dune” is sure to satisfy old fans and recruit new ones.  “Last Night in Soho”: In acclaimed director Edgar Wright’s psychological thriller, Eloise, an aspiring fashion designer, is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s, where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer, Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy).

"Oct 27, 2021",NEUTRAL,"A visually impressive offering that feels long, incomplete, and -- despite some exciting moments here and there -- fairly flat."
"Oct 27, 2021",POSITIVE," “Dune,” Frank Herbert’s epic, titanically influential science fiction novel, has been adapted for the screen twice (once big, once small) in the last four decades, and while both versions have their defenders, there’s always been the nagging sense that it’s one of those books Hollywood might never really get right.  Herbert’s novel – a dense, expansive exploration of political, cultural, and personal fallout and redemption amid a conflict on the title planet – looms large in the popular imagination among its fans as a singular work of imagination, one so massive that it’s impossible to truly capture on film in a way that will both hold the attention of devotees and capture the hearts of newcomers just hoping to watch a new genre epic. Now, another filmmaker has stepped forward in an effort to put those fears of impossible adaptation to rest. After helming the sci-fi masterpiece “Arrival” and the underrated sequel “Blade Runner 2049,” direct Denis Villeneuve was announced as the next great cinematic mind to tackle “Dune,” something he’s long described as a dream project. With a history of tremendous cinematic invention under his belt, Villeneuve seemed like the kind of filmmaker who could bring the necessary sense of visual grandeur to the project while also never losing sight of the emotional stakes. Now, at last, “Dune” is here, and it’s here with more than just the appropriate blend of scope of character. Through a combination of enthusiasm, craft, and extraordinary attention to detail, Villeneuve and company have created much more than a faithful adaptation. They’ve given us a new sci-fi epic, an immersive cinematic journey that, like its source material, feels poised to endure as one of the genre’s great works. Though it’s certainly a gamble in terms of betting on a sequel, Villeneuve’s film actually only opts to adapt roughly half of Herbert’s original novel, giving the narrative a bit more room to breathe as “Dune” establishes the two noble houses at the heart of its initial conflict. On one side, there’s the Atreides family, led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), his lover Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothee Chalamet), all of whom are preparing for tremendous upheaval as we meet them. Leto has just been granted control of the profitable fief planet of Arrakis (aka Dune), home to the powerful Spice that allows interstellar travel and is thus a very important product across the galaxy. Despite the prominence of the planet in galactic politics, the Atreides family senses a trap right away, because Arrakis’ previous rulers, the vicious Harkonnens, don’t seem the like the type to go down without a fight. As Leto, Jessica, and Paul arrive on the planet, they must face an uphill battle against forces seemingly conspiring against them from all sides. It’s a struggle for everyone, but especially for Paul, who must face a major question about his future: Will he become his father’s heir, or embrace his mother’s prediction that he’s destined for something even greater, something that perhaps begins with prophetic dreams pointing him toward Arrakis’ harsh desert? This, of course, only scratches the surface of everything at work in Herbert’s novel, including the machinations of various aides to both houses, the influence of Arrakis’ native Fremen desert dwellers, the plots of the Bene Gesserit order of supernaturally gifted women, and much more. All of this ultimately finds its way into Villeneuve’s narrative, and all of it has a part to play in the grand tapestry of “Dune,” yet the script by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth never overwhelms in its structure. There’s always been a sense that “Dune” is a slightly impenetrable work, with its made-up words and fictional power structures, but as fans of Herbert’s novel know, it all makes sense in context. The problem in adapting all of that fiction comes when the filmmakers try to make the context apply before the actual story. Here, it’s story first with every scene, every moment, every careful narrative choice. That means that all you have to do to understand the inner workings of Herbert’s vast universe is watch. And you won’t have trouble watching, because “Dune” is one of the most beautifully realized films you’ll find on the screen this year. Anyone who’s watched his previous work is no doubt aware that Villeneuve can deliver arresting visuals, but with “Dune” he outpaces even the very best of his other films. Every design choice is carefully engineered to convey the scope of Herbert’s world while also delivering a compelling vision for new viewers, and the result is something that feels simultaneously ambitious and, perhaps paradoxically, restrained. It all makes sense in the context of the world, and that means that even when the costumes get particularly elaborate, and the sets particularly huge, you’re both invested and immersed. It’s less like watching a world being invented and more like a glimpse into something that’s already existed. The same feeling rings true with the characters, all of whom crackle with intensity and lived-in vulnerability via the film’s phenomenal ensemble. It’s a movie packed with scene stealing talent, from Javier Bardem as the Fremen leader Stilgar to a radically transformed Stellan Skarsgard as the monstrous Vladimir Harkonnen, and somehow Chalamet has to find a way to rise to become the linchpin of the whole piece. Despite incredible performances from everyone who shares the screen with him, he rises to the challenge, and it’s easy to see him carrying several sequels if Villeneuve is granted the chance to expand this sci-fi world. “Dune” could have been called a success if it had only been a confident, clear adaptation of Herbert’s story, but it ultimately grows beyond that. It’s a masterpiece in its own right, one of the most beautifully realized new sci-fi films in years, and it reaffirms Villeneuve’s place as one of the great filmmakers of his generation. This is a film that must be seen to be believed, packed with moments that live in your brain long after the credits roll, and a reminder that even the most well-loved stories can still be reinvigorated by the right collection of talent.

"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE," There are a lot of moving parts when reviewing the long awaited release of Denis Villeneuve’s vision of Dune. Not least one’s relationship with Frank Herbert’s original text. It should be clear that this reviewer has not engaged with the much lauded science-fiction novel. David Lynch’s 1984 effort, has been my only window into this world, in all its campy, clunky glory. It is an ambitious project for Villeneuve to take on. Tasked with satisfying lovers of the novel, and blockbuster film fans alike. Villeneuve loves a challenge. As evident from his taking the mantle from Ridley Scott by making Blade Runner 2049. Whether he delivers on the high expectations sought after by avid fans of the novel, these opinions cannot be expressed here. However, what can be said is Villeneuve has made a thrilling sci-fi epic that, at times, gets bogged down by mandatory world building exercises.  Dreams have always been a fixation for Villenueve. His 2013 effort Enemy is essentially a waking nightmare. Dreams link the protagonist of Dune, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), with the protagonist of Arrival (2016), Louise Banks (Amy Adams). But, are they dreams or visions of the future? Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) asks Paul ‘Do you often dream things that happen just as you dreamt them?’ to which Paul replies ‘Not exactly’. It seems Villeneuve is continuing his musings, on dreams, language and the space-time continuum that proved so awe-inspiring in Arrival.  Unfortunately Villeneuve does not get a chance to stick any kind of landing on this set up because Dune is Part 1 of a prospective 2-parter (this has not been overtly mentioned in the film’s promotion because Part 2 is essentially still ‘to be announced’). What we do get. however, is an audio-visual feast. Villeneuve and his screenwriters do an excellent job of executing a complicated plot without either dumbing down the narrative or alienating audiences with overbearing exposition. House Atriedes are tasked by the Emperor to rule over Arrakis, a harsh, desert planet that is home of a precious mineral ‘spice’ which not only has mystical qualities but is critical for interstellar travel. To go any further would constitute spoiler territory, but suffice it to say the Emperor might not have House Atrides’ best interests at heart.  The film is swarming with interesting characters. The aforementioned Paul Atriedes, son of Leto (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is seen as a potentially messianic figure. His father is royalty and his mother is a member of the Bene Gesserit- a group of women capable of the supernatural. As Reverend Mother Mohiam attests ‘You have more than one birthright, boy’. House Harkonnen are the film’s antagonists. They are led by floating super-being Baron Vladimir- a grotesque individual played by Stellan Skargaard, who seems to be wilfully channelling Marlon Brando’s performance as Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979). Supporting characters include Duncan Idaho, a soldier for the House of Atriedes. Aside from being a fantastic name for a character, Jason Momoa brings a certain amount of levity to the role, which is refreshing in a film that otherwise treats itself very seriously.  Like Apocalypse Now (1979), Dune hints at anti-colonialist themes. Paul certainly finds himself ‘up river’, as he encounters characters from his earlier dreams. However, it is debatable whether this film has a climax of its own. He meets his Montagnards but by this point, the film has run out of runtime, and fans can only dream of visions of a future Part 2. "
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE," When people declare a story “unfilmable,” they don’t mean it literally. They just mean that — for whatever reason — it simply doesn’t lend itself to the popcorn arts the same way it does the written word. In the case of author Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi epic “Dune” — the first book in his series of the same name — its alleged unfilmability lies in precisely what makes it such a compelling read in the first place: Herbert’s masterful job of creating richly imagined worlds with their own deep histories, mythologies and political shenanigans. In short: There’s just too much there to cram comprehensively into two hours, as director David Lynch proved so aptly with his 1984 “Dune” debacle. That’s why, even though it has been filmed before, there are still those who will deem “Dune” unfilmable until it can be done so properly. Not only does his “Dune” fulfill the literal requirement — it exists, therefore “Dune” is filmable — but, if you’re willing to lean in, it becomes an immersive experience. That’s not to say it isn’t without its flaws. But Villeneuve’s suitably sweeping “Dune” is nothing if not a cinema-scale spectacle. In addition to the sheer scope of his vision, it benefits from staggeringly beautiful visual effects and a Hans Zimmer score you can expect to crop up later in award season. On top of that, just as he did with his 2017 sci-fi sequel “Blade Runner 2049,"" Villeneuve manages to create a “Dune” that boasts both faithfulness to and respect for the original story on which it is based. That story, in a nutshell: The teenage son of the noble-born Duke Leto Atreides finds himself thrust into a world of political intrigue when his family is appointed to rule over the water-starved desert planet Arrakis — also known as Dune — which, despite its inhospitality, is home to lucrative mines containing the drug known as “spice.” There’s more to it than that — like, a whole lot more — which is why Villeneuve decided to cover only approximately half of Herbert’s initial “Dune” novel in this film. The hope, he has said, is to turn the rest of it into a sequel should audience demand dictate. The problem is that this makes the first film feel very much like a mere setup for another. Clocking in at 2 hours 36 minutes, Villeneuve’s “Dune” does all the foundational heavy lifting required to build such a bizarre new world — along with all the momentum-sapping exposition required to explain its politics — but he runs out of time before he can make it really pay off. There’s also the fact that, while Villeneuve’s film boasts a certain trippiness, for the most part it lacks any sense of joy, adventure or fun. As much of a clear influence as Herbert’s books were on George Lucas’ “Star Wars” universe — from its Luke Skywalker-type protagonist to its Force-type mysticism to the sandworms populating its desert-world setting — Villeneuve’s “Dune” is no “Star Wars” and likely will not appeal to the same audience. In fact, it takes itself so seriously as to blunt the overall impact of the film. Here, every moment is played as high drama, which becomes exhausting fairly quickly. It also doesn’t give its cast — which is an impressive one, anchored by “it boy” Timothée Chalamet as the main protagonist — much to do in terms of showing their range. As a result, while the fate of worlds hangs in the balance, the performances here are fairly one-note. It would be a shame if they do, mostly because now that the groundwork has been laid, it’s tantalizing to imagine what Villeneuve can do with the rest of the story."
"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE," Villeneuve recupera la épica que las páginas proponían y reduce la expresividad lingüística de los protagonistas para concentrarse en una parafernalia visual, en donde la aridez del desierto y los cálidos colores elegidos para la propuesta, son sólo la excusa para empoderar un relato de lucha de castas y supervivencia, de amor y sueños, de poderes y legados. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) se desvive por comprender cuál es su lugar en el mundo, ya que si bien sabe que sus padres, y particularmente su madre, le dicen constantemente cuáles son los mandatos que debe cumplir, a partir de presagios y reglas, intentará transitar un camino propio en donde la previsión será algo secundario para sus días. Sueños recurrentes lo acechan, en donde una misteriosa y bella joven (Zendaya), tendrá protagonismo hasta que, claro, abra los ojos o despierte de su descanso, otorgándole allí al espectador la potestad de completar un puzzle en el que, independientemente del conocimiento previo sobre la historia, todo se reinventa, se recicla, y se presenta como nuevo. Duna (2021) además de esconder subtramas asociadas a la ecología con el agotamiento de recursos naturales, la explotación de clases (o castas, según la novela), los vínculos, la sociedad, y el amor; se permite jugar desde el deseo de los protagonistas un relato en presente, en donde los flasbacks, flashfowards y predicciones, sirven para potenciar aquello que se sugería en la novela.  Así, Paul pasa de ser heredero poderoso al fugitivo del relato, entendiendo que esta fuga podría alejar malos presagios y malas compañías a su pueblo pero, principalmente, le evitarán ser parte de una historia que escapa a lugares comunes, diezma la posibilidad de alimento de otros pueblos y solo perpetúa mecanismos de sujeción y control. De esta forma comenzará la aventura en la árida superficie en pos de un futuro idílico para los habitantes de esta distopía, que en manos de Villeneuve, se transforma en una épica shakespereana. Gracias al carisma del trío protagónico -Chamelet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac- esta primera entrega cierra con intrigas y expectativas hacia lo que vendrá, nuevas aventuras plagadas de traiciones y enconos familiares, pero con el amor como objetivo final."

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Adapting the sprawling, detailed world of Dune is no easy feat – many have tried and failed to come close – but I think Denis Villeneuve’s Dune has done an excellent job in translating the world to screen. The visuals and worldbuilding are astounding – they feel so authentic and real, capturing the otherworldly essence of Dune to a T. I was eager to see how they would reproduce certain features of the world – like the sand worms or the ornithopters – and my god, the film delivered such an immaculate vision. Needless to say, this is one of the best films of 2021, giving us a cinematic experience that is top-notch and practically unmatched.  Dune is centred on Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), heir and son to father Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), as well as the son of Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit. The Duke has been bestowed a gift from the emperor – the world of Arrakis as his fief, one which has copious amounts of the precious spice needed to run basically everything. Arrakis was previously the fief of the Harkonnens, under the leadership of the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), and as you can imagine, they are not pleased with being usurped. So, the house of Atreides head to Arrakis with a sense of foreboding, aware that the deck is stacked against them, and things can fall apart at any point.  The adaptation does a really good job at feeding us information without feeling the need to dry hump us with exposition. They use the characters and dialogue effectively to convey the necessary details, and it is really quite impressive considering the inner monologues that inundate the Dune text. All the actors perform flawlessly, regardless of how minimal their appearance is in the film. The sparring scene between Josh Brolin’s Gurney and Chalamet’s Paul is intense physically as well as rich with emotion, and such a great way to reflect the tensions everyone is experiencing in the move to Arrakis.  Oscar Isaac does such a great job in fleshing out Leto’s struggle as he feels the impending doom envelope him. He’s a noble man who wants to be a good leader, however, he’s but a pawn in the larger political forces at play. Chalamet is perfect for the role of Paul, showcasing the transition of Paul’s joyful innocence to that of a cold determination, as well as his strife with his destiny. Rebecca Ferguson handles the duality of Lady Jessica beautifully – she can be so aggressive and ferocious when using ‘The Voice’, but also vulnerable when it comes to her family and her son.  The absolute masterclass performance of them all is Skarsgård’s turn as the Baron. It almost seems like he was channelling Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now; it’s uncanny how similar the performances are. His mannerisms, coupled with the contrasting physicality of the character, gave every scene he was in a simmering tension. Other standouts include Jason Momoa as Duncan, and Dave Bautista as Rabban; the latter actually making more of an impression emotionally than for his physicality.  Han Zimmer went all out with the soundscape – you could feel the ground rumble as the thopters took off, and the sheer spectacle that entailed the arrival of the Reverend Mother. My only qualm is that the sound mixing is a tad uneven, since there are moments which are spectacularly loud, so much so that it masks the dialogue. The IMAX experience is truly a transcendent one, but a set of earplugs might be a good investment just in case the volume proves to be too much.  As for the story and narrative, when it comes to a sci-fi text like Dune, it is impossible to reflect the entire world’s nuance into a slightly more than 2 hours film, so we do lose some of that richer details, like how important water is on Arrakis. The transition between scenes could also use more cohesion, since we cut to new settings with little to no context, and newcomers to the world would need to play catch-up or read up on the lore after. Whether or not Villeneuve’s Dune is considered a successful adaptation or not will wholly depend on the second part in this duology, since part one is merely a setup. It speaks to Villeneuve’s capabilities as a director that I am able to watch this film – which is more than 2 hours long – and crave more. Impeccable on every level – cinematography, sound design, characterisation – if there is any film you need to watch this year, it is Dune.

"Oct 26, 2021",POSITIVE," I will never watch any kind of making-of documentary or behind-the-scenes featurette about Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. I don’t want to know how this film was made. I prefer to believe the extremely convincing illusion that Villeneuve somehow traveled to the year 10,191 and documented the strange civilization he encountered. Dune is full of stylization and visual artistry, but the future it conjures feel so complete and tactile that some segments play like a documentary of the world to come — which is an especially impressive feat since that world involves giant sandworms that consume everything that passes through their sphincter-like maws. The sandworms and all of Dune’s attendant accoutrements — telepathy, a hallucinogenic substance known as “spice,” the vaguely bondage-ish “stillsuits” that characters wear to recycle their bodily waste back into water — have always seemed very silly to me, someone who has never read any of Frank Herbert’s many Dune novels. The same goes for David Lynch’s baffling but oddly endearing film adaptation, which I’ve enjoyed despite the fact that I can never quite follow what is going on in it, even though characters explain the plot in almost every single scene. To my amazement, and to Villeneuve’s credit, this new Dune is totally clear in its premise, politics, and operatic sci-fi story. It’s also filled with the sort of epic grandeur of vision that Dune fans always insist makes the original text special. Watching this movie, I finally understood why generations of readers and directors fell under this material’s spell. Villeneuve took a novel that has confounded many great filmmakers of the past and created something coherent, compelling, and visually remarkable. The trick, it seems, was in only adapting the first half of it. As the opening title card indicates, this is technically Dune: Part One. Villeneuve wanted to break Herbert’s book into two sections and shoot both simultaneously, but Warner Bros would only put up the cash for one film. Whatever they paid for this half of Dune, they got their money’s worth. The word that kept coming to my mind throughout the film is decadent. Villaneuve and his team created a totally credible (if still absolutely bonkers) future, and it looks like cost a fortune to do it. Everywhere the camera goes, it finds new and peculiar things to look at, like spaceships that stay aloft by fluttering their four wings like a giant dragonfly made of steel. From the sets to the costumes to the props, nothing feels like it originated on our planet; everything bears curious and otherworldly shapes and contours. I kept craning my neck to try to peer around the edges of the frame, wanting to soak up as many of the fabulously weird details as possible. The only area where the illusion slips is in the realm of acting, not because the cast is bad but because most of the performers are huge, recognizable stars. (A movie of this budget and scope needs brand-name actors to bring in skeptical audiences, but a Dune full of unknown talents would have been even more delightfully alien.) The central figure of the story is Timothee Chalamet’s Paul Atreides, the scion of the powerful House Atreides. This regal family, led by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), rules over the planet Caladan until it is ordered by the Emperor to relocate to and supervise Arrakis, the borderline uninhabitable desert world where spice is found. The assignment could make House Atreides the most powerful family in the galaxy, or destroy them if they fail to fulfill their duties. House Atreides also has to contend with their rivals from House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis led by the corpulent Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), and the native people of Arrakis, the subterranean survivalists known as the Fremen, led by the mysterious Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Paul, the son of Duke Leto and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebeca Ferguson), joins the rest of his family on Arrakis, where he learns he may be a prophesied superbeing known as the “Kwisatz Haderach.” The young, slight Paul seems skeptical about his grand destiny, and he’s plagued by bizarre dreams of places he’s never been and people he’s never met — including a beautiful Fremen woman played by Zendaya. All of these actors are outstanding. Isaac radiates equal parts strength and sadness as the charismatic Duke Leto. Bardem has just a handful of scenes, but he immediately gives pathos and gravitas to the plight of the subjugated Fremen people. Paul’s closest advisers and trainers are two warriors, played by Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa, the latter of which looks especially jazzed to be surrounded by so much sci-fi splendor. Momoa brings a wonderfully earthy energy to a movie that can otherwise feel a little cold and distant. And Chalamet really sells Paul’s journey from innocent kid to battle-hardened warrior. The struggle between the Harkonnens and the Atreides builds to some truly astonishing visuals. Some are beautiful, others are horrifying; all are so much fun to just look at, particularly on a big screen. Dune will premiere simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max and while it’s worth seeing however you can, there’s no doubt that the film benefits from the size and immersion of a theatrical experience. (I haven’t seen it in IMAX yet, but I want to – I’m sure it’s even more spectacular.) In truth, Dune does feel like an incomplete story. (The last line, ironically, is “This is only the beginning.”) Whether Villeneuve gets to make Part Two depends largely Part One’s success. Call me a cynic, but I suspect that means we’ll never see this story finished. Either way, I would rather have one magnificent portion than a frenzied, nonsensical whole."

"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," It’d be an understatement to say that there’s a lot riding on Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, with a massive fanbase and eighteen sequel/prequel novels. Previous adaptations have been troubled. Jodorowsky’s 1970s attempt fell apart before cameras could start rolling, and David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation was a critical and commercial failure (not to mention a film Lynch would come to disown). On top of all that, studios are desperately looking for a film to pull the box office out of a slump that even Marvel can’t seem to beat. Can the helmer of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 bring us a Dune that will please fans and critics alike? A resounding yes. The story of Dune has such a deep mythology, rife with history, political intricacy, and terminology, that it’s hard to run through all of it with any brevity. Here’s my best: the Atreides family of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and son Paul (Timothee Chalamet) are sent by their emperor to leave their lush homeworld of Caladan and take over the desert planet of Arrakis. Arrakis is a wasteland, but a valuable spice essential to space travel is mined there. Two key factors make this dangerous for the Atreides. First is that the natives of the planet, called the Fremen, are hostile to anyone coming to their home to harvest spice. The second is that the most recent rulers of Arrakis were the Harkonnens, major political rivals to House Atreides. Paul is the heir to these political struggles, but has also been trained in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, a mystical order of priestesses of whom his mother is a part. When the Harkonnens carry out an attack on the cities of Arrakis, Paul and Jessica flee into the desert, where they hope to find help from the Fremen. It’s a massive story (and the film is only part one – part two is still in pre-production). But handling something this big is one of many things the film does so well. To convey such a massive wealth of mythology to audiences who may have no knowledge of the IP is a difficult task, and this script does it wonderfully. It never leaves us confused or feels overly expositional, always dancing on the line in between. The history is built into the integrity of the story in such a way that we grasp many details without ever having anyone explain them to us. The mythos of the world feels deep and real, and does much to ground the story. Villeneuve has earned his sci-fi bona fides in spades by this point so it should surprise no one that the look and feel of the film are spectacular. Along with Oscar nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser, he’s created a world that feels both ancient and futuristic. This is where some of the best sci-fi shines, and one of the things that has drawn people to Dune over the years. Even though it’s about alien planets and space travel, more of it feels centered around myths and ancient prophecy. It reaches forward and backward in time, creating a fusion that’s unlike anything else we’ve seen. The settings and battles on Arrakis feel like they could have come out Mesopotamian history. The film reaches true epic proportions, and draws us deeply into the magic, prophecy, and wonder of this universe. Many signature elements of Villeneuve’s style are found here. Muted color palette, imposing monolithic architecture, high contrast visuals, especially in the interplay between light and shadow. The use of the dark effectively highlights the mystery behind so much of the story. Whether it’s the conspiracy between the emperor and the Harkonnens, the powers of the Bene Gesserit, or the secrecy of the Fremen, it all feels dark, ominous, and tantalizingly elusive. Much of the film is shot in the deserts of Jordan, and likely even more of part two will take place there. When it comes to desert films, it’s hard not to think of Lawrence of Arabia – in fact, Herbert was said to have taken influence from Lean’s film, to the point where an earlier draft of his novel found Paul “too much like Lawrence.” Villeneuve doesn’t ignore that influence, but doesn’t rely too heavily on it either. The film also succeeds where others have failed when it comes to the details of the world-building. Some things, like the sand worms for instance, were understandably hampered by special effects capabilities in the past. This time around the filmmakers are capable of so much more with visual effects, but Villeneuve chooses to hold details back, keeping everything eerie and mysterious. This keeps the effects from looking flashy and plastic like they often do in Marvel films. The practical details are fantastic. From the weaponry to the stillsuits to the palace furniture, everything has its own sense of history and fits snugly into its part of the world. Of course, there are always superfans who will be disappointed at the film’s inability to match what’s in their minds. But this film is by far the best adaptation of the book, and it will undoubtedly bring lots of new fans into the Dune universe. It’s exciting, mysterious, beautiful to look at, and a lot of fun. Everything you could want from a Hollywood blockbuster. If the team can deliver as much for Part Two, we’ve got lots to look forward to."
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," We’ve waited a long time for director Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune,” and, yes, it has been worth the wait in terms of its overpowering visuals and sound design. The technical elements do all but smother the ecological, sociopolitical critique, but it’s there in battles for the rare commodity spice, imperialist incursions affecting the native Fremen culture, and the imperial family skirmishes. Set in the year 10191 on desert planet Arrakis where the hallucinogenic spice, crucial for interstellar travel, wafts in the air, House Atreides faces multiple crises as power plays and an attempted coup ensue. A distinguished sisterhood, ferocious sandworms, traitors, physical and emotional confrontations, ritual duels, and tests of bravery: these and much more complicate the way forward for House Atreides. Wisdom proves elusive, visions plague heir Paul, and exposition abounds in a complicated empire. Hans Zimmer’s innovative sound design weaves its way through the entire film, at time bombastic and, at other times, subtle, even elegant. It is unfailingly resourceful with metal, bamboo flutes, whistles, drums, distorted guitars, a cello, and newly created instruments accompanied by song: Indian, Celtic, and Tuvan singing (all of this elaborated on by Darryn King in the New York Times, October 23.) Equally, technically marvelous, cinematographer Greg Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette deliver breathtaking work, but two hours thirty-five minutes running time is demanding, even for this exceptional film. Director Villeneuve reports that Frank Herbert’s 1965, immensely popular sci-fi novel was the bible for them. “Dune” does disappoint in its pursuit of more complex, conflicted characters, due, I suspect, to Villeneuve considering this film, its opening title “Dune Part One,” an appetizer, there to build the foundation of this world. I’m ready for the main course. As encouraged by all involved with “Dune,” THE way to experience it is in IMAX where its special effects and sound design deliver a spectacular immersion. Check listings."
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," The word I keep coming back to is monumental. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is monumental in a way that hasn’t been true of a film in a long time. The director and coscreenwriter has taken a story that is familiar — and not just because it’s based on a book, by Frank Herbert, beloved by many — and told it with uncommon elegance and pensiveness, even dreaminess, on a scale that is breathtaking. 
No one is making movies like this anymore. Hardly anyone ever did. There’s sweep here like nobody’s business. [snip] No one worldbuilds in movies the way that [George] Lucas did… yes, even in the less-than-satisfying second [Star Wars] trilogy. The bigness of Lucas’s vision is positively expansive, of a civilization sprawling enough so that even the biggest of the big baddies — Darth Vader, the Empire — are nothing but a distant rumor to many.
 But now, here, with Villeneuve’s Dune, we have something like that again. And getting caught up in it is magnificent. Even if Dune is a very different kind of movie. Yes, it’s another hero’s journey (and a white-savior one, too, dammit), though this is more like if Star Wars was presented from the perspective of Princess Leia. For here we have young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet: Little Women, Beautiful Boy), heir to House Atreides, one of the great houses that rule, under an emperor, interstellar human civilization in year 10,191. Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac: The Card Counter, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), has just been commanded by the emperor to take over the mining of spice on the planet Arrakis; the spice is the most valuable commodity known to humanity, because its hallucinogenic qualities allow navigators to traverse interstellar space. (It just does, okay?) This new post for the Atreideses is dangerous for many reasons, not least because the “brutal” House Harkonnen, from whom the emperor has stripped the spice franchise, is unlikely to take this lightly. But Duke Leto is a genuinely good man — grading on the curve of capitalistic colonizers, at least — and believes he can bring peace to Arrakis, which has been torn with strife under Harkonnen rule. Paul isn’t sure if he can wear the mantle his father expects of him: to take over House Atreides, eventually. And he’s been having dreams of Arrakis, even before the emperor’s unexpected command, and of a young woman of the indigenous Fremen there, called Chani (Zendaya: Spider-Man: Homecoming), though he doesn’t know her name yet. These dreams are strange to him, and even possibly prophetic… because Paul has inherited talents from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson: Reminiscence, Doctor Sleep), a former acolyte of the “witchy” Bene Gesserit sect of women who are powers behind thrones everywhere. For one thing, they don’t use the Force, but they do use the Voice, with which they can command the weak-minded. Soon enough, we learn that Paul, thanks to his mother’s doing, may even be the Kwisatz Haderach, a savior prophesied by the Bene Gesserit. (As you may suspect or already know, Lucas was inspired by Dune when creating Star Wars. The Luke analogue here might be Chani. Funny how these sorts of stories only ever allow women to be on the periphery but never at the center. Do the men who invent these tales imagine that women have no angst, no doubt, no desire for adventure, and no fear of actually succeeding at it? Can a woman never be any flavor of Chosen One?) But unlike Star Wars, this is not a movie about space battles, and while it is about revolution, that is only maybe just beginning to foment here. (This movie is but Part One. We must hope Part Two gets greenlighted.) There is some action, some things getting blowed up real good, but mostly Dune is supremely dignified, often quiet even in tense moments, a thoughtful and stunningly gorgeous movie about ugly things: oppression and imperialism, political maneuvering and strategic assassinations, parents who bring children into the universe to serve their own presumed grand purposes. The performances by the wonderful cast are terrific: to a one, they bring a gravitas to the proceedings that elevates the film even further. This is a solemn movie that treats science fiction with the seriousness it deserves, and too rarely gets onscreen. There is nothing winking here. But in many ways, this Dune is all worldbuilding, of the best, most engrossing kind. There are few infodumps, and those we get are gracefully presented, as when Paul watches a “film book” about the ecology Arrakis. Mostly, Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) lets us absorb the reality of human existence eight thousand years from now in the majestic vistas of Caladan (played by the fjords of Norway) and Arrakis (for which the deserts of Jordan stand in), and in little touches that clue us into how people live: “How does it feel to walk on a new world?” someone asks Paul when the Atreideses arrive on Arrakis, and so we learn that even for a young man of immense wealth and privilege like him, interstellar travel is rare. (Even the vast expense of an imperial visit to Caladan is marveled at.) Atreides tech — oh, those excellent insectile ornithopters! — looks different from Harkonnen tech, neither of which could be mistaken for imperial tech. Enormous ships defy gravity… but a bagpiper acts as a herald for House Atreides. Memories of Earth linger on these worlds — in names like Caladan (echoing Caledonia), like Duncan Idaho (Jason Mamoa: Aquaman, The Bad Batch) — but they are memories only. If you’re a fan of this particular type of science fiction, of big, broad, far-ranging space opera… if you long for alien landscapes, for new worlds, here they are. Dune may be unfinished, even as it clocks in at more than two and a half hours, but it is deeply satisfying nevertheless. I am not going to say “You must see this in a cinema, and on the biggest screen possible!” I did see this in IMAX, and it was indeed enrapturing. But we are still mid-global-deadly-pandemic, and cases are soaring in the US and the UK, where many of you reading this are. (If you’re somewhere else, where the pandemic has been better controlled, lucky you!) If you feel comfortable going to a cinema, please wear a mask and go at a less busy time, if you can, even if you are fully vaccinated. If you decide to see this at home, you will still find enormous pleasures here. And, I have no doubt, many of the films that hit screens this year and last will, in coming years, get big-screen rereleases. No movie is worth risking your life or your health, or those of others, for.  “The emperor of the known universe,” whoever he may be, dispatches Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his clan to take over from the Harkonnens (a real bunch of bruisers) on the dun-colored planet of Arrakis, there to continue the vital harvesting of “spice.” This, allegedly, is the most valuable of all substances, for it aids interstellar travel. I think, rather than see the actual film, I’d like to see a comedy about a stoner college student writing a terrible, derivative science fiction novel that was inspired by the book. This was the second half of a double feature following No Time to Die, an interminable car commercial of a film, so I was already a tad grumpy going in.  Keeping that in mind, I failed to be swept away.  The scale of the special effects was neat, but I didn’t care about any of the characters except for Lady Jessica (thanks to Ferguson’s excellent acting), so there was almost no tension in any of the political maneuvering or fights. I already complained about this in BladeRunner 2049, but my lord and lady does Villeneuve love him some walking shots.  The Wizard of Oz doesn’t have half the amount of walking that this film does, and that movie is literally about a girl walking on a road.  It’s possible that I’m just not a fan of Denis’ directing style and visuals – they feel a bit too sterile and safe.  Say what you will about Lynch’s glorious failure – the “box scene” and floaty man’s heart plug drainage is still stuck in my head thirty years later – I doubt I’ll remember anything from this version in six months. Wait, that’s not true, I will remember its callous disregard for basic physics.  There’s a scene where Skaterboy Lawrence and Our Lady of Hypnotic Persuasion are being tossed around like a ragdoll in their dragonfly copter but appear surprisingly stationary and unjostled.  “Oh this is supposed to be some kind of metaphorical internal image depicting their mental calmness,” I rationalized, only to see them shake and shimmy like Kirk and Spock on the deck of a torpedoed Enterprise moments later as they glided in a relatively straight line.  Do physics exist or do they not, Denis? Please make up your mind good sir. One positive – I did enjoy the music, especially the funky throat singing on the Emperor’s planet. However, if you happen not to enjoy the music, you will quickly be driven insane.  A few films have what I would call an “overbearing” soundtrack – then there’s this movie, in which the majority of the scenes feel like a soundtrack with a movie playing in the background.  I like to sit in the first row which was a big mistake this evening – my ears are still ringing two hours later.  The music is admittedly great though, much better than the desert tech demo/walking simulator it’s doing its best to drown out. If you happen to be a huge fan of the novels, then I’m sure you’ll get a kick out of seeing the Quidditch Haberdasher running around in a big budget tentpole flick, even though he doesn’t catch a single golden snitch or even talk about sewing Aquaman a cool hat.  If you’re more of a casual fan of the books, this isn’t a bad movie, at best it might even be half of an average movie, I guess we’ll find out in a few years.  It’s more fun and imaginative than No Time to Die, I’ll give it that.  Just don’t go in expecting the next Lord of the Rings, Empire Strikes Back, or even Game of Thrones.  The review has it right on the money, go in expecting the next Phantom Menace, and you’ll almost certainly have a good time. Yeah, I was mostly being silly.  I love a ton of bad science fiction movies with questionable physics.  I read the books as a wee lad, but have to agree that this is an overall more enjoyable experience.  Herbert’s writing, like that of a lot of sci-fi/fantasy authors, is a bit too heavy on infodumps, and too light on subtle character development for my tastes. This film has even more paper-thin characters than the books, but the visuals are definitely awe-inspiring at times, and the soundtrack is both unique and fitting.  I’m sure if I wasn’t grouchy from nearly three hours of half-assed Bond car chases/cheesy melodrama, I would have enjoyed it more.  In two or three years, when it’s finally complete, I’ll watch the whole thing and reevaluate how I feel. Also, the “box scene” in the Lynch version is one of my favorite sequences in all of 80’s sci-fi, so I was pretty let down by the lack of drama/psychedelic visuals in this version. Except for Ferguson, the casting didn’t work for me either.  Isaac is an outstanding actor, but seems to be phoning it in – I kept expecting him to fall asleep mid-sentence.  Momoa is a lovable meathead who still can’t act his way out of a wet paper bag (surprisingly great on SNL though).  Sting was a lousy actor, but his Feyd Rautha is such a wacko badass it works out – Bautista is a poor substitute (playing a different char. of course).  Brolin is fine, but he sure ain’t no Patrick Stewart.  Bardem and Zendaya are barely there, and I could not take anything Chalamet said seriously with that relaxed, skaterbro accent or take any of his fights seriously with that heroin-chic physique. I cared about more than Ferguson’s character.  In fact, this time around, she’s relatively flat and one-note.  Chani, Stilgar, and Feyd-Rautha were much more compelling than any characters in the first film. Denis’ visuals are less safe and sterile, and far more gritty, visceral, and filled with emotion, due in large part to the film centering around the Fremen, but also due to much better directing which wisely relies less on dialogue and leans into grand spectacles much more.  Many of the sweeping shots feel like a Jean Giraud comic come to life, and the first worm-riding scene is one of the best-shot and scored sequences I’ve seen in years. The “rocketpack” anti-gravity physics are kind of silly, as are the magnetic barn-door, anti-vehicle explosives, but there’s nothing quite as egregious as the dragonfly-copter goofiness of the first film. The racial stereotypes are dialed back slightly.  There’s still an uneasy sense that this is “sci-fi Muslim Noble Natives vs. Nazi Royals in Spaaaaace with those pesky Psychic Catholics pulling the strings, but that’s accurate to the source material, and the racial undertones are less simplistically patronizing and more present and acknowledged in the story.  The script feels like it’s doing its best to offer a slight critique of  its reluctant white savior,  its noble “savages,” and various religious leaders which is admirable for a big budget film, and far more sophisticated and mature than say the Avatar films.  The Harkonnen remain cartoonishly evil skinheads though, which is a bit disappointing. The soundtrack is still powerfully felt, but not nearly as overbearing, knowing when to pull back and let a moment, vista, or line breathe on its own. Chalamet’s acting isn’t distractingly bad this time.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s still bad – I’m reminded of Hayden Christensen’s understated and emotionally flat performance in the prequel trilogy – but not so bad that I had to hold back laughter as I did in the first film.  He has a couple shouty Braveheart-esque performances that are shockingly adequate. Zendaya’s face acting is fantastic, however many of her line readings are a little too light-hearted “teen-romance,” to fit with the overall tone.  Bardem, Butler, and even the unborn baby command every scene they inhabit and make Chalamet look like an amateur.  I would hesitate before following that twiggy young man into a well-lit grocery store, and yet here we are meant to believe that he’s inspired nations to follow him into interplanetary war. The dialogue is still very cheesy in parts – Walken’s emperor in particular had me using 110% of my willpower to avoid cackling like a lunatic in the theater – but thankfully as I said, there was much less talking, so the corniness wasn’t nearly as distracting.  All in all, definitely worth a six-buck half-price Tuesday ticket.  That first-person worm wranglin’ scene and a gorgeous overhead shot in which Fremen heads resemble individual grains of sand parting for the Mujahideen/Quiz Burt Bacharach are worth the price of admission alone. Hopefully in a few years we’ll see a similar jump in quality from this film to the third and finally receive a satisfying conclusion. Regarding the “White Saviour problem”, Frank Herbert had already tackled it back when the book was published, by pointing out how Paul is anything but (and the whole “Prophecy” is nothing else than a false religion created by the Bene Gesserit). The central theme of “Dune” is that mindless ecological alteration done for profit (or any other reason) leads to disaster. This is what makes the book so important in our current times and I hope that the message will not be lost in the Second Part. That’s an excellent point – I like that Paul cynically uses the Bene Gesserit Prophecy (that he doubts is true) to gain political power from religiously motivated followers for the revolution.  It’s a more realistic and nuanced portrayal of politics and organized religion (and a not so subtle jab at Catholicism) than we typically see in sci-fi blockbusters.  If your hopes bear fruit and that perspective and the ecological message survive in Part 2, I’ll definitely upgrade my opinion. This Part was a little too light on plot/ideas for me, but I suppose it was mostly concerned with world building and accuracy to the source material (primarily via the generous deployment of walking scenes – felt like watching scifi Aaron Sorkin in sloooow motion).  The next part should have some more juicy character development and intricate sociopolitical maneuvering.  My prediction about Part One’s lasting power was correct though.  It’s only been a week, and I’ve already forgotten watching 95% of this. YMMV of course. In this movie, Paul is depicted as a white savior. Whether the Prophecy is “real” or not is beside the point. White Western men, whether Herbert and Villeneuve, think it’s plausible that indigenous people would accept an outsider — who just happens to look more like a white Western man than he does like those indigenous people — as their salvation. Even if you want to take Dune as a critique of the idea of the white savior — and, again, there’s no hint of that in this movie — we can still question that critique being structured as it is. What about L. Frank Baum’s Dorothy?  And doesn’t a male character in one of the later Oz books turn out to be a girl? (“Ozma”?) I’m sure it’s not an accident. But the movie still centers Paul. This is Paul’s story, which creates empathy for Paul. The Fremen are barely characters."
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," In a world where movies are dominated by massive special effects and every prospective blockbuster is now expected to run over two and a half hours, we risk losing a sense of awe. “Dune” defines everything in large scale cinema, from its look to the music and source material. Denis Villeneuve’s opus is such a grand venture at 2 hours and 35 minutes, that it cannot encompass all of the narrative in Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel. This film has been so hyped and anticipated, that it may surprise some viewers when the opening credits announce that this is actually “Dune: Part 1.” Herbert’s devotees will no doubt want to know how faithful the film is to their cultish book, which was famously filmed into a flop by David Lynch in 1984. Taken on its own merits as a movie, however, “Dune” is a genuine work of awe. Above anything else, it succeeds in transporting the viewer fully into its world. The plot is as in the novel. We are far in the future in the year 10191. Galactic powers obsess over a resource known as spice, which can act as a potent fuel and has hallucinatory properties. The main source for spice is the desert planet of Arrakis. A mighty Empire is the central authority while various houses compete to get ahead. One of these is the house of Atreides, led by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), who with wife Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) has a son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Paul has been having intense dreams and visions, which suggest he has inherited the mind-control abilities of his mother, who belongs to the mystical order of Bene Gesserit. The distant emperor then decrees that the Atreides are to take over the governorship of Arrakis. This excites Duke Leto since now the family will rise in deserved prominence. They land in the barren planet and learn about its harsh environment from which spice is mined. Giant worms traverse beneath the sands, triggered by motion. Beyond Arrakis there is a plot against the Atreides being hatched by the Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), who seeks to rule the desert planet. A worthy adaptation of “Dune” has been a sci-fi Holy Grail for decades. The stories are well known, including how before Lynch made his version, legendary surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky planned a wildly creative take with a cast that included Salvador Dali and Orson Welles. Pink Floyd was to contribute to the soundtrack while designs were made by the painter H.R. Giger (who would later design much of “Alien”). You can see this story in the great 2013 documentary “Jodorowsky’s Dune.” Maybe it’s as a wink to that vision that composer Hans Zimmer recorded a cover of Pink Floyd’s “Eclipse” for the early trailers of this “Dune.” Like many anticipated titles, this one’s release had been continuously delayed by the pandemic. Now that “Dune” here, it feels like the best cinematic interpretation we’re likely to get of Herbert’s messianic novel and a culmination of where Denis Villeneuve as a director has been heading towards for years. At first science fiction was not the genre instantly associated with this visually rich filmmaker. He’s been making features since 1998, but starting in 2016 with “Arrival,” the Oscar-nominated film about language and alien contact, and 2017’s “Blade Runner 2049,” the stylishly immersive sequel to Ridley Scott’s classic, Villeneuve established himself as a unique sci-fi director. What he does so well is envision the material in an organic way that is grand and vivid, yet keeps the story at the center. Working with screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, Villeneuve manages to take the essence of the story and craft an epic film out of it. Much of the originality in Herbert’s creation is in all the influences he mixes together. “Dune” is Shakespearean royal intrigue infused with mysticism, political allegory and very entertaining action. Villeneuve opens with a quick introduction narrated by Chani (Zendaya), a native of Arrakis who describes how her planet has been continuously invaded for its natural resources. Sound familiar? The Atreides royals dress in uniforms that look out of some World War I portrait, even if Paul practices his fighting skills with force field shielding with Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin). Letters are still sealed with wax. Much of the first act is about establishing the world and interests at play. Duke Leto wants to prove he can run Dune and tries to get along with the local “Fremen” clans led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who know best how to survive in their desert home. Layered over that is Paul’s increasing visions, which hint at more than merely inheriting his mother’s powers. It is sensed Paul might be a prophetic figure foretold long ago, who will rise in Arrakis as something more than just a prince.  In the hands of a lesser director this could have been a very talky yawn. Villeneuve instead immerses us. “Dune” is a modern-day version of the kind of large-scale filmmaking that used to be associated with directors like David Lean, now combined with the gritty, mechanical futurism of a James Cameron. It’s “Lawrence of Arabia” meets “Aliens.” Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser shoot much of the film in the IMAX format, which makes for an exhilarating experience in the proper theater. Instead of depending purely on exposition dialogue, the story is seen. Great wide shots of landing armies in vast Arrakis capture the potent metaphor of imperialism in the narrative. Interiors are not overly designed, but detailed enough to really feel like a complex, alien world with stone murals in dining halls depicting past histories. Vast ships in the void of space cover the screen, with even smaller vessels flying out to land on the dune world. Stellan Skarsgård is unforgettable as the massive Baron Harkonnen, who is equipped to elevate himself when necessary. His first appearance is out of “Apocalypse Now,” bald, surrounded by steam, with a deep bass of a voice. Scenes of war and combat that follow are visceral but also stark, with visual links to Villeneuve’s 2010 “Incendies,” a powerful film inspired by the Lebanese Civil War. This is science fiction on a level more vivid and imaginative than a throwaway popcorn distraction. Armies gather in rain-drenched worlds where beings speak in crackling languages. Women walk in veils that seem plucked from a medieval dream, like Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling), head of Lady Jessica’s mystical order. Zimmer’s music gets otherworldly with its electronic dirges. Despite all this high-budget excellence, Villeneuve still pulls some good performances out of his vast cast. Timothée Chalamet eschews the macho posturing of typical space adventures and plays Paul like both the inexperienced prince in training and a would-be messiah grappling with the insecurity of his visions. He’s brave but sensitive. You need to sense fear, even in a messiah, when the Harkonnen enemies finally attack and shatter his world and Chalemet pulls it off well. Zendaya’s Chani is more earthy and a born fighter, even if we don’t get much of her in the movie until the third act. “Dune” is a trove of good supporting roles, where even Jason Momoa plays a royal guard who is also Paul’s palace buddy. Of course he still gets to beat up entire waves of enemies and swings a big sword around. The point is he’s perfectly cast. In a film of this type you’re essentially playing mythical characters. No one seems self-aware and inhabits this world and its rules. Oscar Isaac’s Duke Leto is truly an ambitious monarch, even in a rubber suit that recycles your sweat into drinkable water for long walks around Arrakis. Dave Bautista is a wonderfully menacing acolyte nephew of Baron Harkonnen, pillaging and warlording when commanded.  Unlike David Lynch’s version, which is a guilty pleasure in its own curious way, Villeneuve decides not to cram all of Herbert’s novel, which was the first of a wider series, into one film. “Dune” ends at a moment where all that is missing is “To Be Continued” appearing onscreen. In a sense this robs it from feeling like a complete film because the narrative never has its own form of closure. You really need to either read the book or wait for the next film, if it happens, to find out what happens after the final shot. Yet “Dune” is such a bold gesture within mainstream films that even with an abrupt ending it’s worth seeing, and on the biggest screen possible. Villeneuve could have easily made an extravaganza full of rapid editing and endless action scenes to drown out the story. “Dune” has action and effects that will surely be nominated for awards, but it doesn’t rush and is concentrated on telling a saga with a classic feel. "
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," The peaceful moment is shattered. Horns blare ominously as a soldier in an alien-looking space suit and flowing robes trudges through the twilight desert, lasgun in hand. “At nightfall, the spice harvesters land,” the girl says, and we see one such machine, like some fiery beast amidst the plumes of darkling sand. “The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day,” the girl says as the drums beat faster. We see men and women laying in ambush in their desert garb. We see the girl, her eyes the unsettling blue-within-blue of her people, the Fremen. “They ravage our lands in front of our eyes,” she narrates. “Their cruelty to our people is all I’ve known. These outsiders, the Harkonnens, came long before I was born. By controlling spice production they became obscenely rich. Richer than the Emperor himself.” We see rows upon rows of vast spaceships lined up in front of sprawling battalions. Men marching. A clash in the desert between Harkonnen troops and Fremen freedom fighters. Lasguns blasting spice harvesters into fiery ruin. “Our warriors couldn’t free us from the Harkonnens,” the girl says over it all, “but one day—by Imperial decree—they were gone. Why did the Emperor choose this path, and who will our next oppressors be?” Of course, this is nothing like the opening to Frank Herbert’s novel upon which Dune is based. The film, wisely, sets the stage for the greater conflict early, introducing us to its chief players before diving headlong into the story. Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), head of the powerful House Atreides, has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take control of the planet Arrakis. House Harkonnen, the wealthy and powerful rulers of Arrakis for nearly a century, have been ordered to leave and return to their home planet of Giedi Prime, leaving a vast fortune behind. Arrakis is the only planet in the known universe where the magical spice mélange can be found. Spice is the most valuable substance in the known universe, granting not only an elongated life-span but also special abilities to various powerful factions including the mystical order of the Bene Gesserit. The mysterious Spacing Guild and its Navigator use the spice to control their monopoly on space travel, granting them an iron hold over the Imperium itself. All of this is established, briefly, during the opening of the film in order to set the stage for what’s to come. It’s a slight divergence from the book, but one that feels necessary to make the adaptation work on-screen. We are introduced to Duke Leto and his Bene Gesserit lover and concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) as well as various members of their household including the swashbuckling Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), the oddly baliset-free Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Duke’s advisor and mentat, Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Stunning glimpses of the Atreides home world, Caladan, and its rocky beaches and tumultuous oceans root us in a place that is utterly foreign to the arid sands House Atreides will soon call home. Here is a water planet, green and grey, mountaintops shrouded in blankets of cloud, rugged but habitable—a stark contrast to the endless sands and sweltering heat of Arrrakis. Director Denis Villeneuve’s Dune doesn’t bother sticking to the letter of the novel, choosing instead to juggle chronology when necessary to ease audiences into what is a complex and sometimes confusing narrative. The novel’s opening sequence comes much later in the film. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of Duke Leto and Jessica, is brought by his mother to a room in Castle Caladan. Here, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), chief witch of the Bene Gesserit and Truthsayer to the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, is waiting. Paul is tested—the Bene Gesserit think he might be the “chosen one” aka the Kwisatz Haderach—by placing his hand in a box while the Reverend Mother holds a poison needle called a gom jabbar to his neck. In the box is “only pain” she tells him, but should Paul remove his hand, he’ll die. Thanks to his training in ‘The Way’, Paul endures, passing the test and taking his first step toward his destiny—a destiny that this film only begins to explore. The important thing you need to know about Dune is that it is only the first of a two-part adaptation of Herbert’s novel. It covers roughly the first two thirds of the book itself, right up to the novel’s time-jump, essentially. This means that it leaves out much of the story as well as numerous characters and scenes that we encounter much earlier on in the book. Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth made a narrative decision to withhold a great deal, presumably for the second film. While we meet the Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista), Paul’s Harkonnen analog, Feyd-Rautha, is nowhere to be found. Much of the book’s politicking and intrigue is missing entirely. I suspect that some of this is being saved for the second film, where we’ll delve more into the Emperor’s scheming. Other exclusions are more puzzling. An entire plot involving a traitor in the midst of House Atreidesis glossed over to such a degree that I’m half-convinced we’ll get some pivotal scenes later in a Director’s Cut. I don’t want to spoil too much here, but those of you who have seen the film and read the book will know what I’m referring to here. Nevertheless, Dune hews close enough to the novel and certainly to the spirit of the novel, that nothing truly important is lost. Herbert’s story is lyrical and almost poetic at times; Villenueve’s film is visually sumptuous and profoundly beautiful, even during its ugliest moments. The film captures the feel of the novel and in many ways expands upon it exactly how a film adaptation ought to. (The 1984 adaptation often follows the letter of the book more closely while not capturing its spirit, and is often cartoonishly grotesque by contrast. More on this in a separate piece). From a design standpoint, this is quite frankly one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. The costume design is as rich and detailed as it is bizarre. The black-robed Bene Gesserit; the oval-masked dignitaries in their elaborate cloaks; the armored troops of House Atreides and the elite Imperial Sardaukar; the simple black tunic that Paul wears; the elaborate dresses of Lady Jessica and her maids as they cross the sands of Arrakis for the first time; the Fremen and their desert garb and water-preserving stillsuits. There’s never a moment in this film where you’re not gawking at something or someone. The special effects feel natural throughout. The body-shields are subtle, a faint blue glow you barely notice after they’re activated turned bright red when a blade passes through (though I wish we’d been given at least one scene of a lasgun interacting with a shield and the terrible fallout such a combination is said to make). A daunting sense of scale permeates the film. The massive spaceships that House Atreides leaves Caladan on are dwarfed by the Guild transport ship that shuttles them through space to Arrakis. The city of Arrakeen is all sand-colored rooftops and shaded interiors. The planet is too hot for bustling outdoor streets. Then there are the massive spice harvesters and the flying carry-alls that bring them to and from the spice deposits; the insect-like ‘thopters people use to fly across the sands. All the little bits and pieces of Dune-tech that help make the world feel real. You’ve glimpsed these in the trailers but the massive sand creatures are truly a sight to behold on the big-screen. The second film will almost certainly take all this spectacle to even greater heights. Technologically, we have arrived at a place where the scope and scale of Dune can be fully realized, but it’s the artfulness of the design itself that makes the world of Arrakis and its alien technologies and environments truly come to life. The sound design is every bit as impressive as the visual design. The creepy, immensely ominous score composed by veteran composer Hans Zimmer, sets the mood perfectly. It’s a mix of swelling strings, intense choral interludes and subtle electronic elements that’s every bit as dark and foreboding as the film itself. Equally impressive is how the film handles the Bene Gesserit power of the Voice. One scene in particular, in which Jessica trains a reluctant Paul in the Voice’s subtleties, is handled especially well, using sound effects rather than just vocal distortion to convey how powerful this ability truly is. Sound and visual design are used deftly to show Paul’s emerging powers as well, and how the spice affects those powers, intensifying his prophetic dreams and granting him strange, all-consuming visions, often of a strange girl with blue-on-blue eyes who we come to learn is Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen of the desert and a follower of Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Chani doesn’t have much of a part in this movie, but will almost certainly play a vital role in the sequel (a role, I suspect, that will be justifiably expanded on from the books). Some of the changes in the film are welcome. I actually think gender-swapping Liet-Kynes, the Imperial Judge of the Change and planetary ecologist, works well and makes sense. Kynes is played by Sharon Duncan-Brewster who does a terrific job. The film is also far more diverse than the lily-white 1984 David Lynch version, whose Fremen are all bizarrely pale. It is a testament not just to more diversity in film, but also to common sense in filmmaking, that people who inhabit a desert planet have darker skin than those who do not. There is almost no time spent between House Atreides landing on Arrakis and the inevitable Harkonnen assault. I would have liked to see more of Duke Leto’s reaction to the state of Arrakis after the Harkonnen withdrawal. In the book he bristles often at the injustices imposed upon its people by his predecessors and there’s a sense of real tragedy when his reforms are cut short. Here, we skip ahead too quickly, glossing over these details. The film does do a great job with many of the little details, faithfully including small touches like the portrait of Leto’s father and the head of the bull that killed him. These little gestures to fans of the book are nice, to be sure, and serve as rich world-building, but I would have liked a bit more of the scheming and politicking that feature so prominently in the original. That all seems to have been brushed aside, perhaps to keep the runtime in check. Movie studios balk at anything longer than 2-and-a-half hours these days (and often at anything much shorter). Anyone familiar with my film reviews will know of my Rule of 20. That is, most movies these days should be roughly 20 minutes shorter (at least). I’ve wagged my finger at films like Army Of The Dead, Black Widow, Aquaman and even the new Suicide Squad. There are exceptions, of course, such as A Quiet Place Part II and its 90-minute runtime. But with Dune I would have been happy with 20 minutes more. A three-hour Director’s Cut would make me very happy, especially if we could get a bit more of the intrigue, a bit more of the grotesque Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, perhaps a slightly deeper dive into Thufir Hawat and his Harkonnen analog Piter de Vries (David Dastmalchian). Thufir Hawat’s role in the film is strangely truncated as well. Same for the really vile and slightly insane Piter. Mentats are such intriguing characters in the novel, but here they’re little more than advisors. On the other hand, I like that we get a touch of humor to lighten the mood, something utterly absent in the book. I’m fairly certain that Frank Herbert wouldn’t know what comic relief looked like if it slapped him in the face. Duncan Idaho joking with Paul helps alleviate the gloom instantly. So does Duke Leto’s reference to “wanting to be a pilot” rather than a Duke, a gentle little poke at Star Wars if ever there was one. Gurney Halleck telling the Duke “I don’t like that man,” after Stilgar leaves the room made me laugh outloud. There’s a hidden joke in that one. Gurney is played by Josh Brolin, and Stilgar by Javier Bardem. The two were last seen together in the phenomenal Coen Brothers adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s No Country For Old Men. That’s an old feud if ever there was one. Chalamet is the perfect choice for Paul—perhaps not as young as in the books, but does anybody really want to watch this movie with a 15-year-old lead? I’m happy to see Oscar Isaac land a truly great role in a space opera, having had to suffer through three lackluster Star Wars films as a character whose potential was never fully realized (again, the “wanted to be a pilot” jab is on-point). Jason Momoa brings Duncan Idaho to life and gives him charisma and verve he doesn’t really have in the books (though my girlfriend was not happy when he shaved his beard partway through the film). Chen Chang as Dr. Yueh also does a terrific job, though his role has been cut down far too much. At least the Imperial-conditioned doctor is played by an Asian actor this time and lines up much better with how we imagine him in the book. Though, speaking of Imperial conditioning, we don’t really get . . . anything at all about that in the movie. Skarsgård is an imposing Baron, though even with all the added pounds he’s never quite as morbidly obese as I pictured the Baron in my mind’s eye. I should also note that neither this film, nor the 1984 version, portray the Baron’s fat the way I see it in my imagination. In the book he’s propelled about on suspensors since he’s simply too fat to walk otherwise. I always pictured these attached to every part of his body: His arms held up by suspensors, sagging flesh draped over each one. Suspensors on his back and around his belly and clasped to the rolls of fat on his thighs and buttocks. Here, the Baron only has suspensors on his back which he uses to float high above the ground, making him almost pillar-like as he hovers above his hangers-on and bodyguards. Here he looks fat but also tall. I want him floating about closer to the ground, his girth everywhere at once. Dune is a visual feast and a space opera tour de force that should please fans of the novel despite some small changes and its missing final act. I’m not sure how newcomers will feel about the movie, but if nothing else they’ll have plenty of gorgeous vistas, incredible sets and masterful CGI to enjoy, and perhaps a world they’ll be curious to delve into further. (Check out my Dune book club over at my Substack if you’d like to read up on the novel). There is much of this story yet to be told, though I suspect the sequel will need to embellish the novel’s final act a great deal. That’s not a bad thing, actually. Unlike The Hobbit which devolved into ludicrous inanity in order to stretch out to three films, Dune the novel could actually use some embellishing. Crucial characters have yet to be introduced and a great deal of courtroom skullduggery and all-out desert warfare (much of which I believe the novel glossed over far too much) is still to come. Of course, Dune: Part II remains theoretical at this point, hinging on the whims of Warner Bros. and the success of Part I. Even then, a sequel would be years in the making.

"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  The Independent Film Festival Boston winds down its excellent Fall Focus program this weekend at the Brattle Theatre with Sunday’s three hotly anticipated films: “C’mon C’mon” from Mike Mills (“20th Century Women,” “Beginners”), starring Joaquin Phoenix as a radio journalist on a cross-country trip with his young nephew, and “Petite Maman” from Céline Sciamma of “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (2019), about two young girls who meet in the woods and discover strange connections. Furthering that theme of haunting ties, the fest concludes with Pedro (“Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “Pain and Glory”) Almodóvar’s “Parallel Mothers” (a sold-out area premiere), in which Milena Smit and Almodóvar regular Penélope Cruz star as strangers a generation apart who find themselves linked by time together in a maternity ward. The Brattle fires up its Halloween program this week with “Folk Horror Beyond the Wicker Man,” inspired by Robin Hardy’s 1973 cult classic. The slate includes the Monday area premiere of Kier-La Janisse’s documentary “Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror,” a deep (three-hour) delve into the evolution and legacy of folk horror cinema. Among those chiming in is director Robert Eggers, who cut his name on folk horror (“The Witch,” “The Lighthouse”). On Tuesday there’s Piers Haggard’s classic period piece chiller “The Blood on Satan’s Claw” (1971), in which the children of an 18th century English village fall under the influence of demonic forces and behave accordingly. On the quirky, unintentionally camp side there’s “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988) from Ken Russell (“Tommy,” “Altered States”) starring Amanda Donohoe, Catherine Oxenberg and Hugh Grant as those on the quest for the giant snake of lore. The film screens Wednesday – a film in off its own drinking game. Thursday brings to the screen Chad Crawford Kinkle’s “Jug Face” (2013), in which worship at a pit in the woods sometimes brings healing and happiness; other times, very bad things happen. On Friday the original “Candyman” (1992) with Kasi Lemmons, Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen hits the screen, followed Saturday by Ari Aster’s art house horror hit “Hereditary” (2017). Aster’s feature debut about possession and inevitable fate rivets, though it’s his follow-up, “Midsommar” (2019) that took lore gore to a whole new grim level. Sure, it’s an improvement over the 1984 misfire by David Lynch, but it doesn’t quite close the book on the notion that “Dune” is unfilmable. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, a logical choice after sci-fi gos “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017), the film looks great in scope and atmospheric moodiness. It’s blessed with a talented cast too, but like that 1984 film the roles are tag lines and the characters never become much deeper than their screenplay summation; the man-boy warrior (Timothée Chalamet, who loses out to Kyle MacLachlan in the hair wars), the loyal guardians willing to die at a moment’s notice (Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin) and so on. The intergalactic machinations to topple the noble House of Atreides, the clan housesitting Arrakis, the barren planet of the title with coveted resources, never really hits a convincing chord. Nor do the giant sandworms patrolling the seas of desert or the Fremen, indigenous people routinely oppressed by imperial forces dropping into their backyard to strip it of the valuable spice melange that enables spaceships to navigate at warp speed. The film’s a two-parter; here’s hoping the next chapter kicks up a little more sand.

"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," Following up the near-universal acclaim of his Blade Runner sequel, director Denis Villeneuve returns to the big screen with his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction epic. Grander in scope than any of Villeneuve’s work yet, Dune is proper, ambitious blockbuster filmmaking for grown-ups. Among the four-quadrant, brightly-lit Black Widows, dragons and kaiju that dominate this year’s biggest screens, it’s easy to forget that blockbusters can be for adults, too. Last year, Tenet was going to save event cinema, and Bond’s Walter PPK is still smoking after Craig’s final shot as 007. But it’s Dune, in its assured bombast, belief in the patience of its audience (at two and a half hours, this Part One covers around half of Herbert’s first novel), and truly epic scale that is the first major Hollywood tentpole to offer some reassurance that big ‘E’ Event cinema is not going anywhere. That is to say, there is no way to experience the sturm und drang of Villeneuve’s space opera other than in the cinema, not least because of Hans Zimmer’s ludicrously big score. Zimmer’s compositions are always muscular, but here he squeezes every drop of thunder from the barren landscapes of the planet Arrakis, whose stewardship is fought over by the warring Houses Atreides and Harkonnen. Equally big are the performances from a dream cast: Timothée Chalamet is perfectly cast as the callow Paul Atreides, heir to House Atreides, currently led by Duke Leto, played by a fulsomely hirsute Oscar Isaac. Rebecca Ferguson fills out Jessica Atreides’ ferocity and depth of power, while Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa bring muscle, charisma, and some much-needed levity as Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho. Elsewhere, Stellan Skarsgård is as slimy and revolting as Herbert ever imagined the corpulent Baron Harkonnen, while Dave Bautista waits in the wings for his shot in Part Two. It’s hard to imagine a more faithful adaptation of a science fiction novel, both in its streamlined narrative fidelity and the realisation of its world, from the architecture, costumes and iconic, sublimely monumental sandworms. Without question, this is a far more accurate representation of Herbert’s vision than has ever before been realised, hitting pretty much every major story beat from the text. But in pursuit of absolute fidelity to the page, something of a unique vision is lost. This is almost a literal translation of the text – Villeneuve’s Dune looks and feels as it does, essentially, because that is how Herbert’s Dune does. It’s gratifying, awe-inspiring and often stunning – for my part it is always how I imagined Herbert’s novel – but there is little of the visceral madness of David Lynch’s maimed version, or of the imaginative promise of Jodoroswky‘s legendary lost interpretation. Herbert purists may balk, but being served up a one-to-one version of Dune, perhaps we miss the potential of its vision. If there is one flaw to Villeneuve’s rendering of this pulp-Shakespearean tale of power, aristocracy and galactic colonialism, it is one shared by much of his recent filmography. Villeneuve nails the grand opera, but often misses the human scale. He is in thrall to the awesome, but it’s an awe that rarely transcends into the sublime. The psychology of his characters, too, is of the broadest variety (arguably a feature of the source material), who more often than not feel like chess pieces to be moved around on an epic board. Perhaps it’s unfair to expect nuance among the grandeur, but in aspiring to David Lean as much as to Shakespeare, Villeneuve misses some of the humanity of his inspirations. "
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," A mining heir goes native and joins the insurgency. A civilisation that plunders natural resources is forced to find a new way to live. Dune’s environmental allegory, the one writer Frank Herbert smuggled into his seminal 1965 sci-fi tome, would end up being the rudiments for David Cameron’s Avatar almost half a century later, while Star Wars, with its desert backdrops and coming-of-age sorcery, owes it a huge debt too. This is the third attempt at making a decent fist of Dune on the big screen. Alejandro Jodorowsky was intent on putting together a lavish 10-hour take on it in the mid-1970s, but it didn’t get much further than pre-production. David Lynch’s 1984 version ended up being whittled down against his will from three hours to two, with the filmmaker disowning the finished product as “a failure” to be put behind him. Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) has emerged over the past decade as one of the finest sci-fi/action filmmakers of his generation. Some would argue, he eclipses even Christopher Nolan when it comes to blockbuster sweep wedded to an auteur sensibility. Dune’s generations of fans would have greeted news that the French-Canadian writer-director was helming this latest go at committing the novel to the big screen with caution. But Villeneuve, who has yet to make a bad film, is one of their number, and your gut tells you the images, sensations and textures he formed back when he was a teenage fanboy himself, have been exquisitely actualised here. With all such outings, there is a mythology that newcomers must get to grips with. Playing the young messianic Paul Atreides is Timothée Chalamet, upon whom the entire saga hinges. His father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) has secured control of the planet Arrakis, where the hugely valuable and potent mineral “spice” is mined. Paul has inherited special abilities from his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is part of an ancient and powerful coven of intergalactic mystics. The planet is inhospitable, not only due to its treacherous desert climate and the gigantic burrowing sandworms that are drawn to the mining vessels, but also its native population of “Fremen”. These are warriors who are understandably averse to seeing their homeland stripped of resources by outsiders. The greatest threat however are the motives of House Harkonnen, a violent race led by Stellan Skarsgård’s obese Baron that for some reason has ceded control of Arrakis to Duke Leto. A betrayal, a battle, and an escape see Paul and Jessica flee into the vast scorching desert. Survival will depend on them locating the Fremen and winning the trust of their leader (a parched Javier Bardem). Paul, who has been experiencing strange déjà vu on Arrakis, is in for his ultimate test. Villeneuve (co-writing with Eric Roth and John Spaihts) has split Herbert’s doorstop in two, meaning that by the end of its 150 minutes, it can feel like you have only watched half a film. Worryingly, part two has yet to be officially green-lit, with Warners on hold to see the sales figures before committing. Let’s all cross our fingers and hope that it does. From the stunning production design (take a bow, Patrice Vermette), set locations (Jordan, Abu Dhabi, etc), costumes (Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan), the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, to the conceptual rendering of an intricate world in which we are swiftly embedded, Dune is an aligning of stars that occurs the very odd time when a project is steered by a very clear and affectionate vision. Arrakis comes to us as a real place, not some coded digital greens creen but a living, breathing landscape cut with natural light and colour by cinematographer Greig Fraser. Chalamet proves there is enough ballast in his young shoulders to carry a film as broad and epic as this. Front-and-centre, he may be, but there is an ensemble circling him – Skarsgård, Ferguson, Brolin, Zendaya, Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Jason Momoa, Charlotte Rampling, et al. All feel tailor-made to the task, and this again is down to Villeneuve’s clarity of tone. It’s absurd to think that the conclusion might never see the light of day, consigning Dune yet again to Hollywood’s cursed tomb. If Warners come good, however, and more of this arrives in due course, we might end up with the first truly great epic film series since The Lord of The Rings. Rebecca Hall’s directorial debut, which she adapted from Nella Larsen’s novella, is an ambitious one. The theme, of light-skinned black people passing for white in a deeply racist society, is close to Hall’s heart because it was how her grandfather lived. In 1920s New York, a light-skinned black woman, Irene (Tessa Thompson) moves nervously around a predominantly white area. She bumps into an old friend, Clare (Ruth Negga) who is living an entirely “white” life with an odiously racist husband (Alexander Skarsgård). Back in Harlem, Irene, disgusted by what she has seen, refuses to answer Clare’s letters. But Clare, missing the life she turned her back on, charms her way into the proudly black life Irene lives with her husband Brian (André Holland). Shot in black and white, the film is beautiful. It has some fascinating themes, like race-generated shame. Negga shines and Thompson is very good but her character is a bit thankless. However after a powerful start, the story sags in the middle. It also leaves too much unanswered in the lead up to the dramatic denouement. It may not prove engaging enough for some viewers. The Boss Baby, the animated comedy from 2017, made over $500m. A sequel was inevitable. And the sequel is here. Much of the same team, director Tom McGrath and writer Michael McCullers, have returned, as have most of the voice cast. As with any sequel, it is not quite as original as the first film, but it is great fun. Thirty years since the events of The Boss Baby, the Templeton family have grown up. Ted (Alec Baldwin) is a super successful businessman who doesn’t have much to do with his family. Tim (James Marsden) is a stay-at-home dad to his two daughters and he is worried about eight-year-old Tabitha (Arianna Greenblatt) who seems too focused on achieving. His second daughter, Tina (Amy Sedaris), seems like a normal baby, however she is a secret agent of BabyCorp on a mission to investigate both Tabitha’s school and its headmaster, Dr Armstrong (Jeff Goldblum). It’s all about family values with a dash of concern for the pressure on children to achieve. Sure it’s milking the first film’s success, but it works well and kids of pretty much any age, and their accompanying adults, will enjoy the humour, fun and animation. In 2015, Ben Platt starred in the enormously successful, award-winning Broadway musical, Dear Evan Hansen. He was 21, playing the titular role of a socially anxious, teenage boy. One frequent criticism of Stephen Chbosky’s film version of the musical is that Platt is now too old for the role. But onscreen teens are often played by older actors, the cast of Grease had an average age of 27. However, it is the use of prosthetics to hide Platt’s age that creates a strange effect. The biggest issue is actually the premise. As a therapy exercise, Evan Hansen writes himself a letter. The letter ends up being misconstrued as the suicide note of a boy called Connor (Colton Ryan). Evan exploits this misunderstanding, ingratiating himself with Connor’s parents (Amy Adams, Danny Pino) and sister, Zoe (Kaitlyn Dever). It is an interesting premise for a horror. It is a weird idea for an inspirational story. Evan Hansen seems a creep, not a hero. That said, younger audiences might embrace the theme of overcoming obstacles more than this old cynic did."

"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," Luces borrosas, figuras espeluznantes y enormes máquinas arrastrándose por el desierto: Dune, la nueva versión del clásico de ciencia ficción de Frank Herbert del mismo nombre, comienza con imágenes apocalípticas. Casi nada se ve a través de la arena, que asfixia y se extiende sobre el paisaje. Todo en este mundo sombrío, donde los poderosos luchan por obtener aún más poder, habla de una hostilidad abismal. Cualquiera que se pierda en el planeta Arrakis irá directamente al infierno. Durante mucho tiempo, esta boca del infierno estuvo controlada por la Casa de Harkonnen, pero el emperador aparta a los explotadores sin escrúpulos y pone la gestión del planeta desértico en manos del duque Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). A partir de ahora velará por Arrakis y promoverá la descomposición de la sustancia más valiosa de todo el universo: la especia. Al comienzo de Dune hay una nueva partida y un gran cambio de poder, las imágenes opresivas, sin embargo, no sugieren ningún cambio para mejor. Más bien, estamos lidiando con la espera de un desastre. El director Denis Villeneuve pone en escena los dos primeros tercios de la película como una lenta cuenta atrás que narra sin piedad las últimas horas de la casa de los Atreides. La cautivadora partitura de Hans Zimmer zumba amenazadoramente de fondo, mientras que los desolados panoramas de lugares solitarios y desiertos se revelan ante nuestros ojos. Las personas son diminutas en comparación con las estructuras a través de las cuales se mueven, absolutamente sin sentido. Sin embargo, en Dune existe la idea de que el individuo puede cambiar algo. Leto no viene a Arrakis para tomar de los Fremen locales más de lo que ya se les dio. En cambio, busca soluciones pacíficas a un conflicto que ha estado sucediendo durante décadas. Sin embargo, en el fondo sabe que el Emperador lo envió a morir al desierto. Dune transporta esta carga desde el primer minuto con grabaciones desesperadas, melancólicas y escatológicas. El director de fotografía Greig Fraser, tiene un extraordinario sentido para capturar la desolación quejumbrosa con imágenes en movimiento, por lo que Dune se convierte a nivel visual en el cine en una impresionante experiencia. La película se desarrolla tranquila y pensativamente para que cada toma pueda respirar. Sobre todo, como naves espaciales lentamente sobre la hostil estructura de ese mar de arena. Otro motivo, claramente más íntimo que se repite en las imágenes, son las habitaciones oscuras en las que solo cae un estrecho espacio de luz. Aquí, la película cuenta más sobre los personajes y su incertidumbre de lo que podría hacer el diálogo. A veces, destellos de esperanza iluminan los rostros de los temerosos, a veces las sombras arrojan un hechizo. Dune nos muestra pequeños extractos de una historia mucho más extensa y compleja, solo gradualmente la luz atraviesa la oscuridad y emergen los abismos ocultos de la trampa mortal que es Arrakis. Dune quiere ser el preludio de una epopeya de ciencia ficción que traerá el mundo que Herbert inventó a una nueva vida. Si la película, que se basa en la primera mitad de la novela, fuera un éxito, no solo sería una secuela, sino que incluso todo un universo podría seguir. Se está desarrollando una serie derivada llamada Dune: The Sisterhood sobre Bene Gesserit para el servicio de transmisión HBO Max. Warner Bros., que tiene grandes esperanzas en Dune, aunque durante mucho tiempo se consideró que el libro no se podía filmar. Además de las dos miniseries de la década de los dos mil, la controvertida implementación del tema por parte de David Lynch contribuyó a esta reputación. La adaptación de Villeneuve toma decisiones conscientemente diferentes en muchos puntos. En lo que respecta a la atmósfera, es en Dune de este año, que Lynch nos da la sensación de encontrarse en una pesadilla que siempre es una extraña y desconcertante voluntad. Villeneuve nos lleva a través de cuevas intimidantes, templos aplastantes y cámaras funerarias aterradoras, como si el próximo xenomorfo naciera en la oscuridad en medio de todas las intrigas y luchas de poder. Solo visiones y sueños crípticos interrumpen el estado de ánimo hirviente del inminente declive: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), el hijo y heredero de Leto Atreides, mira hacia un futuro que traerá aún más sufrimiento y dolor, pero también dará esperanzas de cambio. Desde Incendies(2009) instan a las imágenes de Villeneuve a convertirse en icónicas, ya que su poder se ve socavado una y otra vez por explicaciones interminables y metáforas intrusivamente simples. Los aspectos expositivo-léxicos de sus películas, sin embargo, ya vienen con la plantilla esta vez. La novela de Herbert siempre ha sido paradójicamente difícil de filmar y hecha para el cine. Como una mezcla de biblia galáctica, enciclopedia ficticia y registro interminable de nombres, la fábula es más una lista que literatura, una enumeración de neologismos exóticos que sugerían la infinidad de un universo entero. La película busca esto de forma inconmensurable en sus imágenes. Dune casi solo conoce rostros y panoramas, personas impotentes y el universo. El individuo solo puede leerse visualmente como una imagen de un santo o como parte de la geometría colectiva: por ejemplo, como soldado en un batallón. Ciertamente no es una película de matices, pero brutal en el mejor de los casos y voltereta en el peor. Catástrofes ecológicas, capitalismo sin alternativa, jerarquías arcaicas, colonialismo y conflictos eternos despiertan el anhelo de un poder que se eleve por encima de las condiciones pedregosas. De un mesías. Las Bene Gesserit lo llaman Kwisatz Haderach, los Fremen anhelan al profeta del mundo exterior, Lisan al-Gaib. Blade Runner 2049, en la que Dune está inspirada de muchas maneras, también fue diseñado como una deconstrucción de los mitos clásicos sobre los elegidos. Aunque Frank Herbert no es precisamente amigo de superhéroes carismáticos, la película se eleva a lo mesiánico, se envuelve en una espiritualidad endeble y juega con los anhelos de una audiencia trascendental y cinematográficamente sin hogar. Es un tipo de cine que a veces se mueve tanto por su propia existencia que no puede ir más allá de evocar sus propias fuerzas primarias. Un placebo de trascendencia. Dune exige asombro, si no sumisión, del espectador y da poco a cambio, excepto el sentimiento de obediencia. Por lo tanto, debe ser admisible preguntarse si las películas de Denis Villeneuve o Christopher Nolan no infantilizan en la misma medida que las de los hegemónicos Marvel-Disney. Como una reflexión lúgubre, como una alternativa falsa, cimentan el horizonte del medio onírico del cine y cincelan sus nombres en la roca en el borde de nuestra percepción. En la negación se cosen a los que luchan. Opulencia sin sentido, artesanía. Un lienzo lleno de dinero, solo que un poco más melancólico. La película termina casi de repente, lejos de cualquier dramaturgia tangible, incompleta en todos los aspectos. Visiones y realidad han coincidido por primera vez, pero no se puede adivinar ningún indicio de finalidad. Cine en franquicia, Dune – Part I. De hecho, sería lógico que nunca apareciera una segunda parte. Si el Dune de Villeneuve seguía lleno de potencial y promesa, siempre se refería a un espacio en blanco. En la nada, hacia la que todo en este universo infinitamente desolado se esfuerza de todos modos. Una visión sin vergüenza de la realidad. Un sueño que puede seguir siendo un sueño.

"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE,"Sumptuous, spectacular with an enormity of sounds and magnificent visual effects."
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s science-fiction novel Dune is one of the best-selling books with the genre.  Released in 1965, the literary work has sold over 20 million copies, has been translated into multiple languages, and is a worldwide success. Though many have tried, up to now all screen adaptations of Herbert’s story have been a bit lacklustre. First there was David Lynch’s Dune, a film which even the director took offence to, then came a slew of made-for-TV adaptations for channels such as Syfy, which covered not only Dune, but the following stories in the series. Undeterred Denis Villeneuve, the director behind instant science-fiction classics Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, has set about creating his own interpretation of Dune. A lifelong fan of Herbert’s book, Dune is a film that Villeneuve has long yearned to adapt. The director has pumped everything he has into creating the most faithful interpretation of Herbert’s source, going so far as to split the story into two separate pieces, making his Dune, Dune Part One. It’s a bold opening gambit, titling one’s film as such, especially [at time of writing] with a second film not yet confirmed. Hinging all of his hopes on a successful box office return, Villeneuve is clearly a filmmaker unafraid of rolling the dice and taking chances, but will his gamble bear fruit? The extended run time is a daunting undertaking, and yet it passes by in the blink of an eye. Villeneuve effortlessly whisks the viewer away to this fictitious universe and stuffs all he can into each frame to keep the audience entirely immersed in what is on screen. With so much to see, IMAX really is the best place to experience Dune. The marriage of sound to image is always a key one, but Villeneuve has a history of pairing the two together so intrinsically that only an IMAX set-up can accurately translate to audiences. It’s worth noting too that IMAX screens tend to be better looked after than other cinema screens, and taking a chance on a regular screen outside of London’s West End could leave you with a sub par viewing experience. Multiplexes are notorious for not keeping their screens fully maintained to the desired industry standard. Projector bulbs are often kept in place long after the luminescence has deteriorated to the point that you can only barely make out what the images are; the screen themselves also have a habit of being either visibly dirty, or worse still, slightly warped. It’s a practice that needs to change, terrible projections lead to many simply writing certain films off as having been too dark. This is one criticism likely to afflict Dune as most of the non-sand-set scenes take place in grand shadowy halls.  Epic scale cinematic science-fiction films have a history of relying more on VFX gimmicks and action to sell their stories, and whilst Villeneuve’s has plenty of sumptuous vistas to enjoy, it is the choice of cast that makes Dune so special. Timothée Chalamet leads as our hero Paul Atreides, giving a great portrayal of a boy on the brink of manhood. His Paul is thoughtful, brooding and confident. Entirely a product of his upbringing, Paul is the perfect combination of both of his parents, housing his father’s shrewd mind for politics and his mother’s psychic talents. Taking on the mantle of Paul’s parents are Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson. Issac shirks his Poe Dameron persona as the more serious, and yet warm, leader of the House of Atreides. Imagine if you would that The Lion King’s Mufasa was placed into human form and you have a vague idea of who his Duke Leto is and what he stands for. Of House Atreides it is Ferguson who steals every scene, and almost the entire film. Her Lady Jessica is a brilliant mixture of maternal instinct, keen mind, and ferocious fighter and Ferguson plays her to absolute perfection. If Dune is worthy of any Academy Award nods in the acting categories, it is Ferguson’s performance that is the most worthy. When the calibre of the cast is as strong as it is in Dune, a director could simply sit back and relax, the film could be classed a hit on performances alone. Villeneuve however answers the gauntlet thrown down by his players, giving them a beautiful and wondrous visual playground, pushing visual effects to their limits to create the perfect surroundings. The richness and complexities of the narrative are complemented with an equally vast landscape, the world of Arrakis feels real despite its fictitious origins. Villenueve also pumps in the right amount of tension and dread when exploring Arrakis. The world is overridden with the giant indigenous Shai-Hulud (sandworms), creatures who dwell underground, attracted to rhythmic vibrations, and can appear at any time to obliterate anyone nearby. Sequences featuring these monstrous beasts are especially compelling, in particular the first aerial tour of Arrakis, which culminates in a worm attack, is a masterclass in action and suspense. Dune is likely to be a film spoken about for many years to come, already being touted as this generation’s The Lord of the Rings, and is a worthy recipient of all the praise being lavished upon it. A smart science-fiction film whose characters and world tangibly connect with the viewer, Dune is a grandiose and emotional film that leaves you craving further exploration. Fingers crossed Dune Part Two isn’t far away."
"Oct 25, 2021",POSITIVE,The best kind of popcorn movie with aspirations to a monumental tone and a feeling of grave importance to its razzle dazzle.
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL," Not long after the release of Frank Herbert’s novel “Dune” in 1965, film studios set their sights on making a movie out of it. Three attempts in the 1970s with directors Arthur Jacobs, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Ridley Scott—for very different reasons—never got beyond the pre-production phase. In 1981, producer Dino De Laurentiis hired David Lynch to write and direct a version, which was released in 1984. An immensely gifted artist, Lynch was absolutely the wrong guy to make the movie. Containing nearly two dozen (mostly) A-list performers with close to two dozen major speaking parts, Lynch’s “Dune” clocked in at over four hours, something Universal Studios (largely at the behest of theater chains) summarily rejected. They cut it down to 137 minutes, removing all continuity before releasing it to scathing reviews and anemic box office returns. On the upside, Villeneuve’s adaptation (co-written by him, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth) is light-years better than the “Smithee” interpretation, which isn’t saying much. Considering that Villeneuve’s film covers only half of the novel, the filmmakers had a wider creative berth and a running time far longer than the final “Smithee” cut. To provide even a thumbnail of the plot here would be more confusing than helpful as this is one of the most convoluted stories ever imagined. In printed form, convoluted can be a plus, but on-screen it can become problematic—similar to untangling a gnarly thicket of roses and kudzu. Sadly, “filmable” doesn’t equate to riveting or engaging storytelling. It just means that it’s understandable and somewhat cinematic. At points, the visuals are undeniably breathtaking. Set in multiple worlds, one rain-soaked and green and another arid and engulfed in sand, it offers superb contrast. While all of the buildings are the size of stadiums, most appear starched and monochrome. The human characters are dwarfed by their surroundings and, as a result, a huge emotional disconnect sets in. The central character Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is frequently referred to as a would-be messiah. He’s an almost otherworldly being who will ultimately save the universe. This same type of character was realized with greater clarity and pizzazz with Neo in “The Matrix.” The early international receipts indicate that “Dune” is on its way to at least a break-even finish, yet if the movie doesn’t exceed its budget with lots of room to spare, there will be no “Part 2.” If you’re a “Dune” fan and want to ensure that the second installment gets made, go watch it in a theater. It will cost more and will rob you of your creature comforts, but you’ll see the film the way it was intended and perhaps save the franchise in the process."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE,"Visually, Dune is one of the best-looking films that I've seen in recent memory."
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune is a challenging book to adapt to screen for a few big reasons. Frank Herbert includes practically no filler in his 1965 epic, a densely packed narrative built to naturally resist any efforts to parse it down. A feature-length movie can’t be twenty hours long. It’s easy to explain the appeal of the planet Arrakis or the feud between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen, but concepts like the Muad’Dib or the Bene Gesserit represent ideas that Herbert spent much of his life exploring through the five sequels he wrote before his 1986 death. Director Denis Villeneuve is tasked not only with portraying the events of the story, but also to bring to life the headier parts of Herbert’s world that even hardcore fans can struggle to understand. Villeneuve does not necessarily try to tame the beast that is Dune, instead choosing to emulate the Fremen approach to wormriding. He sinks his hooks into his work’s massive scale and spends the 156-minute runtime desperately trying to hang on. The results are a bit more of a mixed bag than with his previous film Blade Runner 2049, a similar journey into well-trodden, narratively challenging terrain. As a film, Dune is absolutely beautiful. The cinematography conveys its spectacle in every single frame. Having been previously adapted for screen in David Lynch’s 1984 disaster and the solid yet decidedly smaller-scale 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries, Villeneuve finally gives the source material the blockbuster adaptation it deserves. The story falls a bit short in ways that help validate the two previous adaption’s efforts. Dune deserves the big screen, but its material is far better suited for television, a far more forgiving medium to the amount of exposition required. Villeneuve does a pretty good job giving his audience what they need to know, but he’s less successful in harnessing the emotional weight of the stakes at hand. Timothee Chalamet looks a bit lost as the young Paul Atreides. It’s hard to blame him. Dune is really Dune part one, covering roughly the book’s first half. Chalamet is forced to be the star of a coming-of-age story where his character doesn’t get the chance to actually come of age. It’s an awkward dynamic, undoubtedly made more awkward by the film’s handling of the white savior trope at the core of its narrative. Dune is largely about destiny, but it can’t do much to overcome the privileged, mildly tedious nature of its star character. As Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson largely carries the emotional weight of the narrative. Caught between the world of the Bene Gesserit and her loyalties to her family, Jessica is by the most intriguing of the characters in Villeneuve’s orbit that’s forced to operate without much of Herbert’s backstory. The politics of the film’s universe are way too overly simplified, leaving Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) with little to do but stare at things and express love for his kid. Villeneuve has a firm grasp on Arrakis’ awe and wonder, but he never gives the audience a reason to invest in the narrative. The worldbuilding struggles without a strong emotional core. It’s hard to blame him for too much, having put forth stellar cinematography and a first-rate cast. Dune isn’t as satisfying as it should have been considering all the talent involved. Villeneuve makes sure that supporting players like Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson) get their moments to shine, but House Atreides as a whole never really feels like the power center it’s presented to be. There’s too much going on. While part two is practically a foregone conclusion, it’s a fair question whether Villeneuve invested enough in the Fremen during part one. He treats Chani (Zendaya) as an object of fantasy more than a character, a notion that will sit in the audience’s mind for however long it takes to craft the sequel. Javier Bardem and Sharon Duncan-Brewster put forth two the film’s best performances in very limited appearances. Villeneuve may have been better off using Arrakis’ own people to explore the planet rather than mostly through the eyes of its under-developed colonizers. Dune’s action sequences leave plenty to be desired, an oddly refreshing dynamic. Studios were leery of Herbert’s work for years largely due to the fact that it’s not a franchise that relies on battles. Villeneuve makes one of the book’s few epic conflicts look pretty small, an irony that Herbert himself might appreciate. Arrakis has not been kind to those who venture to its world, a notion that applies both to its characters and those who have sought to adapt the material. Villeneuve crafted a beautiful film full of obvious love for Dune’s lore. It’s just too hard to walk away from the epic feeling a little underwhelmed with the final presentation. Maybe that’s inevitable to some extent, but maybe Villeneuve simply got lost in the desert, failing to fully grasp the magic of the spice. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "
"Oct 24, 2021",NEGATIVE,A spectacular but empty film. A single scene from David Lynch's failed version - Kenneth McMillan floating in the air and laughing wickedly - is more cinema than this entire movie.
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE," In an ideal world, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One and the deeply messy but visionary 1984 David Lynch adaptation could be Brundleflied together, allowing for the strengths of each to improve the whole. It wouldn’t take a member of the Bene Gesserit to recognize that combining their disparate pedigrees and execution would result in a hardier, stronger take on the material that keeps its feet sand-bound and its head flashing through infinite space on a spice binge. I love the books, and recognize their grand sense of expansive and mythic storytelling even while recognizing their culturally messy collage approach to building societies. But for a book written in 1965, Dune is a fascinating casserole of environmental science, political theory, religious history and all the drugs, and it has never stopped being a captivating story.  There’s a major gambit afoot in Villeneuve’s film, and it’s in taking a series of books that are both incredibly internal (in the sense of an omniscient narrative voice) and aware of their own mythology (the chapter headings draw epigrams from historical surveys, biographies and communiques, not to mention the very presence and purpose of Princess Irulan, who doesn’t even appear in Part One) and making them into a work that is completely external and of pronounced immediacy. It feels different, though it makes the precognitive aspects of Paul’s dreams much more defined and allows the universe to demonstrate its trippier touches. We have Mentats, but no sapho juice. We have crysknives, but they can be resheathed without spilling blood. We know that the spice found on Arrakis drives the entire empire (the oil metaphor is pronounced), but everything it can do is left on the sidelines. We have too many characters who get streamlined almost into oblivion, leaving their deaths almost meaningless. In narrowing focus onto the travails of House Atreides, we get a compelling and fairly traditional narrative. But Dune is, and should be, more than that. Much of Dune: Part One feels like the radio edit of a Jim Steinman song — it’s still long, and you get the bullet points of what’s going on, but you don’t get the cumulative world-building of all that excess. The most impressive feat that Villeneuve and his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth pull off pertains to the Bene Gesserit, the sisterhood of genetic scientists/psychic warriors who’ve been masterminding the long game of human evolution for millennia. These women are fascinating, because they’re the one faction in this film that we’ve never seen before. CG phalanxes of dudes with swords? Frontline workers in extremely hazardous situations? Piggy rich folk who just want more of everything? Those are all archetypes that any moviegoer is acquainted with. But the Bene Gesserit are their own thing, and they make the film leap to its highest heights, and the forthcoming HBO Max spinoff series devoted to Raquella Berto-Anirul’s matriarchal order should be very interesting indeed. As the Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson is the film’s MVP. In toning down the character of primary villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), the production made a serious error. The books’ Baron is a corrosive gay stereotype, a cruel and jealous monster who slaughters, assaults and pillages the universe all while wielding Shakespearean-level gravitas. Lynch’s film leavened some of his behavior, but still leaves him as a pustulant incarnation of disease and avarice. Villeneuve renders the Baron generically greedy, and allows him to be defined by his fatness alone, which is very Chaucerian choice and also very boring. Do we need the Baron pulling heartplugs and menacing the beautiful boys of the Imperium? Not necessarily. But it would be better than how utterly boring he is here. There’s nothing in this film’s portrayal of the Harkonnens and Giedi Prime that would plant the exact right nightmares in early mid-’80s Chris Cunningham’s head and help create whole new waves of disturbing art. But it isn’t just the Harkonnens who suffer some seriously sanded-down edges. Dune is a weird book, and each of its successive sequels and prequels double down on that vibe. But if there’s one big over-arching criticism about Dune: Part One, it’s that it feels like an audition, keeping its cards close to the chest in hopes that the spectacle, cast and historical heft help bring an audience in. Hopefully, the film’s good-to-very-good numbers overseas, coupled with however it does here, will allow Part Two to bring in some of the glorious strangeness and imagination that defines the books. Let’s have a Spice Agony, a Guild Navigator, perhaps a baliset, and hell, why not some Tleilaxu while we’re at it? So very little is directly explained, which makes the film an incredibly rich field for people who’ve read the books to make like the greediest of children at an Easter egg hunt; there is a tremendous opportunity for weirdo genre enthusiasts (like me) to answer questions for mainstream audiences who have dipped a toe in the Duniverse and are just waiting for the little tidbit to get them to dive right in. There are parts of this film that are overwhelmingly beautiful and majestic, pummeling the cerebral cortex into submission with the sheer scale of it all. I’m already making the effort to road trip with some friends to Chattanooga to see it again on the Aquarium’s Dual-Laser IMAX system, because I’m a big fan of the 1.43:1 aspect ratio. So despite my issues with this particular adaptation, it excels at Duniverse Mood, and that’s what’s going to keep me interested until we see where all this is going, but more importantly, how it’s all going to get there. The irony is not lost on me that to try and judge things based merely on Dune: Part One would be like trying to second guess The Golden Path. So let’s regroup in a bit and we’ll see."
"Oct 24, 2021",NEUTRAL," An hour into Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited new version of Dune, I was confidently dusting down my fourth star and just beginning to wonder whether a fifth might yet be in order. After all, it looks fantastic, Frank Herbert’s sprawling science-fiction novel makes reasonable sense and, best of all, the Harkonnens – one of the two families battling for control of the desert planet Arrakis – are no longer plump, red-haired figures of gravity-defying fun, as they were in David Lynch’s unhappy 1984 production.  But somewhere in the long closing 90 minutes (be warned: this is a very long film) that fourth star slipped slowly away, at least for anyone like me who dips happily in and out of the sci-fi genre rather than being a dedicated devotee. Would it be the House Atreides – represented by the young heir apparent Paul, played by Timothée Chalamet – or the predatory Harkonnens who end up controlling Arrakis’s reserves of ‘spice’, the hallucinogen that somehow also makes interstellar travel possible?  I found I didn’t care quite enough, despite the extravagantly made-up Stellan Skarsgård channelling a lot of Marlon Brando into his performance as Baron Harkonnen. Oh, the horror, the horror. So what goes wrong? With Herbert’s influential novel predating the first Star Wars film by a dozen years, Villeneuve plays up the comparisons, clearly out to establish that Dune got there first. Nevertheless, as Rebecca Ferguson and Chalamet, playing mother and son despite being only 12 years apart in real life, rush around Arrakis dodging dreaded sandworms and searching for the indigenous Fremen people, there’s a sense of having seen too much of this sort of thing before.  And with Dune 2 probably still to come (depending how this one goes down), a lack of resolution doesn’t exactly send you out into the street with a spring in your step either. Some of my closest friends love Wes Anderson films, but hard as I’ve tried, and The Grand Budapest Hotel apart, I’ve never quite seen the appeal. They’re too arch and mannered, over-reliant on that strange deadpan acting that Anderson loves so much and that Bill Murray – an Anderson regular – has down to an underplayed T. He’s here again in The French Dispatch, playing the soon-to-be-dead editor of a Kansas newspaper supplement that has, for decades, celebrated all things French. It’s episodic in structure, with a cast fairly dripping with stars, and each heavily narrated segment plays out as a series of beautifully composed tableaux.  Ethnically speaking, the great American western has historically been an oh-so-white affair as far as main characters are concerned. Well, The Harder They Fall (also on Netflix from November 3) is the western that starts putting that right with a black ensemble cast, led by Jonathan Majors and Idris Elba, playing the goodies, the baddies and everything in between.  Dear Evan Hansen is one of those films where you go in aware that it’s the movie of a Broadway musical, yet it still comes as a surprise when Ben Platt starts to sing. With a contrived-feeling plot involving a US high school, mental fragility and one very big lie, it certainly won’t be for everyone but does just about get there in the end. "
"Oct 24, 2021",POSITIVE," For years, it seemed that the greatest film ever to come from Frank Herbert’s quasi-biblical 1960s sci-fi novel Dune would be a 2013 documentary about the failure to make a great film out of Herbert’s novel. In Jodorowsky’s Dune, director Frank Pavich documented the Chilean-French maverick’s unhinged (and ultimately abortive) effort to mount a screen adaptation with a projected 14-hour running time, featuring a starring role for Salvador Dalí and a burning giraffe. Really. Crucially, Pavich’s engrossing doc suggested that although Jodorowsky’s film never actually existed, it still cast a long creative shadow, with the pre-production work of the French graphic novelist Moebius and Swiss artist HR Giger influencing Star Wars, Alien and pretty much all subsequent screen sci-fi, a claim that cannot be made about David Lynch’s finished but fatally flawed 1984 version. Now, the French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose impressive genre CV includes Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, has made a bold stab at proving that Herbert’s book may not be unfilmable after all. Opening with the words “Part One” and closing with a declaration that “this is just the beginning”, Villeneuve’s Dune sensibly tackles only one manageable section of the story, avoiding the baffling narrative compressions and ellipses that blighted Lynch’s version, while reining in the extravagant excesses that thwarted Jodorowsky before he’d even started. Timothée Chalamet does his usual whey-faced Edward Scissorhands impression as Paul Atreides, beset by dreams of Fremen girl Chani (Zendaya) on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. Here, the houses of Atreides and Harkonnen vie for control of the “spice” trade, a magical dust viewed by the desert-dwelling Fremen as “the sacred hallucinogen that prolongs life” but harvested by off-worlders as the highly prized (and thus highly priced) key to navigating interstellar travel. Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth conjure clear plot lines that accent the contemporary colonial parallels; this is a tale in which wealthy overlords battle over mineral resources in a vast sandy region that they find hostile and dangerous yet irresistibly profitable. There’s an almost comedic element to early scenes of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) arriving on Arrakis, heralded by the blaring of bagpipes. Meanwhile, Charlotte Rampling shrouds her admirably straight face behind sinister black lace as Reverend Mother Mohiam, attempting to divine whether Paul is actually the prophesied one (“I hope you live,” she says dismissively), while Rebecca Ferguson steals the show as Lady Jessica, torn between her desire to protect her son and the mysterious legacy of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. So much of Herbert’s novel has become part of the fabric of popular science fiction that at times Villeneuve’s film may seem deceptively derivative. Whether it’s the samurai-style swordplay and inner voices of Star Wars or the Matrix-like question of Paul’s foretold divinity, many riffs can feel familiar. What makes them new is Villeneuve’s astonishing visual sensibility. From ornithopters that flit like dragonflies to vast spaceships that glint in the mist, these are the kind of sights that Roy Batty rhapsodised about in his dying moments in Blade Runner. Yes, there are explosive action sequences and a booming Hans Zimmer score, but there are also low-key moments that reminded me of the mournful air of Jacques-Louis David’s 18th-century painting The Death of Marat. As for the giant sandworms that splash through deserts like eels through water, they are no longer silly but instead spectacular, with credit to visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and his team. Of course Lynch’s Dune contained its fair share of unforgettable sights too, from a steamy Sting posing with wings on his nethers to Kenneth McMillan’s pustular Baron Harkonnen floating absurdly through the incoherent madness of the movie. Villeneuve’s altogether better behaved version (for better or worse) dials down the crazy, with Stellan Skarsgård’s baron favouring the bald-head-stroking of Brando’s Colonel Kurtz, and even getting a haunting Apocalypse Now face-surfacing-through-watery-slime moment. “Dreams make good stories,” says Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, “but everything important happens when we’re awake.” That’s a line that strikes a chord in a film that, for all its unearthly vistas, still manages to make a surprising amount of sense. Whether that can be sustained remains to be seen – there are still mountainous narrative hurdles ahead – but right now, Villeneuve is riding the sinewy worm of Herbert’s sacred text with aplomb."
"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve’s operatic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi classic Dune finally arrives on HBO Max and theaters this weekend, bringing all manner of implications with it. Will the streaming schedule hurt theatrical outcomes? Will it boost HBO subscriptions? Will it contribute to pandemic spread? These questions are more relevant for Dune because the filmmaker and studio repeatedly made those topics talking points leading up to Dune’s release, for better or worse. The results — the film, and the context around its opening — are a mixed bag. Domestically, Dune is poised to take somewhere around $35-40 million, depending on how it holds through the rest of the weekend after a $5+ million early bow on Thursday night and another $10+ million on Friday proper. That suggests a final tally stateside of perhaps $100+ million, depending on how well it holds. With horror films including Last Night in Soho potentially drawing away younger audiences on Halloween weekend, and Marvel's superhero blockbuster The Eternals arriving on November 5th, Dune will have an uphill battle holding strong enough to deliver higher domestic receipt totals beyond $100 million stateside. Ghostbusters also hits theaters in late November, and December brings a slate of big holiday pictures including West Side Story, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Sing 2, The Matrix Resurrections, and plenty of higher profile adult-skewing award season entries. What this means is, Dune is releasing during a pandemic with only a small window to get its legs under it and hold onto its audience long enough to build a financial cushion ahead of continued business from strong word of mouth. It’s a franchise IP, but one oriented far more to older genre fans of the book series and/or the 1984 film adaptation by David Lynch, or who are simply familiar with the title in general. It’s also in excess of 2 hours 30 minutes runtime, so it screens less often each day. Now add in the fact it’s a film with long scenes lacking dialogue and without constant action to keep the pace feeling faster — this isn’t a criticism of such things, merely noting that for mainstream audiences a long film with a lot of long quiet shots and slower pacing is taking a gamble, when the marketing is framing it as the next Star Wars and with trailers making it look like a Marvel movie. It’s getting good grades from early audiences so far, which is great and well-deserved, but it’s also worth remembering the audience showing up for early preview screenings and waiting in line on Friday includes a lot of the most enthusiastic fans. Which means the more average moviegoers’ tastes aren’t quite as well-reflected in those reactions, and I think there’s some danger for Dune that mainstream audience expectations (especially among younger viewers) are a bit different from what the film delivers. Outside of North America, Dune has racked up $130+ million so far. Opening in China on Saturday, Dune took about $6.5 million. This all points toward a probable final international total of somewhere around $200-250 million, heavily dependent on just how high the receipts from China go. The final worldwide tally should fall somewhere in the range of $300+ million. I think the worst case scenario would be in the $250+ million range, if it can’t manage a couple of decent weekly holds through early November, and if it also suffers a weaker-than-expected run in China. On the higher end, I think it’s possible Dune could benefit from enthusiastic word of mouth and some upcoming films underperforming, as well as the Covid boosters combining with declining infection rates just in time for a holiday box office surge. And there’s a chance it could really connect with audiences in China, who might boost it with positive word of mouth and overcome some early concerns that it will fade fast. In that case, I can imagine a scenario where Dune takes closer to $125 million domestic and $300 internationally, for a $425+/- million worldwide box office total. I doubt there’s any scenario in which the film could make much more than that, and the reality is it will probably finish closer to $300-325 million. Off a budget of reportedly $165 million and a big marketing budget, Dune’s break-even point is somewhere around $500 million (the studio only gets about 40% of global box office). Dune won’t reach that figure. So the studio will have to decide they’re committed to this franchise and to working with Villeneuve regardless of whether Dune is profitable or not — the latter being a determination they already made once in Villeneuve’s favor after Blade Runner 2049 fizzled at the box office, so I’m not 100% convinced we’ll get a Dune sequel if this first movie performs as I expect. Keep in mind, Discovery will be taking relatively soon. If Dune scores on the lower/lowest end of potential box office outcomes, then there’s a good chance the new leadership balks at dropping a few hundred million dollars more on a sequel. I’ve decided to address the whole “see Dune in theaters, not at home” argument in a separate article publishing next week. But there are a few things that informed my viewing experience that I need to say, for the sake of my review. I watched Dune on my TV at home. My TV is a 75 inch 4K, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos compatible, and my review of Dune will be better and more positive precisely because I saw it in these conditions. Why? Because most theaters don’t have Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos, so most theaters show a lower quality of the film than my TV. If you think size of screen is all that matters and that image/sound fidelity shouldn’t matter most, then I’d say you have a myopic perspective. The brightness of the projection, the color and contrast capabilities, the audio system — this all matters in conjunction with and in relation to screen size, and most theaters aren’t premium venues with the higher-end options like Dolby Cinemas and IMAX, nor do most theaters keep projection at the brightest levels or properly balance the various factors for maximum experience. But I do, because of my TV and home environment. Other added bonuses: I didn’t have to worry about catching Covid or spreading it to others; I didn’t have to worry about catching the flu; I didn’t have to wonder if some anti-vax protester was going to cause a scene and disrupt the screening; I didn’t have to pay outrageous prices for popcorn; I didn’t miss any of the movie if I had to run to the bathroom; and if I couldn’t hear or didn’t see something, then I can rewind it and watch it again. So if you are wondering if Dune is only impressive and a worthwhile experience in theaters, and whether watching it at home ruins the experience, have no fear — Dune is still going to impress the hell out of you when you hopefully watch it on HBO Max, and you won’t appreciate it any less, or lose any of the story or vision. Dune is visually stunning. It relies on a great deal of gargantuan imagery and sweeping views across expansive landscapes to covey the immense scale of its subjects. Interiors and structures are monolithic, spaceships are enormous and move glacially, deserts are endless moving seas and sandstorms reaching into the clouds. The camera pans, it pulls back, it raises its gaze skyward, forever searching for the beginnings and ends of these seemingly limitless subjects. Such shots are appropriately reverential, with little dialogue and taking plenty of time to let the scenes engulf you. The story unfolds in as straightforward a manner as possible, even if much of what’s happening and the subtext are left for the audience to figure out (or not, as the film is also designed to let you take it all in while understanding comes later, like perceiving the image on a jigsaw puzzle as the pieces assemble). Because the visuals and experiences tell so much of the story without exposition, the streamlining of the tale makes sense and was necessary. The result, however, is a much briefer and — at least at this stage of the telling — relatively shallow story and character arcs, made admittedly grander and more illustrious because they transpire surrounded by such towering spectacle. Still, it’s hard to feel invested in any of the main characters or their fates. Don’t get me wrong, the performances are excellent, but we aren’t presented with a whole lot to personally relate to when it comes to the goals and conflicts the main characters are facing. I appreciate this is only half of the story, and I know it was streamlined out of necessity. But either I feel drawn to characters and their conflicts and aspirations, or I don’t, and I just don’t feel very drawn to them in Dune. The nearest exception perhaps being Jason Momoa’s standout turn as the most charismatic person in the story and the only one who seems purely driven by love of family and friends. Luckily, the story doesn’t frankly need me to heavily invest emotionally in the characters (at least at this point in the story) for me to enjoy the visuals and the approach to storytelling, and to appreciate an operatic adaptation of the novel. So as a big sci-fi blockbuster, it works as entertainment and has enough intelligence to the concepts and story to keep things moving and remain interesting. I can watch and enjoy sci-fi films that are more story-driven and visual-heavy, so the lack of more emotional connection is worth noting here but also not as detrimental as it might otherwise have been. Still, I imagine how much better it would be if we were given more entry into the heart and connections between these characters, in ways beyond superhuman powers and corporate/military strategy. This is also among the more overt “white savior” stories to hit the screen lately, as it’s literally is about a white savior who comes from afar and fulfills the prophecy of a messiah who leads a desert people in revolution against those outsiders who come to take their resources. So that is another factor that prevents easier relatability and engagement with the main characters. It’s no secret Dune is inspired by T. E. Lawrence’s writings, and if you’ve seen Lawrence of Arabia you’ll see that film’s influences on this latest film adaptation of Dune. The story includes social commentary about the Middle East and energy resources, and it uses “Mahdi” and other Islamic phrases and terms. So I’m not reading things into it that aren’t there. Choices were made to intentionally create this analogy, and to present it in this manner, with these faces to the characters. It informs the narrative and is baked into the concepts behind the characterizations. So, sure, Dune is presented this way because it was written that way on purpose. Part of its point is that western society should step away from the move toward secularism and science guiding our beliefs and actions, and embrace the lessons and culture of these other people whose beliefs and culture are driven more by the mind and spirit, by faith and extra-sensory abilities. It represents a white westerner turning against their own empire and own value systems, and instead supporting revolt by an indigenous people against occupation and theft of resources and corruption of spirit. And that is the way it wants to be seen and enjoyed now. The problem with that is, even though it can all be true in terms of themes and plot points, it still relies on the notion that the success and fulfillment of those oppressed indigenous people’s beliefs and revolution relied on the arrival of the “white savior.” While it remains to be seen how they handle this aspect as it progresses in the next film, and while I can see a way the filmmakers might choose to undermine the “white savior” elements with some creative reimagining of certain story elements, I think they’re probably going to go with a more direct adaptation and focus on the previously mentioned themes and concepts to let them stand and be judged on their own merits. Which I believe would be a mistaken direction to go with it. I’m sure some of the property’s fans will be upset and resent that I raised these points, but I would argue you are not taking the film or its themes seriously enough if you don’t recognize these are elements of the story and talk about it. It’s literally part of the original story, and it’s clearly part of this film. Ignoring it, or not discussing all of its implications and whether it’s appropriate for modern audiences, would be a much bigger insult to the story and film than, say, watching it on your TV. The musical score by Hans Zimmer is sublime and as Oscar-worthy as the visual effects. It’s some of his greatest work, and I dare say even if you don’t like the rest of the film you’ll like the music. It is gorgeously haunting, alien and irreverent, but not so much so as to be obtuse or to feel antagonistic toward the viewer. The visual effects are of course mind-blowing, not just looking real and feeling thrilling but also impressing upon us a sense of vast size and movement. The dreamlike sensibilities Villeneuve brings to the passage of time and proceeding of events contrasts well with the way the effects are both realistic and yet also hallucinatory. The production design, costume design, and pretty much everything else in the film is remarkable and likely to earn some award season attention, including deserved wins. It’s an impressive undertaking, and there’s a time when Warner Bros. would’ve dared to put the sequel and a third film into production all at once, akin to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Alas, that was another time, and in light of the pandemic it turns out it’s lucky they didn’t try to film all three at once. As an adaptation, Dune has trimmed a lot but retained most of what the story needed and is still faithful enough to make most fans of the book happy. As a film, Dune is a visual splendor and achieves its desired sense of scale and of wonder so well that it works fantastically on a big TV, without need for a giant theater screen (which is a compliment and testament to the filmmakers’ talents, even if they don’t agree). As entertainment, Dune gets it mostly right and checks most all of the boxes, but it has flaws preventing it from transcending the source material to turn its themes into something modern and universal. You will be impressed by Dune, you will probably enjoy much if not most of it, but it will be the imagery and the sound and the dreamlike flow that move you and evoke emotional reactions, not the plot points or the characters."
"Oct 23, 2021",NEUTRAL," This is Part 1 of Dune (2021), y’all so get comfortable. I know this because when the lights went down in the theater and the title card shown big and bright on the screen it said DUNE (Part 1), and Lord love a duck, I cursed a little. However as many of us are apt to complain about our epic novels crammed into 2.5-hour affairs, I can’t say I’m mad. It’s broken into pieces that don’t feel (really) long and actually look lush despite the harsh desert conditions so we’re not really mad at all. Just mildly irritated. The Planet Arrakis is desert, like all of it. Its one marketable commodity is mélange or Spice, which can power ships, enhance the powers of the mind, and regenerate aging bodies – but the spice itself is only a thing as opposed to the thing in Part 1. What we focus on is the political power struggle for control of its harvest and distribution. The unseen Emperor has, for his own reasons, removed control of Arrakis from “dark and brutal” House Harkonnen to “trying to do the right thing” House Atreides. No one seems happy about this, Duke Atreides (Oscar Isaac) least of all because he’s left with harvesting a very marketable product that only powers the entire universe with damaged and outdated equipment, but he’s determined to forge alliances and make due. He also knows he’s being set up to fail without knowing why, but he can only make the best of a garbage situation. Meanwhile, Young Master Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is unsure of his future role as Duke to the House Atreides as his father would like, but is steered towards latent mystical abilities carefully honed by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) Paul has dreams of the desert, though he was raised on an ocean planet. In his dreams, he sees a blue-eyed girl who is either a future love interest or a means to his end, his visions can’t make up their mind and like his dad, he really just wants to do the right thing. Paul is trained by Duncan Idaho (Jason Mamoa), swordmaster, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), weapons master, two sides of the same unyielding warrior coin, both tough where his father is gentle and nurturing. Their training methods are decidedly disparate, but when used together, Paul potentially has the ability to be the kind of leader his people may need when he comes of age. Anyway, there is the inevitable betrayal and Paul is forced to flee into the desert to make nice with the native Freman, while warring Houses make their way to Arrakis to claim the spoils of an unprotected planet. Did I mention the sandworms? There are sandworms and not the Burtonesque variety either. There are motion-sensing, multi-toothed behemoths, faster than worms have the right, and they make things like spice mining and fleeing through the desert particularly treacherous. Dune (Part 1) is 155 minutes, and in only a few moments did you get the feeling it was running long, however, it’s extremely well-paced, as characters, factions, and plans are allowed to spool out in as natural a fashion as living on a desert planet with valuable sand and warring Houses descending upon your head can be. What I’m trying to say is that it doesn’t feel long drawn out, as if the direct owes anything to the source material, but it also doesn’t feel rushed, with events happening in due time rather than “do it now.” The multiple parts help because while David Lynch certainly tried with his adaptation (Dune, 1984), not even the director’s cut did it justice. I’m looking forward to more to come with Part 2, and maybe if we’re very lucky, we see a cinematic completion of the series in our lifetime. Dune (2021) is rated PG-13 for bloody images, people fighting with swords, shot with darts, and slashed with knives, as well as people eaten by sandworms, blown up, and beheaded."
"Oct 23, 2021",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve is a director that I've adamantly followed since the beginning of his career in Quebec. It took a while for him to finally hit it big. In 2010 he released what is still his best movie, “Incendies”. “Dune” is certainly an ambitious endeavor for him. He’s been dreaming about making a film sourced from Frank Herbert’s novel since his teenage years. Now that Villeneuve has become one of the most popular filmmakers within the studio system, that dream can be realized. Herbert’s novel has always been deemed “unfilmable,” especially since David Lynch struck out with his 1984 adaptation. Of course, Lynch never got his full vision out, at least without major studio interference, but Villeneuve seems to have been given carte blanche here to, at the very least, to make Part One exactly the way he wanted it to be shown. No alterations. No cuts. Pure cinema. That’s what it’s aiming for. Whether it does that successfully is up to the viewer. I’m very mixed on “Dune.” I’m trying to be polite here because I know Denis and he’s one of the most talented filmmakers out there, but I tried watching his sci-fi epic — twice already — and I have come to the conclusion that it just isn’t my cup of tea. It left me cold, distanced, and entirely unsatisfied. Don’t get me wrong, the visuals here can feel transcendent; the sandworm sequence is an astonishing display of CGI, the glow of the spaceships, the legions of army marching down with astute conviction thanks to production designer Patrice Vermette’s sweeping eye. Hans Zimmer’s score is a true original as well, with electronic tones, guitars, and boomy percussion.  Villeneuve tries to honor Herbert’s text the best way possible, so much so that the size of the whole thing feels epic in scope. And yet, even with an astonishing budget, it still fails to fully reveal Herbert’s vision. 155 minutes and hundreds of millions of dollars isn’t enough. There’s also the fact that “Dune,” the novel, has been imitated by so many sci-fi films over the years (Lucas used it as a blueprint for “Star Wars”) that its vision just doesn’t seem as fresh and original today. I may have read the novel way back in high school, but I’m no “Dune” aficionado. The arcane details could have used some more elaborating. Villeneuve should have focused more on building up his characters, delving deeper into the story, the meaning of it all, rather than continuously showing off the grand scale of the whole thing. One can easily get lost watching this film unfold."
"Oct 23, 2021",NEUTRAL," This film covers the first half of the source novel, so many of the book's bigger themes -- including religion and environmentalism -- aren't fully explored. One theme that does arise involves control of Arrakis: The villains (House Harkonnen) oppress the Fremen, while the heroes (House Atreides) try to work alongside them. Paul comes off as a fairly traditional hero but also has started down a dark path by beginning to use a prophecy to his own advantage, setting himself up as a kind of messiah. To prove himself worthy of the Fremen, he kills a man; there are no consequences. His father, Duke Leto, is a far better role model; he's shown to be kind, benevolent, wise, understanding, although his trust and loyalty eventually (spoiler alert) get him killed. Male-driven narrative, but women in supporting roles are quite powerful and admirable. This version improves on previous iterations' all-White casts by including diverse actors (Latino, Hawaiian/Polynesian, Asian, Black), but main characters are still all White, and (spoiler alert) virtually all characters of color die. Has raised concerns in the way it leans on Middle Eastern culture for world-building but doesn't include any MENA actors. No body/size diversity, unless you count the Baron, whose grotesqueness is unfortunately tied to his larger size and eating. Sci-fi action-style guns and shooting. People get shot; deaths/dead bodies. Fighting with swords, blades, other weapons. Battles. Explosions. Character stabbed. Character impaled with dart. Neck-slicing. Beheadings. Characters swallowed by sandworm. Not much blood, but scenes include a bloody hand, bloody knife, blood spot. Poison gas. Crash-landing. Rape is mentioned in dialogue. ""Spice"" is described as a drug that has good properties but is also addictive; the only side effect is that it turns users' eyes luminous blue. It's not really depicted as a substance that can be abused. It's more just ""the thing"" that both the heroes and villains want to get their hands on. Parents need to know that Dune is based on Frank Herbert's epic 1965 novel (previously adapted for the big screen in 1984 and for TV in 2000). It covers the first half of the book and stars Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya. Sci-fi action violence includes lots of fighting, both on the battlefield and one on one, with guns, knives, and other weapons. There are also beheadings and explosions, and characters are stabbed and/or cut open, poisoned, and eaten by worms. A little bit of blood is shown, and characters die. There's kissing and partial male nudity (no sensitive body parts shown). Infrequent language includes ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" and ""hell."" The story is about a drug known as ""spice,"" but it's more of a thing for everyone to fight over than a real drug. While this (long) movie isn't without its flaws, director Denis Villeneuve gives it a languid smoothness that makes for an enthralling tale (which continues in Dune: Part Two). To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In DUNE, the desert planet Arrakis is the source of a valuable drug, called ""spice,"" that allows users to travel vast distances. Spice mining and distribution on Arrakis are controlled by the evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), whose armies oppress the planet's Fremen people. Under orders from the emperor, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) takes over the stewardship of Arrakis and moves there with his wife, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Lady Jessica has been teaching Paul in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, and, once on Arrakis, some of the Fremen begin to suspect that Paul may be a prophesied ""chosen one."" But after a betrayal, Lady Jessica and Paul find themselves in the desert, hunted by giant sandworms, with the mysterious Fremen their only chance of survival. In this first of two Dune movies, director Denis Villeneuve smooths out the most cumbersome parts of Frank Herbert's original tale, providing enough spectacle to overcome the dull bits. With echoes of his earlier films Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve brings a languid moodiness to the storytelling here, slowing things down and allowing viewers time to take in the vast sets (built broad and low to fit the widescreen frame) and devices -- like the amazing, if impractical, ships modeled after dragonflies -- and to keep track of the story's innumerable characters. This rhythm builds to the tale's memorable, invigorating highlights -- such as Paul dodging a life-threatening hunter-seeker or enduring the painful gom jabbar test, or the first appearance of the massive sandworms -- and makes them feel extra vivid. The movie even manages to soften the old, tired ""chosen one"" device, as well as the simplistic plot strands that are covered up by heaps of sci-fi names (how do you pronounce ""Thufir Hawat"" anyway?), places, and devices, making things flow more organically. It's even possible to remember that the original novel, published in 1965, actually inspired much that came after it, including Star Wars and The Matrix. Villeneuve can't quite downplay the source material's choking seriousness, but there are lighter moments. Skarsgard's Baron is a highlight; he's so grotesque that you can't look away. And then there's a swaggering Jason Momoa as swordmaster Duncan, who seems to be the only one having any fun. As with Blade Runner 2049, Dune goes on too long, with too many scenes of fighting, and this version lacks the quirky personality of the 1984 David Lynch take, but it's far more rousing. Families can talk about Dune's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? What are some of the movie's themes? How can sci-fi be used to explore real-life issues like colonialism and representation? How are the Fremen represented in the film? How does this movie compare to the novel, the previous movie, and/or the TV movie? How is it different from those versions? How is it the same?

"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE,Writer/director Denis Villeneuve brings Herbert's world to life in a breathtaking jaw-dropping fashion.
"Oct 23, 2021",NEUTRAL,"You might not be able to tell a player without a scorecard, none of whom are particularly engaging in this lengthy ""Part 1"" assortment."
"Oct 23, 2021",NEGATIVE," It’s surprising how cheesy the new “Dune” looks. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel seems less like a C.G.I. spectacle than a production still waiting for its backgrounds to be digitally filled in or its sets to be built. David Lynch’s version of “Dune,” from 1984, was a profuse film, teeming with sets and costumes as intricate as they were overwhelming, making extended and startling use of optical effects, and, in general, displaying an urgent will to turn the fantasy worlds of the story, which is set in the year 10191, into physical and visceral experiences. Villeneuve’s interests appear to lie elsewhere. He puts the drama and plot first, avoiding details that could be distractions and appearances that aren’t explained (or explained away) in dialogue or action. The bareness with which he depicts the story doesn’t resemble the shoestring production values of nineteen-fifties sci-fi cheapies, but it instead suggests merely a failure of imagination, an inability to go beyond the ironclad dictates of a script and share with viewers the wonders and terrors of impossible worlds. Like most fantasies and futuristic science-fiction movies, “Dune” requires a large amount of exposition to set up the rules of its universe. Lynch, in his “Dune,” hardly distinguishes exposition from drama, because he’s as interested in the what as in the why. His film establishes a phantasmagorical and nearly fetishistic relationship to the material world, to even apparently trivial objects as well as to gestures, phrases, inflections. He unifies his cinematic field, lavishing as much attention to detail—and as much time—on relatively undramatic scenes and background elements as on scenes of great moment. By contrast, Villeneuve (who wrote the film with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) appears embarrassed by the lengthy exposition that the story requires. Rather than revelling in it, he dispatches the necessary information hastily and dutifully, because he knows all too well where the film is going and why it’s going there. There’s a nexus of planets under the reign of a shadowy emperor, whose realm runs on a mineral known as spice. Both a hallucinogen and an energy source, spice is mined in the deserts of the planet Arrakis, which has been colonized for that purpose and, at the emperor’s orders, run by the evil House Harkonnen. But the emperor removes the Harkonnens from governing Arrakis and dispatches the benevolent House Atreides and its leader, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), to take their place—along with his consort, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). But the Harkonnens and their cruel leader, Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), aren’t giving up so easily, and this seems to be all according to the emperor’s plan to lure the House Atreides to its destruction. Arrakis is no empty desert. It’s inhabited by the Fremen, a people who have endured the spice colonies and survived by living underground in elaborate warrens, constructing advanced technology to sustain themselves in difficult conditions. The Harkonnens are ready to exterminate them, whereas the Atreidae want to make common cause with the Fremen and help them. Paul, young and untested, comes to believe that he is the Messiah, the so-called Kwisatz Haderach, whom a religious order of Atreides women, known as the Bene Gesserit, have been trying to breed, from generation to generation, and who will be the savior for both the House Atreides and for the Fremen. What’s more, Paul’s dreams conveniently include, as a special enticement, anticipation of a Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya), whom he will love. Some films were made to be broadcast in several parts but nonetheless play seamlessly as a feature—Bruno Dumont’s “Li’l Quinquin,” for instance, which was made for French TV. The new “Dune,” which runs for two and a half hours, is a single film that plays like a collection of episodes in a series—which, in a way, it is, insofar as the movie ends with a cliffhanger, when Paul meets the Fremen and Chani says (more to the audience than to Paul), “This is only the beginning.” The film includes very short scenes of terse dialogue that slot the story together piece by piece while hardly allowing for dramatic development, let alone the characters’ full perspective on the action. Lynch’s version includes “inner voices”—internal monologues, in voice-over, that, despite being brief, are vastly texture-enriching and deftly add a haunting dimension of subjectivity. Unsurprisingly, Lynch also makes ample and frenzied use of Paul’s dreams and other internal visions. In the new film, these visions are mere snippets and flashes, hints and approximations. Paul is put to a terrifying and mortal test by a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit (played in Lynch’s film by Siân Phillips and in Villeneuve’s by Charlotte Rampling). But, whereas Lynch draws out both the agony of Paul (Kyle MacLachlan) and the specific details of the tortures that he endures, Villeneuve hastily dispatches the same scene and merely winks at Paul’s afflictions. Villeneuve makes “Dune” as if he were his own showrunner, following not the dictates of a domineering producer but his own mandate—to deliver a simplified coming-of-age story and emphasize the cautionary aspect of destructive colonial rapacity and even more destructive Messianic delusion. His images are as rigid and hermetic as the illustrations in a graphic novel. His point of view is without a second level, without physicality, without visceral impact, without an unconscious. The movie’s stripped-down material world correlates with a stripped-down emotional one—narrow, facile, and unambiguous. The prime terror of life on Arrakis is the threat of attack from gigantic sandworms, which are said to grow up to four hundred and fifty metres long, and can swallow a huge harvesting rig in a single gulp. In Lynch’s film, their arrival is heralded by the eerie spectacle of short bolts of lightning sparking up from the sand. Villeneuve’s conception is monotonously literal—the sand bulges, and the maws of the creatures are shown in quick, devouring motion that’s closer to a disaster scene than to one of gargantuan body horror. What’s most startling in this “Dune” is where the sense of directorial passion—of effort, of personal commitment—does go. What Villeneuve appears to savor most is knife duels, fiery explosions, knowing gazes (between Paul and his mother, between Paul and Chani), and the pats on the shoulder that the young Paul gets from his father and his mentor, a warrior named Duncan (Jason Momoa). “Dune” ’s  cautionary tale of a would-be savior reflects strangely back on the movie’s directorial psychology. Far from the excess, the hectic cruelty, and the extravagance of Lynch’s vision, Villeneuve’s is spare, austere, and almost savior-like in its commitment to a coherent and worthy set of principles. Perhaps the film’s very dullness, its withholding of visual and even dramatic pleasure, is Villeneuve’s version of virtue signalling. The prime victims of this austerity are the movie’s actors. Villeneuve has assembled a terrific cast of more and less familiar performers, but he’s given them little time and little leeway. Because the pieces of the movie are calculated to fit together in unambiguous arrangements, the performances are reduced to ciphers. Chalamet, whose theatrical specificity is both an art and a liability, is onscreen for much of the film and yet reduced to a mask of his own appearance. Stuck with a script that denies his character variety and complexity, he delivers a performance that never gets to take shape. What he can do with the role in a second installment may be the biggest cliffhanger of all. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE,A beautifully rendered painting left incomplete.
"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE," Once, another Dune, directed by David Lynch and released in 1984, launched Kyle MacLachlan's career. Denis Villeneuve directs this slicker version of Dune, which benefits modern technology and an all-star cast. This time, Timothee Chalamet portrays Paul Atreides, while Zendaya as Chani haunts him in his dreams. The Dune of 2021 is an awe-inspiring, breathtaking, and enthralling experience. Unlike Lynch's version, Denis Villeneuve chooses to divide the story into two parts, leaving you wanting more. It's a wise strategy because it allows him to take his time with the material. The tricky part is that the studio hasn't yet committed to part two. The battling houses serve as the story's foundation. Leo Atreides (Oscar Isaac) leads Artreides, and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen leads Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). Greed and betrayal are at the root of the problem. A conflict erupts between the two houses over control of Arrakis and its valuable commodity spice. Spice makes space travel easier, and whoever controls it controls the universe. For Paul, this is his first trip on a mission with his father, the Duke, and mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Lady Jessica bequeathed Paul another birthright, which he will use in the future. There's also the Fremen to contend with, they are Araki's residents who have suffered under Harkonnen rule, so they are naturally wary of the Atreides or anyone foreign. From casting to scenery to costuming, the screenplay by Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and Villeneuve chose to go dramatic, and that's a good thing. The visual effects, such as the giant worms, contribute to the story's drama. Finally, this is Paul's story; he's caught in a web of dreams and expectations. Chani, played by Zendaya, is central to the dreams. She's a Fremen. (Her fanbase will be irritated by her limited screen time so that you know.) Chalamet was an excellent choice for the role of Paul. Naturally, he fits the age, but also the angst the young heir is experiencing. He's supposed to lead but isn't allowed until a series of events propels him to the forefront, and all of his training and learning must come into play. The downside is that, while the film entices you with its grandeur, it abruptly ends just as you're fully committed to the adventure. We've sat through 155 minutes (approximately 2 and a half hours) of movie time, and now the credits are playing. While this is a huge gamble, this could also be the best chess move made in movie history because the studio knows where coming to see the second part no matter. Finally, underutilizing a talent like Zendaya is simply criminal. She wasn't the only one who deserved to be given more screen time.  Jason Momoa, and Josh Brolin, are all stunning and could have used a little more screen time. It is expected that Zendaya will play a pivotal role in the next saga, which will disappoint her fans who have come to support the young icon this go around. In the end, if you were missing that grand experience, Dune delivers on all counts, and that isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Escapism is beneficial. It's future might appear to be as hazy as Paul's visions. This movie is everything a sci-fi fan could ask for from Hollywood. We know who is good and who is bad. We have great battles to look forward to, as well as a hero to root for. The best part is that it does not feel overwhelming despite the film's length of over two hours, which is one of its biggest triumphs. We leave the theater disappointed that there wasn't more."
"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE," Few films are as buzzy as DUNE in the past decade and after nearly a year delay, its eventual release date felt like it crept up on me all of sudden. The press screening was packed, which wasn’t always the case lately as most screenings have been barely half full. But DUNE felt like a cinematic event, and the visuals on screen certainly attest to that. No wonder, Denis Villeneuve wasn’t pleased that DUNE will be released on HBO Max the same day as its theatrical opening, even from the first five minutes, this is a film to be seen on as big a screen as possible. Right from its opening screen, I was immediately in awe of the visuals… the world building that Villeneuve has done with his longtime collaborator Patrice Vermette. Set in the year 10191, the universe of DUNE is undeniably vast, so I’m glad I had read up about it leading up to the film. It certainly helps me digest the plot a bit better, which begins on planet Caladan, where the leader of the House Atreides, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) is preparing for a new role as the governor of Arrakis. It’s a lucrative gig given the desert planet is the only place the vital natural resource of spice, aka melange, can be found in the galaxy. Of course, that new power comes with a dangerous enemy, especially from the House Harkonnen, the previous family in charge of mining the spice. Like any greedy colonial government, the Harkonnen is good at stripping any place of its natural resources and using it for their own gain. Naturally, they’re not happy to have to leave Arrakis and would do anything to regain control of it. At the center of the story is Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the Duke’s son and heir of the royal house. Obviously, he’s special given what he’s to inherit, but he’s also got special powers thanks to his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who belongs to a mythical intergalactic guild comprised of women with special powers called Bene Gesserit. The scene between Paul is tested by the guild’s leader Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) is a memorable one and filled with mystery and suspense. The film shows just how revered and powerful this group is, as Mohiam is seen talking to and wielding her influence in both royal houses. The set design, architecture, costumes, and futuristic elements are marvelous to look at. The Atreides’ home base in Arrakis capital Arrakeen looks like a World War bunker with its angular shape, which I read is what the style was modeled after. The construction looks like it could withstand the extreme climate and high winds of the desert planet. I especially LOVE the four-winged, dragonfly-like chopper (ornithopter) used by the Atreides, which was apparently built for real by a company in England specifically for the film. This meticulous details of futuristic elements are the kind of stuff we go see a sci-fi movie for! I’ve always appreciate films shot on location and the fact that DUNE was filmed in UAE and Jordan definitely lends authenticity to the story, you could almost believe this desert planet actually exists. Given the complexity of the story, this film could’ve easily gotten bogged down by exposition. Thankfully, the script by Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and Villeneuve did a good job of not over-explaining things. I like how Dr. Liet-Kynes, the planetary ecologist explains how the Fremen stillsuits work to help survive Arrakis’ harsh environment while commenting on how Paul seems to already be familiar with a world he never steps foot in. It’s obvious that Paul, like his mother, has supernatural abilities who are destined for adventure and greatness. One of my favorite scenes is when Paul is in his room studying Arrakis via holographic imagery and senses a foreign object has trespassed his space. It’s such a cool, thrilling scene that’s beautifully filmed. Given this is just the first part of the story, the script feels more enigmatic which sparks my curiosity. I like the mystery of it all… the secrecy surrounding Bene Gesserit, the Fremen’s native people desert power, etc. There’s a lot to take in, but the film makes it enjoyable to digest them. Hans Zimmer‘s music helps immerse me in the desert universe with its Middle-Eastern motifs and African beats. Just like Villeneuve, Zimmer has been a huge fan of the book in his teenage years. He seems to relish working on this project and the result is an evocative, soulful, and rousing score. As much as I love it though, the music can get overwhelming in some scenes as it overpowers the action. I think in certain parts, the music could have been toned down a bit. I have to commend Villeneuve on the one thing that many filmmakers struggle with, and that is pacing. It’s especially crucial in films over 2 hours long, but for me, its 2.5-hour running time didn’t feel like a drag. I do have my quibbles–for one, the films do feel overly indulgent at times, likely because of the director’s passion for the subject matter. The film’s energy also dips a bit in the second act, but overall it’s well-paced and the talented actors help keep me engaged throughout. Oh and what an ensemble cast it was! Chalamet is perfect as the film’s protagonist, he’s got a strong screen presence with his handsome, youthful face and lithe figure. There’s an inner tumult and angst, which is typical in a teenage boy, but there seems to be something deeper that plagues him… as he constantly dreams of a Fremen girl that’s both seductive and ominous. Zendaya’s Chani is an important figure in the story. Though she doesn’t really get to do much until the third act, her presence is felt throughout Paul’s dreams. In the House Atredeis side, I love how commanding and regal Oscar Isaac looks as the Duke with his glorious grayish hair and matching beard. Apparently, he lobbied for a role in DUNE and he’s spot on as the patriarch who’s protective but also loving to his heir. But then again, he rarely made a wrong move since I first laid eyes on him in Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood as Prince John. I’ve loved Rebecca Ferguson since The White Queen series and she’s got the beauty, strength, and certain mystical aura as Lady Jessica. She has the most screen time with Chalamet here and I like the unconventional mother-son dynamic. In many ways, his mother is also his mentor as she was still training Paul to use the ‘voice,’ an audio-neuro mechanism used to manipulate others.  As the Duke’s most trusted military advisers, both Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa have the brute force as well as intellect required for the roles. The fighting scenes are pretty cool to watch, especially since the characters use an invisible shield, some kind of protective energy field that makes them temporarily impervious to harm. Charlotte Rampling is not in the film much but you definitely won’t forget her in one pivotal scene. In the House Harkonnen side, we’ve got the villainous Baron Harkonnen, who looks like an oily version of Jabba the Hutt. Stellan Skarsgård portrayed the role in full-body prosthetic jumpsuit. He doesn’t have to act much as his body makeup alone does the work. Baron is more repulsive than scary, while Dave Bautista barely has much to do here as his henchman. Javier Bardem plays the leader of a Fremen tribe who has the audacity to visit the House Atredeis without an invitation. He’s a knight-like figure who’s strong and defiant, but like Zendaya, we only get to see him prominently in the third act. Taiwanese actor Chen Chang has some memorable moments as House Atredeis’ family physician Dr. Yueh despite his limited screen time. Last but definitely not least, there’s Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet-Kynes who’s easily one of my favorite characters in the entire film. Apparently, the film changed the gender of the character from male to female in the book, which I think works just as well. Duncan-Brewster has a charismatic presence here so I’m glad to see her featured prominently throughout. I think fans of the book would likely have more things to pick apart than those who have not, such as myself. Herbert’s book has an anti-imperial, anti-colonial theme woven into its larger arcs. Even without reading the book, I could see the unsubtle commentary on Middle Eastern oil (swapped for the spice in this story) and also its environmental message that resonates today in regard to climate change and lack of care for our planet. As for the ‘white savior trope’ criticism towards the book, Villeneuve himself has addressed that as saying that ‘…it’s not a celebration of a savior, but more of a criticism of the idea of a savior, of someone that will come and tell another population how to be, what to believe.’ As someone from a SE Asian country that was colonized for over three centuries by a small country that literally mined our spices, obviously, I’m not fond of this commonly-used narrative. To be fair, I think Villeneuve has tread carefully in this regard and presented Paul’s story as someone who struggles with the idea that he’s seen as a savior. He’s shown as being passionate about learning about Arrakis and its people. There’s a scene where he’s talking to a Fremen watering the native palm trees. You can imagine how precious water is to a desert planet, and Paul questions whether the water should be saved for the people instead. There’s also a scene where he and his mother mimic the Desert Walk of the Fremen where one alters its rhythm while walking on sand. It’s not just for efficiency but for survival given the giant sandworm is a constant threat. The fictional extraterrestrial desert creature is meticulously designed and it’s quite thrilling and suspenseful every time it glides through under the sand and practically swallows everything in its path, even a giant mining machine, if you can’t outrun it. Overall I’m impressed with what Villeneuve has done in bringing his vision of DUNE to life. It’s more than just a feast for the eyes, but the narrative delivery offers something thrilling and thought-provoking. The version we’re seeing is in fact Villeneuve’s vision from when he was a teen when he first read Frank Herbert’s influential sci-fi novel. I’ve mentioned in this post that I haven’t seen the David Lynch version, or should I say the Dino De Laurentiis version as Lynch disowned it. Not that it matters as Villeneuve has said repeatedly that his version wouldn’t have any semblance to the 1984 film. ‘Fear is the mind-killer,’ that’s the book’s mantra, but it might as well be Villeneuve’s as well given he dared to tackle something deemed ‘unfilmable.’ Tackling this weighty project obviously takes some massive ambition, passion, and craftsmanship. It takes an even higher level of courage given that the Montreal-born director took this on after the major box office bomb of Blade Runner 2049 which also happens to be a remake of a 1980s version.  Now, I’m not saying this movie is without flaws. I was hoping there’d be more emotional resonance given the high stakes. I didn’t connect with some of the key characters as much I had hoped, either because they’re underdeveloped or inaccessible. I figure it’s par for the course that the film feels incomplete, as this is just the first part of the whole story (even the poster spells it out… IT BEGINS). One thing is for sure, there’s enough to get me invested in the world of DUNE, and the ending certainly makes me hope we get to see the conclusion in part II. I have my ticket for Sunday afternoon as I am eager to see this as I am aware that this is only the first part of a book that is dense.  It’s best not to watch David Lynch’s version (even Lynch doesn’t recommend it) though I would suggest watching Jodorowsky’s Dune in how insane a project like this would’ve been if Jodorowsky had his way. Curious to hear your thoughts on it! Glad you are gonna see it on the big screen. The book is very dense so I think splitting it into two films is wise, and I hope we do get to see part 2. This is one of the few films that needs to be seen on the biggest screen as possible to appreciate the hard work of the people that made it happened. I was awed at the visual of the film and the sound design was spectacular too. I’m bummed that the IMAX at the zoo is closed, it would’ve been a treat to have seen this film on that giant screen. Finally a highly anticipated film that lived up to my expectations. I was so disappointed with No Time To Die. I don’t have any issues with the whole white savior trope, it’s a film based on a book that’s written in the 60s by a white guy. So of course the main hero will be a white dude but I appreciated that Villeneuve has a cast that’s very diverse. As oppose to the all white cast of Lynch’s 1984 version. Now, the question is when/if we’ll get to see part 2. This was huge production and Villeneuve will need an even bigger budget for part 2 since the big climatic battle will include a lot of visual effects to make it look believable. Also, we still haven’t seen The Emperor’s planet and some other characters. Including Paul’s nemesis Feyd Rautha which played by Sting in the original film. I thought Tye Sheridan was cast in that role, maybe he got cut out of this one and be introduced in part 2. Yeah I saw it at ICON and the picture quality and sound were great! I might try to see it again on a theater with larger screens, I’ve been impressed with Marcus cinema with their UltraScreen DLX. I love the diverse cast and Timothee was good as the protagonist. I’m hopefull this one will make money so we get to see part 2!! I would recommend you see it at a Dolby Cinema in Rosedale Mall, the one in Southdale is having some issues with their audio system. The sound would go silent for a few seconds, it happened like 7 times during the movie. That’s the first time it happened in that theater, I’ve seen several films there and it never happened before. I’m planing to see it the second time this week at The Icon Westend at their 4k laser and Dolby Atmos theater. I’ve been to the Oakdale DLX theaters like 7 years ago, drove for an hour just to experience it. Lol! I remember liking it, the screen is very big. I’ve only seen Timothée Chalamet in two films, The King and this one. So far, he’s been impressive. Hopefully he has a good agent that helps him choose good scripts down the road. He might have similar career as Leo. Ok good to know about the Southdale IMAX, hopefully the get it fixed soon. I’m seeing ETERNALS there on Monday! Thankfully there are a ton of DLX Theaters near me now in the Southeast Metro, the screen is ginormous and the sound quality is pretty good. Yeah I think Timothee has been in a ton of big projects lately and he is talented, I can see him having a long career like Leo. My cinema has plenty of showings for Dune so I prioritised Dear Evan Hansen and The French Dispatch (the former was a terrible mistake!) but I’m looking forward to seeing Dune on Thursday. I’m wary that the hype is going to raise my expectations too high but I’m definitely open-mided. I had a high expectations for DUNE too but thankfully it was met despite some quibbles. The visuals are astounding but I was also absorbed in the story, characters and mystique of it all. I have no interest in Dear Evan Hansen so will for sure skip that. Have been hearing mixed reviews of The French Dispatch though, so I might watch that once it hits streaming service. I also loved the ornithopters and the music!  Those were two of the most prominent things I was thinking about as I came out of it.  It has been a long time since I was so wowwed by the production design of a movie like I was with Dune.  Great review! Hey Ian! Glad you enjoyed this too. It got me thinking maybe they should build a DUNE ride with the Ornithopter-type vehicle at Universal Studios, I’d definitely take that in a heartbeat!! Film is in my blood.

"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert's epic book Dune has so far proven to be quite difficult to adapt to other mediums. It's a dense piece of work filled with numerous terms that have to be learned, tons of exposition, complex political intrigue, immense world-building, and a narrative that is mostly propelled by the constant inner monologue of the protagonist Paul Atreides. David Lynch struggled with it (though he gave it a good effort) and now Denis Villeneuve is the latest director that is trying to tackle the material. Villeneuve isn't new to sprawling sci-fi or complex material having directed Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and Arrival (2016) and so far with the first part of Dune he is off to a good start. Dune follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) the sole heir to House Atreides a powerful clan led by his father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Leto is given domain over Arrakis, a dangerous desert planet that is also home to a valuable commodity known as ""spice"" which gives humans special powers. One such power is the ability to navigate space-time and it is responsible for the ability to travel between planets. Duke Leto takes over a spice-mining operation on Arrakis with the intention of gaining a massive fortune. As spice is such a valuable resource, House Atrides attracts enemies and while all of this is going on Paul is having prophetic visions that may be telling his future. Villeneuve had his work cutout for him because not only did he have to satisfy the detail-oriented fans of the original novel, he also had to make the film accessible to those with no familiarity to the source materiel. He was more successful with the latter than the former, streamlining the complicated exposition of the book and replacing it with grand spectacle. Dune feels a bit like a cliff notes version, hitting most of the important plot points but missing some of the nuance and subtext. With the limited runtime of two films, this was inevitable, and even curtailed, there are a few moments of exposition dumping that drag the pacing of the film. Visually, Dune is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen, filled with incredible cinematography, lighting, costumes, and vistas. The designs have some Moebius vibes, mixed with a heavy contrast sterile futurism that is intoxicating to soak in. It truly feels like one is seeing an alien universe, with few familiar things to anchor it to the real world. Hans Zimmer's score is equally epic, with a sweeping exotic influence that gives way to booming sound design. The obvious metaphor in Dune is the idea of a society that has a precious resource being colonized by outsiders for profit, and most viewers will make the connection between the fictional spice and our real life reliance on oil. The political subtext has taken a backseat in this new version--both the aesthetic and the language of Arrakis is heavily coded middle eastern but it is definitely downplayed in comparison to Herbert's vision. There could be an issue if they don't make a sequel, because a certain part of Paul’s character arc doesn’t happen until the second half of the book and the movie ends before that change. That would leave this film in a vacuum and it might be misinterpreted as a ""white savior"" story when it is in fact a subversion of one (which is lightly foreshadowed). Timothée Chalamet is perfect casting as Paul, as he has a dark haunted quality to his look and acting that embodies the complexity of the character. The rest of the cast does a fine job, but they don't feel as fully realized as Paul, it's as if they are dwarfed by the expansive visuals. Unfortunately, it makes it hard to empathize with anyone outside of Paul, but since the film mostly focuses on him it isn't too detrimental overall. Dune is beautiful and occasionally confounding film, and it's clear that Villeneuve was passionate about the material and wanted to do it justice. Flaws aside, it is astounding albeit unfinished piece of work that hopefully will garner enough accolades to green light the second half."

"Oct 23, 2021",NEGATIVE,"An effort to create a grand science-fiction epic has yielded something cold, something that fails to generate an emotional response."
"Oct 23, 2021",POSITIVE," Over 56 years after the publication of Frank Herbert's massive hit - and 37 years after the release of the only successful attempt at bringing his story to the silver screen - ""Dune"" has been reimagined. And it was well worth the wait. The wait for technology to improve, for audience's appetite for large-scale, science fiction epics to grow thanks mainly to the behemoth of popularity that is Marvel and for the exact right visionary to come into his own. That creative behind the camera is writer-director Denis Villeneuve, and it has his signature mark all over it: alien-like space ships designed with soft curves and ambiguous minimalism in mind, love stories that span time and space, and the role of destiny as a thematic punch. He didn't create this one by himself, of course. Herbert's book provided a dense but colorful story for Villeneuve to work with, and it is by honing in on the core plot and fully fleshing out the characters that ""Dune"" succeeds in building the intensely complicated universe in which it is set. The film takes place in the very far distant future (roughly 20,000 years from now to be a little more precise). Humans have colonized the galaxy and are still the only form of intelligent life. Various human civilizations have evolved over thousands of years to adapt to their new planet homelands. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the only son and heir to Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of planet Caladan. The unseen emperor who oversees all the noble houses in the known universe assigns the Atreides family to take command of Arrakis, a desert planet highly desirable for its lucrative natural resource: melange or ""spice"", a substance exclusive to Arrakis that, when harvested, can extend life. It is also vital for space travel. The emperor is wary of the Atreides family. He is setting them into a trap, and the duke has no option but to attempt his best at reaping the spice and holding at bay the ruthless House Harkonnen who once ruled Arrakis and are plotting a hostile take-back with the emperor's blessing.  The ever malleable Stellan Skarsgård stars as Baron Vladimir, the Harkonnen leader who is truly what nightmares are made of. His portly, meaty figure (that seemingly handicaps his movement except for his horrifying ability to glide omnisciently through the air) is actually quite indestructible. This is a true highlight of ""Dune"", as are all the instances of hair, make-up and special effects that bring these characters, not just to life, but to terrible, incredible, puzzling effect.  Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), Duke Leto's concubine and Paul's mother, is a member of the Bene Gesserit, an all-female group that has mystical powers and works in the shadows to influence politics. Though Paul is set to inherit his father's empire, enduring rigorous physical training  with the Duke's righthand aids Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), he also is learning some of the Bene Gesserit's secrets. His premonitory dreams are of true interest to the Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling), though Paul is much more interested in the subject of his dreams: a Fremen girl with striking blue eyes and undeniable beauty (Zendaya). The Atreides will need all the help they can get as they battle diplomatic foes, the Fremen, Arrakis' native people who roam the planet in hidden caves beneath the sand, and giant sandworms that are attracted to rhythmic sounds and can swallow entire tankers with one gulp. This adaptation of ""Dune"" perfectly encapsulates Herbert's intentions for the work with a heavy, but well-balanced focus on ecology, religion, politics and culture. Chalamet leads the very all-star cast (Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista also star) with the strongest screen presence of the lot. He is gentle at times, allowing the camera to cast its gaze over him without diffidence. He also leads the charge into action with visible strength and resolve as the plot thickens. Ultimately, the beauty and elegance of Villeneuve's grand epic is given the chance to shine thanks to the Shakespearean source material. Unlike other intergalactic chronicles that cannot pack one story with enough heroes, villains, relationships and motives, ""Dune"", even for those who have not read the sweeping novel, is refreshing with its uncomplicated plot and cinematic universe that clearly establishes the world and its people. There is still great depth, emotional complexity and elevated nuance in this sci-fi odyssey, but there is less for audiences unfamiliar with the property to weed through just to break the surface. The flashiness and commercialism of previous blockbusters is replaced with stark realism and a muted, moody color palette that reflects its neo-noir influence. (This makes sense, given that Villeneuve is very familiar with the genre with his last project ""Blade Runner 2049""). This is technically ""Dune: Part One""; ""Part Two"" is hypothetically happening once Warner Bros. gives the green light (and assuming ""Part One"" makes enough money). This means the story is cut off midway, which will frustrate many viewers. It's surely not ideal. Rarely are we happy with a film that has no true resolution, but the visual beauty of ""Dune"" is worth the journey to the theater. The scope of Villeneuve's vision can only be truly appreciated on the big screen, and you would be amiss to pass this one up."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," (L-r) JOSH BROLIN as Gurney Halleck and TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET as Paul Atreides in Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure 'Dune,' a Warner Bros. Pictures release. There have been very few experiences in my life when you’re watching a movie on the big screen, and you’re completely immersed in the world and forget about life outside the theater. Above anything seen in the large format since the pandemic hit (including Tenet), Dune offers the most bang for your buck. And this is for a film that is only half a story. (It’s been tucked away in marketing, but a few minutes into Dune, the true title pops up: Dune Part One. A second chapter has yet to be confirmed — and after you finish this, you’re going to want to start a GoFundMe to make it happen.) Director Denis Villeneuve really has mastered the art of patience. All his films move at this steady pace and always build towards something. Look no further than the border sequence in his 2015 thriller Sicario — helicopters are flying, and you’re riding shotgun with the characters. You have no idea what’s about to happen, but you’re on the total edge of your seat. The alien vessel introduction in Arrival is the same way. Dune pretty much sustains that feeling for the first hour and a half. You’re tractor-beamed into the story, Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful musical score vibrates, and your eyes eat up everything gifted cinematographer Greig Fraser (Rogue One and The Mandalorian) serves.  If you haven’t read Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel (and I wouldn’t blame you if you haven’t because that sucker’s dense), you’re trying to figure out what’s going on. Possible order of events inside your head: “Oh, OK. So, a desert world? Got it. And spices are pretty much gold. People hate each other. Oh, look—a ship that looks like a dragonfly. Princes, kings and queens. Bad guys, for sure. Ooh, and there’s one baddie who looks really nasty and could do some serious damage. But, there’s magic in this universe. Some people have Obi-Wan skills. Giant sandworms! OMG!” And I better stop myself before it gets too annoying. But all of this is incredible fun. The mood and atmosphere may seem one-note, but there are splashes of color in between the lines. Villeneuve holds your attention and moves the camera in mysterious ways. Take, for instance, a scene when Oscar Isaac’s royalty good-guy character meets the ultimate bad-guy character, played by Stellan Skarsgård, who feels plucked from Blade II. Fraser’s camera blurs Skarsgård and keeps him at a distance within the frame. Then, suddenly, Skarsgård levitates, and you feel your soul sink to the floor.  Villeneuve somehow cracked the code and managed to find a way to articulate this story visually when so many people have tried and failed before. Only a so-so 2000's television series and David Lynch’s 1984 film made it off the ground, and we are trying our best to let the latter get lost to the sands of time. (Lynch, too. He hates it.) Villeneuve’s artistry is so infectious that he could adapt a phone book and make it an award winner. The color palette here may not hold a candle to Wes Anderson’s upcoming The French Dispatch, but Villeneuve causes you to get lost in the movement and lighting. The way the sun hits the sand, or how a beast travels through the ground, Tremors-style, to take out a spice harvester — you just can’t beat the thrill. Even the drug-like effect the spice has on people creates a painting mixed with blurred and glowing contents. It’s something to be admired. (L-r) ZENDAYA as Chani and TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET as Paul Atreides in Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure “DUNE,” a Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary release. The cast is one of the year’s best ensembles. Timothée Chalamet makes a great lead character with Paul. The complexity within him drives up your fascination. In classic fashion, he’s like a Shakespeare character that feels pulled between two worlds. It leads to compelling conversations with his father (Isaac) and mother (Rebecca Ferguson, a.k.a. the film’s MVP). One conversation about fatherhood hits the heart, and then another about purpose drives up the tension. And don’t forget Jason Momoa, who deserves his own movie as the perfectly named Duncan Idaho. He’s a swordmaster and one heck of a pilot (taking the title from Isaac’s Stars Wars character).  Amid all the popcorn-flavored glory, the most significant problem with the film is it still feels like half a movie where the biggest things are yet to come. It manages to cover a lot more ground by splitting itself up into two chapters (maybe a miniseries format would have been a wiser choice). However, there’s a difference between the pace of the film's first half and the second. It’s a little choppier, feeling like the screenwriters are like, “Oh! We have a lot of plot left. We need to kick this gear up.” In that last half, there are times when the momentum picks up and then slows back down. But it wasn’t anything frustrating enough to dock it too many points. It remains a spectacle and an effective tone poem. If you’re going to watch Dune, let your first viewing be on the biggest screen possible. (My suggestion is IMAX or 4DX.)

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Long before Luke Skywalker romped around the galaxy in his billowing satin pyjamas, another young hero with extraordinary powers emerged from a desert planet to battle forces of unimaginable evil. He was Paul Atreides, the conflicted protagonist in author Frank Herbert’s acclaimed 1965 sci-fi epic Dune. The fantastical and labyrinthine spaceport novel (if you will), set millennia into the far future, is often called the greatest science fiction book ever written and it certainly aspired to the status of great literature in a genre that is often unfairly maligned. Obviously talk of a film adaption was there from the start. In 1975 Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky planned to cast Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, and Salvador Dali but his elaborate vision turned to grand folly, Star Wars creator George Lucas has long acknowledged his debt to Herbert’s novel, but David Lynch was so unhappy with his 1984 version that he disowned it. So, in the same way that we used to think of Lord of The Rings before Peter Jackson arrived, Dune seemed to be destined to reside for ever more in the revered company of the ""unfilmable"" novel. Then a few years ago word got out that Denis Villeneuve was finally going to do the story of the royal House of Atreides, the Freman, those frankly bonkers giant sand worms, and the evil Harkonnen clan justice. If anyone was ever going to bring Dune to the big screen with the respect and seriousness it deserves it was the French-Canadian director who has already proved his genius for arty and thoughtful sci-fi blockbusters with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 and his gift for telling very human stories with Sicario and Prisoners. This is his masterpiece. Anyone who kept a torch spluttering for Lynch’s flawed but hugely enjoyable version (and I, for one, will never forget that image of Sting in a space nappy) will be stuck by how very dark, brooding, and unsettling Villeneuve’s Dune is. An atmosphere of mounting dread and a profound sense of mystery hang over every second of its 155 minutes. This is a story in which myth and religion collide with politics and war with very messy results (Some things never change, eh?). Villeneuve knows that Dune is a tragedy and that out there in the vast reaches of the known universe menace and evil radiate but so does the human capacity for goodness and love. It is also the best-looking movie you will see this year (and I’m not just referring to leading man Timothée Chalamet). Dune has a strikingly original look and feel, a mesh-up of ancient civilization and unimaginable future technology that sees monolithic spacecraft hang in the inky vastness of space like Bronze Age or Inca artworks while down below chivalrous knights do battle with sword and dagger. And then Hans Zimmer’s vertiginous score strikes up suddenly and slices through the lingering stillness and you just know that something very, very bad is going to happen. It’s a thrilling space adventure for sure but Dune also addresses big themes such as ecology, religion, and politics in a far future universe which has reverted to a feudal society ruled by a constellation of royal planets all vying for the favour of the Machiavellian emperor. Our hero is Paul Atreides (Chalamet) the fearful but brave scion of the noble House Atreides, who are rising in popularity among the royal leagues. Feeling threatened, the emperor sets a trap when he tasks them with bringing peace to the inhospitable colonial outpost of Arrakis, the desert planet known as Dune, where the most valuable commodity in the universe is mined. This is the spice melange, a deeply trippy substance that looks like golden glitter and is produced by ocean liner sized sand-worms who inhabit the vastness of the desert. This spice imbues the user with the ability to fold time and space and achieve travel across unimaginable distances in seconds. Dune has been ruled for generations by the operatically evil Harkonnen dynasty, led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a brilliant Stellan Skarsgård), an obese and petulant tyrant who gets around using gravity suspensors to keep his vast carapace upright. When I saw his pet spider, which really is the size of a Buick, scuttling around his gothic palace, I eyed the cinema exit in panic. Enraged that he is about to lose Dune to the Atreides but aware of the Emperor’s chicanery, the Baron sets in motion the movie’s superb second act, a sequence of non-stop action that reveals all of Dune’s myriad complexities and wonder. But while Dune may look extraordinary and be possessed by an unknowable weirdness, there is plenty of sub-heraldic phrase-making and gnomic babble that can sap the story of momentum, which seems to be the main reason people give up on the book. It’s a valid criticism and some of the overly expository dialogue is scorched away in the dead heat but Villeneuve is fiercely loyal to the text. After all, this was Herbert’s attempt at a literary take on the hackneyed space opera genre popularised decades before his book was published. And to paraphrase Herbert himself, Chalamet makes a fine Paul, the teenage Duke in waiting who will become a messiah and change the universe forever. He may seem effeminate and rather solemn at first sight, but he grows in stature as his task and talents become more apparent to him. The rest of the cast do not fare quite as well. There is barely a grain of chemistry between Chalamet and an inert Rebecca Ferguson as his watchful and terrified mother, Lady Jessica, and Oscar Issac as Duke Leto is left with little to do except look noble and watchful. However, Villeneuve has several Han Solos to choose from in the book’s stock of action heroes. Josh Brolin’s scowling imperial enforcer Gurney Helleck is great value, while Javier Bardem’s Freman warrior Stillgar is a lugubrious and testy tribal leader. A Sphinx-like Charlotte Rampling is imperious as the Reverend Mother of a secretive religious order, the tormentor and judge who sets young Paul a terrible test in the opening moments of the film. This is only the beginning of the saga and while purists may quibble, and newcomers may be baffled - and even bored - there is no doubting the terrible beauty of Villeneuve’s vision of Herbert’s medieval future. Dune is an awesome triumph. © RTÉ 2024. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media. RTÉ is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Beloved by hippies, well-thumbed by 1970s environmentalists, Frank Herbert’s novel Dune has been the kiss of death for film-makers. In the 1970s Alejandro Jodorowsky spent three years planning and raising money for a film adaptation that would star Orson Welles and Salvador Dali, and run for 14 hours: not surprisingly, financial backing proved elusive. David Lynch did make a Dune film, released in 1984, but everyone hated it, including Lynch, who publicly disowned it. Perhaps Herbert’s wordy tale of an intergalactic war over natural resources was too grandiose, and long-winded, to be filmed at all. Still, didn’t they say that about Lord of the Rings?"
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"I watched Villeneuve's richly realized world with appreciation, even if I sometimes felt more like an impressed tourist than someone who had fully invested in this sci-fi saga."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Adaptation is always a risky business, and that truth is especially so for a particular kind of epic, complex science-fiction, or fantasy novel. For much of cinematic history, if you weren’t outright collaborating alongside the author of the text or inventing something new with them, you were probably best off absorbing what you could from a particular novel and incorporating it into a fresh, original concept: Such thinking gave us Star Wars, after all, after George Lucas threw the elements of his upbringing in imagination into a blender and let Marcia Lucas and his other collaborates season the final product to a palatable and irresistible taste. But for those looking for that extra something, that name-brand recognition bestowed upon dorm-room stoner classics that would cause an aging boomer to look up at the marquee and say Hey, I Remember Reading That On The Quad While Tripping Balls and then subsequently buy tickets to an evening screening, a certain few seemed unadaptable: J.R.R. Tolkein’s Lord of the Rings and Frank Herbert’s Dune chief among them. Both received adaptations in that era — Ralph Bakshi took the reins on an animated version of Tolkein’s tale after the Beatles couldn’t get their shit together, and tha god David Lynch worked as a gun-for-hire for Dino De Laurentis, the mega-producer in search of his own Star Wars, so that he could accumulate the capital to make Blue Velvet.  Lynch’s Dune is vastly underrated — it is a genuinely delightful and weird film, full of amazing design work and a generally low-fi, lived-in feel — yet it’s also easy to get why audiences didn’t go wild for it, given the odd-and-heady nature of the film itself. I’ll get to exactly why in a second, but it’s hard to remember just how of-its-moment the style of Dune ’84 is, and just how much better it does its decrepit, hyper-futuristic yet hideously fleshy aesthetic than many of its contemporaries. The problem is, however, that the conventions of fantasy-and-sci-fi epic storytelling hadn’t quite caught up with filmmaking right then: No one really knew how much weirdness one audience would be able to take, especially when drawing from a tome and lore as richly created and explored as it is in the books. Hell, De Laurentis ordered programs — complete with glossary — for those who were attending the film, should they get lost and need a guide to help them understand exactly what the hell a “stillsuit” or a “Muad’ib” was. It’s too much — both in an exposition sense and in the fact that the book’s story is simply too large to be jammed properly into a 136-minute film — and yet not enough, at least in a traditional storytelling sense. This is perhaps why we aren’t discussing Denis Villeneuve’s latest adaptation of Herbert’s novel as a well-timed reboot after a long series of book adaptations and tie-in merchandise and angry fanboys who are mad that the Baron Harkonnen isn’t covered in boils just like in the original.  But something wonderful happened in 2001 when Peter Jackson dropped The Fellowship of the Ring on the world like a bomb: Filmmakers (and perhaps more importantly, the studios and money men) realized that audiences could tolerate the weird nerd shit that made this complicated nonsense both hard to parse and insanely compelling. In fact, the solution had been buried in Star Wars decades earlier, but no one really cared to notice, given that, at the time, it was assumed that all of the fun ships and swords and banter seemed to be the reason people went wild for it. The lesson was this: Don’t stop and explain, just say the words, and people either won’t care if you’re talented enough in order to make it compelling or they’ll seek out what it means. This ethos fully informs Denis Villeneuve’s approach to Dune, which has the wonderful quality of playing like Herbert’s novels read. You see, the great secret of those books is that they are actually incredibly easy to read (one only knows how many times Lord of the Rings has been abandoned by interested readers over the years thanks to its beautiful-yet-complex prose), given that the writer specialized in making accessible pulp before he began to expand his consciousness towards more heady dimensions such as this one.  From Enemy, Villeneuve brings both a giant spider (half-human, glimpsed as a pet in the household of the Harkonnens) and some measure of psychological complexity, as best represented in the story’s protagonist, Paul Atreides, scion of the House Atreides, who have been made stewards of the all-important planet Arrakis by their Emperor. Paul’s the result of generations of breeding, concocted by the Bene Gesserit, a history-manipulating group of psychic witch-nuns who aim to bring out Herbert’s equivalent of the messiah, the Kwisatch Haderach: A powerful being who will manipulate and change history. This Paul is allowed to be far brattier than Kyle MacLachlan’s was, but he’s also given a legitimate moral dilemma, one at the heart of the books, that the previous adaptation didn’t try to touch: He is a product of destiny, and he’s forced to consume the spice melange — a psychoactive drug that lays on the sands, which is all-important, given that it makes space travel possible — he sees visions, either prophecy or fantasy, that suggest to him the horrible consequence of his legacy. Thus, a duality: The man of fate standing in opposition to the boy who has to learn both how to lead and speak, and isn’t sure if he wants to cause all this suffering anyhow.  Those hallucinogenic scenes, where Paul envisions himself either getting slain or doing slaying, of blood-stained hands and piles of burning corpses, are a crucial element to the film’s visual palette, of which Villeneuve has pulled from aspects of Arrival and Sicario in their realization. The former’s presence is easy to feel, given how stark and minimal this post-technology future really is: If you really can “fold” space to travel long distances, that would perhaps alter the look of your intergalactic transports, right? Many of the great moments here feel like a concept artist’s wet dream, perfectly realized from the page, and it must have been a joy to work on a project like this. Every set and location, be it exterior or interior, is vividly rendered, though, as it was with Lynch’s film, it is clearly a product of its time. As for Sicario, one can feel its presence in the slow, tactical movement in the battle sequences, such as in the Harkonnen’s assault on the Atreides household on Arrakis, though, clearly, it will eventually give way to hand-to-hand chaos, as the energy shields that are worn by all combatants having long-ago eliminated the usage of most projectile weapons. I couldn’t help but think of the movements of the soldiers at the end of that film when white-clad baddies lower themselves into holes via ropes, gently suspended, armor standing out in the darkness here, and most, if not all, of the other scenes are filled with notes as graceful as those.  This brings us to our final point of comparison in the Denis Goes To Hollywood line-up and perhaps the most important aspect of how this relates to Lynch’s film: Respect for the master that came before you. As was with Blade Runner 2049, which allowed itself the space to do something new with the future-noir elements of Ridley Scott’s classic while retaining its core essence, Villeneuve pays heavy tribute to Lynch’s Dune as an essential antecedent. It would have been easy enough to ditch nearly all of the aesthetic that he crafted back in ’84, and to be fair, much is jettisoned or is inherent to any adaptation of the novel — there aren’t steaming hydraulics, nor do the bug-styled pilots of the Space Guild make an appearance — but what’s retained is fascinating. He keeps so many aspects of Lynch’s style: The formal wear of those on Arrakis, the style of the stillsuits, the environments (especially in the feel of the nighttime battle scenes), and, importantly, the weirdness. Yet he manages to find space to add his own rhythms and styles, building on top of the foundations that have been laid, both by a storytelling master like Herbert and one of cinema’s greatest image-crafters, all while helping to make this tale work better and feel sturdier for audiences to come. This Dune overwhelms you into understanding through the power inherent in the paring of the image with sound and editing, not through the complexity of its world, and one can only hope that enough people seek it out so that Villeneuve will be able to finish his tremendous tale in the near future.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"I was completely swept away by Denis Villeneuve's eye-candy vision, fully convinced that I was watching the best sci-fi movie of the decade. Yes, it's that good."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," This weekend marks one of the biggest paradoxes of Hollywood’s hybrid pandemic release model. A film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible is arriving in theaters … and on the small screen. Back in December, director Denis Villeneuve strongly expressed his disdain for Warner Bros.’ decision to simultaneously release his “Dune” in theaters and on HBO Max. His statements got support from Christopher Nolan, who famously held out on pressure to release “Tenet” to streaming in 2020. Of course, the difference between then and now is the wide availability of effective vaccines against the virus that shuttered theaters for most of a year. Villeneuve’s feelings on seeing his sweeping sci-fi epic on the small screen haven’t cooled, comparing the experience in an August interview to “[driving] a speedboat in your bathtub.” Having seen his “Dune” on the big screen, he’s not wrong. Villeneuve took Frank Herbert’s novel to the big screen — a feat once attempted by no less than David Lynch — in such sweeping fashion, there’s almost no way a home screening can recreate the sense of awe it brings. That it is visually stunning and world transporting is no surprise if you’ve seen Villeneuve’s films, particularly “Blade Runner 2049.” The question going in was, how would the director handle the storyline from a nearly 500-page novel that requires a glossary? Part of the answer was previously known but not widely made clear in the marketing of the film. The opening credits announce this is “Part 1.” The story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the young son of a duke, and his journey to a larger destiny is a classic hero’s tale, but not a simple one. Add in a cast that includes Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, and Zendaya, and it’s enough to make your head spin. How much your head spins will determine whether “Dune” is more than its epic scope, stunning visuals, a brilliant Hans Zimmer score and Oscar-frontrunner set design and costumes. I’ve made no secret of my belief that novels don’t always make great movies, particularly if they require pre-knowledge of the material. A movie that’s only good if you’ve read the book doesn’t do its job. Villeneuve and his co-writers, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, do an impressive job of making the dense material digestible and (mostly) understandable through clever exposition and solid pacing. None of this is to say that there aren’t moments when the journey is a bit of a slog. The last stretch of the two hours and 35 minutes did have me glancing at my watch a few times. But it’s also abundantly clear that trying to squeeze the material into one epic (and epically long) film would have been a mistake. Of course, this also means we’re seeing half a story. The endpoint is one of intrigue, but it also feels a bit like the film is wheezing to a resting point for the rest of the journey. “Dune” even dropped a day early on HBO Max, and I’ve already seen people who’ve watched it say what I’d tell you now. It’s best to see this on the biggest screen possible first. If your comfort level means waiting a few weeks for those mostly empty matinees, I’d recommend it."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is back with another sci-fi epic, following on from the successes of 2016's Arrival and 2017's Blade Runner 2049. He's no stranger to stunning, transportive visuals and rich storylines, so fans of the genre were understandably excited when it was announced he was set to adapt Frank Hebert's Dune for the big screen. The plot follows the Atreides family who has recently been invited to govern Arrakis, a dangerous planet that is rich in the “spice” known as melange, a coveted resource that can extend life and enhance consciousness, making it an incredibly valuable thing to be in possession of. The family is made up of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), with the three leading this impressive cast list. With any ensemble cast, there's an expectation that it will deliver, and it does. The performances in Dune are fantastic and there's depth to the characters, especially when it comes to Ferguson's Lady Jessica who is powerful yet has a tenderness and vulnerability to her, especially when it comes to her relationship with her son Paul. Ferguson and Chalamet are the standout performances as the film spends a lot of time focusing on them and their bond as they navigate what life on Arrakis means for them. Timothée Chalamet is making waves in the industry right now having dazzled in Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch and is now gearing up to play Willy Wonka in a new adaptation. As the lead star of Dune he gives a captivating performance with more to come, as this is only the first part. His take on Paul is an incredibly convincing one, you can really feel his emotions and the pressure he's facing during the course of the film, especially when he begins having visions that would seriously affect his future. Many of these visions include a woman named Chani (Zendaya), who lives on Arrakis. She's a mysterious figure who doesn't have a huge role in the film but it does set it up to see much more from her in the second part. Despite her lack of screen time, she has a powerful, intriguing presence. None of Chani's brief time on screen is wasted, and it seems like Zendaya and Chalamet will be major players in part two.  Dune is a massive film, it's 2 hours 35 minutes in length and feels that way, but that's no bad thing. Sufficient time was needed to properly explore the universe, and establish the lore that's at its heart. Having said that, audiences would benefit from reading the source material or at least doing some research into it, because it's an incredibly story-rich film and there's lots to sink your teeth into in order to fully appreciate the scale of it. Bringing this film to life alongside Villeneuve was cinematographer Greig Fraser who has previously worked on Rogue One, The Mandalorian, and is set to work on new DC film The Batman, so if anyone knows how to do sci-fi and fantasy well, it's him, and it's recommended that you see his work on the biggest screen you can find. Complementing Dune's scale and stunning visuals is a score composed by legendary musician Hans Zimmer, known for his work on Inception, Pirates of the Caribbean and the latest Bond flick No Time To Die to name but a few. Any project is in very safe hands with Zimmer, and the score certainly elevates the rest of the film, especially when it comes to its more dramatic moments. Dune: Part Two is currently in pre-production, and after the grand conclusion of the first sci-fi fans will no doubt be desperate to see how Villeneuve continues the story. We might have a while to wait but if it's anywhere near as good as this installment, our patience will definitely be rewarded.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"Science fiction claims to be about tomorrow, but it's really about today."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL," To clarify right out of the gate: no, I have not read Frank Herbert’s Dune. By all accounts, it is a masterful epic of glorious sci-fi, and I can readily admit my shame in never having turned the pages of this Herbert’s opus. Also, while I did not watch the 2000 miniseries, I did catch David Lynch’s 1984 cinematic attempt, and let’s just say that film lacked the necessary spice to leave a positive lasting impression. All of that said, I am not here to offer my thoughts on the novel, the miniseries, nor whatever the hell Lynch’s film was. No, this review is solely dedicated to Denis Villeneuve’s vision of Dune. As the outset, Dune: Part 1 offers a title card that quickly explains we are only witnessing the first half of the story, where all of the worlds are built and the pieces are placed. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is tasked by his emperor to modernize Arrakis, a desert planet populated by its own people known as the Fremen and visually akin to Tatooine. Arrakis is the home to the most valuable resource in the galaxy (known as spice), and the emperor is determined to seize control away from the unwieldy savages of House Harkonnen and reestablish a peaceful settlement. Along for the ride is Leto’s concubine, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Paul has been training for years in both physical combat with Leto’s right-hand, Gurney (Josh Brolin), and his mother’s underlying mysticism to one day take over for his father as the Duke. He is also besieged by visions he asserts to be premonitions of a future-to-come, specifically revolving around a beautiful Fremen woman known as Chani (Zendaya). Almost immediately after landing, the infinitely hungry Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) leads a revolt in an attempt to destroy Duke Leto’s people and seize Arrakis for themselves, forcing Paul and Jessica to flee with Paul’s trusted bodyguard Duncan (Jason Momoa) in tow. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is truly only half of the story as the film builds right up to an understated cliffhanger, therefore the majority of this film is setting up the characters and the story for what’s to come. Villeneuve has a plethora of talent to pluck from, as there is not an actor present not bringing their A-game to the occasionally confounding vernacular inherent to this world. Isaac, Ferguson, Momoa, Brolin: they live and breathe their characters and their moments, no matter how melodramatic nor small the part. It’s an overall committed cast. Timothée Chalamet’s Paul is the lone exception, as frequently his performance is so muted and uninvolved it comes across rather mundane. As Chalamet is a very charismatic and talented actor, it would seem this is simply how the character of Paul is either written on the page or being directed than the actor’s own shortcomings. Nevertheless, Paul’s wannabe savior character is a difficult follow, as he spends an exorbitant amount of screen time staring off into the ether, pondering his own motivations it seems. He’s simply too milquetoast a character to invest in at this point. Perhaps that amps up a notch in the next film, but as I alluded to earlier, this review can only look at half the puzzle. As for the rest of Dune, if you are an avid fan of the novel, the visual representation here is sure to take your breath away. Denis Villeneuve pulls no punches bringing Herbert’s world to life. Much like walking into the Shire for the first time in Fellowship of the Ring, stepping foot onto Arrakis will transport you immediately there, regardless of your previous knowledge of the novel. The cinematography is gorgeous, the set designs are massive, the score is sweeping. In terms of sheer cinematic achievement, Denis Villeneuve and his immensely talented crew have delivered in spades. So why is Dune so god damn boring? The cast is excellent, the production design flawless, even the sand worm is amazing. So with this enormously immersive world, (mostly) fascinating characters, and spotless special effects; why – in all that is holy – isn’t this a “good” movie? I do not care how talented everyone involved is. How well researched every aspect of your screenplay is. It doesn’t even matter if you have the most fantastic CGI effects movie theaters have ever seen. If your movie does not ENTERTAIN, can you call it a great film? No, absolutely not. And Dune is an insipid bore. Part of it lies in the lack of personality languishing in our lead character of Paul, but mostly it rests in the meandering pace dragging its ass kicking-and-screaming through each frame and every scene. Even the action scenes, though striving for operatic grandness, amounts to little more excitement than watching your kid play Call of Duty from across the room. Over the film’s 2.5 hour runtime, my watch was checked no less than 5 times in what should be, by most accounts, a sprawling sci-fi epic for the ages. I wasn’t even bothered by the cliffhanger conclusion, as I was just ecstatic the movie finally ended. It’s an insane turnabout that the most visually arresting film of the year, also happens to be the worst paced movie during that same time."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL,"'Dune' is a spectacular, procedural exercise."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"The inventive visuals and audio effects are world class and often spellbinding, but the twists and turns...are sometimes hard to follow."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Growing up, my main resources for books were libraries, the occasional trip to a bookstore and the bookshelves in my parents' bedroom. The collection was mostly my father's, a treasure trove of science fiction and fantasy. Classics and current releases intermingled, in no particular order, though I always made sure to return any I pulled down back to their place. Here I discovered authors who would expand my young mind and shape my world views. J.R.R. Tolkein, Anne McCaffrey, David Drake, Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. Le Guin, Allan Dean Foster. Yet, among all those paperback spines, one book always jumped out at me: Frank Herbert's seminal work Dune. Maybe it was its size, veritably dwarfing most of the other inhabitants of its shelf. Maybe it was the title, one single, simple word that simultaneously said nothing and everything. Maybe it was the artwork, several small silhouettes standing on a sandy terrain, towered over by a gigantic rock formation. Whatever it was, this tome one of the first truly dense and epic reads of my life. So, of course, I was excited to see one of our greatest modern directors tackle what has been attempted before, but never successfully realized. In the year 10191, the most valuable commodity in the universe is spice, and it only comes from one planet: Arrakis. House Harkonnen had ruled the planet with an iron fist for decades, but those duties were recently taken from them and given to House Atreides. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) are set to leave their home planet of Caladan and settle on Arrakis. Paul has been having dreams about the planet, most involving a young woman named Chani (Zendaya). Some of this may have to do with the fact his mother has been training him in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient sect possessing superior mental abilities. The Bene Gesserit are exclusively comprised of females, so this training of Paul is frowned upon by the Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling). However, Jessica is convinced her son might become the Kwisatz Haderach, a messiah that has been foretold of in Bene Gesserit prophecies. Leto plans to be a much more benevolent ruler for Arrakis than Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) ever was. Little does he know, the Baron has plans to take back the planet with a violent coup. An epic novel deserves an epic film, and Dune is that film. Denis Villeneuve has done what past adaptations were thought to have proven impossible. This is the Dune that was meant to be on the big screen, and only a visionary such as Villeneuve could've brought it to such vivid life. It's almost exactly how I, and probably most anyone who has read the novel, envisioned Herbert's vast universe. There are so many characters, all with outstanding actors wearing their skins, that going in depth into every performance would take too long. The one to single out, obviously, is the one that carries the film on his back. Chalamet is a perfect choice for Paul. Not only is he an actor of tremendous talent, he's the kind of seemingly ageless young man who currently has the ability to play anywhere from a teen to someone in their early thirties, as excellently displayed in his role as Laurie in Greta Gerwig's version of Little Women. Everything on the technical side is wonderous, as well. The film looks gorgeous, stunning the viewer with every frame. The overall design, from sets to costumes to vehicles, is outstanding. I believe that, were he alive today, Frank Herbert would be astounded by how close this film is to what was probably in his head as he wrote. If you only see one science fiction epic film adapted from one of the greatest works of 20th century literature, make it Dune. Also, if you personally feel safe doing so, see it in a theater. On the big screen with immersive surround sound is how a picture like this is meant to be seen.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,We could be looking at the opening chapter of one of the greatest film sagas of all time.
"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve has recently established a reputation for high-minded and grand sci-fi (ARRIVAL, BLADE RUNNER 2049). However, these films also retained a hint of those with which the French Canadian established his filmmaking skill: beautifully presented films with an emotional edge (PRISONERS, SICARIO). DUNE may be his most grand and high-minded entry in the cinematic canon yet, but the relationships and emotions developed in this adaptation of Frank Herbert’s book are as dry as the desert sand we find on Arrakis. Timothée Chalamet leads as Paul, the heir apparent to the Imperial house of Atreides on the ocean planet Caladan. The (unseen) Emperor has forcibly taken back the desert planet Arrakis from the house of Harkonnen and given it to Atreides along with responsibility for producing ‘spice’, the lucrative resource laced through the sands of the harsh and inhospitable world. Paul must adapt quickly to a hazardous political and physical situation for his family and their followers. Meanwhile, he is burdened with recurring dreams of the planet’s Indigenous people, the Fremen, and he seemingly holds a significance to the mysterious female religious group – the Bene Gesserit – to which his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) is devoted. It is hard not to be in awe of the visual spectacle when the Fremen rise out of the sand to attack their opponents, when Gurney (Josh Brolin) charges into battle as an interplanetary war erupts, or when a giant sandworm makes Star Wars’ Sarlacc look like little more than a maggot. In addition, the sound – whether it be the Hans Zimmer musical accents or the visceral effects applied to ‘the voice’, a commanding paranormal tone the Bene Gesserit cultivate to compel others – gets under the skin and stays there. “However, it is ironic that the dusty, hazard-laden, abrasive landscape DUNE builds often feels so sterile when we come to the characters inhabiting it. Despite the peril faced by Paul, Chalamet seems impassive.” However, it is ironic that the dusty, hazard-laden, abrasive landscape DUNE builds often feels so sterile when we come to the characters inhabiting it. Despite the peril faced by Paul, Chalamet seems impassive. His reaction to unimaginable pain inflicted by the Bene Gesserit is the same studied concentration he displays when parsing his dreams or taking part in hand-to-hand combat. His slightly glaikit expression isn’t true across the board: Rebecca Ferguson’s inner conflict between fealty to her order and maternal instincts is keenly felt in her face and body language, even through the portentous dialogue; Oscar Isaac’s stoic but warmly-speaking Duke Leto conveys a sceptical but honour-bound leader; and Jason Momoa’s natural charisma comes through in Duncan Idaho’s reverence for the Fremen and fraternal affection for Paul. However, despite that trio’s best efforts with comparatively limited screentime, blank performances are not exclusive to Chalamet. Although there is little in the script for them to work with, Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård also find little beyond surface-level malevolence in their Harkonnen leaders. “…blank performances are not exclusive to Chalamet. Although there is little in the script for them to work with, Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård also find little beyond surface-level malevolence in their Harkonnen leaders.” Some of this shallowness can be ascribed to DUNE covering only part of a layered but unwieldy story (as the prominent ‘Part One’ subtitle in the opening highlights). Any thematic depth built up is terminated prematurely by the film before any resonant payoff even hints at lumbering over the heat-distorted horizon. The script and imagery also give short shrift to the obvious parallels with Middle Eastern petrostates, given that this is a world where monied overlords have historically displayed callous indifference to the Bedouin-like Fremen at best or oppressed them at worst. Any Fremen characters (except for one) are present for comically short periods, given the outsized importance they should have to some of the film’s more subtle concerns. All these Middle Eastern and Islamic elements are very much there in the film, and some will presumably rise in importance in any sequel(s), but here they merely exist. Although the film’s grand visuals protect against apathy, it also does little to create empathy with its lead character. The awe generated means DUNE avoids sinking under the sand completely, but that same heft means neither does it glide elegantly across it. Whether this dedication to the source’s scope – to the detriment of a narratively and thematically cohesive initial film – will prove visionary or hubristic on Villeneuve’s part remains to be seen (with sequels as yet unconfirmed). Still, in its current standalone status, DUNE is an emotionally inert beauty."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," A mythic hero’s journey, “Dune” is the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal 1965 bestseller about a feudal interstellar society in a galaxy far, far away, which is set in a distant future. It’s the story of Paul Atreides, a gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding. As part of the noble house of Atreides, he must travel to Arrakis, the most dangerous planet in the universe for the future of his family and people. The desert wasteland planet has an exclusive supply of “mélange,” aka “the spice,” a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. As it is the most precious resource in existence, malevolent forces are at work to prevent this, and only those who can conquer their fear will survive. Directed by visionary Denis Villeneuve, who frames everything with meticulous care, as he did with “Arrival,” his only Oscar nomination, and “Blade Runner 2049” – the film is a technical marvel, with visually stunning panoramas and innovative flying machines. Yet are these characters engaging enough? How much do we care about what happens to these political dynasties? They prefer to whisper in cavernous spaces, and while mesmerizing Zendaya’s narration helps, the project’s mythology on such an epic scale tends to weigh it down with “importance.” Our hero’s journey is a very long one and we spend 2 hours and 35 minutes leading up to a next chapter. This is only Part One. We are warned at the end, when one character says to Paul: “You’re just getting started.” The payoff isn’t quite there – so when is Part Two? We have just invested time on an extended prologue. Oh dear. Will only fans of the book be able to appreciate this saga? And isn’t that the true test? As is always the case, those not familiar with the source material will be at a disadvantage trying to keep up with the warring factions. Considered the best-selling science fiction novel of all-time, “Dune” is gigantic in scope, and the 1965 cult classic touches on themes involving politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, threading them all together in space. The empire’s other planets want control of Arrakis for its spice, which is also necessary for space navigation because of its multidimensional awareness and foresight. “Dune” is only the first in a series, followed by Herbert’s five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. After his death, others have kept the franchise going. Its devoted fan base inspired filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky to attempt a film adaptation in the 1970s but was cancelled after three years in development. Along came David Lynch’s complex adaptation in 1984, which was a harshly received misguided mess, and a Sci-Fi Channel miniseries in 2000. While light years ahead of the 37-year-old film, “Dune” does seem to have the same problem in adapting something so unwieldy – that the character development suffers. It’s difficult to figure out the planetary relationships and who’s who among the different groups, even with a strong cast that attempts to make everything as lucid as possible. This one does attempt to over-correct in a tedious way, with a screenplay by director Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts (“Doctor Strange,” “Prometheus”) and Eric Roth, Oscar winner for “Forrest Gump,” that still falters in explanations. Paul is played with youthful elan by Timothee Chalamet, who seems to be working non-stop. His character, burdened by birthright, is actually the least interesting of the massive ensemble – but the camera loves him, and he looks good standing in many shots of wind and blowing sands, contemplating. Chalamet has genuine interactions with his father, an authoritative but loving Duke Leto Atreides, well-played by the always captivating Oscar Isaac. With warm fatherly advice, Isaac tells him: “A great man doesn’t seek to lead; he’s called to it.” It’s not his fault that Paul is a blank slate. He is being groomed to take over, and while at times reluctant and confused, he accepts his duties. His mother, all-serious Lady Jessica, is a tough taskmaster, and subtly played by Rebecca Ferguson, they have a protective relationship. Far more compelling is Jason Momoa as the fierce warrior Duncan Idaho. He brings some oomph to the fighter’s bravado and his fists of fury are legitimate. Momoa and Chalamet warmly convey a loyal long standing friendship. Not given much to do is Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, the duke’s right-hand man, and Dave Bautista as antagonist Beast Rabben Harkonnen – along with Momoa, they are the recognizable fighters. A barely there Javier Bardem is Stilgar, a leader of a desert tribe. An unrecognizable Stellen Skarsgard appears, Jabba the Hut-like, as the disgusting despot Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. The Harkonnens are the evil not-to-be-trusted bad guys. The first hour is full of awe. But why do movies about the future tend to mix medieval and “Star Wars” knock offs in production design and costumes, similar to the “Game of Thrones”? The color palette is deary shades of gray, beige and black. While that gets wearisome, the cinematography of Greig Fraser is dazzling. An Emmy winner for “The Mandalorian” and Oscar nominee for “Lion,” he expresses the grandeur of the planets’ landscapes as well as the more intimate moments in various degrees of light. He worked on “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” and the upcoming “The Batman,” so tackling sandworms and spaceships is natural for him. His majestic work is one of the pleasures of seeing this in IMAX. Despite its storytelling flaws, “Dune” is such a monumental example of state-of-the-art filmmaking that its cinematic universe deserves to be seen on the big screen."

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," El miedo es el asesino de la mente, pues la preocupación no quita los problemas de mañana, sino la paz de hoy. La ciencia ficción siempre me ha parecido el género por excelencia del alcance del cine, pues en su núcleo se pudiera definir como la más alta expresión de nuestra imaginación, ¿y qué es el cine sino nuestra imaginación volando? Irónicamente hay una respuesta, el cine también es la vida y las personas tal cual quien lo hace lo percibe. Termina siendo una combinación, razón por la cual no importa la historia, incluso en la ciencia ficción se sienten los rastros de la humanidad. ¿Y a qué me refiero con humanidad? A conflicto, a lo que nos mueve, a lo que nos imposibilita mantenernos estáticos y nos come por dentro las ganas de algo nuevo, algo diferente y algo mejor. Hoy no vengo a hablar de la novela de Frank Herbert, pues lamentablemente aun no la he leído, sino de lo que en mi opinión es una clase magistral de creación de universo, elaborada por un director que conoce el por qué de absolutamente todas sus decisiones creativas. En tan solo sus primeros minutos, “Dune” establece su historia, su vida y las posibilidades de su conflicto, el apretón a nuestra atención se siente y está directamente vinculado a la narrativa de la película y no a una explosión de eventos llamativos, como usualmente ocurre en el género. La audiencia se trata con suficiente inteligencia como para no tener que mostrar lo obvio pero a la vez señalando puntos importantes para llegar a la conclusión de que este es un mundo que vibra y existe por sí solo. Utilizando aspectos comunes en los épicos, cae en cuenta inmediata de quienes son esenciales para su historia, y quienes no tanto, no pierde tiempo en la burocracia de su política, pero sin menospreciar el drama y el pasado de sus personajes. La película establece su protagonista pero el contexto y los eventos que vive pasan a jugar un papel doble, pues son importantes para la atención de la audiencia pero no tanto para el misticismo de su personaje principal. En la naturalidad del conflicto, y lo humano que se siente el hecho de que exista la ambición, la codicia, la envidia, la explotación y el hambre de poder, también se crea un balance de introducción de aspectos únicos del universo, la tecnología, el vestuario, el diseño de producción y muestra de locaciones permiten transportarnos a un lugar lejano donde irónicamente transcurren nuestros mismos problemas. Utiliza la religión y la política como punto de partida para conectar la vulnerabilidad de nuestras posiciones, y en este subtexto crea su propio misticismo sobre las posibilidades de este universo, su inmensidad y el muy probable futuro que tenga. Una dirección de casting inmejorable y precisa, cada actor y actriz es perfecto en su papel, al punto de que en lo masivo de su historia me olvidaba de las caras y me concentraba en la acción. Si digo nombres me quedaría corto, absolutamente todo el mundo está genial. Hans Zimmer de por Dios, no hay palabras para definir el trabajo de este hombre, que le da sonidos y música a universos impensables, no tengo idea ni de como empiezas a conceptualizar como suenan estos espacios, y de qué forma apoyas la historia y sus sentimientos con la creación de una música que se sienta de otro mundo. Por momentos “Dune” se siente como un viaje psicodélico, como si nosotros mismos estuviésemos en contacto con la especia, y la música de Zimmer absorbe cada partícula de drama, acción, tragedia, espectáculo y posibilidad. Me encantó que el cine estaba estruendoso de alto, como se debe ver. Denis Villeneuve es un director indie atrapado en la posición de un director blockbuster, pues aun con estos mega presupuestos logra crear una historia donde su foco principal es la estructura, las revelaciones y el storytelling visual. Sus películas más grandes son las que más a fuego lento son, como para que poco a poco vaya creciendo en ti y exista mucha capacidad de repetición. Fue valiente con “Dune” al adoptar por completo el concepto de que esta es tan solo la primera parte, y tengo los dedos cruzados, pues no puedo esperar para ver el futuro de esta franquicia que de manera tan efectiva me ha introducido a un magnífico universo."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," First, Timothée Chalamet is acting antimatter. The live-action Edward Gorey drawing is undeniably some people’s cup of tea. Related: Apparently, some people think tea tastes good? Second, the names chosen by Frank Herbert for certain characters in Dune were either a dare or a magnificent joke. Planets, languages, and other miscellany get elaborate original organizations of consonants and vowels. But then there’s Paul (Chalamet). His mom is Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). This means you hear things like “House Atreides is at war with the Harkonnens on Arrakis, right Jessica?” Let’s leave Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) out of this because that nomenclature is so hilarious it kinda wraps back around to being awesome again. Third, dress Dune up any way you’d like – and director Denis Villeneuve does dress it the hell up – and you’re still stuck with a redundant, gross colonial White savior narrative that is such a thinly veiled Middle Eastern metaphor that the film should come with a see-through niqab. Because “problematic” is such a lame-o buzzy word these days, let’s call it what it is: manipulative bullshit at worst, boring at best. Fourth, making a film that’s labeled “part one” without having “part two” already in the can or deep into production should be illegal. Are there bigger problems in America? Yes. But if we’re going to solve everything with legal chicanery and forceful imprisonment, then hurl any studio that releases Dune Part One without Dune Part Two on the schedule into the pokey. Okay, enough caveats. Villeneuve’s Dune follows space Paul, a very special rich White boy who is learning to speak in a magic voice that makes people do exactly what he says. His daddy, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), gets told by the unseen emperor that he must take his family and army to the desert planet Arrakis to “mine spice.” Spice is sand cocaine that lets people travel through the universe. Whatever, man, the book was written in the 60s. House Atreides takes over Arrakis from the Harkonnens, who are led by a bloated human worm named Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård). Before Leto, Paul, and Jessica can even find a horse with no name, things get ugly between the families. In the middle of all of this, Paul is having future-predicting dreams, and his mom reveals herself as a kind of intergalactic witch who tried to intentionally make him a literal messiah. And they drink their own pee through nose straws. Dune absolutely crushes every small detail. Each vehicle and dwelling is marvelously envisioned. Hans Zimmer’s score is the good kind of bombastic. The battles are incredible, the transition shots are breathtaking, and the world feels more three-dimensional than Kyrie Irving thinks ours is. Everyone mumble-whispers or yells the whole time, but this is a sci-fi opera, so such things are allowed. The problem is that the core of Dune as a narrative just kinda sucks. Paul is dumb. Not just because he’s played by walking Tim Burton fanfiction. The lame “hero’s journey” riff that Villeneuve so gracefully subverted and destroyed in his Blade Runner 2049 is laughably disinteresting right now. Who wants to watch space Elon Musk figure out he should be nice to oppressed minorities? Any subversive stuff with the cult of women Jessica belongs to, who secretly scheme to control the universe, is still sprinkling glitter on colonization. Even if, in the maybe-never-going-to-be-made Dune 2: The Dune-in-ing they realize that all such behaviors are bad and nobody should ever do colonizing again, the central arc is still about cosmic Eric Trump. Also, everyone has wanted to anoint the “next Star Wars” for almost 50 years without ever realizing that part of what made it fun was that it was, itself, fun. Duncan Idaho gets like three one-liners here. That’s what counts as levity, unless you count the scene where Chalamet says, with a very straight and pouty face, “It wasn’t an allergic reaction!” to his mom. His mom being named Jessica. Whether or not you’ll love Dune (Part One) or not highly depends on your affinity for the source material and willingness to tolerate Timothée Chalamet, charisma assassin. It’s too well made not to kinda want Part Two but not as much as, say, a final installment of Ridley Scott’s second Alien trilogy. Collier “CJ” Jennings at But Why Tho? says “Dune is a visual marvel and boasts a star-studded cast, but splitting the book into two films leads to what is essentially an extended prologue.” Lonita Cook at the Black Bee Buzz says “there is just ill-measured Wizard of Ozing and going over the rainbow that sucks the second half of this flick down a hole bigger than a spice worm’s gullet.” Patricia Puentes at Ask.com says “I’ll admit to having spent at least half of the movie wondering whether Chalamet makes for a credible offspring of Isaac and Ferguson. I still haven’t reached a conclusion.”"
"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE," After a theatrical run in the fall of 2021, Dune is finally back on HBO Max. Frank Herbert’s sweeping, complicated sci-fi epic novel has a tumultuous page-to-screen history, first as a (regrettably) unrealized project conceived by cult hero Alejandro Jodorowsky in the early 1970s, then in 1984 as David Lynch’s only failure, and later as a 2000 Sci Fi Channel original miniseries that suffered the not-so-great fate of being a Sci Fi Channel original miniseries. “Impossible to adapt,” they said of Dune, but director Denis Villeneuve had already achieved the impossible — making a Blade Runner sequel a near-masterpiece, of course — and was therefore undaunted. He assembled a star-studded cast, pulled together a $165 million budget, set up production smack in the middle of the blazing desert, watched the pandemic delay the film’s release, didn’t particularly care for Warner Bros.’ decision to let people watch it at home on HBO Max — and put the words Part One under the title, all but assuring that the two-and-a-half hours we’re watching is really only half a movie.  The Gist: Let me preface this by saying that all the sci-fi proper nouns are killing me. KILLING ME. Anyway, the year is 10191. The desert planet of Arrakis is hot property because that’s where “spice” comes from — a drug that extends human life and renders lightspeed space travel possible. The galaxy or universe or whatever is ruled by an empire that’s divided into factions, and it’s all rather complicated, but we needn’t get rabbit-holed here. Villeneuve makes it fairly clear, and I’ll attempt to simplify even further: There’s the ruling Harkonnen, evil jerks who give control of the spice mining operation on Arrakis to the House of Atreides, led by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). It’s a trap, and Leto knows it, but doesn’t have the power to say no. So he’s gotta pack up the fam and move to the desert, where they’ll not only face hostile natives known as the Fremen and sandstorms that can slice through metal, but also massive sandworms that try to eat the crap out of anything and anyone that’s trying to steal their spice. It’s a dirty job, but someone’s gotta do it. Leto’s son is Paul (Timothy Chalamet), who’s not a boy and not yet a man and almost but not quite a legit movie character. He’s the heir to the House of Atreides, which sounds like a suckass gig now, what with the worms and all. He’s in training to be a warrior, under the mentorship of Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), so we get sparring sequences in which Paul does some sweet moves with a long dagger, while wearing an invisible electronic shield to protect his body. Additionally, Paul possesses weird ethereal psychic powers, the result of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who belongs to a cult of nun-witches known as the Bene Gesserit. She teaches Paul how to use “the voice,” a vocal tone that allows one to control another person. He’s also having visionary dreams about Zendaya — and who can blame him? — because she plays a Fremen girl named Chani. Is destiny afoot? It sure seems to be, especially after a Bene Gesserit elder, who has the sinister authorial grandiosity of 200 Mirrens or two Swintons but is actually just one Charlotte Rampling, says he might be a golden boy chosen one as prophesied by the ancients, etc. What with a lot of somber pomp and circumstance involving robes and flags and bagpipes and assemblies of soldiers, Leto, Lady Jessica and Paul assume control of the spice refinery on Arrakis. We get some scenes with Baron Harkonnen (an unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgaard), who looks like Brando in Apocalypse Now crossed with Immortan Joe and the space slug from The Empire Strikes Back, and his warrior nephew (Dave Bautista) as they plan to betray House Atreides. Meanwhile, the Atreides get to woik, learning about spice harvesters and buzzing their dragonfly ornithopters over “worm territory.” You have to wear special suits when you’re out in the desert or else you’ll dry up and blow away lickety-split. Leto hopes to avoid any hostility from the Fremen by engaging them in some hard, pipe-hittin’ diplomacy; they’re led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and live in tunnel communities beneath the sand. Paul keeps having the dreams, and thinks he’s seeing the future; he has a Spiritual Moment in the desert with a sandworm rumbling beneath him. This movie will eventually come to an end, but the story won’t, so brace yourselves for a marked lack of dramatic resolution. “This is only the beginning,” says one of the characters. Is that a threat? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Dune sometimes reminded me of the time I fell asleep on the couch watching The Sheltering Sky, another very long movie set in the desert. But there are also times when Villeneuve marries the steady, measured pace and sumptuous wide-open spaces of Blade Runner 2049 — especially the abandoned-Vegas sequence — with the visionary desert world of Mad Max: Fury Road. Maybe this is just a long way of saying Dune is very much a mixed bag. Performance Worth Watching: I’m still shocked to learn that that’s Stellan Skarsgaard beneath all that blue paint and prosthetic gloop. In a movie full of stoic characters, he at least does something memorable. BUT SERIOUSLY, I can’t take Dune seriously because it takes itself too seriously. This isn’t to say Villeneuve doesn’t give the material the fresh vision it needs; it’s a marvel to look at, and the story is presented with the clarity it requires, although you’ll still want to pay close attention and not chomp your Cheetos too loud during dialogue sequences (compare it to Lynch’s Dune, which drops so much exposition on us, it’s like being buried beneath two dozen mattresses). But it’s still somber and dry — like, I dunno, something vast and tan with very little moisture? — and a little too tied up in its sense of ceremony to encourage our emotional involvement. That goes for the grand cinematography, state-of-the-art CG effects and the overall massive scope of the project, technical exercises that rarely cease to impress but suck all the air from the drama. Are we supposed to care about the fate of the Atreides, the dastardly behavior of the bad guys and the foreordination of Paul, beyond their existence in a movie plot? Two factors may be at play here: If you’ve read Herbert’s book — which I haven’t — the context may be deeper and the rewards greater. And watching it at home on a TV — which I did, since we here at Decider are all about the streaming experience — no matter how large it may be, doesn’t seem to do it justice. I sense the potential for greater immersion in the theatrical presentation, although that may not atone for the lack of a sense of dramatic consequence. (Blade Runner 2049 was still thoroughly engrossing at home.) There’s also a third factor, that Dune is all setup and world-building for a humdinger of a second movie, although you’d think, after two-and-a-half hours, a star like Chalamet might find an emotional foothold in the material, which is heavily adorned with names, places and spiritual and political implications, but not enough recognizable human behavior. Villeneuve stages a few exhilarating action sequences which probably will blow away IMAXgoers, but there’s only a hint of sandworm spectacle, and the pseudo-divine implications of these great and uncontrollable forces of nature. Far too often, the film is a strikingly handsome bore. There’s a point where Baron Harkonnen says, “The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience,” which sounds like a defense of the movie. At this point in this incomplete story, I don’t buy it. Our Call: Dune — and Villeneuve, by association — may deserve a second chance in a movie theater. But as far as the at-home experience goes, SKIP IT and call me when Part Two is ready to roll. John Serba is a freelance writer and film critic based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," When I was around 12 or 13, I finally saw Star Wars. At the time I was a little confused about what all the fuss had been about. I’d been hearing about Star Wars basically as long as I’d been sentient, playing with my older cousins’ toys and internalizing the concepts of droids, lightsabers, Darth Vader, “the force,” etc. without ever experiencing the source material. When I finally did, I couldn’t quite grasp what it was that had blown all those Gen Xers’ minds. After a decade of buildup maybe it was inevitable that it couldn’t live up to the hype. Or maybe I just should’ve started with The Empire Strikes Back instead of A New Hope.  Whatever the case, watching Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s new adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal 1965 novel, has been in many ways the experience I had once hoped Star Wars would be. After years of never quite getting around to reading Dune, forgetting to watch Dune (1984) and Jodorowsky’s Dune, and pretending to understand memes about sandworms and the necessity of spice flowing, I now feel ready to jump into the world of imperial fiefdoms, Fremen prophesy, and Bene Jesserit tricks with both feet.  Yes, Dune, adapted by writers Jon Spaights, Eric Roth, and Villeneuve, is the first part of a planned serial and is essentially a movie without a third act. It might as well have a “TO BE CONTINUED” title card for an ending. But for this Dune virgin it was exactly what a Dune introduction needed to be: a compelling primer on the material that created a coherent universe, introduced intriguing characters, and left me wanting more. Fire up the thopters, we worm dance at dawn! Like Star Wars, Dune is set in a dimension where technology has advanced to the point of intergalactic travel while politics have regressed to those of medieval Europe; authoritarian empires, warring clans, hereditary dynasties, even sword fighting (explained through invisible shielding devices that bullets can’t breach but blades can). Like Star Wars, the front line of imperial strife seems to be a desert planet. Dune though, offers greater narrative justification for this: the planet Arrakis is a rich source of “spice,” which for the locals is an ayahuasca-like sacred hallucinogen but for the rest of the empire is the driving energy force powering interstellar travel. Their “unobtanium,” say. The Harkonnen have ruled Arrakis for years, growing wealthy on spice and treating the local Fremen brutally in the process, but the Emperor has recently dispossessed them. This remote, unintroduced Emperor has offered the fief instead to the rising Atreides clan, led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), who thinks he can be a kinder, gentler kind of extractive steward, not just profiting from the spice but adding the Fremen to his coalition in the process. “Desert Power,” he calls this plan, about which his son, Paul (Timotheé Chalamet) and concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) seem suitably skeptical, but cautiously hopeful that he can pull off.  Most of the film takes place during this transfer of power, as the Atreides move to Arrakis, a harsh environment where the war-like locals have learned to adapt both to water scarcity and to giant sandworms that can sense vibration and devour entire spice harvesters (think: offshore drilling platforms). Yes, the local Fremen have developed a little sand dance (my words) they do to avoid attracting the worms (Let’s do the worm dance agaaaaaaa-aaaain…).  The big question for the Atreides is whether the Emperor has given them Arrakis as a just acknowledgment of their rising power, or simply as a deliberate quagmire designed to ratfuck a potential rival. “The Emperor is a jealous man,” says Baron Harkonnen, played by Stellen Skarsgard in a CGI costume combining revolting corpulence with unchecked alopecia. A Scandinavian-coded race of villains, how about that.  Paul’s mother, meanwhile, comes from a race of pseudo-witches with mysterious mind-control powers in which she has been tutoring her son. The Fremen too think there may be something strange and prophetic about young Paul. “I think I recognize you,” says Stilgar (Javier Bardem), leader of Fremen cell, the first time they meet. Again, it’s hard not to notice the Star Wars parallels in a story with a desert planet, giant worms, an ancient religion, and a potential messiah, among other things (and Star Wars has been accused of being a Dune ripoff for years). Yet whereas I never quite understood what I was supposed to get out of a battle between “the light” and “the dark side” in Star Wars, Dune turns on a valuable commodity (“spice” can be actual spice, it can be oil, it can be rare Earth minerals, etc) and the feuds between warring clans with conflicting dynastic pretensions all trying to curry favor with an authoritarian state. The allusions there are endless, both historical and contemporary. Not that Dune needs to be an allegory, its characters simply have recognizable motives and the story has coherent levers of cause and effect. Star Wars feels like it’s all stitched together with vague platitudes and childish generalizations by comparison. It’s fitting that Disney owns Star Wars now because it feels, in mid-20th century parlance, pretty Mickey Mouse. Maybe this is all hopelessly remedial for the Dune scholars out there but it was exciting for me. This Dune being the first of a multi-part story may even play to Villeneuve’s strength. He has long been the best in the business at staging a scene, creating massive, immersive spectacles that have occasionally been a little weak on story structure. In Dune, he balances the book’s storylines deftly, staging spectacle always with an eye to suspense without the burden of closure and a cast that’s fairly perfect from top to bottom. I could watch Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson paint a house and it’s been wonderful witnessing the continued evolution of Jason Momoa as he plays more and more Momoa-like characters. It’s hard to tell whether Jason Momoa has become that much better of an actor or if Hollywood has just become that much better at recognizing what stories could benefit from some Jason Momoa. Either way, I’m happy. Give me all of the Momoa. The Momoa must flow! Maybe I’m just happy that I can finally do Dune memes now. In some ways it’s a blessing that Dune doesn’t have an ending. It allows us to focus on all of the best parts of the material (I can only assume) married to the strongest aspects of Villeneuve’s filmmaking: it’s an immersive, transporting, intriguing, fully-realized world that we can enjoy spending time in without rating against our ideas of which characters should “win” in that world. I don’t know how this story plays out but for now I’m content to bask in the spice glow. "
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," “Dune” is a gigantic, rumbling, otherworldly epic of a movie that’s slightly less than it seems, if only because it seems so huge. Director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) still has yet to locate a sense of humor, but it’s not really needed for this project, an adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 science fiction novel – or rather, the first half of it. Ironically, the story has influenced so many movies in the decades since the book came out that it arrives here slightly threadbare, but the film’s well-acted (by everyone except Timothée Chalamet as hero Paul Atriedes, who, to be fair, spends the first half of the novel in reactive mode) and Villeneuve gets to concentrate on world-building, which he does with a tactile, visionary inventiveness. “Dune” is a Warner Bros. movie, which means it’s also available on streaming service HBO Max, but if you feel comfortable doing so and take the necessary precautions, a theater is really the only place to drink in Villeneuve’s visuals and feel Hans Zimmer’s musique concrète score galumphing down your spine. The movie isn’t “Lawrence of Arabia in Space,” but it comes pretty close, and I say that as someone who went in a doubter. (Approached in a spirit of camp indulgence, David Lynch’s 1984 “Dune” has its amusements, and “Jodorowsky’s Dune” is a marvelously unhinged documentary about what may be the most influential sci-fi movie never made.) Wes Anderson has followed three of the best movies of his career (“Moonrise Kingdom,” 2012; “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” 2014; “Isle of Dogs,” 2018) with “The French Dispatch,” inarguably his worst. An omnibus film, it surrounds three short tales with several comic vignettes, and the conceit is that we’re “reading” a copy of the title magazine, a sort of “New Yorker” by way of France by way of Kansas (don’t ask). The first story, about a madman (Benicio del Toro) who becomes an acclaimed painter, is precious but watchable, and Tilda Swinton’s teeth are the funniest thing in the movie. The second, about a student uprising starring Timothée Chalamet (again) and a dowdied-down Frances McDormand, is incomprehensible. The third casts Mathieu Almaric as a doting father of a kidnapped child and Jeffrey Wright in a plangent riff on James Baldwin; it’s sweet but fatally cluttered. Even for a Wes Anderson movie, every frame of “The French Dispatch” feels oppressively coffee-table ready – a wryly anal-retentive labor of love hermetically sealed and disconnected from any larger sense of purpose. The sensory overload becomes exhausting, and then irritating, and then just dull – it’s a movie to be endured rather than watched. Only occasionally are there flickers of the melancholy, the inconsolable sense of loss, that permeate “Moonrise” and “Grand Budapest” and allow them to expand emotionally beyond their maker’s fussiness. Those movies were critical and commercial hits, which seems to have caused the director to double down on his house style until someone cries uncle, and that someone is us. Success may be great for Wes Anderson, but apparently it’s hell on his work. I'm terminally suspicious of Wes Anderson, because he always seems to be teetering on the (very precarious and crumbly) brink of overbearing preciousness. Then he manages to pull back just enough to make a great film-it'll be sometime before I wade into the French Dispatch. Dune, on the other hand, I can't resist. I'm the only boostered member of my family (as yet), so I'll likely just sit six inches from the flat screen... I am totaally with jac, the post just after me. I mostly gave up on him a good while ago....I think the one I liked was the one with Bill Murray and Gene hackman and a wealthy NY family (now I will found out that wasn't even by Wes Anderson, so  it goes). His movies usually have some good side, but he manages to ruin them (for me, your mileage may vary)."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Despite its rich visual splendor -- and, truth to tell, the film's imagery is so sumptuous, it's near ravishing -- the idea that struck me most acutely watching French Canadian sensualist Denis Villeneuve's painstaking adaptation of the famous Frank Herbert novel ""Dune,"" is how much that book, first released in 1965, has gone on to affect the basic tenets of modern pop culture. George Lucas borrowed liberally from Herbert's extensive vision, with its specific hardware and parental dichotomies for his Star Wars universe; the Wachowskis ran with the idea of a preordained prophesied savior against brutal oppression in ""The Matrix"" (with help from, you know, the Bible); George R.R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" series features ""houses"" of different races and creeds, locked in a perennial power war, vying for control over an empire. The bloodlines run deep from Herbert's work to many of the mainstay pillars of modern futuristic narrative. With that in mind, it seems only fitting that the source material finally gets its day in the sun with an exultant adaptation that does it some semblance of justice. Herbert's novel, with its layers of political intrigue, moral philosophizing, and sophisticated world-building, was a wonder, but remained near impenetrable for cinema, despite David Lynch's somewhat misbegotten attempt in 1984. What Villeneuve has done is to take the epic essence of Herbert's storytelling and create an imposing physical manifestation of it: Practically everything in the film is of a scale that feels imposing, from the massive ships the different factions travel on, to the monumental edifices built for the ruling classes, to the 400-meter-long sandworms that travel under the surface of a desert planet, only to emerge from the depths of the dust like enormous sinkholes with thousands of tendril-like teeth. Perhaps most impressively, however, is the way Villeneuve, along with fellow screenwriters Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, have managed to condense Herbert's sprawling prose into something resembling clear-minded coherency. There's still an awful lot going on, but, as I mentioned casually to a publicist after the screening, it's largely ""penetrable,"" which is about as much as could have been hoped, given the source text. We meet callow Paul (Timothee Chalamet), the young son of the Duke of Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his mother, the Duke's concubine, the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) on the eve of a momentous occasion for his father, and the rest of the Atreides over which he rules. Emperor Shaddam IV (not pictured), in his infinite wisdom, has seen fit to bequeath the desert planet of Arrakis, with its untold riches of spice -- a powdery drug that has become essential for interplanetary travel -- to the Atreides, and so taking the planet out of the brutish control of the Harkonnen, led by the evilly corpulent Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), who terrorized the place for 80 years, laying waste to many of the sand-dwelling natives, the Fremans, in the process. Initially thrilled at the prospect of a new adventure, Paul's excitement, shared by his friend, the elite Atreides soldier Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), is quickly quelled after a near immediate -- and terribly predictable -- attack from the outraged Harkonnen shortly upon the Atreides' arrival, leaving their army in tatters. Paul and Lady Jessica go on the lam out in the desert, in hopes of locating the Fremen, and the mysterious young woman, Chani (Zendaya), who has been frequently appearing in Paul's prophecy-ridden dreams. As the book has been split into two films -- reportedly, Villeneuve would not sign on to helm it without the studio's assurance they wouldn't force him to try and tackle the whole thing at one go -- the talented director got the chance, like Peter Jackson in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, to take things at his own pace. The result is an epic film that feels suitably paced and weighted. Scenes are allowed to breathe, characters are granted nuance, and the action, while plentiful, doesn't feel overly stuffed. All of this helps gloss over the story itself, also appropriated endlessly by various YA-theme book series, of a White Teen to Save Them All, who arrives amongst the Fremen as the Chosen One, and continues to use his considerable powers to help free them from their world's enslavement. Not for nothing do the Fremen resemble Middle Eastern Arabs, living mostly underground, and in such dire need of saving, they require a pale-faced outsider to lead them. As a premise, it seems hopelessly out of step with the relative progressiveness of the modern canon, but there are at least indications that part two will perhaps distance the films from Herbert's novel in this regard. One can only hope. Still, Villeneuve, who has made his bones on enigmatic, high-end outre fare -- see: ""Arrival,"" ""Enemy"" and ""Blade Runner: 2049"" -- certainly knows how to sell the genre. A stylist at heart, the basis of his films, the technology that powers the narrative, seems plausible in his work, with a lot of attention paid to the look and feel of the monoliths, monstrous war ships, and spice haulers, such that it actually adds weight to the proceedings. You couldn't say (for a second) that his films are light on their feet, but in his hands, the added gravity and seriousness, reminiscent of equally portentous filmmaker Christopher Nolan, keeps the film from slipping into fictive silliness. Instead, we watch in some discomfort as Paul is subjected to the gom jabbar test, administered by an ultra-stern ""Reverend Mother"" (played by Charlotte Rampling), and, later, is handed a crysknife by Chani. The film's reverence for its own artifacts very much helps sell the enterprise as a whole. It's a necessary element to a story as dense as ""Dune,"" with its many politics-based plot tendrils, and entire subdivisions filled with characters (many of whom won't be making it to the film's concluding second half). Without believing in what we're seeing, at least in context of the narrative, there isn't a need to sink into the world Herbert created. If nothing else, Villeneuve needed to convince audiences the film was worth that sort of effort; and it says here he has solidly fulfilled that promise.

"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. From the time it was first published in 1965, “Dune,” Frank Herbert’s densely convoluted sci-fi classic, was ritually referred to as “unfilmable.” This hasn’t stopped directors from trying to film it anyway. Alejandro Jodorowsky tried for years in the 1970s before finally giving up. David Lynch’s infamous 1984 version, which he disowned after his producers recut it against his wishes, was followed in 2000 by a Syfy channel adaptation that few remember. Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune,” starring Timothée Chalamet, is the latest and certainly the most anticipated attempt, not least because the pandemic delayed its release for well over a year. With this much buildup, was the wait worth it? That depends, I suppose, on how much of a “Dune” fanatic you are. I’m not exactly an aficionado, but the prospect of realizing Herbert’s eco-visionary saga on the big screen, especially at a time when moviegoing audiences are aching to once again be overwhelmed, is palpable. From a purely pictorial standpoint, this new “Dune” is indeed often overwhelming. The sheer monumentality of it all is impressive. Alas, the film’s emotional power underwhelms. Turning a novel into a film is never easy. But it has proven particularly difficult for “Dune,” a book from the 1960s that has inspired subsequent sci-fi epics like “Star Wars.” The Monitor’s film critic assesses how the latest effort to take on Frank Herbert’s tale has fared.  When the film begins, one of the fiefdoms, the harsh House Harkonnen, is ordered off Arrakis by the emperor and control of the planet is ceded to the more egalitarian House Atreides, led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). The duke rightly suspects the emperor is laying a trap for him but nevertheless transfers his trusted lieutenants – played by Josh Brolin and, in the film’s most entertaining performance, Jason Momoa – to the planet along with his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Chalamet). There’s a great deal more to the story, but lest I demonstrate that “Dune” is not only unfilmable but also unreviewable, I’ll just add that Paul represents that timeworn avatar of sci-fi mythology – the newbie who mutates into a messiah. He’s the savior, or at least the savior-in-training, of this brutal world. No matter how impressive its special effects, a sci-fi movie ultimately has to do more than just wow us with them. Even though Paul is the spiritual center of this epic, his struggles seem rote. Chalamet has the right poetic-romantic look, but without the impassioned underpinnings. This is partly Villeneuve’s fault; he has a penchant for dwarfing his actors in the frame so they resemble stick figures viewed from an Olympian height.  “Dune” – which is billed as “Dune: Part 1” – has a bigger problem: Because Villeneuve, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, filmed only the novel’s first half, much of the action essentially plays as exposition leading up to a more stirring saga that never comes. After 2 1/2 hours, the film rather apologetically offers up the words: “This is only the beginning.” And yet no sequel is definitively in the works. At least when the first “Lord of the Rings” was served up, we knew we’d eventually get a full meal. For “Dune” devotees, none of this may matter much. But for those coming to this galaxy for the first time, the sense of incompleteness can’t help but be a letdown. And because Herbert’s visionscape heavily influenced so many subsequent sci-fi epics, especially the “Star Wars” franchise, we may feel as if we’ve seen it all before anyway. I admire any director who is able to create a self-contained world on such a scale, but this is an epic for the eye, not the heart. Peter Rainer is the Monitor’s film critic. “Dune” is available in theaters and on HBO Max starting Oct.21. The movie is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence and some disturbing images and suggestive material.  Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15. You’ll get the Monitor Weekly magazine, the Monitor Daily email, and unlimited access to CSMonitor.com."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE," “I don’t like sand — it’s coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.” So complains a pubescent Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, a film linked to the tentpole du jour Dune by more than their shared fixation on the unique properties of desert terrain.  The meat of Denis Villeneuve’s new space opera takes place on the planet of Arrakis, where the arid landscape glistens with a natural resource known as “spice,” a substance acting as super-drug, precious fuel source and possibly also the essence of life. But the parallels abound: Anakin’s counterpart is Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), another scrawny kid called up as the chosen one, with another intergalactic conflict he’s destined to resolve in peace. His rainy home world of Caladan bears more than a passing resemblance to Kamino, the precipitation-heavy planet cranking out clone armies in Episode II, and Arrakis shares a desert climate with Anakin’s native land of Tattooine. The gargantuan sand-worms impeding the spice harvests recall the fantastic beasts faced by Anakin and company in a gladiatorial match. There’s a Jedi-like cabal of powerful mystics called the Bene Gesserit, and even a nearly identical attempted-assassination scene carried out by a small mechanized insect. Villeneuve also owes a major creative debt to Lawrence of Arabia, the other sand-based epic chiefly informing its plot and look. He succeeds in replicating the endless, oceanic quality Lean brought to his footage of the dunes back on Earth in the god’s-eye-view photography of Arrakis, as if nothing larger has ever existed. Paul cuts a markedly Lawrence-ian silhouette as well, an empathetic emissary caught between empires in his adopted allegiance to the Fremen native to the region, a third-world population subjugated by his own colonialism. These works even bisect themselves around the same narrative juncture, the conclusion of Dune (Part One, as the title card announces) and the intermission of Lawrence of Arabia both falling at the hero’s defection to his chosen comrades.  There’s no sport in faulting nu-Dune on these familiarities, seeing as they’re all drawing from the same well of Campbellian mythmaking. The 1965 source novel by Frank Herbert predates George Lucas’s galaxy far, far away and the lion’s share of blockbusterdom, so it logically follows that the book’s latest adaptation would be in line with the half-century of pop culture it originally influenced. The three films mentioned share key tropes and a titanic sense of scale, but Dune is the black sheep of this illustrious family line for the utter solemnity of its presentation. Villeneuve has pulled off an impressive feat of sheer craft that is very large yet very empty, full of wondrous sights but shot with a staunch lack of wonder. Like the ceremonial electric bagpipes tearing a swath through Hans Zimmer’s deafening score, the film assumes the tone of a dirge, its dramatic peaks and valleys flattened into a sustained drone.  It’s a shame, considering the vivid, bizarre details of the text peeking out from the cracks in its adaptation’s somber front. The finer points of the script and its universe-building suggest a consciousness about the outré in Herbert’s initial writing that Villeneuve’s stone-faced approach rejects. It’s there in the inexplicable sexual tension between Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), as well as their names, two outliers of the Americanized ordinary in a story filled with people like Thufir Hawat and Glossu Raban. Or the gliding two-step walk that those traversing the desert must use to evade the sonar of the worms, in practice a hilariously inefficient method of locomotion that looks like a goofy little dance. Paul’s equivalent of the Jedi mind trick is called “the voice,” by which he can exude powers of mental persuasion simply by talking in a sufficiently commanding register. The phrase “desert power” is muttered on multiple occasions, seemingly never to anyone in particular. The built-in weirdnesses of Dune fight the self-serious attitude applied to a property previously realized by David Lynch in all its colorful, incoherent glory. The dissonance starts with the visual palette, Villeneuve working in a drab mix of blacks, greys and beiges, thereby breaking the cardinal rule of sci-fi: rather than an adventure anyone would dream of going on, space travel is made out to be a grim obligation for the House Atreides, their fate hanging on banalities like rates of mining and protein refinement. These matters can only be discussed with the utmost gravity, all scenes pitched at a subdued grittiness that breaks only with the arrival of Paul’s lone friend Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, his presence giving away the Game of Thrones connection the producers surely hope audiences will make). That he’s the only one having fun here throws the blanket stoicism into sharper relief; conversely, some of the most affecting sections concern the sluglike antagonist Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), his “Colonel Kurtz goes to the deepest reaches of the cosmos” vibe fitting perfectly with the grave attitude against which so many others clash. Credit where it’s due: Villeneuve’s not lacking in ambition, aiming for a grandeur nothing short of the stratospheric. He basks in extreme wide shots, taking an aerial view of the Atreideses’ army in block formations right out of the Riefenstahl playbook, their regimented immensity recalling imperial powers of the Western world. Much care has evidently been put into the design of the assorted ships as well, fashioned after a brutal minimalism in keeping with the “evil futuristic MP3 player” aesthetic of Arrival’s vertical flying saucers. In either case, whatever might be astounding about the size of these sights is nonetheless undercut by the gloom they radiate, the air of the fantastic having faded from these fantasies. The lack of basic characterization also contributes to the difficulty of personal engagement with these spectacles; the fate of Duncan Idaho in battle, to pick one example, means so little when we’ve barely spent any time with him beyond the occasional one-liner. While Villeneuve has long faced the accusation that he’s interested in ideas, things][ and people in that order, even the ponderous Blade Runner 2049 lent more depth to its leading man, and he was a robot. Dune benefits somewhat from a lowered bar, in that it looks unlike any other blockbuster of the current era. For its gargantuan scope, the clarity of its special effects, and its overall severity, it stands head and shoulders above the superheroic horde. But inviting comparison to so many cornerstones of the past exposes the lack of a certain something — not magic, but the awed attitude that believes in magic — holding back the full richness of the text. If the planned second installment that has not yet even started shooting does indeed come together, the contours of the story may naturally remedy this, Paul’s turn from oppressor to liberator striking a more stirring note. (Though that will inevitably open up a separate can of worms about white savior complexes, a conversation that could fill another essay’s word count.) Until that day comes, we’ll have this incomplete colossus more daring in its imperfections than most, the shell of an instant classic hollow on the inside."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply. Marvel superheroes, begone! It’s grownup season on the big screen, and this weekend’s new films have our critics pounding the table (and hoping you’ll hit the theaters). If you want your movie night on the sofa, check out Amazon’s rollout of 25 James Bond flicks to celebrate the franchise’s 60th anniversary (we’ve got the scoop, below). It’s a stirring weekend at the movies, so do pass the popcorn! Brace yourself for a scathing comedy that takes aim at the wealthy and the beautiful — and tosses all decorum overboard without a life vest. Set on a yacht captained by a Marxist alcoholic (the wily Woody Harrelson, 61), we encounter a luxury ship of fools, from the Russian capitalist (Zlatko Buric, 69) and the demanding privileged patrons; to the models Carl (rising leading man Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), who trade their looks and social media influence for a free ride; to cleaner Abigail (scene-stealer Dolly De Leon) and the below-deck crew. When the inevitable storm hits, a small group washes ashore on a desert island. Wealth and beauty surrender to those with survival skills, and the balance of power radically shifts. From Ruben Östlund, the Swedish genius behind Force Majeure, the English-language satire won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for its outrageous takedown of the lifestyles of the rich and Instagram famous. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Writer-director Walter Hill, 80, who’s made classic Westerns on film (The Long Riders) and for cable (Broken Trail), recharges the form with a low-budget doozy. Christoph Waltz, 66, leads Hill’s tight ensemble through taut adventure as a bail enforcement agent who tracks a New Mexico oligarch’s wife (Rachel Brosnahan), ostensibly abducted by a Black U.S. soldier (Brandon Scott), deep into Old Mexico. It’s refreshing to meet characters like Waltz’s sly, stoic “bounty man,” or the mordant roughneck played by Willem Dafoe, 67, when they’re a long way into their lives. And when they re-meet, it’s explosive. Benjamin Bratt, 58, is a dashing villain, Hamish Linklater, a skin-crawling cuckold, and Warren Burke, an exuberant sidekick who becomes Waltz’s full partner in a tale that fleshes out Mark Twain’s thought: “Laws control the lesser man. Right conduct controls the greater one.” —Michael Sragow (M.S.) Christian Bale is ferociously wonderful in Amsterdam. He sings, wisecracks, injects painkillers, has WWI battle scars and is frequently seen adjusting (or chasing) his glass eye. He leads a suitably eye-popping cast: stunning Margot Robbie; John David Washington; Robert De Niro, 79; Mike Myers, 59; Chris Rock, 57; and many more. While Amsterdam flashes back to WWI, it’s largely set in the 1930s, as veterans and compatriots Ben (Bale) and Harold (Washington) witness a socialite’s murder. Under suspicion themselves, they attempt to expose the real culprit. They gradually realize her death isn’t an isolated incident; there’s a fascist cult in lockstep with genocidal European tyrants intent on scrambling domestic democracy. From Oscar-winning showman David O. Russell, 64, there’s so much razzmatazz, artistry and comedic snap — yet the antic pastiche lacks a satisfying mystery plot and, sadly, is less than the sum of its amazing performances. —T.M.A. ​Talk about stirring the martini: Amazon celebrates James Bond’s 60th anniversary by streaming every Bond flick, from Dr. No to No Time to Die, on Prime Video. There’s also a documentary, The Sound of 007, and a recording of a charity concert of the Bond soundtracks, The Sound of 007: Live From the Royal Albert Hall, with special guests including “Goldfinger” singer Dame Shirley Bassey. If Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series about the Milwaukee cannibal, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, doesn’t slake your taste for psychological horror, try this three-part documentary, which explores the serial killer’s warped mind through his newly unearthed recorded interviews with his legal team, revealing the ways that race, sexuality, class and policing allowed him to prey on marginalized communities. We haven’t heard a whole lot from Girls creator Lena Dunham lately. But her adaptation of this 1994 best-selling novel, a medieval coming-of-age story about a young girl dodging her parents’ plans for her to marry, was well received at the Toronto Film Festival, so maybe all she needed to get her creative mojo back was a new setting (like, say, the 12th century). Our critics scanned the entire film catalog from the 1930s to now to handpick just 30 films that you must ­— must — see. We’re not talking about the best films (everyone does that list) but rather the films that are essential. You want to have seen these movies not just because they’re great (they are), but because they ensure you’re tuned into their cultural moments, the power of their time. So when someone makes a Philadelphia Story reference or deadpans, “the Dude abides,” you know exactly what they mean. It’s truly amazing how many incredible movies there are available on mainstream platforms like Amazon, Netflix and others. Our critics round up the very best for you, no matter what your interest. Check out the latest “Best of” lists from AARP critics. There’s never been a better time to catch up on movies you always intended to watch. Sigourney Weaver, 72, is staggeringly good: as in Hildy Good, a driven divorcée, mother of two grown daughters, and Realtor who survives from house sale to house sale. With a stiff upper lip, she puts on a brave and perfectly polished face. Snappy responses shoot out with a deflecting charm. But once her family stages an intervention, Good gradually realizes — after one blackout too many — that she doesn’t control the bottle; it controls her. Together with charmer Kevin Kline, 74, as her rustic high school sweetheart, the pair generate heat and heart connection in a mature sleeper that’s ultimately about the struggle to live an authentic life. The Good House dramatizes how alcohol, that demon brew, can take possession of a hardworking woman, her family and their collective future. There’s got to be a morning after, and Good ultimately confronts it with Yankee fortitude, lobster dinners and a front-row seat at A.A. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Ok, maybe it’s time to worry, darling. High on her directorial debut, the delightful Booksmart, Olivia Wilde turned to Stepford Wives dystopian sci-fi. 1950s housewife Alice (magnificent Florence Pugh) makes a mean pot roast and a stiff martini. She shares a mid-century modern with husband Jack (pretty but bland teen idol Harry Styles), who returns daily from his workplace beneath a mysterious mountain and ravishes her in conjugal bliss. But there’s a crack in the dream: The next-door neighbor (KiKi Layne) freaks out; the big boss (a dapper Chris Pine) has messianic tendencies; and Alice starts to snoop at the fringes of the utopian community with dire consequences. The glossy, beautifully shot movie, swamped by incidental gossip about Wilde and Styles coupling on set and tension between her and Pugh, arrives with plenty of baggage; it’s a lot of buildup for a modest payoff. —T.M.A. Around 1995, filmmaker Tyler Perry, now 53, was a stone-broke nobody. He chanced to meet the legendary playwright August Wilson, who inspired him to write his own first screenplay, now at last a movie. It’s an August Wilson-ish melodrama about a shy 1930s Georgia musician (Joshua Boone) who falls for a beauty (Solea Pfeiffer) who passes for white. He becomes a hot Chicago musician, she marries a white racist. When they reunite in their small hometown in the 1940s, murder occurs. The movie is a mess, but ambitious and interesting, and less messy than the shambolic Madea comedies that made Perry a billionaire. The music scenes, from jumpin’ juke joint to ritzy nightclub, boasting tunes by Terence Blanchard and dances by Debbie Allen, are dazzling. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) Muscular and well oiled, Oscar winner Viola Davis, 57, vanquishes and vanquishes again as the emotionally and physically scarred General Nanisca, who cuts through rival tribes and European slavers in a war epic from Gina Prince-Bythewood, 53. Set in the 19th-century West African kingdom of Dahomey, this violent, female-driven history centers on the triumph of Nanisca’s women-only army, loyal to King Ghezo (an underused John Boyega). It’s also the tale of new recruit Nawi (The Underground Railroad’s outstanding Thuso Mbedu) and her journey under Nanisca’s critical eye from abused daughter to machete-wielding warrior. While the movie’s treatment is surprisingly conventional, the tale of women empowered to own their own bodies couldn’t be timelier. —T.M.A. Charming, happy-go-lucky and loose with the truth, Fletch, the title character of the late Gregory McDonald’s easily digestible crime series, has found joyous casting in Jon Hamm, 51. Opting not to pursue the slapstick route of the role’s previous star, Chevy Chase, 78, in Fletch (1985), Hamm’s Irwin M. “Fletch” Fletcher is easy on the eyes as the journalist-turned-sleuth. While investigating a kidnapping and art heist, Fletch is framed (pun intended) for a murder he couldn’t bother to have committed. Colorful characters abound: Kyle MacLachlan, 63, as a germaphobe art dealer; Roy Wood Jr., as a slow-but-steady barking police inspector; and Marcia Gay Harden, 63, going full Anna Magnani as a seductive countess intent on regaining her abducted husband’s priceless paintings. The result is a delightful Gordian knot of a mystery solved by a nutty guy who never breaks a sweat as he wisecracks through life while tripping over corpses. —T.M.A. No conventional music documentary could capture an artist as mercurial as David Bowie. So it’s good that director Brett Morgen, 53, banished the usual parade of talking head blowhards to, instead, turn his doc into a psychedelic swirl of sound and vision. The only voice you hear belongs to the artist himself, swiped from scores of vintage interviews. The quotes float over a dense collage of images from Bowie’s career that, once projected onto the looming screens of IMAX (it’s also in regular theaters), sweeps the viewer into an immersive dream. Contrary to the cliché of Bowie as the alien who fell to earth, his words present him as a man of urgent flesh who brought creativity, insight and awe to every living moment. —Jim Farber (J.F.) Loosely inspired by Bentley-driving Georgia prosperity-gospel preacher Eddie Long, sued by congregants for sexual misconduct, this dark semicomic mockumentary stars Sterling K. Brown as disgraced Pastor Childs, battling to revive his megachurch alongside his increasingly exasperated wife, Trinitie (Regina Hall). The plot is aimless, the writing clunky, but what carries the film is the incandescent performance of the supernal Hall as Trinitie, who covets a beaded spider-silk white hat, props up her errant man (“I would sooner kill him than leave him”), half-conceals eruptive emotions beneath a sweet façade, and whitens her face to do “praise mime” (which is a thing!). Brown is solid, but his character is muddled, and it’s Hall who shines, as does the vivid cast of parishioners and rival preachers. The arch, jokey fantasy is richly rooted in writer-director Adamma Ebo’s ambivalent love of Southern Baptist folkways: the wonderful church ladies’ outfits with serious hats, the troubled lives even a scamming pastor can inspire, the use of Bible verses as proof texts for self-serving purposes, the way “Bless your heart!” can convey seething contempt. It’s a messy film but a lively slice of life. —T.A. ​Sylvester Stallone, 76, can’t stop, won’t stop. If the legendary action star’s run with The Expendables franchise proved anything, it was that the actor still knew how to entertain audiences and demolish rivals unrestrained by age. OK, he may be creakier than in his Rocky days and, thankfully, those painful romantic subplots are a thing of the past. Here, he dips his toe into the world of superheroes as one of two mighty twins: Samaritan and Nemesis. Two decades after an explosion that allegedly eviscerated both, his character is recognized by a young boy who idolizes him (Javon “Wanna” Walton, Euphoria). Samaritan stomps out of retirement to protect the fan from bullies, and good old Red City from rampaging villains, led by the gleefully evil Cyrus (Pilou Asbaek, Game of Thrones). If you like a Stallone action pic, and giggling bad guys driving old muscle cars, this one’s for you. —T.M.A. Idris Elba is noted for arty fare (The Wire, Beasts of No Nation), but he’s terrific in this popcorn thriller about a widowed doctor who takes his realistically squabbling young daughters (Iyana Halley and Leah Sava Jeffries) to their late mom’s South African village for a safari, to connect them with her past. A lion enraged by poachers attacks their jeep, attempting to prevent their future. Director Baltasar Kormákur (Everest) consulted with the director of the superb The Revenant, which featured Leonardo DiCaprio’s hand-to-paw combat with a CG bear, to make his CG lion realistically menacing. Though The Revenant is a lot better — and this lion has a terrible sense of smell, unable to detect the doctor clinging to a limb right over its head — Beast delivers its jolts effectively. It’s 90 minutes well spent. Rogue Agent is a cunning, creepy fact-based thriller about a Ted Bundy–like serial con man. Played by the charming English actor James Norton, best known for his hot priest on PBS’s Grantchester, Robert Freegard is a sweet-faced devil — but make no mistake: He is a devil. The first bizarre act we see is Freegard’s convincing three college students that he’s an MI5 member, uprooting the trio in the middle of the night and deploying them on an undercover “mission” — really an act of kidnapping and extreme manipulation. He then seduces sharp-witted Alice Archer (ex-Bond girl Gemma Arterton). The lonely but chic-as-hell lawyer should know better but finds him irresistible enough to ignore his story’s inconsistencies, until she begins to dig into his past and gets dirt under her manicure. The true-crime tale, anchored by Norton and Arterton, is both classy and chilling on the windy road to the fiend’s comeuppance. —T.M.A. The payoff is worth the wait in Ron Howard’s 147-minute docudrama about the rescue of 12 members of a Thai boys soccer team and their coach from a flooded mountain cave — the basis of the terrific 2021 documentary The Rescue. This movie doesn’t tell us enough about the lads: Netflix secured their story rights for a miniseries. This Amazon Original film hopscotches among pressured public servants, frustrated families and heroic volunteers. But Howard pulls everything together when British cave divers (Colin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen) reach the kids and an Australian colleague (Joel Edgerton) hatches bold plans for their extraction. Legions of saviors, including Thai Navy SEALS, demonstrate the right stuff in scenes that are simultaneously spooky, poignant and thrilling. —Michael Sragow (M.S.) As Brad Pitt, 58, globe-trots promoting his latest action comedy, he’s breaking the male movie-star mold by wearing funky fashions: skirt sets (nice knees!) and shamrock-green suits. He’s equally loose and alive as “Ladybug,” an unlucky hired gun struggling to achieve work-life balance while pursuing a recon mission amidst four other assassins on Japan’s express train. Pitt’s surrounded by a dazzling cast of villains played by Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, 61, Zazie Beetz, Michael Shannon and a sliver of Sandra Bullock, 58, all in fine form. The well-written movie hurtles along, bouncing between zingers and stingers, a runaway train of entertainment. Among the few summer blockbusters that demand theatrical viewing, leave it to Pitt (alongside Cruise, 60) to ensure that movie stars still have the potential to rule the box office — with the right vehicle, like a Bullet Train. —T.M.A. Jordan Peele owns the summer. Amid heat waves, he lures audiences back to air-conditioned theaters with a big, glossy, funny, gross, scary horror movie. A little bit Close Encounters, a little North by Northwest, Nope is nonstop entertainment. Working with Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya (his version of Cary Grant), Peele weaves a wild Western UFO tale. It follows a brother-of-few-words struggling to maintain the family’s Hollywood horse-wrangling business while a suspicious disc cruises above their inland California ranch. Joined by his fast-talking sister (a delightful Keke Palmer), an alien-obsessed techie (Brandon Perea), and a traumatized former child star (Steven Yeun), they battle to survive and capture the wily alien — on film. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard veteran character actor Michael Wincott, 64, as the dour cinematographer delivering the lyrics to Sheb Wooley’s 1958 “The Purple People Eater” in his gravelly voice. —T.M.A. Cinderella’s got nothing on Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville, 66), a widowed British housecleaner of a certain age with a dream: to own a fab frock by Dior. Though there’s a potential Prince Charming in her future, she’s the one who makes the dream happen, saving up to invade France’s haughtiest haute couture salon, guarded by formidable Mme. Colbert (Isabelle Huppert, 69, portraying a nicer version of the scary fashionista Manville got an Oscar nomination for playing in Phantom Thread). Once there, she charms all, befriends and advises young lovers, calms class warfare, wins the best dress, and overcomes heartbreak. It’s wispy fantasy, but lovable Manville and a winsome cast make it feel real. Need a mood boost right now? This is it.  —T.A. A giant of women’s fiction (12 million copies sold), Delia Owens’ novel Where the Crawdads Sing was plucked by Reese Witherspoon’s Book Club, and produced by her as a film. Naturalist Kya (Daisy Edgar-Jones) raises herself from wild child to womanhood in the North Carolina wetland, earning her the derogatory nickname Marsh Girl. Dumped by college-bound Tate (Taylor John Smith), she’s seduced by Chase (rising star Harris Dickinson). When Chase tumbles from a fire tower, Kya becomes the prime suspect. A cross between The Notebook, Fried Green Tomatoes and To Kill a Mockingbird (David Strathairn, 73, stars as Kya’s defense lawyer), the romance will satisfy fans of the book but suffers from abuse overload. Abandoned by her mother, siblings and drunken father, beaten and sexually assaulted, Kya’s defiance is admirable. But why create such a dynamic character only to make them fate’s piñata? —T.M.A. Baz Luhrmann’s best movie since his masterpiece Romeo + Juliet (1996) is brilliant but overlong, and Tom Hanks (65) masterfully wrestles with a flubbed role as con-man manager Colonel Tom Parker. But Austin Butler is an utter wonder as Elvis, and Baz is even better, frenetic yet nimbly precise, the camera leaping from Elvis belting the first rock hit, “That’s All Right,” to the child Elvis peeking at a Black singer performing the blues original in a wicked juke joint. Quick as a cricket, Baz’s dazzling cinematography conveys his subject’s roots in Black blues and gospel, and Gary Clark Jr., Kevin Harrison Jr., Yola, Shonka Dukureh and Alton Mason are superb as influencers Arthur Crudup, B.B. King, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Big Mama Thornton and Little Richard. Hanks does his best as Parker, narrating the King’s heroic, tragic arc while robbing and ruining him with carny marketing and god-awful films. Elvis balks when Parker tries to make him sing songs like “What Child Is This?” — Parker calls it “Whose Child Is This?” — in a cheesy Christmas special. But he permits Parker to imprison him in Vegas, doped up, instead of touring the world. Baz makes Parker almost nice, vague when the movie (and authenticity) need him to be vividly villainous. Still, you likely won’t see a more original film this year. —T.A. The charming YouTube-sensation short about a brave, inch-tall seashell (voiced by Jenny Slate) gets the full feature treatment, demonstrating a gigantic heart and an easygoing humor. The animated and live-action film follows the bighearted shell-on-sneakers as he navigates the disappearance in the night of a huge portion of his extended family, the diminishing abilities of his beloved immigrant Nana (the sly, moving vocal talent of Isabella Rossellini, 70) and a quest to recover his community with a little help from a heartbroken documentarian (the film’s director Dean Fleischer-Camp). Like wisehearted early Pixar films (Up), Marcel the Shell With Shoes On is a treat for the whole family, and a welcome respite from cynicism, sentimentality and anything-for-a-buck-ism. —T.M.A. Sometimes hard to watch but impossible to turn away from, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande tells the story of uptight, self-conscious widow Nancy Stokes (pitch-perfect Emma Thompson, 63), who hires smooth escort Leo Grande (Daryl McCormack, 29), hoping to find the adventurous sexual fulfillment lacking in her 31-year marriage. Nancy seems as if she’ll never be able let go of her fussbudget, retired teacher persona, even presenting Leo with a list of the sex acts she wants to tick off. But just when you think the film will end with Nancy abandoning herself to Leo’s confident charms, their antiseptic meetups take an abrupt, earthy turn. Nancy pries too much, and Leo’s self-assurance proves a mask concealing an interior as messy and sad as hers. Nancy has never had an orgasm, with herself or others. But their inauspicious coupling — however temporary — results in a happy ending for both. —Dana Kennedy (D.K.) Michelle Yeoh, 59, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 63, make beautiful movies together — and I hope to see them joined in everything from Westerns to crime thrillers. In this whacked-out, exuberant, multiple-timeline sci-fi actioner, Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a bedraggled Chinese immigrant living above the family laundromat with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, 50). While sandwiched between her cranky father, Gong Gong (James Hong, 93), and moody daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), she finds herself on the wrong side of IRS auditor Deirdre (Curtis in a crowd-pleasing, physically comic performance). In other words, she’s doing the everywoman juggle, except that in an outrageous series of multiverses, Evelyn has to dig deep, find her inner kung fu fighter, make peace with Joy (who often appears in outrageous costumes as her mother’s multiverse antagonist), Waymond and Gong Gong, and save the world. Spoiler alert: She succeeds — and global audiences will emerge feeling like winners, too. —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"Working from an adaptation he wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, Villeneuve has gotten an enormous amount right, from the casting to the epic scale."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL," Dune is directed by Denis Villeneuve and co-written by Villeneuve with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts. The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has been having recurring dreams of the planet Arrakis and a mysterious girl (Zendaya) who lives there, along with a holy war that spans the universe. Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Issac), is assigned fiefdom over Arrakis to harvest its “spice”—a substance that increases human vitality and allows pilots to navigate the universe. House Harkonnen, who previously held dominion over Arrakis, plots the downfall of House Atreides while Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) encounter the Arrakis natives known as the Fremen. Dune is not only known as one of the most influential novels in the science fiction genre, but it’s also been notoriously difficult to adapt. Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film adaptation of Dune in the 1970s, but the production fell apart. Other filmmakers, most notably David Lynch, have given their own take on the novel over the years, but Villeneuve’s is arguably the most faithful to the source material. That is partly due to Villeneuve’s decision to split the book into two parts to capture the novel’s events fully. However, this has the unexpected side effect of making the film feel like the buildup to far more interesting events—it literally ends as one character says, “this is only the beginning.” Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson was able to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien’s novels into full-fledged films; I think that with a bit of tweaking, Villeneuve could have easily made a three-hour cut of Dune. (Especially since he’s on record saying that the second part depends on the first’s box office returns.) There’s also the matter of culture to consider, particularly MENA culture, as the Fremen are inspired by Arab culture. Though Villeneuve is on record saying that he didn’t want Dune to be interpreted as a white savior story, I feel that it would have made more of an impact if the Fremen themselves were portrayed by actors of MENA descent. David Dastmalchain, who actually is of Iranian descent, has a woefully small role as the ghoulish Piter de Vries-the right-hand man to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). And while I admire Javier Bardem’s performances, he’s about as Arab as I am. Villeneuve has said that Dune is a passion project, so it’s strange that he hadn’t taken this into consideration. I will give Villeneuve this: he knows how to make a visual masterpiece. Cinematographer Greig Fraser shoots some stunning images: a massive spaceship rises from the waters of Caladan, where House Atreides makes its home. Golden rays of sunlight fall on the sandy dunes of Arrakis. A trail of missiles leaves fiery orange trails in their wake as they descend upon the ground and consume ships in a gulf of flame. Villeneuve also approaches Dune the same way he did with previous films, including Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival; he takes his time and lets the scenery wash over the audience, immersing them in the world. This is the right approach to take with a book like Dune, which was packed with paragraphs full of description. The film also boasts one of the most star-studded casts in recent memory. Chalamet is a solid presence as Paul but ends up being outshined by many of his co-stars, including Issac, who shifts from parental pride to righteous fury with ease. The standouts of the cast are Jason Momoa as swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Josh Brolin as weapons master Gurney Halleck. Momoa’s boundless charm makes Idaho one of the most interesting characters in the film, and Brolin brings his trademark intensity to bear when Gurney and Paul engage in sparring matches. Ferguson is also a compelling presence in the movie, as it’s revealed that Jessica is part of the Gene Besserit—a secret society comprised of women who hold designs on the shape of the universe. And Dave Bautista is pure nightmare fuel as Harkonnen’s nephew Rabban, a hulking albino behemoth who is chomping at the bit to slaughter his uncle’s enemies. Dune is a visual marvel and boasts a star-studded cast, but splitting the book into two films leads to what is essentially an extended prologue. Should Dune: Part Two be greenlit, it will contain the most exciting sequences in the book and will hopefully be worth the wait.

Adapting Frank Herbert’s seminal 1965 science fiction novel Dune as a film has continually been a tricky proposition. The cult psychedelic icon Alejandro Jodorowsky infamously tried to do it in the ’70s and failed so spectacularly that a documentary was made about the fiasco. Dune eventually made it to the screen in 1984, courtesy of David Lynch, but it was a mostly ill-received flop (though Herbert appreciated it). Further efforts to “get it right” started and stalled over the years, dwindling to perhaps the ultimate indignity for an important work of speculative fiction: an early 2000s Sci Fi Channel miniseries.  But now the stars have aligned for another big-budget go at Dune, with the caveat that the new movie adapts only half of the story — “Part One” is not included in any promotional materials but displayed clearly in the title. That over $150 million has been put into a film that requires a sequel but has no guarantee of one is quite the risk on the part of Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros., to put it both mildly and kindly (especially since it will be released in theaters and online simultaneously, much to the chagrin of director Denis Villeneuve). The desert planet Arrakis is the only known source in the universe for “spice,” a substance of incalculable importance to the interstellar empire of humanity. The brutal House Harkonnen has grown wealthy thanks to their control of the planet, while the respected House Atreides is winning more and more prestige within the empire’s nobility. Threatened by both houses, the Emperor plays them against one another by giving dominion of Arrakis to Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), who recognizes the trap but cannot refuse the position. With his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), Leto and his retainers find Arrakis unfamiliar and hostile — not just in the climate, but also because of the native Fremen, who have chafed for decades under Harkonnen oppression. And that’s before the Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) launches his plot to violently retake Arrakis for himself.

The biggest problem with turning Dune into a film is not its epic scope (enough money and ingenuity can take care of that), nor the potentially alienating complex terminology and lore. It’s that as time has gone on, the book appears increasingly derivative of generic sci-fi tropes — not because it is derivative, but because it is the source of many of these tropes. Herbert combined his pet interests in mythology, ecology, history, and religion to create a story about a war over a desert planet, and then Star Wars came out and gave mass audiences an extremely specific reference point for science fantasy taking place on a desert planet. For more than 50 years books, movies, video games, music, and more have cribbed bits and pieces from what Herbert built. How do you present these elements in a fresh way in 2021? Villeneuve (who also co-wrote the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) tacks into a sincere, serious, and above all faithful interpretation of the story (faithful to the point of insisting on doing it in two parts without any assurance that the second part would even happen). If there’s one aspect of Dune that hasn’t been much imitated, it’s the plot’s critique of what Herbert called “the superhero syndrome.” In Paul Atreides, he fashioned a dark version of a chosen one narrative. Paul has special abilities because he has been eugenically bred to have them; there are prophecies on Arrakis telling of the coming of one like him because for millennia the secret powers of the empire have deliberately spread such prophecies to make the populace easy to manipulate. While the books lack grounding in true anti-colonial sentiment, the prospect of Paul becoming a messiah figure to the Fremen in order to turn them into weapons against the Harkonnen is a grim one, and definitely not the “White savior” tale it may first appear to be.  It is tough to judge how well Villeneuve understands this without seeing the payoffs for all the setups here, but there are hints that he gets it. In the opening, Fremen fighter Chani (Zendaya) wonders in voiceover who her people’s next oppressor will be, which is followed immediately by a cut to Paul. The military attire of House Atreides looks distinctly fascistic. One sequence pays clear homage to Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (Paul is wearing essentially the same outfit as the figure in the painting), making ironic use of a touchstone for the Romantic self-image of the European man.  In contrast to Herbert’s deconstructive approach, George Lucas cited studies in monomyth and traditional archetypes when conceiving Star Wars, and it makes sense that the latter work’s straightforward romantic (lower-case R this time) vision caught on with popular culture. One way that this Dune perhaps benefits from being made in this post-Star Wars age is that it puts work into humanizing characters whom Herbert often rendered from a distance. Besides adding scenes to explicate the setting, the film also adds welcome warmth and familiarity. In the book, when Leto tells Jessica he should have married her, it reads like a Bible quote (particularly because he prefaces the declaration with “my beloved concubine”); here it’s played much more tenderly and intimately. The movie’s insistence on keeping things grounded works less well for the visuals. In many respects it looks like a good deal of other contemporary sci-fi blockbusters, particularly in the costuming and vehicle designs. It’s unclear how much leeway the crew may have been given to indulge themselves, lest they spook an executive. It was always unlikely this movie would look as cool as the concepts that fan artists like Alex Jay Brady have drawn up, but it’s a bit disappointing. Fortunately there are still moments that look appreciably like they could be prog rock album covers. More importantly, the film invokes a sense of tremendous scale, and this is where its gravitas works most in its favor. People are frequently dwarfed by their surroundings, be they warships, industrial machinery, or rocky wastes. Thousands of fanatical soldiers invoke a bloody ritual before battle. A flying machine tears through a storm like a leaf. Human beings are utterly minuscule before the icons of the Dune series: the enormous, godlike sandworms of Arrakis. It truly feels like these characters are struggling to control their destinies amidst an overwhelming universe. The most frustrating thing about Dune is that it does enough well to leave anyone who can appreciate it thirsting for how Villeneuve and company will handle the rest of the story, which contains most of the incidents that would truly let them go wild. Such fans will now simply have to wait to see if this film performs well enough for the green light to glow for the second part. As it is, Dune is intriguing but inescapably incomplete.

"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE,"I'm eager to see where Part Two takes these characters, but the awe-factor of Part One is seriously diminished by a lackluster script that gets stranded in the desert of its own creation."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Adapting Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" for the screen has proven to be somewhat akin to ingesting the potentially fatal sandworm bile known as the Water of Life. Men may not have died in the attempt, but those who tried failed to adequately transmute Herbert's full vision. That alone is reason enough to appreciate Denis Villeneuve's mesmerizing interpretation of this sci-fi masterpiece, the release of which was delayed due to the pandemic. His take on ""Dune"" isn't merely fascinating and narratively coherent. It is a gorgeous sensory immersion that holds us in its spell for hours, with an ending that sparks yearning to see what comes next. The ""Blade Runner 2049"" fandom likely expects this, given the confidence with which Villeneuve's 2017 sequel honored Ridley Scott's 1982 classic while assuredly evolving its timeline. One might even think of that movie's evocation of a futuristic Las Vegas as a trial run for the filmmaker's version of Arrakis, except his desert planet isn't a ruin but a place of forbidding beauty, dressed in velvety waves of sand and life-sustaining spice. But any concerns surrounding various ""Dune"" remakes have less to do with a creator's track record than their ability to successfully wrestle Herbert's dense, extensively branching mythology into a form newcomers can grasp and people conversant with the text can appreciate. ""Dune"" may have defeated David Lynch in 1984, but it didn't ruin him; time has transformed the convoluted debacle into an oddball classic many view with affection. Villeneuve mitigates the novel's perilous complexity by presenting it as a two-part journey instead of trying to jam the entire tapestry into a single pass. This approach invites us to consider this movie as the world-building chapter of what could, and should, become a franchise chronicling Timothée Chalamet's youthful Paul Atriedes' maturity from an uncertain teenager tossed into the wilderness into a messiah who threatens to rearrange the social order. The main caveat to this approach is that it bucks the modern cinematic tradition of such stage setters. Moviegoers are used to entering epics on a fast-moving current of explosive clashes and heart-pumping skirmishes leading up to a final battle. Be warned, then, that anyone expecting an equivalent to the Death Star exploding or sword-wielding heroes slicing up goblins and orcs may be disappointed by how heavily ""Dune"" skews toward establishing the political intrigue at the heart of Herbert's mythos. That Villeneuve charts that path as deftly as he has here is a testament to his storytelling skills and his awareness of both the limitations of the standard theatrical format and the audience's patience for detail. Lush and complex as his adaptation is, this ""Dune"" also strips down the primary plot to the essentials, first by introducing the prodigious rivalry between Houses Harkonnen and Atriedes, the two most prominent families in this futuristic empire. The Harkonnens are cruel, barbaric overseers of Arrakis who have made an obscene fortune from mining spice, a substance with psychoactive qualities that is at the heart of commerce and technology in the known universe. Their enrichment comes at the expense of the indigenous people of Arrakis, the Fremen, who they've spent generations slaughtering. Without warning or explanation, in the year 10191 the Emperor orders Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) to take over stewardship of Arrakis from Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), decreeing that Harkonnens abandon the planet. Ever the loyal servant, Duke Leto, his son Paul and his concubine Lady Jessica, Paul's mother (Rebecca Ferguson), uproot their household and their house's military strength from their lush, marine home world to the place colloquially known as Dune. Meanwhile Jessica, a member of a politically influential religious sisterhood known as the Bene Gesserit, receives a message from the imperious and cruel Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) that she and Paul, who has been having prophetic dreams, may have another fate to reckon with. The noble, charismatic Leto is no simpleton.  He knows the Emperor is jealous of House Atriedes' popularity and deduces his ruler is walking him into a trap. Not content to pick up where the Harkonnens left off, Leto Atreides decides to form an alliance with the Fremen instead of waging war on them. This is the aspect of Villeneuve's approach that could go some way to transform this story's reputation of being the quintessential sci-fi white savior tale. On the face of it, that's precisely what it is despite Villeneuve's recent insistence during a press event that it is a critique rather than an example. Helping to sell that view is the choice to shift the opening narration from the Emperor's daughter, Princess Irulan, to Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen warrior who recurs in Paul's dreams. The script doesn't place Irulan's dialogue in Chani's mouth, either, charging her to set the terms of this myth from the perspective of her people. She speaks of the spice harvesters ravaging the land, the cruelty that the Harkonnens inflicted on the Fremen. Then she wonders aloud, ""Who will our next oppressors be?"" Zendaya and Chalamet's combined magnetism is enough to sell tickets, and along with Ferguson's and Isaac's appeal, their selection to play these roles needs little explaining. This half is mainly Chalamet's showcase, however, and he strikes a credible equilibrium between the guilelessness of a sheltered royal and a eager, curious young man ill-prepared for god-level power and responsibility, let alone leadership of a great house.  As the bloated floating Baron Harkonnen, Skarsgård's presence is shadowed for much of the movie but his menace drips off the screen nevertheless. Dave Bautista's casting as Baron's brutish nephew Glossu Rabban amounts to even more of a preview, which speaks to Villeneuve's implied desire to save the bulk of the desert warfare for a second movie that has yet to be officially greenlit. Viewed as an origin story, ""Dune"" delivers on the story elements people may have found lacking in previous versions. Jason Momoa does justice to swordmaster Duncan Idaho, one of the book's most popular characters alongside Gurney Halleck, well-played by Josh Brolin. But as is true of Bautista's casting and the near absence of other major constituencies in this story, Brolin's limited screen time is mostly a tease of what's to come, as is Javier Bardem's, who plays Stilgar. Without a disciplined script, a gallery of impressive stars can only make a film work to a point. Villeneuve and his writing collaborators Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts demonstrate their awareness of this by emphasizing timeless themes in the story while capitalizing on the cast's ability and the expansive grandeur of each planetary territory to ease exposition into the plot's flow. Attuning Herbert's fable to forcefully speak to the sentiments of this age, they clearly delineate the divide between the sacred nature of the spice and its industrial value without exoticizing the indigenous characters. If anything it better establishes the arrogance of invading forces and how foolish assumptions of superiority can lead to a land's and a people's undoing. The script wisely chooses to explain less and show more, relying on the audience's curiosity and imagination as partners to Greig Fraser's wondrous cinematography. Villeneuve's finest work is in scenes that draw us into Paul's hazy dreams, floating on Hans Zimmer's heady score. An equal portion of the marvel ""Dune"" inspires must be credited to the props and visual effects teams. Getting the design of sandworms and the life-supporting stillsuits right are a prerequisite to success. But the less obvious stylistic particulars complete the artistic seduction, like the bonsai in the background in Leto's official chambers on Caladan, or the elegance of the flying transports that resemble dragonflies. Every inch of plot and the screen upon which it unfolds begs to be enjoyed on as large a canvas as possible. ""Dune"" is available to HBO Max subscribers for free, but unless you have a superior living room theater set up, you'll be robbing yourself of the absorptive experience a theater offers. Whether you're left astonished or impatient by the ending, knowing this part of the journey is only the beginning is reassuring – and makes us hope we don't have to wait long for the continuation.

"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE,"If you expect a sensual, kinetic, visually exciting movie version of Frank Herbert's renowned 1965 epic sci-fi novel, be prepared for a presentation of global malaise instead."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"DUNE is an awe-inspiring, epic science-fiction masterpiece, carefully crafted by one of the best directors working in the genre today."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," There’s big movies and then there are movies like Dune which aim to be bigger than big in scope, plot, and detail. Adapted from the ground breaking novel, Dennis Villeneuve brings his sense of wonder to the story of feuding houses, resource allocation, and a Chosen One. In the future, the empire control a planet called Arrakis, the only source in the universe of spice, a compound that makes space travel possible and leads to higher thought. Previously held by House Harkonnen, the emperor soon transfers stewardship to House Atreides headed up by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Leto realizes that something might be up with this but must comply. He moves his advisors and family to the planet. At the same time his son Paul Atriedes (Timothee Chalamet) is beginning to come into his own unique powers under the guidance of his Bene Gesserit mother (Rebecca Fergusson), whose order has other potential plans. Their presence on the planet sets into motion events that will change the direction of the universe forever. One of the strongest aspects of this film are how the sense of grandeur really amplifies the narrative. Denis and his incomparable collaborators (Greg Fraiser, Patrice Vermette, the VFX team) seamless work together to bring the script to life and blend in with the script. Every world and character is defined in every aspect, and alongside the script it wasn’t difficult to follow. This is an astounding feat considering the way the story unfolds. While you might be confused with the names of the characters, you definitely won’t be lost with the intergalactic politics. I loved how the movie gives you the tools you need to realize what’s happening so that you can be immersed in the world of the characters. Where Dune sort of loses the audience is that by nature of being only half a story, the movie starts to stall even as it builds towards its conclusion. It’s a very strange conundrum as the movie gets infinitely more action packed as it moves. Even as the visuals remain excellent, something about the pace of events unfolding before ending on a note that feels consequential for the characters, but not for us as viewers. Yes, it very clearly is a part one of a two part story but much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, it struggles to make the ending of the first part of the story whole."

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," The last line in Dune is: “This is only the beginning.” It had bloody well better be. Because as wondrous a movie as Dune is – and it is epic, Homer-meets-Shakespeare-by-way-of-Star-Wars epic – it is still only half a story. And if director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve doesn’t continue the tale of Paul Atreides’ coming of age on the desert planet Arrakis – I mean, I guess I could reread the second half of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, but where’s the fun in that? Villeneuve, who cemented his science-fiction bona fides with 2016’s Arrival and the following year’s Blade Runner 2049, proves himself more than equal to the task of adapting a literary classic. It’s an undertaking that stymied such directors as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Ridley Scott and Peter Berg, all of whom were attached to earlier versions before dropping out. David Lynch’s 1984 film has its fans but was undeniably a box-office flop. Part of Villeneuve’s genius is the way he initially sketches out his characters in broad strokes – “I am smiling,” says weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) at a command from the Duke to lighten up – and then gradually fills in the details. The introduction is gradual, but by the end of the film we feel we know them intimately. The action is set in the year 10191. Dune-atics more versed in the lore than I will tell you that dates are measured from the founding of the Spacing Guild about 10,000 years hence. Any way you slice it, it’s a long time from now in a galaxy right here. Oscar Isaac stars as Duke Leto Atreides, benevolent ruler of the planet Caladan. As the story opens, the Emperor has granted him stewardship of Arrakis, whose wealth-generating properties (thanks to a substance known as “spice”) are rivaled only by its harsh climate, giant sandworms and an irascible group of early settlers called the Fremen (rhymes with lemon). Leto arrives with Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), whose title of ducal concubine is not nearly as demeaning as it sounds. She’s one of several strong female characters in the movie, alongside Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet-Kynes, a kind of local governor who was male in the novel. There’s also Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen woman of whom we’ll see much more in (ahem) Dune: Part 2. Others in the royal household include the aforementioned Gurney Halleck, and Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, a trusted lieutenant who brokers a fragile peace with Fremen leader Stilgar, played by a delightfully taciturn Javier Bardem. And of course there are bad guys, including Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a role I could see being played by a late-career Marlon Brando, and which was once offered to Orson Welles in the never-made Jodorowsky version of the 1970s. But the central character in novel and movie alike is the Duke’s son, Paul Atreides, a Messiah-in-the-making played by – well, I was going to say a brooding Timothée Chalamet, but when is that lad not brooding? He looks like his first words were: “What is this thing called life?” Regardless, he’s great in the role, watchful and wary and a little cynical. When his mother tells him that the people of Arrakis have been conditioned by a mystical female-led order known as the Bene Gesserit to expect a saviour from off-world, he scoffs: “Planting superstition.” She shoots him a look: “Preparing the way.” Villeneuve does a fantastic job of world building here. There are alien tongues and secret sign languages. The dialogue is formal, even a little stilted – “What’s mood to do with it?” Gurney snaps at Paul when the young man says he doesn’t feel like fighting – without ever falling into the pseudo-Shakespearean valley. There is architecture that would make Brutalist buildings seem like cozy cottages in comparison; ’thopters that look as though someone had reverse-engineered a dragonfly; and an almost comical number of shots of spaceships landing, hatches ratcheting open and ramps descending. I’m assuming most of the visuals are computer-generated, but if these were practical effects then the hydraulics budget must have been enormous. Oh, and after decades of space lasers that go pew-pew-pew and shoot out congealed nuggets of photons, Dune gives us a real Martian heat ray that slices through the air like a killer spotlight. It’s just another small example of a director who doesn’t take anything for granted. It all adds up to a glorious two and a half hours of cinema, often grim but punctuated with grace notes of happiness and even humour. At times it feels as if the characters, and by extension the actors behind them, can’t quite believe their good fortune to be taking part in this tale. The first line in Dune is: “Dreams are messages from the deep.” It is part warning, part invitation. Don’t be afraid. Fear is the mind killer. (If you don’t get that reference then it applies to you even more.) Open your eyes, and let the dream take you. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," How much we know about Paul, how intriguing the machinations of the plot, how far the story moves — these are almost incidental factors. The film is endlessly artful and unforgettable. Was it a perfect, indelible effort? No. Would I see it again today? Yes.

"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL,"The sharp modernization of the previous, incredibly theatrical version is accomplished by making it visually and tonally cinematic."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,Fans of the novel will weep with joy as the film gets it absolutely correct .. It is the best that science fiction movies can offer in the modern age. HAIL Frank Herbert & DV!
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," James Bond is still on a one-man mission to save the beleaguered cinema industry, but he was at least joined yesterday by a rampaging army of angry giant sandworms.  Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not the masterpiece some have proclaimed it to be, but it is the roaring, sprawling embodiment of a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen available. Villeneuve's last film, unveiled four years ago this month, was the excellent Blade Runner 2049 — the French-Canadian director has form in the business of tackling science-fiction material freighted with baggage. The baggage in that case was Ridley Scott's original Blade Runner. Could Villeneuve do it justice with a sequel after 35 years? He did. With Dune, the baggage is Frank Herbert's bestselling 1965 novel, which scared off film-makers with its narrative breadth and thunderous symbolism until David Lynch had a go in 1984, a suitably apt year in which to spin a futuristic yarn. Unfortunately, Lynch's adaptation span out of control. It was a bloated, incomprehensible mess. So here we are again, in the year 10191, transported once more to the planet of Arrakis, a fiercely inhospitable expanse of arid rolling desert where the only creatures that feel truly at home are those worms the size of dirigibles. Tunnelling through the sand, destroying everything in their path, they are meant to inspire awe. So I'm almost ashamed to report that I found them a hoot. They are risible dirigibles. Arrakis, by the way, contrary to appearances, is also a treasure house. It contains vast quantities of 'spice', the most valuable commodity in this forbidding universe. Spice production is a guarantee of obscene wealth. Without spice, we are told, 'interstellar space travel is impossible'. You'd have to be a little slow on the uptake not to recognise spice as a euphemism for oil, our own earthly holy of holies. The story begins on the more salubrious planet of Caladan, home to the noble house of Atreides, where dreamy Prince Paul (Timothee Chalamet) keeps having visions featuring a beguiling beauty from some faraway place. Of particular interest to the Emperor's mysterious Truthsayer (Charlotte Rampling in an extravagant black headdress), Paul's vision turns out to be beautiful Chani (Zendaya), who lives on distant Arrakis as one of the oppressed Fremen tribe. The Fremen, led by the brooding Stilgar (Javier Bardem), are warrior-serfs, subjugated by the dastardly House Harkonnen, who have been harvesting spice for decades and duly living high on the hog. Speaking of hogs, their ruthless leader is the terrifyingly corpulent Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard in a fat suit). Are you keeping up? Back on Caladan, Paul's father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) plans an alliance with the Fremen as a way to muscle in on the spice business. In homage to Scary, Ginger, Sporty, Baby and Posh, let's call him a spice wannabe. His wife Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) isn't sure about any of this, and she's not the only one. My tip is to mug up on the story beforehand. Still, it's a heck of a spectacle, with great visual effects, fabulous cinematography (by Greig Fraser), and a soaring Hans Zimmer score. It helps to keep that oil metaphor in mind as the Atreides troops land on Arrakis, aware that if the furious sandworms or the Harkonnen fundamentalists don't nobble their attempts at friendly colonisation, the scorching heat will. Just to flog the modern-day allusions even harder, Paul refers to 'a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire'. Similarly unquenchable are the bagpipes with which the Atreides announce their arrival. Whether it's depressing or uplifting to find that bagpipes are still around more than 8,000 years from now, with so much else having presumably fallen into extinction, you'll have to decide for yourself. If Dune is a hit, incidentally, then we are certain to get a sequel; this movie only covers half the story. I saw it at last month's Venice Film Festival, emerging from the premiere into a hysterical mob of 'Chalamaniacs' desperate for a glimpse of young Timothee. They will be thrilled that he also looms large in The French Dispatch, as a wild-haired student revolutionary in writer-director Wes Anderson's idiosyncratic 'love letter' to journalism in general and The New Yorker magazine in particular. Anderson has certainly assembled a spectacular cast: Chalamet, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Willem Dafoe, Benicio Del Toro, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, Lea Seydoux, Christoph Waltz, Henry Winkler, Adrien Brody . . . the list goes on. And his film, segmented into four separate stories, each dramatising a feature article in The French Dispatch, supposedly an outpost in provincial France of a Kansas newspaper, is undeniably exquisite to look at, its every frame a thing of beauty. Moreover, I write as a huge fan of Anderson's last live-action feature, 2014's glorious The Grand Budapest Hotel. His deliberately mannered narrative and visual style can work triumphantly. But, while mindful of the rhapsodies heaped on it by others, and having seen it twice just to be sure, I found The French Dispatch to be a pretentious slog, mystifying in its storytelling, laboured in its comedy and generally far too adoring of itself.  Dear Evan Hansen (★★✩✩✩ 12A, 137 mins) is the film version of the hit stage musical about a troubled high school kid, Evan (Ben Platt), crippled with shyness and anxiety, forced to sustain the pretence that he was the best friend of a classmate who committed suicide. The situation springs from the letters he writes to himself by way of therapy, one of which is found by the dead classmate's mother (Amy Adams). She thinks her son wrote it, and so the misunderstanding develops. Hats off for the idea of trying to address teenage mental health issues through the medium of a musical, but by the end of this overlong film I felt like I'd waded waist-high through treacle. It is slickly done, and a fine cast includes Julianne Moore as Evan's single mum. But there are reasons why the film has bombed in the U.S. and I can't disagree with any of them. Best Sellers (★★✩✩✩ 15, 102 mins) tries just as hard, and fails even more dismally, to yank the heartstrings. It stars Michael Caine as Harris, an ancient, cantankerous author who, 50 years after he wrote his only novel, a big bestseller, is tempted away from his reclusive existence to save a venerable publishing house run by his old editor's daughter, Lucy (Aubrey Plaza). The pair then go on a tour to promote his new book, and I think we are meant to find their relationship by turns funny and moving. In fact it's neither, largely because it isn't remotely believable. Off the top of my head I could name 20 better odd-couple generation-gap movies. That said, it's always nice to see Caine, who first said he was retiring and then that he wasn't. Either way, we should probably cherish him while we can. The Boss Baby 2: Family Business (★★✩✩✩ PG, 107 mins) is a sequel to The Boss Baby, the 2017 animation which gave a baby (voiced by Alec Baldwin) a business suit and a briefcase, and was great fun. Baldwin's back for this one but, alas, it entirely lacks the charm of the original."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," The title on the screen for Denis Villeneuve's ambitious new adaptation of Herbert's dense (and some say unfilmable) sci-fi novel, reads Dune: Part One. Whether or not there will be Part Two depends on how many punters will sit through a sombre 155-minute epic that doesn't have an ending. Thankfully, at least this one manages to correct most of the earlier film's mistakes. The plot makes sense, the special effects are stunning, the score is by maestro Hans Zimmer (not cheesy rockers Toto) and we don't have to suffer the sight of Sting in a codpiece. Again, most of the action takes place on the commodity-rich planet of Arrakis where gigantic sandworms patrol the desert plains and the Fremen wage guerrilla war on their colonial masters from House Harkonnen. Their leader Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) wants a treaty with the Fremen. But before his benevolent form of colonialism can take root, the bloated Baron launches a surprise attack."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Antes de aparecer el logo de Warner, un fuerte ruido retumba en la sala y aparece una leyenda: «los sueños son mensajes desde las profundidades». Así es como empieza Duna, la más reciente película del director canadiense Denis Villeneuve. Ésta le significa el mayor reto y su película más personal a la fecha. Paul Atreides es un joven que pertenece a la familia de la casa Atreides. Ellos viajan al planeta Arrakis para administrar la sustancia más valiosa del universo, conocida como “la especia”. Los beneficios de ésta van desde la posibilidad para el viaje interestelar, hasta extender la vida y la mente. Sin embargo, el padre de Paul, Leon, sabe sobre los peligros que acechan en Arrakis. Especialmente con los miembros de la casa Harkonnen, quienes buscan crear un golpe de estado. Cuenta Denis Villeneuve que Duna llamó su atención a los 13 años gracias a la hipnótica portada de la primera edición en francés del libro de Frank Hebert. También lo cautivó la leyenda con la que comienza la película. El sueño para realizar una adaptación de la primera novela se fue gestando en lo más profundo de su ser. Y esto es notorio desde el primer fotograma de la película, hasta su último cuadro. Duna es una película que aborda elementos que siempre han estado presentes en los trabajos de Villeneuve. Algunos de los cuales incluso nacieron a partir de su temprana lectura adolescente. En Sicario existe una tensión política latente llevada a niveles básicos –como el encuentro entre un cartel y la policía en la frontera de Tijuana–. En Duna dicha tensión se cuece a fuego lento. Lo hace desde la preparación de Leon Atreides para llegar a Arrakis, hasta su enfrentamiento con los Harkonnen. Y todo ello gracias a una sólida interpretación de Oscar Isaac, quien denota una fuerte masculinidad sin caer en los lugares comunes del personaje ‘macho alfa’. Pero es el personaje de Paul Atreides quien encierra muchas de las inquietudes de los protagonistas del cine de Villeneuve: las dudas sobre liderar que tiene K (Ryan Gosling) en Blade Runner 2049, el reconocer la diferencia entre lo que es real y lo que no como Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) en Enemy, o la constante necesidad de una respuesta que tiene Kelle Dover (Hugh Jackman) en Intriga. Todo esto es logrado gracias a la interpretación de Timothée Chalamet como un protagonista alejado del arquetipo de Hollywood. Él no goza de un exceso de testosterona como los adolescentes de series y películas que apenas están por entrar a la etapa adulta y ya tienen cuerpos atléticos sacados de una rutina 24/7. Chalamet sigue siendo un actor delgado y con una estética frágil. Pero no por ello evita que exista una conexión y empatía con su versión de Paul Atreides.  Mientras el viaje de la familia Atreides recae en la introspección y la búsqueda por un significado, la película es una obra única en sus apartados técnicos. El diseño de producción, vestuario, maquillaje, fotografía y música se mezclan como pocas producciones en los últimos años -con todo y pandemia de por medio-. Cada elemento se suma al engranaje y Denis Villeneuve llega a niveles visuales de la talla de Star Wars: Una nueva esperanza.  Pero la grandeza de Duna puede desanimar a quienes esperan una película con historia circular. Podría ser un problema si necesitan una narrativa que cierre. Y es que Duna -o al menos su primera parte- es tan sólo el inicio del viaje y la experiencia de Atreides en Arrakis.  Mientras algunas de las obras de Villeneuve son cíclicas como La llegada o Blade Runner 2049, el cineasta ha experimentado con finales abiertos o incluso, para muchos, indescifrables como Enemy. La experiencia con Duna es sólo una más dentro de la filmografía del cineasta. Nos invita a explorar Arrakis y mientras más se adentra al desierto su protagonista, junto con nosotros, más profundo es el viaje de introspección.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune is about as big as films get, delivering one massive set piece after another as it explores the intricate worlds of its vast universe. It's epic in every sense of the word."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,A glorious spectacle that will please those who've been following the exploits of Paul Atreides for decades. This is what you've been waiting for. Let the spice flow.
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," There is a row of palm trees in front of the outer wall of the capital city of Arrakis, the desert planet also known as Dune. They require massive amounts of resources, and have grown straight and tall, tended by a steward who knows his job; who takes care and pride at spending the large sum of precious water to keep the majesty visible to all those who care to look. They are good-looking trees. The question is, do I want a handsome straightforward cultivated aesthetic? Do I want merely stylish iconography, when I have tread the wild, unwieldy, nightmare fuel, tangle of a forest? This is a question I struggled with, as Denis Villeneuve's Dune unfolded majestically on screen. It feels more like a beat for beat remake of the 1984 David Lynch cult fiasco, which is nevertheless beloved by many (Full disclosure: this includes me). It does not feel like a fresh adaption on Frank Herbert's timeless, and over-sequeled, source novel, however. Of course, I can only talk in partials, as Dune is only half a movie. The second act is not made at the moment. It is beholden to Warner Brother's profit margins, in an ongoing pandemic and theatrical exhibition crisis, so a comprehensive review of the *complete* film feels like a somewhat futile exercise, until the second half is realized and released; probably a couple years from now. Set far into the future, the human race is a scattered diaspora in the galaxy, connected only by a form of space travel that is made possible by Spice, which alters human consciousness, extends life, and allows the folding of space-time. Without Spice, there is no Empire. The Emperor of the known universe abruptly reassigns Spice production from the brutish and plundering Harkonnen family to the kinder, but still militant, Atredies family. The latter of which are shown in the process of relocating from their verdant cliff and ocean planet, Caledon (shot in Norway) to their new dusty, hostile home on Dune. The politics are fraught, and there is a plot at play to undermine the Atredies family from gaining too much power and possibly make a play for the Galactic throne. As the Duke, his concubine, his heir, Paul, and the A-lister entourage of bureaucratic and military mentors (and mentats) adjust to life on Arrakis, they try to suss out the mysteries of the local, oppressed desert people, balancing their colonial extraction of resources, with duty and honour. Young Paul is, of course, tested in this fiery crucible of this, the galactic game of thrones. Meanwhile he struggles with his own strange visions of romance and death, his future, and his legacy. Villeneuve and his production team throw all the money on screen. They create a seamless, fully realized, science fiction Middle East, complete with jihad, a century's long guerrilla conflict around religion, culture, and resources. As always, things are relevant to the West's dynamic with that 'Other' part the world. Resources are finite. Climate change is inevitable. Villeneuve is the cellist playing classical music as the world's stability is slowly sinking, and we all search for lifeboats. Perhaps the current geopolitics are too much to saddle on a slice of classy pop entertainment. If there is a 21st century concession to this adaptation of the material, it is lip-service paid to the oppressor / oppressed identity politics. Paul, and by extension, the entire Atredies clan choose to function as a reluctant White Knight. This is sensitive, even in a massive blockbuster, because it is not the 1960s or the 1980s anymore. I'm not sure if the film has 'done the work.' It is hard to say. The cast is composed of a diverse ensemble of international players, who, if I am being blunt, kind of sleepwalk through the material. I mean nobody embarrasses themselves, but serviceable is hardly the highest of compliments. Think of all nearly all of the top tier talent present, and consider many other performances, from all the principles here. Past performances by all were simply more alive which is reason for much of the casting, which does not quite come to fruition here. But, hey, they all do look great. The mere humans in the story are competing with the films greatest strength: Its majestic (ahem, IMAX) visuals. From the sweeping vista of Jordan's Wadi Rum valley (deeply familiar territory to viewers of Lawrence of Arabia, Prometheus, and nearly every movie set on Mars ever made), the rich fabrics and textures of the costumes, the brilliantly realized 'dragon-fly' helicopters, to the various palaces and cities of Frank Herbert's sprawling universe. The fully realized sand worms, with their long hair-like teeth, part the sand like water, which washes upon the rocks. It is unquestionably neato, but it all feels obligatory. There is a kind of death by committee, and a somewhat lack in any kind of idiosyncratic life beyond all the visual splendor. There have been spruious comparisons to the wilder and crazier WB remake, George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road which are ludicrous. It must be the smililar ochre hues of sand in each film.  Fury Road had a whole-cloth original, gloriously unhinged, sensibility. Villeneuve's Dune is content to merely pose. Think of how Villeneuve introduced and realized Juarez and its ruling cartels in Sicario, with Josh Brolin acting as the poet-warrior there too, and you will see what is simply not present in Dune. Villeneuve comfortably handled Ridley's Scott's Blade Runner remake/sequel, as they are brothers in production design and leading an army of talent by committee, and adept at the emotional ecosystems of replicants. He is less adapt at the intuition-led, off kilter dreamwalking (with a cumshot of camp) of David Lynch. Few are. I know it is wrong to review the film I wanted rather than the film I got. This is a nearly impossible task when the act of viewing feels akin to listening to a glossy cover of your favourite song (It should be noted that Dune was always my Star Wars, your mileage may vary, but get off my lawn!) So far, with only half a movie, there are so many things missing: Gone is the overture of the folding of space, as well as the slug-human Spice-evolved 3rd Stage navigators; it should be noted that this the very reason for the conflict and Bene Gesserit prophecy in the first place, interstellar mobility, the ability to live long and get high. A better world, but at a horrendous cost. Some key characters are not present in the first half of the film, others are given some more flesh than past incarnations. As it stands, Dune is that 3rd or 4th draft of an idea that loses the thing that made one passionate for the idea in the first place; by polishing the damned thing to death. Oh, bloody hell, bring on Part 2, with or without the perfect row of palms. Review, in slightly altered form, originally published during the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2021. The film is now playing throughout Europe and Asia, and will open in U.S. theaters on Friday, October 22. It will also be available to stream on that date via HBO Max."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s actually quite thrilling to witness the birth of the next great sci-fi franchise. The latest iteration of Dune is the film stellar director Denis Villeneuve was born to make, and will hopefully keep him happily occupied for the next decade, at least. It’s as if all the excellent genre films Villeneuve has made up to this point (Bladerunner 2049, Arrival, Sicario) were preparing him for this epic. And yes, it is a grand and glorious epic—the ultimate cinematic spice for movie lovers. “Spice” is the substance essential to the plot of author Frank Herbert’s seminal series, some say it’s his answer to Isaac Asimov’s Foundation, which has been so grandly adapted into a series on Apple TV+. It’s a good year for sci-fi. But don’t worry if you haven’t read the Dune novels. It’s been decades since I have, and I was still able to discern the plot details without confusion. In essence, in the distant future, the powerful House Atreides, led by Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is commissioned by the galactic Emperor to take over the desolate desert planet of Arrakis, which is essential because it’s the only planet where the most valuable asset in the universe can be harvested: a substance with almost magical powers called “Spice.” This is a perilous commission, however, as the Emperor’s motives are suspect, and the House Harkonnen, the previous managers of the planet, are reluctant to give up their power, and the planet natives, known as Fremen, are reluctant to give up their land and Spice. Then there are those giant sand worms to contend with— theyalso protect the Spice. Emerging from the intense intrigue is Paul Atreides (the perfectly cast Timothée Chalamet), son of Leto Atreides and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), an acolyte of the all female, mystical and powerful Bene Gesserit. Dune is the story of Paul’s legacy, survival and rise. And it’s told here with brilliant subtlety. Whispers and profound images give intricate details, with no obvious character ‘splaining to be found. Pay attention to the monument and meaning of images like water spilling through fingers, later replaced by sand, and to the first boot step on a new world. Allow yourself to be mesmerized by Hans Zimmer’s lovely and lyrical score. Simply go with the flow, and you will be amazed. I am aware that those more accustomed to non-stop space chases and futuristic battles may find the film tedious. Dune does have sophisticated and thrilling action scenes as well, but they’re dolled out with more discrepancy. They’re not jammed in just to pander to short attention spans. If you give reign to your more cerebral nature, you will appreciate the beautiful gestalt of Dune. It absolutely must be seen on the big screen.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Extraordinary and epic, this new adaption of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel doesn’t just demand to be seen on the biggest screen possible, it questions whether there exists a screen large enough to do justice to this Lawrence of Arabia meets Apocalypse Now space opera. Directed with a relentless majesty by Denis Villeneuve, the Canadian takes the tremendous sense of scale he essayed in Blade Runner 2049 and beats it mercilessly into a cocked hat as he crafts a tale of cosmic proportions. Assembling the considerable weapons of the Hollywood arsenal such as a huge budget, state of the art special effects, a pantheon of big name stars and a well known intellectual property, Villeneuve allies them to his astonishing vision and outstanding technical ability to deliver thumping action and spectacle on an out-of-this-world scale. Starring as Paul, a young man is stripped of his wealth and status, and outcast on a dessert planet where he begins to develop his mystical mind control powers, Timothee Chalamet further cements his heartthrob-with-talent status with a nuanced performance geared to character development.  If this setting all sounds familiar then you won’t be surprised to find there’s also an evil all-powerful empire and a brutal lord as the villain who commands an army of faceless stormtroopers. Dune was one of the key texts influencing Star Wars supremo George Lucas, but where he leant into the comedy, Villeneuve’s broadly faithful and respectful version embraces the slowly unfolding tragedy. With its litany of betrayals and battles Dune is at times extraordinarily exciting, yet the script has time to explore contemporary concerns such as resource scarcity and colonialism. It’s a film rich with its own internal history and yet also is remarkably intimate,  exploding with charisma as humanity blooms across the desert with romance, loyalty and love to spare. Paul’s dreams are filled with visions of a beautiful woman of the desert planet Arrakis, as she’s played by Zendaya this seems perfectly reasonable for a person of his age. And the accomplished actress brings much needed humour as she casts her lines with a delivery even more dry than Arrakis. Fans may feel short changed by her screen time, but her charisma allows her to make an impression even among this most manly of company. Paul’s troop of macho role models are played by Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Jason ‘Aquaman’ Momoa, and it’s the latter who’s swagger is closest the film has to a Han Solo character. Opposing them is the considerable muscle of Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard. This remorseless machismo is partially offset the icy presence of Charlotte Rampling, and a ferociously commanding Rebecca Ferguson, who’s quite astonishing at conveying the complex layers of emotions and pain involved in being Paul’s mother as she guides him to his destiny. Meanwhile Sharon Duncan-Brewster is given the gender-flipped role of Dr. Liet-Kynes, and makes it her own with a subtly powerful performance of openly guarded wit and grace. Villeneuve treats his audience as adults by throwing in Herbert’s vocabulary of ‘Fremen’, ‘Mentat’, ‘Bene Gesserit’ and so on, but this is no more puzzling than Sith, Jedi, and so on. Besides, the storytelling is so well rendered you could follow the story without the dialogue. Puny humans being terrorised by giant sand worms looks the same whatever language the characters are screaming in. Plus with the outrageous phallic symbolism of the hero having to master an enormous worm as proof of his manhood, it’s difficult not to imagine Herbert smuttily giggling to himself as he conceived the idea, and laughing out loud as he dared himself to write it. In a film of wondrous design, it’s the rotating winged aircraft resemble mechanical insects, called ‘thopters, which make you gasp, and stand alongside the Eagle craft of TV’s Space 1999 as a classic of sci-fi iconography. Complementing the monumental cinematography of Greig Fraser, who’s work can next be seen in next year’s superhero neo-noir, The Batman, Hans Zimmer’s score is a teeth-rattling achievement, even for this noted composer of titanic-sized themes, and Zimmer seems to have invented a new language of noise, which blends seamlessly into the equally unique and thunderous soundscape. David Lynch’s disowned 1984 film version has been not ungenerously described as ‘a glorious mess’. But I’ve respect for its imaginative leaps of hideous design, and it scores over this version in that it manages to complete the book in one sitting, whereas Villeneuve only delivers the first half or thereabouts of the book. However the sheer Everest-like enormity of Villeneuve’s Dune ensures it never feels like half a film, instead it feels more like a myth fashioned in primordial clay and brought to life by the lightning of the gods. This is a planet-stomping titan of a movie, and for us not be presented with part two would be a crime against cinema. A mobile interactive fiction game employing a bespoke combat system and hundreds of original illustrations, Nemo’s Fury is inspired by the 1980’s role-playing gamebooks such as ‘The Warlock of Firetop Mountain’, of the Fighting Fantasy series which celebrated its fortieth anniversary last year. There’s mayhem, monsters, maelstroms and murder as Nemo takes you from the South Pacific to the Northern Atlantic via Antartica and the Red Sea. And if they survive long enough, the player will of course fight a giant squid."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s the golden age of television, with epic cinematic tales on the smallest screens possible. Whether you are watching on a big Smart TV or streaming from your phone, we’ll tell you all you need to know about the best shows."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE," The new work from Wes Anderson, “The French Dispatch,” is a portmanteau film. That is to say, it contains a number of narratives—in this instance, four—that are neatly packed together, as if inside a suitcase. In truth, almost all Anderson’s movies, hitherto, have borne an air of packing; think of the boat in “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou” (2004), the train carriages in “The Darjeeling Limited” (2007), or “The Grand Budapest Hotel” (2014), with its stacks of servants and guests. Elegant containment is the norm. Does Anderson like to journey with an actual portmanteau, plastered with old travel stickers and smelling richly of worn leather? I wouldn’t bet against it. Multistory movies need something, even if it’s only the voice of a narrator, to link the various parts. In Julien Duvivier’s “Tales of Manhattan” (1942), say, a tailcoat is handed on from one section to the next. What binds together “The French Dispatch” is The French Dispatch, a fictional English-language magazine. It was, we are told, founded in 1925; produced in France, in the town of Ennui-sur-Blasé (which I strongly suspect of being fictional, too); and edited by a Midwestern gent named Arthur Howitzer, Jr. (Bill Murray), whose motto is “No crying.” Given that the end credits of the film pay specific tribute to Harold Ross and William Shawn, and also to writers such as Mavis Gallant, A. J. Liebling, and Lillian Ross, one can safely state that any resemblance to persons living or dead, or to publications that continue to flourish, is far from coincidental. Each chunk of Anderson’s movie is a dramatization, so to speak, of an article that is submitted to The French Dispatch. Our first reporter is Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson), who provides a tour d’horizon of Ennui-sur-Blasé, much of the touring being done on a bicycle. Then comes J. K. L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton), a vision in juicy orange. She lectures us, through prominent teeth, on the saga of Moses Rosenthaler (Benicio Del Toro), whose roiling oils, painted during his imprisonment for homicide, triggered a quake in the art world. Third in line is Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand), who is caught up in the “biological need for freedom” displayed by student protests—and, indeed, in the embrace of a young firebrand, Zeffirelli (Timothée Chalamet). There’s biology for you. Last and dandiest is Roebuck Wright (Jeffrey Wright), a doyen of the Tastes and Smells department, who is hot on the scent of cuisine gendarmique. Or, in plain terms, fuzz grub. Even by Anderson’s standards, the crowd of performers is comically dense. Supporting roles go to Elisabeth Moss, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Christoph Waltz, and Léa Seydoux. (The last two, like Jeffrey Wright, can currently be seen in “No Time to Die,” which seems to hail from another planet entirely.) Such density is a feature of the portmanteau: “Tales of Manhattan” was loaded with Rita Hayworth, Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Charles Boyer, Paul Robeson, Edward G. Robinson, and Ginger Rogers. Now, that’s a cast. Yet something else arises from the profusion of “The French Dispatch.” Here, we realize, is a director who is more at ease with a flurry of pen-and-ink sketches than with the heft of a finished portrait. He has faith in the superior expressive powers of the sketch, plus the knack of arriving, after hard creative labor, at an illusion of the artless and the weightless. If I had to nominate a presiding spirit of this magazine to whom Anderson is indebted, I wouldn’t pick a writer at all. My vote would go to Saul Steinberg. Exhibit A, should you wish to see this Steinbergian economy of wit at play, is one scene, or scenelet, in the jail-bound portion of the film. Moses—a painter incarnate, bearded and besmocked at his easel—faces a naked model by the name of Simone (Seydoux). She stands on a stool, one arm bent gracefully above her head. The atmosphere is wordless but not noiseless; “Shoosh,” she exclaims, dismissing him as he draws too near with his brush. Once the session is over, she hops down, nips behind a screen, and emerges fully clothed, in uniform, boots, and a cap. Ah, now we get it: Simone is Moses’s prison guard. We talk airily of an artist capturing somebody’s likeness, or essence, but here, in a beautiful twist, the captor is revealed as the captive, and the male gaze is placed under lock and key. All of which is a mini-film unto itself, and also a loving nod, I’d guess, to “Le Modèle,” the final chapter in the greatest of all portmanteaux, Max Ophüls’s “Le Plaisir” (1952). If anything, Ophüls clung even more tightly to his source—a trio of tales by Maupassant—than Anderson does to this magazine. (Note to hungry pedants: The French Dispatch bears a typeface similar, though not identical, to the one that you are reading now.) It must be said, too, that the warmth of feeling that ascends from “Le Plaisir,” like incense, lies at a far remove from the glancing coolness in which the new movie is encased. It would be churlish to deny that “The French Dispatch” is a box of delights; Wright, in particular, is a joy as the sauntering hedonist. Equally, though, it would be negligent not to ask of Anderson, now more than ever: What would incite him to think outside the box? Consider the upheavals that strew the movie’s third segment. Homage is being paid, incontestably, to Gallant’s two-part account of the Parisian riots which appeared in these pages in 1968. By and large, however, the chaos of that time is proffered onscreen in tableaux; the characters are studiously poised or, as is Anderson’s wont, photographed head on. When he presents a standoff between cops and angry youths as a literal chess match, with each side phoning through its next move, he does so not as a reactionary satire—a Swiftian snarl at these spoiled middle-class kids—but purely as a jeu d’esprit. Violence is tranquillized by jokes. I happen to admire anyone who can keep the ruckus of existence at arm’s length, for so long and in such style, but I can well imagine other viewers, more politically hands-on, bristling with exasperation, just as Zeffirelli bristles when, having composed a manifesto, he gives it to the correspondent for The French Dispatch. Rather than taking to the streets and brandishing his fervid text like a flag, she proceeds to proofread it. You say you want a revolution? Check your commas first. Halcyon days, for anyone who liquefies at the sight of Timothée Chalamet. In “The French Dispatch,” he has a wraith of a mustache and a burst of insurrectionary hair, and claims to be “shy about my new muscles.” His what? The theme is maintained in “Dune,” in which Chalamet looks moony, bony, boyish, and bloodlessly pale. He plays the hero, Paul Atreides, whose messianic mission, foretold in dreary dreams, may or may not be to lead an oppressed people out of bondage. One of Paul’s initial duties is to undergo tuition in single combat, although, to be honest, he doesn’t need weapons training. He needs half a dozen lamb chops and a side of spinach. The movie is adapted from Frank Herbert’s novel of the same name, published in 1965. The director is Denis Villeneuve, following boldly in the wake of David Lynch, whose film of the book, in 1984, turned into one of cinema’s most celebrated shipwrecks. The plot remains roughly the same. “The emperor of the known universe,” whoever he may be, dispatches Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his clan to take over from the Harkonnens (a real bunch of bruisers) on the dun-colored planet of Arrakis, there to continue the vital harvesting of “spice.” This, allegedly, is the most valuable of all substances, for it aids interstellar travel. But is the assignment a privilege or a trap? Even Herbert’s fans, of whom there are armies, would struggle to defend him as a natural namer. Paul comes from Caladan, which sounds like something you rub onto insect bites. Many of the characters are scarcely more than anagrams: Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck, Liet Kynes. As for Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), he is not, as you might think, an official mascot of the potato industry but a beefy warrior—and, in the event, the best thing in the film. Momoa seems to sense that the story is wandering dazedly hither and thither, none too fast, and needs punching awake. Hence the bracing moment at which Duncan pulls off his gloves and enters a fight, bare-fisted, against impossible odds.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s near impossible to make a movie epic that will knock your eyes out and still touch your heart. But director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) does the impossible with “Dune”—now in theaters and on HBO Max. He’s wrestled Frank Herbert’s dauntingly complex 1965 sci-fi novel to the screen and set it soaring. Not without setbacks. This “Dune” can sputter and flirt with incoherence as it takes 155 minutes to tell a tale that only encompasses half of the book. And those who watched the great David Lynch get tangled up in his knotty 1984 film version may be understandably wary. Don’t be. Canada’s Villeneuve finds the pow and the poetry in this pandemic-delayed cornucopia of visual astonishments that cost $165 million to produce and kept its cast of acting aces, led by Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Zendaya, sweating in the deserts of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates to make it happen. You don’t see the sweat, just the high-flying imagination of the extraordinary creative team. With due respect to all of them, the desert deserves top billing in “Dune” since the staggering vistas and sweeping sands dwarf mere humans and are never out of sight and mind. Chalamet, like a guppy Lawrence of Arabia, stars as Paul Atreides, the potential savior of this futuristic odyssey who soon learns the desert has all the power. His mission is to leave the wet planet of Caladan, ruled by his father Duke Leto (Isaac) and mother Jessica (Ferguson), to help them colonize the arid planet of Arrakis on the orders of an unseen emperor. There are obstacles Paul must first surmount. Arrakis has been under the control of the violent House Harkonnen, headed by evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), who doesn’t give up easy. And there are the locals, known as the Fremen, with glowing blue eyes, who claim Arrakis as their own. Paul has dreams of a Fremen beauty, played with alluring mystery by Zendaya. Arrakis, the Dune of the title, is the source of an addictive spice that can extend life, spark shifts in power and inspire creative feats such as a space fleet that defies rules of gravity. Just wait for the ornithopters, which are a cross between helicopters and dragon flies. Guarding the spice are massive sandworms—easily the movie year’s scariest and most enthralling special effect—that indicate young Paul has his work cut out for him if he’s going to be a messiah for the Fremen on this dangerous planet of the future. Paul has help, of course. His mother heads a semi-religious order known as the Bene Gesserit, which can confer superhuman abilities. On the practical side, Paul can count on the Duke’s loyal men-at-arms, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa). Momoa gets a few welcome laughs by mocking Paul’s lack of muscle. It’s brains that count. Chalamet carries the role on his slender shoulders, gradually achieving a sense of gravity that makes us eager to see how Paul will face his fate. Unfortunately, if you didn’t read the book, you’ll have to wait to see that happen on the big screen. “Dune” is definitely a “Part 1” with no “Part 2” on the horizon just yet. Frustrating? You bet. But Villeneuve, pouring stamina and soul into his passion project, keeps us hanging on. Is that enough? Only time and the fickle gods of box office will tell. But the potential is off the charts."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune is one of the most important and influential books of science fiction ever written. Its dramatic and complex universe coupled with a fusion of future and fantasy brings new meaning to epic. It might even define the word. But for almost 40 years, adaptations of the work have struggled. Alejandro Jodorowsky’s planned adaption never got off the ground, and David Lynch’s 1984 film is notoriously divisive (even for its own director). The 2000 miniseries on the Sci-Fi Channel came closer to success, if only because it gave the dense, sprawling narrative enough breathing room, but it still comes off as unwieldy in many spots.  Now in 2021, we have an adaptation by Denis Villeneuve, who’s already proven he can deliver heavy, atmospheric science fiction epics with style and skill in Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Will he be the one to finally get it right? If anything, he’s given us a masterpiece of a space opera that stands on its own regardless of its source material. Villeneuve’s film only covers the first half of the first Dune novel; if you’re not familiar with the book, seeing “Part One” appear under the film’s title card might throw you for a loop. It’s the year 10191, and we open on Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), heir and only son to Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). House Atreides has been commanded by the Emperor of the known universe to become the new stewards of the desert planet Arrakis and the spice it produces. Spice extends life and enables interstellar travel, and Arrakis is its only source. But House Harkonnen, Arrakis’ previous steward, has plans to destroy House Atreides, and Paul soon finds out that his destiny is not his own.  There’s much more to the story of course, but I’m going to leave it there not just because of spoilers but because there is SO much more story to unpack just in the first 30 minutes of the film. And even with Villeneuve’s streamlined and accessible way of presenting the story’s sprawling web of intrigues and connections, that first 30 minutes unfolds in a slow, stumbling, even stilted pace. It’s rough, no question, and it’s not entirely Villeneuve’s fault. This is a book that comes with appendices and a glossary, and even then the first part of it is so thick with exposition that it could induce headaches trying to comprehend it. But if you can trust Villeneuve’s approach, you will be rewarded with a gorgeous, elegiac melange of drama, action, and humanity. It’s clear that Villeneuve understands what makes the novel run and what keeps it resonant and vital. He allows the story to proceed in a measured, articulate way using a masterful ratio of dialogue, visuals, and music to paint his adaptation. His command of this palette can’t be overstated. His frame is engrossing, even insidious, slowly drawing the viewer in and making us invested in Paul’s story without us even realizing it. Timothée Chalamet initially comes off as perhaps an odd choice for Paul but ultimately proves to be the correct one. Possibly the only one. His Paul is definitely portrayed as the youngest and least worldly version of the character, and his understated approach to the part can initially come off as aloof. But Chalamet has a stronger understanding of Paul than his initial impression gives, and as the film travels forward, so too does his performance. He approaches the role with a very deliberate and tightened way of expression, slowly allowing more emotion out as Paul’s story progresses.  The dramatis personae of the film in general is quite well cast, and there are a number of memorable performances, especially Rebecca Fergson’s conflicted Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsgård’s hypnotically grotesque portrayal of Baron Harkonnen. Special note must go to Zendaya, portraying a native of Arrakis named Chani that Paul sees in prophetic dreams. Zendaya is alluring as the symbolic Chani of Paul’s visions, and Villeneuve films her with graceful, characteristic passion. When Paul eventually meets the real Chani in the film’s third act, Zenadya transforms that allure into a grounded charisma that is as quiet as it is confident.  As great as the cast is, however, it is also quite large. We meet at least a couple dozen characters in the first half of the film, and keeping track of them can be a challenge. Because the focus is so squarely on Paul — with a lesser focus on Leto and Jessica — this means that sometimes these characters come and go quickly with large gaps of time between appearances. And if you’re not paying attention, it’s easy to miss simple things. Like names. To be honest, I don’t remember some of the characters even being introduced by name.  Part of this is due to Villeneuve’s pared-down approach to the novel’s notoriously dense volume of lore. The first part of the film is heavy with exposition, which honestly could probably never be avoided, but other than that Villeneuve only gives us as much information as we need to place Paul’s story in context. He distills Herbert’s world down to something highly digestible, which may upset fans loyal to Herbert’s words but allows the film to becoming accessible. His approach gives the film a distinct flow, a distinct feeling of experience without sacrificing the essentials. You may never know, for instance, that David Dastmalchian is playing a character named Piter De Vries, but after one scene you know exactly what kind of character he is and how he relates to the plot. Villeneuve doesn’t fully rely on his cast to tell the novel’s story, however. A good portion of the film is moved forward solely by audio/visual narration. Much like he showed in Arrival, Villeneuve infuses the film with a kind of understated epic, hinting at the awesome scope of the story and individual scenes with a easy, adept hand. This approach is harmonized with by Hans Zimmer’s music, a sometimes dizzying, almost hallucinogenic score that is capable of quiet contemplation and heavy drama, sometimes at the same time. In some scenes, it actually conveys more emotional weight than the dialogue and performances. Both Villeneuve’s and Zimmer’s talents are brought fully to bear during the film’s action sequences, where this legato approach turns furioso without sacrificing any confidence or grace. But while those action scenes are part of pivotal plot points, they ultimately make up a small portion of the film, at least in relation to how the film was sold to the general public. For as assured and intriguing as Villeneuve’s film is, its trailers painted a poor picture of what to expect, focusing heavily on the action sequences when the film’s true heart is in the more quiet, emotional moments. This is a space opera, not an action blockbuster, and the truth of the matter might be jarring for those expecting the more Star Wars-esque adventure that the trailers hinted at. It’s important to see through that, however, because it cannot be stressed enough about what a gorgeous, humanistic film Villeneuve has crafted here. Beyond Dune’s complex and complicated canvas, it’s ultimately a story of identity and determination, of the discovery of hard, emotional truths that can only be learned through experience and painful self-examination. Villeneuve’s powers of storytelling are in full bloom, highlighted by an excellent cast, buoyed by an almost synesthetic score. This is a film that might be hard to step into but quickly becomes impossible to leave.  “It has certainly never been news to me that a brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is, and I have the right to say what I say about him.”"
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s seminal science fiction novel Dune (published in 1965) was previously adapted for the big screen by David Lynch in 1984. It was famously disowned by the cult filmmaker due to studio interference. Alejandro Jodorowsky also attempted to tackle the behemoth tome in the 1970s and failed; the reasons for its demise can be seen in 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune. And so, in 2017, this notoriously difficult-to-make film was placed in the hands of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve whose eye for large-scale, smart sci-fi can be seen in Bladerunner 2049 and Arrival. Villeneuve’s intention is to make two films, and though nothing has been officially green-lit to date, the opening title card states that this enthralling epic is ‘Part One’. What follows in the 155 minutes runtime finishes at about the half-way point of the novel, with a character teasingly stating: “This is only the beginning.” Whether that will annoy, excite or frustrate is in the eye of the beholder. For those not familiar with the book it follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he comes of age as successor to his father Duke Leto Atreides’ (Oscar Isaac) fiefdom and the inherited powers of his mother Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) who hails from religious order, Bene Gesserit. They are tasked with reigning over the barren, sandy dunes of Arrakis – a desert planet which was mercilessly colonised and mined for a precious material (the spice melange) that allows interstellar travel, by the Harkonnen (Dave Bautista giving off scary vibes as the leader of a menacing army and Stellan Skarsgård going full Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr Moreau as a power-hungry baron lurking in the shadows). The indigenous population, the Fremen (Zendaya and Javier Bardem among others), bear the vicious brunt of their planet’s hugely sought-after ‘spice’. The ensemble cast all do fantastic work with what they’re given, and there are some genius moves in terms of the actors chosen by the casting directors. Sharon Duncan-Brewster takes on the role of the originally male ecologist Liet Kynes. She imbues her performance, as a courageous expert in her field, with a commanding authority as she slides down dunes and confronts strangely beautiful sand worms – a combination of phallic and vaginal shaped monsters. Charlotte Rampling is entirely terrifying as a Reverend Mother dressed in a black beaded face veil (the costume design is exquisite across the board) and threatening young Chalamet with all the vigour of an otherworldly dominatrix. “What’s in the box?” asks Paul, in a splendidly judged page to screen scene. “Pain,” growls a regal Rampling. Chalamet plays Paul with both the fury of a teen discovering harsh realities, and the tenderness of a wise old sage. Chalamet’s scenes with Jason Momoa, as trusted guardsman Duncan Idaho offer some lightness to all the dramatic tension and the two bounce off one another like old friends. Meanwhile, his scenes with Ferguson, are laced with turmoil, as the mother and son bond is tested. The film focuses on how these two navigate a hostile environment, with the rest of the cast popping up for brutal sword fights, meticulously crafted action sequences, ghastly death scenes and treacherous scheming. It’s like Game of Thrones in space – minus all the sex. The worldbuilding is majestic as is the score by Hans Zimmer. The music works beautifully alongside awe-inspiring visuals of Arrakis (Liwa desert in Abu Dhabi); distorted bagpipes sound to the House of Atreides marching along like a fascist regime, and in moments of devastating destruction Zimmer ignites a loud creaking effect that makes the room shudder. Tension is often created through unnerving choral whispers, as characters take flight and in some of the most intense scenes, the sound dips in and out, to stomach-churning effect. Helicopters with the wings of dragonflies’ swoop in to view, with the sound of the loud whirring blades recalling scenes from Apocalypse Now. The burning palms planted and watered in the arid citadel of Arrakis (which bears a resemblance to the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu) and the hallucinogenic effect of the spice on Paul also displays similarities to the aforementioned film. Villeneuve makes people and objects look like ghostly, floating chess pieces – each playing their part in a violent game of tactics with no thought for human suffering. Paul’s visions fade in and out in dreamy fashion, effectively bringing his unconscious mind to life with melancholic flair. Every set piece is shot through with a powerfully haunting quality that makes the film’s themes of conflict, power and wealth linger long after the final credits roll."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL," The best science fiction uses semi-plausible ideas and imagery to ask the big questions, or get us caring about its characters. The recent films from Denis Villeneuve have internalized that idea: Arrival juxtaposes the limits of compassion and regret, while Blade Runner 2049 considers what it means to be human. It follows that Dune, his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling 1965 novel, should continue in that tradition. Somehow it has few ideas beyond its impressive special effects, and inert characters with fates that barely register. Dune is only half a story – the title card notes it is only “Part One” – and deserves some latitude, but only up to a point.  Before Villeneuve gets to the desert planet Arrakis, he spends time with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) on the temperate planet Caladan. Villeneuve and cinematographer Greg Fraser depict this planet, with imposing cliffs and oceans, in wan shades of blue and green. The filmmaker has little use for a vibrant palette, and the austere interiors similarly have no “lived in” quality. The screenplay, co-written by Villeneuve along with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, also keeps a respectful distance from the characters. Paul may have an adventurous streak, although he spends most of the film doing what he is told, whether the instruction is from his father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) or his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Expectations could not be higher for Paul, since he is heir to House Atreides, and they have an important new mission on Arrakis. Those expectations lead to an uninspired archetype: Chalamet is one of our most charismatic young actors, although here is mostly sullen or frightened. It is a wet blanket of a performance. As Duke Leto, Isaac’s performance has more nuance since this film gives him a complete arc. There is an intriguing mix of pride and regret because Duke Leto believes in honor, even when he walks into a trap. He takes his family and followers to Arrakis to mine “spice,” the universe’s most valuable resource, despite major political and existential threats. Aside from gigantic space worms that roam the planet – true to the source novel, they look like giant gaping buttholes – there are two groups of humans that resent the Atreides presence. The brutal House Harkonnen, led by the blob-like Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), had their post on Arrakis taken from them, while the Arrakis’ native population the Fremen want the interlopers off the planet entirely. This all leads to a siege on House Atreides, one that leaves Paul with no recourse but to wander the desert. The “wandering the desert” fate is one of many ways Abrahamic religion influences on Dune, since Paul might also be the universe’s singular savior. Despite all the tangents and factions, including the mysterious all-female Bene Gesserit, Paul’s prodigal son arc is so familiar – so entrenched in our culture – that Villeneuve could have made a leaner, meaner version of this story. Yes, David Lynch famously fumbled his more complete Dune adaptation, except he tried to explain everything, while this Dune wisely glosses over a lot of minutiae. It shows more than it tells, a typically laudable principle in filmmaking, except it show and shows until the narrative weirdly becomes the background. Indeed, Villeneuve’s primary interest is the enormity of this civilization. The spaceships and canvases are massive, giving a striking sense of scale, but Villeneuve feels they justify themselves, when they are typically one of many ways to advance the story. You know how Star Wars includes many scenes where Darth Vader and the others enter and exit spaceships? This Dune suggests those were Villeneuve’s favorite parts, since he pads out his two-and-a-half hour runtime with many, many entrances and exits. The look of Arrakis doubles the frustration, as the browns and grays do less than Caladan to capture our imagination. Great films have been set in the desert (Lawrence of Arabia is a clear source of inspiration), although they are buoyed by strong personalities, or characters are who too stubborn to die. Paul may be another interloping savior; he’s just no Lawrence. Dune is an impressive technical exercise, one that benefits from large-format screens, at least until the enormity somehow becomes monotonous. The “climax” of the film, the destruction of House Atreides, is really the end of act one. Villeneuve depicts battles, fights, explosions and mass murder that never once strikes an emotional note, whereas even more “cerebral” sci-fi like 2001: A Space Odyssey leads to palpable feelings of paranoia and awe. If Villeneuve has the opportunity for “Part Two,” then this Dune deserves a reevaluation. Until then, it is both frustrating and incomplete, an epic that celebrates grandeur for its own sake, so that finally humanity is an afterthought. 
I  completely agree with your take, Alan.  Part of the difficulty in adapting Dune is that so much of the book is internal dialogue. Lynch chose to expose it, Villeneuve chose to ignore it.  Without knowing the inner motivations and drives of these characters, they quickly become two dimensional. Lynch’s version is a mad fever dream and while it’s a bit of a weird mess, it certainly stuck with me. It’s much more fun and more memorable. Having just watched Villeneuve’s version, the only thing that comes to mind is beige. Acres and acres of beige. Bland characters, bland desert shots, bland set pieces.  The only thing I really enjoyed were the ornithopters.  Those machines were beautifully realized.  I think I cared more about the ornithopter falling apart in the sandstorm than I did for Paul or Jessica.  Speaking of Jessica, she seems a pale, beige shadow of the strong and commanding woman in the book and Lynch version. 
I still hope this film gets a second act despite my complaints, but as a stand-alone film with a sequel that’s not a sure thing, I think this movie fails.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," The hotly anticipated blockbuster epic ""Dune"" only gives fans half the story. The opening title proclaims it is ""Part One."" If there is a part two, and I sincerely hope there will be, the unified, complete narrative should be the defining adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic 1965 science fiction novel. However, as a standalone film, this lavishly produced ""Dune"" lacks a suitable conclusion. The world-building is there, but it might leave frustrating questions for viewers unfamiliar with the source material. This movie sets up what is to come with the ""fingers-crossed"" sequel. Producer optimism is that audiences will embrace this handsome 2 ½-hour massive tease, ensuring a second film's production. It's the follow-up that will tell the rest of the story. Working with three writers, director Denis Villeneuve (see ""Blade Runner 2049"") tackles Herbert's weighty tome by focusing on the intimate family drama that undergirds the universe-wide conflict. Much like the novel, this film starts on the water planet Caladan. Its leader Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), the head of the Great House of Atreides, is given a dangerous new assignment by the all-powerful Emperor of the Known Universe. Duke Leto is tasked with taking over mining operations on the desert world known as Arrakis. The former caretakers, the brutish Harkonnen, failed to bring the region and its indigenous population, the Fremen, in line to collect the required amounts of Spice. The Spice is the most valuable substance in existence and acts as fuel for all forms of interstellar transportation. Accepting this new post, the Duke takes with him his son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and his partner and concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Like the book, Paul is haunted by vivid (waking) dreams of the far-off, sand-covered land. He also has visions of an alluring Fremen girl named Chani (Zendaya). His friend, the brawny warrior Duncan Idaho (a sometimes beardless Jason Momoa), tells the boy, ""Dreams make good stories, but everything important happens when we're awake."" That may be true, but Paul's dreams certainly have import. It's the dreams that help guide his possible rise on Arrakis. Palace intrigue is in play prior to the Atreides' departure to Arrakis. Lady Jessica, a member of the religious sect known as the Bene Gesserit, agrees to allow her son Paul to be tested by a visiting Reverend Mother (a sinister Charlotte Rampling). This scene is the famous ""what's in the box?"" sequence. ""Pain"" is the answer, if you don't already know. Meanwhile, the scheming Harkonnen leader, the Baron (a hulking Stellan Skarsgárd), calls in his second in command, Beast Rabban (an unhinged Dave Bautista). While the Harkonnens left Arrakis without conflict, they had no intention of assisting in a peaceful transition of power. The Atreides will have to overcome massive difficulties to accomplish the mining mission. To say that the story is complex is an understatement. This multifaceted plot is why, for so many years, ""Dune"" was thought to be unfilmable. But attempts have been made. Most notably, David Lynch delivered his ""Dune"" in 1984. When Lynch's film was released, I remember ""cheat-sheet,"" postcard type materials were given to viewers to orient audiences. There was so much story, and not all of it could be told in a reasonable running time. A massive flop, the 1984 ""Dune"" is also only half a story. After providing an entertaining, if also cold and dense first hour, the movie went well off the rails, ending in an almost incoherent mess. Admittedly, I've seen that movie several times, and I've read the entire book just once. Lynch's vision was a departure from Herbert's book, and thankfully, Villeneuve doesn't borrow from the film that came before. However, while watching Villeneuve's ""Dune,"" I was surprised how much it made me appreciate what Lynch was able to achieve in the 1980s. Sure, the scale of this new ""Dune"" dwarfs the prior effort, but had Lynch been afforded resources to properly complete the second half of his telling of the tale, it might very well have worked. Of course, if the 1984 film had been a success, this ""Dune"" may never have been made. And the success of ""Dune (2021)"" cannot be easily dismissed. Villeneuve is a serious science fiction filmmaker. And he approaches Herbert's classic with obvious reverence. With its giant worms and otherworldly images, the look is like nothing seen on screens this year. It's a marvel. But as grand as the visuals are, they take a backseat to the intimate family narrative that patiently unfolds. And at the heart of the project is Chalamet, who proves that he can carry a film. He's no joke as the wispy Paul, who, at 15 years old, manages to mature in the face of threats to his family. This coming of age is consistent with the novel. Paul was mocked as being thin and hardly intimidating. Chalamet's sensitive but pensive persona plays perfectly. It's an impressive turn, especially when you consider what's riding on his performance. ""Dune"" is quite simply a monster of a story and a potential disaster for its producers. Failure here could end careers. Critically, ""Dune"" is hardly a failure. But the nature of the source meant that the only way to do it properly would be in one, two, maybe more films. There have been television adaptations (see John Harrison's decent three-episode 2000 television film), but Villeneuve delivers an authentic cinematic experience, one to be taken in on the biggest screen possible. And while ""Dune"" might be available this weekend on HBO Max, it needs to be seen in theaters. It's a big canvas, the most prominent, artiest blockbuster released in years. And if we're denied a sequel, we may never appreciate Villeneuve's complete vision. Finally, in reading the press notes, everyone involved in making this ""Dune"" commented that they read and loved the book as kids. This sentiment is revealing because Villeneuve's film isn't a kid's movie. It should be enthralling for hardcore science fiction fans, but as much as it promises a thrilling fantasy escape, the dramatic parts of ""Dune"" are why it is significant. The high drama should meld with smaller, relatable moments, but in this film, the undeveloped intimate emotional threads aren't enough for viewers to engage entirely. Part two is therefore essential."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Considerable criticism has been thrown at the 1984 predecessor to this version and its director, David Lynch. But by the end of Dune (2021), I wanted to rewatch and savor the (extended) forerunner. Lynch's film adaption is much more fun."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,Dune excels more in its technical aspects rather than in the movie's acting performances or screenplay ... The overall visual effects and a reverence for the Dune novel as the source material are what make this version of Dune an iconic sci-fi movie.
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Now then, this is not leading down the road toward some bold and wildly inaccurate proclamation that Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Denis Villeneuve has somehow failed in his long-awaited adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, a film that may, at the very least, allow us to finally put David Lynch's bold yet misguided 1984 effort into its deserved place in the darkest recesses of our mind.  However, neither is Dune the visionary masterpiece that some will passionately declare it to be as they eat Little Debbie snackcakes from the basement of their mama's basement.  Instead, Villeneuve's Dune is a visual and aural curiosity, a wannabe masterpiece that will be declared a masterpiece by some based almost solely upon Villeneuve's street cred as a sci-fi worldbuilder and because there are legions of Herbert fans who've waited for decades for something resembling a decent Dune adaptation.  Dune is, perhaps if I were to stretch my critical opinion just a tad, a semi-decent adaptation that excels at worldbuilding and falls woefully short in other matters of importance including character-building, cohesive fluidity, and not making it perfectly obvious that Villeneuve has taken an unexpected detour down the road toward cinematic narcissism practically owned by James Cameron.  Opening wide in theaters and on HBO Max this weekend, Dune is somewhat unexpectedly framed as ""Part One,"" a fact that desert nomad Chani (Zendaya) reminds us of just in case we didn't get the fact that this movie actually only covers about half of Herbert's several-hundred pages of writing (of which, for the record, I've never made my way through and never plan to do so). Dune is a part one with a part two that has never been announced, though perhaps Villeneuve has attained enough success to ensure his vision comes to completion regardless of the box-office outcome for this nearly $200 million epic being released into a pandemic-influenced world.  Dune centers around two families - the Harkonnens and the Atreideses - fighting for control of the planet Arrakis (I like to pretend this is where filmmaker Gregg Araki was born), a land with the only known presence of the valued substance known as melange, or spice. For the record, this is not the ""spice"" you can get from the weird house with boarded up windows a few doors down from me in my neighborhood. In this case, the ""spice"" is a necessary ingredient for interstellar travel. Much like our earthbound ""spice,"" it's also a bit of a performance enhancer. The Fremen people (subtlety wasn't Herbert's strong point), who reside on Arrakis, benefit greatly from the substance including a pretty cool blue glow about their eyes.  Duke Leto Atreides, fortunately not played by Jared Leto but Oscar Isaac, is tasked with leading the forces that will attempt colonization of Arrakis despite the Harkonnens having controlled the planet for nearly a century. Their leader, Stellan Skarsgard's Baron, is possessing of the obligatory sci-fi cartoonish lunacy required of a universal baddie. Atreides's son is Paul, here played with more youthfulness and coming-of-age qualities than in Lynch's version of Dune by Timothee Chalamet, whom this story is largely centered around and whom we meet as he's beginning to learn the ways of the Bene Gesserit from his mysteriously gifted mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson).  Dune essentially centers around this battle, or series of battles, and given the fact that Villeneuve only tackles about half of Herbert's original source material it should go without saying that this Dune will and does feel incomplete even at its sloggish 155-minute running time.  Where Villeneuve excels is in world-building and, indeed, it is in world-building where Dune is nearly a masterpiece. Patrice Vermette's enveloping and immersive production design practically swallows you up, especially in the movie theater. I will confess, however, that more than once I thought of Tremors as I watched Chalamet's Paul practically swallowed up by so much sand you could practically create an Indiana lakeshore.  Chalamet, unquestionably one of this generation's up-and-comers, nonetheless more than once feels like that trenchcoat-wearing goth kid who is either going to shoot up his local high school or go out and build another world.  There's a weird tension in this dynamic, essentially an almost ""white savior"" element given the Fremen are a mostly darker-skinned people. Villeneuve doesn't explore this fully, perhaps fortunately, but I'll be curious to see where this goes assuming part two manifests.  Mark Mangini's sound design is similarly enveloping, though somewhat overwhelmingly so and those pre-disposed to sensory overload would do well to take notice that even those not pre-disposed to sensory overload may find their senses overloaded by Dune. I found myself growing tired of Hans Zimmer's powerful yet far too often thunderous original score and felt a similar feeling with Greig Fraser's impressive yet somewhat redundant lensing.  First off, while I respect the re-imagining of Paul Timothee Chalamet is simply miscast despite giving it his best go. It doesn't help that both Ferguson and Isaac are playing with about 1.5 notes and only a handful of supporting players are truly impressive here including, I say somewhat unexpectedly, Jason Momoa as a soldier with tremendous loyalty to the Atreides family. Momoa gives the film much needed heart and humor and he nails the tone that others simply never find. Josh Brolin uses his trademark gruffness to tremendous effect here while Sharon Duncan-Brewster is also a stand-out. Zendaya is fine here, though her scenes with Chalamet lack the necessary tension and grit.  It's arguable, of course, that Dune isn't necessarily about its characters. Heck, it could even be said that plot is secondary to its world-building. However, with a world so beautifully built it's more than a little disappointing that there's so little to actually care about here. With so much awe-inspiring wonder to be found in Dune, the word apathy should never enter the occasion and yet it does time and again.  Dune isn't a failure. It truly isn't. I'd dare say that Herbert purists may find themselves among the most satisfied from Villeneuve's effort here and his attention to the world-building and ecological and spiritual themes prevalent throughout the Dune series. For non-purists and those less familiar with the source material, Villeneuve tries hard with Dune to create a remarkable universe but ultimately fails to make it a place where we'd want to be and to create characters with whom we'd want to engage. "
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE,"Though I fear the average movie goer will find it boring, Dune fans (like myself) will most likely enjoy this adaptation."
"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," For nearly six decades, Frank Herbert’s “Dune” has remained one of the pillars of science fiction. It had been previously adapted first for film by David Lynch, and then by the SciFi network as a mini-series. The former was a stylistic adaptation with legions of devoted fans (including myself), the series has long been considered a significant challenge for anyone to attempt a better adaptation. After a pandemic delay of more than a year, director/screenwriter Denis Villeneuve has managed to exceed all expectations, but that doesn’t mean it will appeal to all viewers. It’s interesting to note that of the two most lauded science fiction book series, both deal with a millennium-scale timeline and a galaxies-scale Empire, and have both been seen as nearly impractical to attempt to adapt from page to screen. Both are truly spectacular attempts- Apple TV+’s “Foundation,” and now “Dune“. The production design and score helps set the tone for a universe with a weight and age to it. Nearly every location and spaceship are designed with the impression of immense scale. The humans inhabiting the world feel so very minor moving within them. It’s a suitable way to reflect the scale of an inhabited galaxy with happenings on a single-world having cascading effects. The casting [mostly] winds up working really well, with Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides standing out as he carries the storyline on his shoulders. Rebecca Ferguson as Paul’s mother, the Lady Jessica, is the only one that feels amiss from the character. She often winds up being fearful, having to struggle to tap those fears down, while her book’s representation is as a far more stalwart bulwark. Newcomers to the story may be a bit lost, and need some friends to help explain the various characters and their machinations. Within the novels, there is a great deal of inner dialogue going on, and the earlier adaptations used prolific voiceovers to help fill-in the blanks. In this version, there is none of it. Villeneuve has opted for a more minimalist approach. The story of “Dune” may not appeal to everyone – it’s part religious crusade, part political intrigue, and part war film, so long on talking and introspection and rather short on action. Consider many classic books, recognized as such and their craft appreciated, but they may not be page burners to a wider audience (“A Tale of Two Cities,” “Dangerous Liaisons,” or “The Great Gatsby”). Even for readers of those works, they will realize at the end there was something deeply special and important that they just read. It might just not be their go-to preference. “Dune” feels like the grand epic in the tradition of “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Cleopatra.” For most viewers, even if it it feels confusing, and a surprise to find out that this is only the first half of the first book. However by the time the credits roll and the lights come up, they’ll know that they just watched something special.  “Dune” is rated PG-13, and opens in theaters everywhere as well as streaming on HBO Max on October 21st 2021. While you can watch it at home, this is one of those films that is served best by being seen on the largest screen with the best sound system you can find in your area. Bill Watters is a child of the late 70s- he walked into a theater to watch Star Wars, and emerged to become a lifelong fan of cinema and television.

"Oct 22, 2021",POSITIVE," The hype, the build up of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune has reached a breaking point, ready to explode, with a massive cast, and visual effects on a scale grander than anything ever projected at an IMAX movie theater. The background history on Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel being adapted to film has its own mythology, with a legendary rolodex of directors that were considered to attempt or create the futuristic story of spice and sand worms, which includes Ridley Scott, David Lean, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and ultimately landed on David Lynch, who brought his vision to life in 1984 to very little praise. Although it has its share of fans, the technology may not have been the right time to make Dune in 1984, but in 2021, and through the advantageous mind of Villeneuve, this Dune is the genuine article. Believe the hype, because Denis Villeneuve has achieved something groundbreaking with his vision, making a sci-fi epic unlike any other, which is hopefully just the beginning. I say just the beginning because an important fact for audiences to know is that this is Dune: Part I. It’s because of this information that I’m not fully committed to a 4-star rating, especially because the argument can be made that this Dune is slightly incomplete, but not without purpose. With a run-time of two hours and thirty-five minutes, co-writers Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth have a tight grasp on the text, yet condensing such a grand sci-fi story is not possible. The action begins with the valiant hero Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the only son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his mother Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), where Paul is in his preparation for when he will take over the throne of House Atreides. In his sleep, Paul has visions, some involving the planet of Arrakis, which is a planet that is a major source of intergalactic conflict, due to the planet’s source of spice, a powerful element in the golden sand covered surface. The Emperor calls upon the House Atreides to take over Arrakis, bring peace to the land, along with the Fremen people living there, and continue to mine the spice. This plan is quickly ambushed by the evil group known as the Harkonnen- led by the snake-like Baron Vlad Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his mass of armies, creating a catastrophic interstellar war. The major themes of Paul stepping outside his fears, becoming the leader he was born to be coincides with when the battle begins, and Dune expands beyond the characters internal struggles. The fight is riveting from the minute it begins, as we start to see the true power that Paul Atreides holds. Digging deeper into who these characters are would start to become a book about Dune and not just a movie review, but that is also why Villeneuve’s accomplishment is so great. The special effects are unlike anything I have ever witnessed, with ships larger than bodies of water, hovering above the sky, and casting a shadow among the sand. The cinematography by Greig Fraser has visuals inspired by Blade Runner, with minor aesthetics similar to what Roger Deakins did in Blade Runner 2049, but nothing about Dune looks manufactured. It’s hard to see the Hollywood seams. The costumes look made in the year 21010, the overpowering score by Hans Zimmer never stops the walls from shaking, while the fight turns up with Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho stealing the show, fighting with courage, while he has a devilish grin in the face of all Harkonnen warriors. It’s all made possible by the gorgeous leadership from Denis Villeneuve, who has no limit to what can be made possible with the art of cinema. This is not to say Dune will be an overwhelming success in the eyes of all, where the density of the science fiction will confide those unaware of what Dune is. The gorgeous faces of Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya may attract the fans of Euphoria or those who fell in love with the Call Me By Your Name star, but it’s much more for a deeper sci-fi nerd. Those are just warning signs, as Dune submerged me into this entire universe. The sand surrounds us, which will have audiences rubbing their eyes to clear grains that are not really there, covering enormous worms that shake the ground, arriving like an earthquake of destruction. And as each character receives more time on screen, the greater the collective cast becomes. Chalamet is perfect for the role of mysterious young man, afraid of his true potential, and haunted by a woman in his dreams. Ferguson subtly steals all the thunder, both as a mother afraid of what could happen to her son, but also as a character that has more depth than what we are seeing on the surface. The rest of the group is just as great- Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista- all actors that Villeneuve seems to have truly known would fit perfectly into this Dune universe. There’s genuinely not enough that could be said about Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. The runtime may be long, but it’s not even a factor, as every second, every inch of the screen injects energy into the viewers eyeballs. It’s something that George Lucas always dreamed of making when he first conceived Star Wars, it’s an adaptation that David Lynch was unable to fully realize, and it’s one of the biggest science fiction achievements in the history of the genre. Dive into the sand and dance with the worms. Dune is absolutely spectacular."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEUTRAL,"A visually stunning, well-produced Spectacle, but it's overlong, anticlimactic and often dull."
"Oct 22, 2021",NEGATIVE," I have, mildly on purpose, learned very little about Dune. I’ve long been aware of it as the first book in a very long and very well-regarded series, but a few too many people have used it to signify their intelligence to me, which made me run as far away from it as I could. Something pretty miraculous needed to come along to persuade me to check it out, and Dune, co-writer and director Denis Villeneuve’s big budget take and intended kickoff of a series, looked like it might be that gamechanger. He clearly got the money to make the family-clashing, sandworm gobbling tale of a boy and his drugs the genre-defining marvel people hype it up to be, but let me tell you dear reader, I will not be picking up the book. His Dune (David Lynch took a stab at adapting the book in the ‘80s, so now there’s two movies running around) is exactly what you should expect from a blank check Villeneuve movie. It’s too heavily concerned with plot, too little concerned with character, tries to visually dazzle you at every turn, and doesn’t bother to vary its tone. I know this is harsh and perhaps unexpected given how revered the man has become, but I’ve always seen him as a deeply flawed, deeply cold filmmaker, with none of his work but Incendies lingering in my mind. But Arrival, you say! It’s a meaningless exercise in a predetermined universe, I say. But Sicario! Nihilism isn’t interesting in my opinion. I could go on, but you get my drift. Denis and I do not get along, but it’s still bizarre to see all his faults, which have grated me for so long, put into one turgid movie. I will give him this: he’s got the eye. He always stages at least one breathtaking shot in his movies, the kind that comes from such intricate vision and planning that it’s clear he knows how to tell the story he wants to tell through film. Dune has a few of them, and they’re almost worth the price of admission alone. Problem is the stories he tells are one-note, so matter how well he tells them, they’re still a bore at feature length. Okay, so there’s a lot of window dressing, but at its core it’s still just a boy with special powers discovering his destiny, and all the rest is accoutrement of the genre. Except it’s all of the accoutrements, with every potential beat of the genre being thrown in instead of picking a lane and going with it. That makes for a tediously packed plot that relegates its characters to pieces on a chessboard. Is this what the book is like or is this just the Villeneuve effect? Either way, Villeneuve is definitely responsible for pitching every single moment as the most portentous event you’ve ever seen, which becomes numbing real fast. I mean, Paul can’t even look at some trees without it MEANING SOMETHING and having a character explicitly state the meaning. I know Villeneuve had a lot to get through, but would a joke kill him? Or how about letting us discover a theme for ourselves? Does he not realize that the best way to make us deeply invested in a story is to give things to work out and people to care about? Otherwise, you’re just a terrible history teacher reciting facts instead of making the past (even if it’s fictional) come alive. The only character who pops here is Jason Momoa’s Duncan, whose rapscallion ways shine through in only a few brief scenes. Everyone else can basically come and go as the story pleases, which they do, and these developments play more as a rote procession than developments that hits you emotionally.  But again, none of this was exactly surprising to me because I’ve always found Villeneuve’s films to be cold exercises. The only thing that did surprise me was how murky he made this movie, putting all the elaborate costumes, sets, and special effects in such gloom that it’s hard to see their detail. There’s no clear reason for this; even obscured, you can see the amount of money that went into realizing this world. Did he think this would emphasize his tone? Did he think that’s what his movie needed help with? There will always be a certain grandeur to this level of science fiction. So rarely do we see them get funded that the novelty alone makes you lean forward to try and glean pleasure from this grim, incomplete story. The movie doesn’t make that easy for you, though, and it doesn’t even have the decency to hit you with some hard truth as a reward for all your work. Instead of delivering glorious sandworms it just lies there like a slug, and it isn’t even in self-defense."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," But while you may be pondering those ifs, you will be stunned and amazed by the astonishing worlds on the screen (please see it on IMAX if you can do so safely), one of the most remarkable examples of cinematic world-building magic ever made, thanks to “Arrival” duo director Denis Villeneuve and art director Patrice Vermette.  Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, the son of a powerful Duke (Oscar Isaac) who is loyal to the emperor and his beloved concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is a member of a group called Bene Gesserit. They are a secretive, nun-like group with magical powers. Remember how Obi-wan Kenobi told the imperial guard “These are not the droids you are looking for” and the guard bought it? The Bene Gesserit has powers like that only to do it they have to use a low-pitched growly voice. So Paul comes from political and financial power on one side and mystical power on the other, quite a potent mix and as a teenager he is still sorting it all out, especially some weird and possibly predictive dreams he has been having.  The emperor makes a controversial decision to remove one of the Duke’s rival houses, House Harkonnen, from the extremely lucrative desert planet Arrakis, where they have accumulated incalculable wealth from the planet’s precious resource, called spice, by exploiting the environment and abusing the planet’s residents, the Fremen, who are now mostly hiding out literally underground. He orders the Duke to take over, and the Duke and his family dutifully obey. Needless to say, House Harkonnen and its leader the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård in Jabba the Hutt mode) is angry. This means Paul has to contend with all the usual teenage angst and identity issues plus the angry Fremen and possibly some traitorous insiders. A couple of other points: Arrakis has some indigenous animal life, including a cute mouse creature and some gigantic and extremely scary and lethal sand worms, with mouth-like openings the size of a circus tent. They are attracted to — of all things — rhythmic sounds, like…footsteps. And spice is extremely valuable and can turn users’ eyes blue. Even if you are confused, you can still be drawn into the story because it is clear who the good and bad and good/bad characters are and who we are supposed to root for. And the visuals are so compelling that the confusing parts make us more curious than frustrated. It is overlong for an origin story, but made with so much thought and story-telling mastery that I’m confident the next chapter will be even better. Parents should know that this film includes some mild language, some sexual references, and extended sometimes bloody violence including weapons and poison. Major characters are injured and killed, including a parent."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s not a simple small thing to overcome the hurdle of adapting a well-loved and complicated book series. Nearly four decades after David Lynch‘s polarizing Dune (1984), Denis Villeneuve shows off his own adapted version of Frank Herbert‘s 1965 novel. Set in a future where feudal houses in an interstellar society battle over resources, political power, and planets, the challenge of turning this story that also includes things like hallucinatory magical spice and political space nuns seemed impossible to overcome. Herbert’s story, although admittedly dated in some aspects, is enormously complex and offers readers a wealth of a fictional world to dive into. The first novel of the saga follows young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides, after his family is sent by the emperor from their home ocean world of Caladan to the desert planet of Arrakis. Arrakis is the center of the conflict of the empire, as it is home to the incredibly valuable resource melange, or more colloquially known as spice. House Atreides not only must face subterfuge from a jealous emperor whose assignment is more machination than gift, but they must also come in to soothe the tensions between the imperialists and Arrakis’ native people, the Fremen. Adding to all of that, there is a prophecy that harkens a great fate for young Paul, but that’s only if he can survive these obstacles in front of him. Villeneuve’s Dune somehow manages to wrap together all the complicated aspects of the novel in a way that not only honors the source material but patiently teaches the audience about this world without handholding them. By its very nature, not everyone will enjoy Dune. The novel itself is a lot to take in, and as a modern reader who read the novel in preparation for the film, it can be difficult to see the appeal in 2021. But the film takes us outside of Paul’s point-of-view, one of my largest issues with the book, tightens up the plot without trimming away too much of what is important to the story, and fully allows itself to revel in the weirdness of the source material. Of course, it’s not just Villeneuve. The cast does an impressive job embodying characters who might not have the same depth throughout the novel. Dune follows Paul Atreides, and Timothée Chalamet walks the line between a young and eager ducal heir and a potential messiah figure to the planet of Arrakis. One of the main aspects of the novel is Paul’s rapid development of his abilities. Like his mother, he is able to use “The Voice”, an ability kind of like the Jedi mind trick that allows someone to gain control over another’s mind based on the tone of their voice. Book Paul’s rabid adaptation with his abilities tends to turn him cold and distant and even annoying at times. But Chalamet’s performance balances the oddness of rapidly scaling up in capability with the shock of a boy who has recently undergone immense change. At his side is Rebecca Ferguson‘s Lady Jessica and Oscar Isaac‘s Duke Leto. Both are magnetic in their performances. Jessica, as the Duke’s concubine and a Bene Gesserit, holds a position of power within his house but is still a rebel to her own order after disobeying the Bene Gesserit and giving birth to a male child instead of a female one due to her love of Duke Leto. Ferguson deftly embodies Jessica, not just as a loving mother, but also as a powerful Bene Gesserit whose voice can quite literally kill someone. Leto, who plays a prominent role in this first novel, is an important figure in Paul’s life and Isaac plays him with distinction while also allowing us to see the tenderness of a father and a lover. It’s hard to pluck out anything really wrong with Dune. Its runtime is long but nothing beyond the average blockbuster movie of the time. The sets are absolutely breathtaking, perfectly capturing the desolation and majesty of the planet Arrakis. The supporting cast is robust, Villeneuve somehow manages to make Jason Momoa play a character who is not just Jason-Momoa-in-a-costume. Stellan Skarsgård‘s Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is a vast improvement from the caricature of the books. But perhaps, if we were to pluck one thread loose from this rich tapestry, it might be the sound design. Don’t get me wrong, Dune is heart-pounding at times, and Hans Zimmer‘s compositions are iconic at this point. But if you’re the type who loves to watch movies in IMAX with Dolby Atmos, you might leave the theater with some eardrum damage. From the ethereal vocalizations to the booming brrrrms (yes, those Inception ones), my experience watching the film quite literally led me to put my fingers in my ears to dampen the intensity of my experience on Arrakis. Ultimately, Dune might still be polarizing in some ways. Despite performances and visual stunners, the book itself can be a lot to take in. And Villeneuve’s loyalty to the source material inevitably means some might leave the movie theater simply saying, “I don’t get it.” But as a fan of Villeneuve’s directorial style (I will go to my grave defending his previous three films), and a fan of the cast, and an appreciator of the series, it’s hard not to say that he’s done the impossible. He’s adapted an accurate and artistically unique version of Dune. This film is currently titled Dune: Part One onscreen — Villeneuve has said that it will be split in two to allow space to tell the story accurately — and if it’s more of this, I can’t wait to see it."

"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," It is also as much a massage as it is a movie, thanks to all the sub-woofer action. This first installment in Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” films (there has to be a second because this is only half a film) is an impressively immersive experience thanks to the marvelous visuals of Greig Fraser (TV’s “The Mandalorian”), production design of Patrice Vermette (“Sicario”) and the over-the-top music of German sonic batterer Hans Zimmer. This “Dune” and its desert planet are also related to “Lawrence of Arabia.” It is, like the book, on one level an allegory about the way the West has treated the East, especially the Arab states, stealing their oil, leaving them the sand. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) is the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and his concubine, Lady Jessica Atreides (the unavoidable Rebecca Ferguson). Paul, who is described several times as “a boy,” has been trained by mentors Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson) in military skills. Paul has also been schooled in the dark arts of secret sign language and using “the voice,” a tone that compels obedience, by his mother. She is a member of the Bene Gesserit Order, a witch/nun-like religious group sporting space-age burqas. On the desert planet Arrakis, giant killer “sand worms” cruise beneath the surface and a hallucinogen named “spice” is harvested. Spice is the most valuable substance in existence. In the expository opening, the powerful, war-mongering Harkonnen clan is recalled from Arrakis, where they made themselves super-rich and cruelly oppressed the indigenous people, known as Fremen. The Fremen have ways to survive on the planet. Primarily, they use “stillsuits” to recycle the moisture from their bodies. The resemblance to BDSM outfits is probably coincidental. The point of this initial episode is to introduce the characters and the planets to us, get the plot moving and Chalamet on Arrakis to learn the ways of the Fremen and introduce him to Zendaya. Done and done. Shot in Jordan, Abu Dhabi and Norway with IMAX cameras, “Dune” is heavy metal sci-fi of a very high order. It must be seen in the largest format you can find to gape at the fluttering, dragonfly-like vessels and other wonders. Villeneuve is gracious enough to give David Lynch’s 1984 version a tip o’ the hat. Like Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, Villeneuve’s film proffers all the fanboy Gummy Bears: a Luke Skywalker-like protagonist with mysterious powers, a warrior princess, spaceships, swords, explosions, dark intrigue, blasters, drugs, witches and giant worms. REBECCA FERGUSON as Lady Jessica Atreides and TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET as Paul Atreides in Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Legendary Pictures’ action adventure “DUNE,” a Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary release. The screenplay by Jon Spaights (“Prometheus”), Villeneuve and Eric Roth boasts dialogue that is both nonsensical and liturgical. It’s a sci-fi “Lord of the Rings” with Islamic, instead of Celtic, etymology. As far as the acting goes, Brolin, Isaac, Momoa, Henderson, Charlotte Rampling as a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Javier Bardem as a Fremen have enough charisma to put just about anything over on us. They are this film’s Alec Guinness. Dave Bautista is fun as a scary Harkonnen. But an almost unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgard as the part-CG Baron Vladimir Harkonnen steals the show. Emperor Ming, Baron Vlad just jacked your gig. Zendaya, who is already in love with a Spider-Man, does not have much to do, yet. Chalamet is good, even if his hair does half the lifting, again."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune (Part One) is big. Dune is great to look at. And with its bombastic, semi-atonal score and soundtrack chanting, all with base maximized to vibrate all your molecules, it feels like a religious event. It helps that almost all the interiors have high, cathedral-like ceilings, and that director Denis Villeneuve approaches the material with all the zeal (but none of the sex appeal) of Cecil B. DeMille taking on the Bible. Walking into Dune is like entering a church service for an unfamiliar faith. Like any such ritual worthy of a mass-following, it’s spectacular, transcendent, at least occasionally meaningful…and yet may have you checking the time before it’s done. Spiritual trappings only affect a person so long without a bit more substance to hook them further. Also, and this is important: This Dune movie is not a stand-alone story. There’s a misguided tendency to say that a movie ends on a cliffhanger just because the bad guys win; that’s not it here, though. No side wins, yet. The story stops with plenty left unresolved, and audiences perhaps mentally calculating where Villeneuve could have cut part one much shorter. And anyone who’s seen the David Lynch version doesn’t really have to guess. Do Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) really need to crash in the desert twice, to be rescued both times? Not really. However, Villeneuve does fix one significant problem: Lynch stacked the deck too easily in favor of Paul. The evil Harkonnens here actually represent an existential threat, and not stereotypical buffoons easily beaten. Ferguson is the acting MVP of the film, imbuing her Lady Jessica with a real sense of internal conflict. Torn between her roles as a mystical nun and the duke’s concubine, she must deal with the fact that her parental choices may have really messed things up. Many of the other actors are effectively objects, cast for their striking looks to stand around making iconic postures. But among them, Jessica feels like a real human. Unlike, say, Josh Brolin, who grimaces well but struggles to make author Frank Herbert’s prose sound like natural speech. It’s tough to assess an unfinished story like this. If Dune Part Two never gets made, this version could prove an even greater disappointment overall than Lynch’s version was back in the ’80s. But Lynch’s has long since become a cult classic. How many fantasy franchise wanna-be first installments ending on unresolved notes get that kind of re-assessment? The Vampire’s Assistant? The Golden Compass? Artemis Fowl? The Dark Is Rising? Anyone? On the other hand, the potential is there for a great payoff. But by necessity, that makes these first two and a half hours nearly all set-up. It’s easy to see why Villeneuve insists on the biggest screen possible. Unlike the Empire in Star Wars, whose spaceships look similar in construction to everyone else’s, the space empire in Dune revels in totalitarian architecture. The massive, intimidating structures favored by dictators and tyrants throughout history as symbols of power pointedly dwarf the people. And said people flutter around in insect-like Ornithopters, metaphorically designating themselves as relative tiny bugs before the might of the throne. This being a Messianic story, of course a hero will come from a humble desert tribe and be undaunted by such ostentatiousness. But that’s for the hypothetical part two. Dune takes a good hour for its characters to explain the whole set-up, but by the time they do, it’s at least clearer than in previous versions. Profitable desert planet Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, the Middle-East of space, is about to be governed by the noble House Atreides, after 80 years under the brutal, greedy Harkonnens. But it’s a set-up — the Harkonnens leave sabotage in their wake, priming the Atreides to fail and get wiped out by the Harkonnens and the Emperor, who’s jealous of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and his rising popularity. Meanwhile, Leto’s son, Paul, might just be the result of years of complicated religious genetic engineering to create a psychic Messiah who will fulfill the prophecies of Arrakis’ native Fremen. Call it Game of Dunes — there’s no throne of swords on which to sit, but rather a planet full of mind-bending spice that powers space travel. And everyone has an angle. Like Lynch, Villeneuve clearly felt some frustration in the book’s lack of aliens, so he makes certain tribes near-alien. The Harkonnens all look pale and bald, while the Sardaukar make for the obligatory Klingon-like Space Vikings, complete with throat-singing. The Fremen sport a variety of vaguely “foreign” accents, all save for Zendaya’s Chani. Who attracts Paul in his dreams by sounding totally American. There’s lots of chanting, and flying, and large simple shapes levitating. But by the time Paul finally gets around to being proactive, the movie’s over. It’s a wonderful trance while it lasts, and that’s fitting for a movie about a powerful psychedelic. Indeed, the fact that a 1965 novel depends on the concept of a Messiah using controlled amounts of drugs is as fitting as the way it depicts natives using guerilla warfare as underdogs capable of defeating an Empire. Much as George Lucas did in Return of the Jedi. But sooner or later, the trip ends, and it’s sometimes hard to remember exactly what was so profound about the whole experience. This film deserves recommendation for its sights and sounds alone. But the story, so far, only gets a big fat incomplete.

"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," *** “I could talk for an hour about the ways these kids could die,” admits Australian doctor Richard Harris about the Thai youth soccer players he extracted from 2018′s internationally famous cave flooding. These odd, macabre little moments are the most striking of documentary team Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi’s recounting-cum-reenactment of the harrowing 18-day rescue from Tham Luang Nang Non cave. Another diver wonders aloud whether he would’ve drunk his life away if the boy he ferried to safety for three subterranean hours had died. Much like in Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi’s Oscar-winning Free Solo, the filmmakers pick knowingly at the bare psyches of adventurers (swapping rock climbers for cave divers) fascinatingly desensitized to death. And while the expert editing does wonders to disguise extended stretches of reenactment (like a very expensive episode of Dateline), creeping, unanswered questions of retraumatization float in those scenes’ staged abyss. Even if thornier issues of dramatic reproduction and white interloping are sanded clean off the film, The Rescue remains a worthy tribute to the operation’s 5,000 volunteers from all over Thailand, the U.K., U.S. and China. At every turn, they chose action when hope was for fools. PG. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Bridgeport, Fox Tower, Movies on TV. **** The place is France. The time is the Middle Ages. The crime is rape. That’s the premise of The Last Duel, director Ridley Scott’s thunderous cinematic portrait of Marguerite de Carrouges (Jodie Comer), a real-life noblewoman who accused Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), a squire and knight, of sexually assaulting her. Each of the film’s three acts is filmed from the perspective of one character—first Marguerite’s husband, Sir Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon), then Le Gris, then Marguerite. While the male perspectives were written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the scenes that peer into Marguerite’s soul were scripted by Nicole Holofcener, who emphasizes the tension between monstrous masculine delusions and brutal feminine realities. The Last Duel understands the fluidity of memory—in one scene, Le Gris willfully misinterprets Marguerite’s mocking smile as a flirtation—but it unequivocally states that only Marguerite is telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The trial by combat between Carrouges and Le Gris that decides whether Marguerite will be vindicated or burned alive is exhilaratingly brutish, but the film keeps cutting away from the bloodshed to show us her haunted, hardened features. The greatest war in The Last Duel is the one she wages against the patriarchy, proving that Scott—who also directed Alien and Thelma & Louise—is still a feminist to his core. R.

So it’s an unprecedented position in which No Time to Die finds itself: belting out a nearly three-hour swan song to Daniel Craig’s chiseled, well-meaning, haunted 007. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation) breaks visual ground in the enchanting blues and purples of nocturnal Cuba and Jamaica set pieces, and bursts of eerie emotional tension stamp his trademark on action set pieces. Meanwhile, stellar supporting actors like Ralph Fiennes (M), Jeffrey Wright (Felix Leiter) and Naomie Harris (Moneypenny) savor their chemistry with Craig to the last sip. Of course, No Time to Die was literally and figuratively meant for two years ago (delayed by COVID-19), when its plot line about weaponized contagions wasn’t so gutting, when villain Rami Malek’s dead stare and monotone whispering wasn’t such tired schtick. More impressive than fun, this 25th Bond outing wraps the Craig years with all the heartache (for Léa Seydoux’s Madeleine Swann) and visceral ass-kicking he’s cultivated since Casino Royale. Always in pain, always trying to quit, Craig’s Bond was the only 007 who saw his end from the very beginning. PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER.

While most Blumhouse productions depend on a steady stream of camera-ready 20-somethings cast as good-looking corpses, this darkly satirical fable focuses on a rather different demographic. Within a working-class New Orleans neighborhood recently overtaken by hipster millennials, Adriana Barraza’s hausfrau heroine Lupita can’t help but notice the sudden exodus of her elderly cohorts following the overnight appearance of a suspiciously luxe gaming emporium run by the seedily sinister Mr. Big (Richard Brake), whose widescreen rictus grin furiously chews every inch of infernal casino scenery. A premise conflating gentrification with selling one’s soul has some teeth, and the picture’s far more engaging first half clearly illustrates the plight of struggling seniors already preyed upon by a rapacious housing market well before the devil came to town. Alas, that measured world-building renders the intercut scenes of close-up carnage especially cartoonish, and however textured the victims’ backstories, their gory fates feel weirdly incidental—collateral damage in service to the larger points expressed by a none-too-clever political skit. Characters so artfully constructed should be allowed to die gracefully. NR. JAY HORTON. Amazon Prime. ** Is Evan Hansen a teen tormented by anxiety, isolation and depression? Or a con artist masquerading as the best friend of a boy who killed himself? The answer is simple—he’s both. Humans crave characters who are easy to adore or despise, but when Dear Evan Hansen debuted on Broadway in 2016, it defied that dichotomy, becoming a blockbuster musical and winning six Tony Awards. The movie mines the play’s ambiguous magic by bringing back original star Ben Platt as Evan, who is so lonely that he invents a history of bromance between him and his dead classmate Connor (Colton Ryan). Connor’s parents (Amy Adams and Danny Pino) accept Evan as a surrogate son, but he’s haunted by guilt—and the truth that his deception may be all that’s keeping him from ending his own life. Dear Evan Hansen diehards will be delighted by the film’s heart-expanding performances of songs like “You Will Be Found,” but not by the ending, which radically revises the story so Evan can atone for his lies. In the play, the greatest act of penitence wasn’t apologizing. It was living honorably in the wake of your mistakes, an idea the film fails to understand. The result? An adaptation with the shape of Dear Evan Hansen, but not enough of its sad, strange and beautiful soul. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Bridgeport, Cinema 99, Tigard. ** A prison guard becomes an inmate’s muse. A reporter beds a budding activist. A police commissioner’s son is abducted by a criminal called The Chauffeur. Those are the stories that define director Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, a perky anthology of tales from a fictional publication called The French Dispatch of the Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun. The film was inspired by articles from The New Yorker, but its blend of pastel colors and deadpan wit is pure Anderson. His direction is painfully precise—even a clash between protesters and police looks like a series of still images—and it threatens to squeeze the life out of a cast that includes Bill Murray, Benicio del Toro, Timothée Chalamet and Jeffrey Wright. Yet Anderson’s fussiness isn’t half as troubling as his attitude toward the film’s female journalists, including J.K.L. Berensen (Tilda Swinton) and Lucinda Krementz (Frances McDormand). Both of them lust after the subjects of their articles, a toxic trope that Anderson deploys without a hint of his trademark irony. Some of his early films—particularly Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums—have aged with good-natured grace, but The French Dispatch proves he has a long way to go if he wants to be the clever and compassionate comedian he once was. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Cinema 21. * A new menace is loose in the universe. His diabolical plan? To bore moviegoers until they lose consciousness. His name? Director Denis Villeneuve. After the haunting poetry of Arrival and the dreamy romanticism of Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve seemed incapable of creating a bad sci-fi film. Yet he’s done it with his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s hulking 1965 novel Dune, which follows the ponderous adventures of the callow nobleman Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) on the desert planet Arrakis. The film keeps hinting at Paul’s potential to become an interplanetary messiah, but Chalamet is so wan and lifeless it’s difficult to care whether the character lives or dies. Rebecca Ferguson adds some fiery charisma as Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica, but Villeneuve buries her performance beneath a seemingly endless stream of information about the politics, rituals and ecology of Arrakis. He cares more about world-building than storytelling, which is why watching Dune feels like reading an excruciatingly dry textbook instead of experiencing a movie. Some people will see the existence of a big-budget, 155-minute art film as a sign of hope in a cinematic landscape strewn with superhero bombast, but Dune isn’t salvation. It’s a stark reminder that pretentiousness can be just as punishing as commercialism. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is the latest and best effort to turn the political sci fi epic into a worthy big screen experience. Frank Herbert’s groundbreaking 1965 novel has proven to be a particularly challenging story to adapt, as many filmmakers — most notably Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch — can attest. Villeneuve’s achievement may not fully realize the big ideas of the novel, but the resulting film is something that is somehow greater than the sum of its parts. What makes Dune so particularly difficult to translate from page to screen is the odd combination of complex political intrigue, melodramatic earnestness, and a silliness that includes a collection of names that ranges from weird to weirdly normal (Bene Gesserit … Kwisatz Haderach … Jessica?). How does one embrace the strangeness of the story’s elements while also giving appropriate weight to its themes? The basic premise of Dune (Part One, as the title card promises) follows a Duke, Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) who has just been appointed by the unseen Emperor to uproot his family from their comfortably temperate planet of Caladan and travel to Arrakis to oversee the harvesting and production of spice, the galaxy’s most valuable and important commodity. Together with his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and a crew of loyal military leaders including Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), they soon set off for the impossibly hot and arid desert planet that is not only environmentally unfriendly, but politically hostile as well. There are a lot of people to meet and a lot of history to understand before the story can really get underway and Villeneuve’s crew manage to do so without making it feel tedious. This is a 2.5 hour movie, though, and asking the audience to commit to so much world-building without the guarantee of a Part 2 is risky and perhaps a little unfair. But there is beauty in the austere splendor of House Atreides and the introduction of certain characters is at least interesting. Paul’s friendship with Duncan is sweet and the power dynamics balance themselves out between the authority wielded by the Duke’s son and the physical strength of the sword master who is his mentor. Their bond mirrors the one between his father and Gurney, the weapons master. Still, one can’t help but observe the definite imbalance of male and female characters, which might not have been as noticeable if director Denis Villeneuve hadn’t been on a year-long press tour praising himself for ordering his writers to focus on the women in the story. The Lady Jessica worries and frets over Paul and his possible future, but with the exception of a few key moments, Jessica’s power as a member of the Bene Gesserit is largely diminished by her anxieties over current events. Chani (Zendaya) may not be a manic pixie, but she is the literal dream girl who Paul does not know but sees in his sleep. She will feature prominently in the next film, but for now we see little more than whispers of Chani, a gauzy promise of…something. Save for one important and slightly frightening scene involving Paul and the Bene Gesserit’s terrifying Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling), the only other woman of prominence in Part 1 is Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) in a role that has been gender-swapped from the book and thereby adopts a much different purpose here. Dune is very clearly intended as the launching point for a much larger story, and as such it spends most of its time setting the stage. We become well acquainted with the Duke, as well as House Atreides’ rivals, the Harkonnens, who did not take well to the news that they were to be ousted from Arrakis after decades in command there. Following orders from the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), the Harkonnens set out to put a stop to the takeover. Most of all, we get to know Paul, the reluctant heir to his father’s title, and the possible fulfillment of a millenia-old prophecy. What we do not get is anything that amounts to conclusion of any kind, nor any particularly deep connection to anyone involved. There is a persistent aloofness to Villeneuve’s films that tends to render his central characters emotionally unavailable and Dune is no exception. And yet, there is much to admire about the artistry and craft of it. With its level of majesty and grandeur, Dune is a film that burrows into your senses much more than into your thoughts. As a collection of sensations and feelings, it is effective and epic, the type of rare cinematic experience we crave."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," It should be of little surprise to those who’ve followed director Denis Villeneuve’s career in films such as “Blade Runner 2049,” “Arrival” and “Sicario” that he masterfully sets mood and tone in his films along with creating a distinctive look, all while telling a compelling story. While attempted before by respected director David Lynch in the early 1980s, his version never caught on with the public, or critics, for that matter. The film performed so poorly, the studio scrapped plans for subsequent sequels. Even in the era of “Star Wars” and its big-screen progeny, sci-fi adaptations of scope were deemed risky, and Herbert’s story of a messiah on another world certainly qualified. Things have changed to a large degree, and when “Dune” hits theaters and HBO Max on Friday, perhaps something will be learned in that regard. It would, however, be a travesty if Villeneuve were not given the opportunity to see his vision of this story through to completion. While this installment is light on action, it possesses the scope that has come to typify sci-fi films of importance. And as much of a setup film as this turns out to be, Villeneuve and his cast accomplish the absolute one thing they need: They leave the audience wanting more by the time it abruptly ends. “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). The elder Atreides has been tasked with protecting Arrakis, the planet that provides the most valuable asset in the galaxy — the spice — which provides the fuel necessary for interstellar space travel. That element is found in the sands of the desert planet they’re given dominion over. Paul, his father and mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), along with their aides, soon find themselves contending with assorted mishaps that come rapidly one after the other upon arriving on Arrakis. Being on the planet affects Paul to a great degree. As is hinted at from the beginning of the film, there’s something special about the young man that his mother chooses to keep hidden and under control. She is of the mysterious Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, thus making him part of that bloodline, and the sisterhood tells the story of the arrival of a messiah-like figure. When the Atreides family is betrayed, they are forced into the desert of their adopted home, made to foster new alliances, and Paul has to learn what role he’s meant to play in all of it. Know going into “Dune” that the film and its more than 150 minutes of run time is a precursor to action and sequels – along with a television series – yet to come. The tricky part for Villeneuve and his creative team comes in crafting something worthy of revisiting. In setting the narrative, he and his co-writers, Jon Spaihts (“Doctor Strange,” “Prometheus”) and Eric Roth (“The Insider”), wisely maintain an element of mystery to preserve interest.  Subtle hints are dropped about future events and in some cases those that appear as prophecy. The film asks that the audience pay attention and enjoy the journey as Paul tries to learn where his path will take him. They’ve provided the right cast to do so. Chalamet continues to rise. In Paul, he imbues a sense of innocence that’s genuine as he tries to identify who he is as a person all while being thoroughly charismatic. As Jessica, Ferguson, likely familiar to fans of the most recent “Mission: Impossible” films, provides the strength her son needs to travel that journey. As for Isaac: In some regard, he’s given short shrift, but he certainly gives a performance laced with nobility and the caring of a father. Make no mistake, however. It’s plainly evident that Villeneuve and the novel’s narrative dictate the best is yet to come. Based on this introduction, I’m here for it."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" might be catnip (or spice, to use the parlance of the story's galactic empire) for fans of Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi tome of the same name. I've never read it, which might make you scoff and immediately avert your eyes from what I wrote, but I have witnessed the unhinged spectacle of David Lynch's 1984 movie adaptation, which maybe counts for something. This new ""Dune"" is different. Its hinges are fully tightened to the door frame. Meticulously stylized and as serious as a prophecy-induced headache, Villeneuve's take on one of the bedrocks of modern space fantasy is a gorgeous, ponderous, multimillion dollar ode to Timothée Chalamet's messianic bone structure. Summarizing ""Dune"" is like wrapping the book of Genesis into a paragraph, but here goes. In the far-flung future, interstellar society is governed by rival noble houses. The gallant House Atreides — Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), heir Paul (Chalamet), concubine-matriarch Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and its various generals — is given control of Arrakis, a planet of sand dunes that hide the precious spice, a substance that both enables space travel and space peyote trips. The dunes also hide giant sandworms, which look like every genital possible. Wouldn't you know it, but the planet's previous stewards, the evil House Harkonnen led by a rotting baron (Stellan Skarsgård), has set House Atreides up for (dramatic synth drones go here) doom. Ominous turns are to be expected, as Paul is given to visions, which makes sense because mama Jessica is part of an occult order of mind-controlling nuns. Dreams of a young woman named Chani (played by Zendaya) belonging to the Fremen, the oppressed people of Arrakis, lead Paul into a centuries-old struggle. Legend promises a chosen one will come, perhaps one with high cheekbones, right as Baron Harkonnen makes his move. And hey, about those dunes. ""Dune"" is presented in gorgeous Sand-O-Vision, which is no surprise given Villaneuve's stylish work on modern sci-fi gems like ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Arrival."" While the vibe is very ""Sharper Image opens up in Marfa,"" no one can deny the fully realized aesthetic language the director's brought to the world of Paul Atreides. Beaded veils and bronze wall reliefs blend with round-edged tech and holographic visualizations. Composer Hans Zimmer's score glitters like stardust, lurches like a star vessel and intones folk horror dread. Costume designers Robert Morgan and Jacqueline West give every clan their own style: Euro-military finery for House Atreides, ""Doctor Who"" foot-soldier uniforms for House Harkonnen, Kanye West-meets-T. E. Lawrence desert duds for the Fremen. For the senses, it's a rich stew. For the mind, ""Dune"" might just prove that the long-held fear in pop culture circles — that Herbert's sandy saga is just unfilmable — was warranted. Destiny, gender, politics, magic, religion, eugenics, commerce, conservation, racism, colonialism, the survival of bagpipes 10,000 years into the future: ""Dune"" is about a lot of things. For some, that might be a welcome proposition, and sure, the ambition is admirable. The all-you-can-eat buffet of themes would feel more like a delightful tasting menu if there was a coherent story arc to ride like a sandworm, though. The opening title of the film, which informs the audience that these 2 hours and 35 minutes are merely a first chapter, quashes any dreams of narrative economy. Speaking of dreams, you can tell Villeneuve was blessed with visions, just like Paul Atreides. The specter of the real-life war in Afghanistan looms over ""Dune"" — futuristic helicopters fly over deserts, woefully underinformed soldiers try to bring enlightenment to a culture being strip-mined for its natural resources, terrorists perform beheadings in the arid wastes. But then there also are the touches of Shakespearian tragedy, and the almost blatant echoes of ""Star Wars."" Herbert's work directly inspired George Lucas' generation-defining space opera, and Villeneuve's film doesn't go out of its way to discourage comparison. Baron Harkonnen? Looks like Palpatine. Arrakis? Could use the same travel brochures as Tatooine. Jessica's psychic powers and Muppet-esque vocal mesmerizing, and Jason Momoa's swashbuckling Atreides warrior Duncan Idaho? The Force, Yoda, Han Solo. It's kind of like the song ""Respect."" Otis Redding did it first, but Aretha did it most famously. It's her song now, which you can't really ignore. And like Anakin Skywalker or Luke Skywalker or Rey (or heck, Neo, Buffy Summers and Harry Potter), Chalamet's Paul Atreides fills the destined hero trope. The ""Call Me By Your Name"" actor's tortured boyishness is put to good use here. His sensitive touch with natural acting choices, a little less so; those are buried under all the backstory about space economics, mind-controlling nuns and race relations. A note on the racial politics in ""Dune"": They're clumsy, to be generous. A white colonist's kid is prophesied to lead a tribal people of dark-skinned natives to greatness, becoming their greatest champion? And that civilization's enlightened connection to the land is represented by their bluest-of-blue eyes? Eep.  A few actors manage to swim above the sand. Momoa sticks to what he knows, which is playing Jason Momoa, this time among the stars. (Dying to see the line item in his contract that forbids cutting that mane.) ""Dune"" creaks beneath its seriousness whenever he's off the screen. And, this being a dynastic melodrama at its core, only Ferguson as Jessica and Charlotte Rampling as her sinister mother superior really lean into the camp.  ""Dune"" is a feat of futuristic world-building and mythic adventure. On those counts, the slow burn doesn't singe too bad. Around the second hour, you realize all that court intrigue has led you to a ""Dancing With Wolves"" story — or ""Dancing With Sandworms,"" as the case may be — that you don't even get to see unless a sequel gets the green light."

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s epic science-fiction Dune saga was made into a film by David Lynch in 1984, which boasted a superb look but completely failed in storytelling terms. This week comes a highly anticipated new movie version of Dune, which also looks phenomenal and offers a much smoother storytelling experience. I walked away from it wanting more, in both good and bad ways. The story picks up in the year 10191, when people have settled thousands of planets due to a mysterious commodity called “spice,” which allows for interstellar travel and is only available on the desert planet of Arrakis. The Harkonnen family has ruled Arrakis for almost a century and become wealthy off the spice trade, but the emperor suddenly hands over control to the Atreides family, whose duke (Oscar Isaac) vows to rule the natives more humanely than the brutal Harkonnens. When the Harkonnens return with an army to take back what was theirs, the duke’s wife Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) have to flee into the desert, hoping that the locals save them from the elements and the giant sandworms burrowing underneath. Director Denis Villeneuve and his fellow writers have an elegant solution to the gobs of exposition that this story requires: Paul listens to a series of audio lectures about Arrakis while preparing to go there. The premise of a bunch of foreigners taking charge of a desert environment whose people practice strange customs and religions takes on a resonance that even Herbert couldn’t have foreseen. The author’s fans should know that the movie’s narrative stops well short of the end of the first book, which makes the environment feel more lived-in than it does in Lynch’s film but also keeps this from being a satisfying stand-alone experience. Say this for Marvel: They know how to make individual films that please general audiences while also advancing storylines for the diehards. Still, if you want spectacular vistas on alien planets, Villeneuve gives you buckets full of those. The shots of soldiers lined up in formation recall Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi-glorifying films, which I think is intentional. We have sand hitting rocks like ocean waves amid sandworm attacks, airships with wings that vibrate like dragonfly wings, and Paul stepping into a hologram of a tree, its tendrils drawing lines across his face. Desert’s not the easiest landscape to make interesting, but cinematographer Greig Fraser finds sculptural lines in the sand dunes (the film was shot in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates), while Patrice Vermette’s sets contrast the outworlders’ brutalist interiors with the more natural ones of the Arrakis natives. No wonder  the director was upset about Warner Bros. releasing this movie on streaming at the same time. The film needs the largest screen possible, as well as a theater’s floorboard-rattling sound during the action sequences. At its best, the movie is sublime in the old sense of making you feel small. Too bad Villeneuve overdoes it, as every scene seems to underscore the epic quality of this 155-minute film. Whatever intimacy his approach doesn’t beat out of the film, Hans Zimmer’s music takes care of. Chalamet is handicapped by a character whose journey only truly begins at the film’s end. Even Javier Bardem is indistinct as the leader of the natives of Arrakis, and Zendaya spends so much time posing against desert backdrops in Paul’s dreams that you wonder whether she was shooting a fragrance commercial. The only actor who makes an impression is a forceful Charlotte Rampling as the high priestess of Lady Jessica’s order of psychic seers who seems to know what a hard time Paul’s in for. I do appreciate how the casting here fixes the original film’s overwhelming whiteness. (You can’t ascribe that to the time Lynch’s Dune was made, either: Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien, and The Empire Strikes Back all came out before it, and they all had characters of color.) The content here may set up some more satisfying story beats later on. However, I’m obliged to review the film at hand, and, ultimately, this film is like a cleverly conceived and beautifully presented restaurant meal that makes you think about hitting the nearest McDonald’s."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," The most important thing to know about the movie called Dune is that it’s not actually “Dune.” As the title card relates from the first seconds of the movie, the film you’re watching (which debuts on HBO Max on October 21st at 6PM ET and in theaters on October 22nd) isn’t Dune, but rather Dune: Part One. It’s a movie that aspires from the start to be more than a single film. It’s the start of a capital F-Franchise.  To be clear, the movie that director Denis Villeneuve has here is great. Dune actually succeeds at translating the oftentimes impenetrable novel into an enjoyable and approachable sci-fi epic at a scale far beyond the Star Wars and Star Treks of yore. The problem is that it feels more like half of an epic.  Dune (the movie) is based on Dune, the classic sci-fi novel from author Frank Herbert. At its core, Dune is the story of Paul Atreides, the son and heir to House Atreides, which is engaged in a complex political power struggle with another house, the villainous Harkonnens. Specifically, everyone is fighting over control of the desert planet Arrakis — the titular “dune” — and the source of the incredibly valuable resource spice, which enables all galactic commerce and travel. Along the way, Paul also stumbles into a greater destiny that could change the face of the galaxy.  A key part of its success is lead actor Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, who has to walk the line between coming across as an actual human being with feelings and emotions and the otherworldly, wise-beyond-his-years messiah that Paul is destined to become. Chalamet’s Paul doesn’t want to be the next Duke of House Atreides; he wants to hang out with Jason Momoa’s bro-y Duncan Idaho, skip his classes because he’s not in the mood, and complain about having to attend family functions. It helps to humanize Paul, who otherwise comes across as a know-it-all who gets to be the best at all of Dune’s various quasi-magic techniques.  The rest of the incredibly star-filled cast is great, too, although many A-list actors feel underused in a way that practically screams “they’ll be back in the sequels!” Oscar Isaac gets the most screentime of the relatively minor characters and puts it to good use as the noble, patrician Duke Leto. Isaac exudes a sense of righteous honor, and it’s easy to see both why his men would follow him to a forsaken desert world and why he falls so thoroughly into the political traps.  Momoa brings the most levity to the occasionally ponderous film, sauntering from scene to scene with smiles and swagger. But other characters — like Javier Bardem’s Freman leader, Josh Brolin’s surly weapons master, or Dave Bautista’s villainous Rabban — feel more like table setting for the sequel.  Unfortunately, Dune — at least for this first half — gives less attention to its female leads. Zendaya’s Chani, destined to be Paul’s love interest and partner in the latter half of Herbert’s novel, is relegated to silent, softly lit perfume commercial-style visions for the vast majority of the film. Rebecca Ferguson gets a little more to do as the Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother, but she spends a lot more time in the film worrying over her son and partner than she does as a member of the politically powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood.  Women hold positions of power in Dune’s world, but in Dune the film, they’re largely second to the male leads. That will presumably change if (or when) Villeneuve gets to adapt the second half of the book, which sees Jessica and Chani take larger roles in the story during Paul’s time among the Freman, but right now, it’s more setup than payoff.  The main exception is Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet-Kynes, a gender-swapped version of the book character who is both an Imperial liaison caught between her love of Arrakis and the Freman and her allegiance to the Emperor, who seeks to embroil Kynes in his plots.  The real star of Dune, though, is the setting and worldbuilding. All of Villeneuve’s modes from previous films like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 are turned up to 11 here: the ships are starker and more abstract, the buildings more towering and brutalist, the landscapes are more sweeping and desolate, the bass-heavy score from Hans Zimmer even more thunderous. I’m still not sure I buy the argument that Dune (or any film, really) demands to be seen in a proper theater, but you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve got a good set of speakers handy for however you do watch it. Dune is a film designed to be seen as epic, with a scope and scale that extends from everything from Paul’s weighty destiny to the sheer size of the iconic sandworms. And it works: when everything is firing on all cylinders, Dune overwhelms with visual, thematic, and sonic heft without losing sight of the personal dramas that power those lofty ambitions.  Fortunately, Villeneuve wisely skips over a lot of Herbert’s info-dumps and makes some of the more subtle political machinations a little clearer in an effort to streamline and simplify the story. No one in the film says the word “mentat” or explains the concept of the living calculators, for example, but no one really needs to. The result is a film that’s relatively approachable for a Dune adaptation, even for newcomers to the story.  But the biggest problem with Dune is that it ends just as the movie is getting started, cutting off not with a big, cathartic ending but somewhere in the middle of the second act of the story. Dune leaves you wanting more, but in the sense that you didn’t actually get everything you were promised.  Dune does try to have its cake and eat it, too, in some respects, with Paul’s visions of possible futures filling in for epic Freman battles and Dune’s galactic stakes. It even tosses a quick shot of someone finally riding a sandworm in the final moments, as if to remind viewers (and studio executives) that the real fun is coming in the still unconfirmed sequel.  If there is a Dune: Part Two somewhere down the line, there’s going to be the possibility of an hours-long marathon of the two parts of the movie for an experience that rivals the original tome. But for now, Dune’s methodological worldbuilding and table setting is in the same place the movie leaves Paul: primed for greatness, but with a lot of unrealized potential that has yet to be unlocked. "
"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL," Denis Villeneuve’s painstakingly parceled “Dune: Part One” is an art installation inspired by the first half of the 1965 novel as well as the matrix of inspirations behind Frank Herbert’s work. The IMAX screen serves as a vitrine for immersion into sensation and allusion. We begin in media res with the merest signposts of the battle that these clans war eight-thousand years from now in a mystical, dynastic age of telepathy. We’re right there in the thick of things, backstory limited to characters greeting each other by name in fellow-well-met fashion. With each movie, Villeneuve is more daring about implication and ellipsis: there are no clumps of specialized knowledge in his quarter-billion-dollar adaptation. Should the experience require familiarity with the text? Villeneuve appears to think not. As spectacle, “Dune: Part One” betrays a mighty appreciation for brutalist architecture exploded across millennia. The royals whose wealth exceeds imagination are cloistered in bunkers that belong in a Francis Coppola Belizean spa, at least before pandemic demolished that industry. It’s a very cool hotel to check into for a few minutes. “Dune: Part One”‘s story, amid battles and explosions, is of Paul Atreides, a curly-haired ephebe of fifteen or sixteen (Timothée Chalamet), hardly weighty enough to stand a sandy breeze, who is presumed to have gained messiah-like identity after generations of purposeful breeding. He could be the “Kwisatz Haderach,” but is teased by characters as being more of a “Baby Spice.” There are ready contemporary metaphors: the “spice,” melange, that all seek as fuel for interplanetary travel (and is also a potent psychoactive drug), is ready reminder of the oil that enriched the cruel kingdoms of MENA (Middle East-North Africa) for over a century, as well as the intoxicating power of visions and the potential of delusion. The shadow of climate change falls across the terrain that is uninhabitable by day. The beauty in its floating slabs of airborne warships, its landscapes like ruins of battle and flying vehicles resembling most vulnerable dragonflies nears abstraction; Greig Fraser’s cinematography often labors in near-darkness, given to halation or fuzziness even when sand is on the ground instead of filling the sky. The armature of the whole on a big, big screen with Hans Zimmer’s busy, loud, largely indifferent score is akin to a fire-flamed sculpted metal bush upon which to hang tags of what one knows or cares about the doings onscreen: BYO text and intertext and subtext and deeply personal slumgullion. I liked a small, twirling metal sculpture of a bull and a fighter; in the book of “Dune,” his grandfather is killed by a bull, but it is also reminiscent of the origami unicorn of “Blade Runner.” Allusions to other bits of text and other movies and works of art will be footnoted for some time to come. Can the elliptical “DPO” be an involving narrative to the uninitiated, that is, most of the world’s potential theatergoers in dark times? Or is it a vessel to pour one’s specialized erudition or lifelong fixations? It’s eminently diverting to slip into a piece about the “Muslimness” of Frank Herbert’s work, or to read someone whose life was transformed in so many ways by the man’s work. Experts on language and MENA cultures weigh in.  Readings of and readings into “Dune: Part One”: this stuff’s a delight, such as from Haris Durrani: “I find the books’ engagement with Islam to transcend linguistic wordplay and obscure intertextuality. After all, Herbert was fascinated by linguistics and believed words shape substantive meaning. The use of ‘Voice’ by the Bene Gesserit, an order of imperialist superhuman female breeders, is a prime example of this, as is the saga’s running obsession with symbols and myths. As these semiotic tools wield tremendous power within the ‘Dune’ universe, Herbert’s references likewise generate a profound ‘Muslimness’ that goes beyond mere orientalist aesthetics. (This is not to say that the ‘Dune’ novels are not orientalist in other ways, which I have detailed elsewhere.) Dune does not cheaply plagiarize from Muslim histories, ideas, and practices, but actively engages with them.” Conversations usually follow: Symposia, panel discussions, prophetic screeds of high hallucination, bring them on. I’ve seen the thing, now I want to read more pieces like Grierson’s. Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, Dune  tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive. The hands down, best thing going for Dune is the stunning visuals from beginning to end. Director Denis Villeneuve compiled a beautiful collection of scenes that are truly a sight to see. One thing you’ll notice is how the cinematography seamlessly compliments so many elements in the film. The setting and world building feel like they come alive with the wide panning shots from the desert to the huge space crafts. The imagery alone in Dune really makes this world feel real and vibrant. Not only that, but the unique camera angles really amplify the tone in particular scenes. Dare I say, Dune is so masterfully shot, that you could watch this movie on mute and still be entertained. Another positive for Dune is that the plot was easy to follow. Despite the dense, sci-elements in the story, I appreciated the focused approach on only one group/family. It was helpful to explore this fantasy world and all the cool technology through the perspective of just a few characters. As a result, it doesn’t take long to have a sensible grasp of the underlying politics and motivations of various characters. Of course, there’s no way anyone could ignore the fantastic cast that star in this film. Timothée Chalamet was exceptional as Paul Atreides. His performance made me care about his character’s journey and his potential growth. Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto was also great in his role. He presented such a stoic feel to his character that almost steals every scene he’s featured in. I think my personal favorite may have been Jason Momoa as Duncan. While the role may have been small, this was right in Momoa’s lane especially when it came to his fight scenes. Of all of the roles, Stellan Skarsgård surprised me the most as The Baron. He was completely unrecognizable thanks to both his delivery and the Dune make up team. Dune carries a runtime of about 3 hours that audiences have to mentally prepare for prior to watching. The long runtime isn’t the issue whereas the pacing of the film may be off-putting for some viewers. There’s a lot of dialogue and exposition that takes place in the film. Plus, it takes a while to get to some of the action scenes. Even those moments are spread throughout the film with a good amount of time in between. I don’t think this would be a concern for fans of the Dune franchise, or deep sci-fi lovers. However, I do think that casual viewers may run the risk of drifting in and out of focus in some pockets of the film. While the movie does have some captivating scenes, I thought some of the action scenes were a bit anti-climatic. If you don’t know what will happen in the rest of the story, then I can’t say that the way Dune ends will generate a lot of excitement for a sequel. The majority of the film was just fine, but the final conflict fell a little flat.  Finally, I was surprised to experience Dune with such poor sound quality. There are several scenes where characters will use a modified voice, or whisper and it was very difficult to make out what was being said. What’s frustrating is that the film does include subtitles in some scenes, but no subs in others. The crazy thing is that I watched this in a Dolby Theater (with premium sound quality) and this still was hard to understand what some of the characters were saying at times. Dune was a beautiful movie, with a fantastic cast, telling a grand story fit for the big screen. Director Denis Villeneuve did a marvelous job of remaking this imaginative world and story into modern times. Dune is what other movies wish they could look like. I think fans of the franchise will be certainly pleased with this adaptation and newcomers will be happy too. Although, I’d still heed a sense of patience for anyone diving into Dune for the first time. Initially, I had only heard about the Dune franchise through word of mouth. So before seeing this film, I did watch Dune (1984). In my opinion, that movie was a huge clunky mess and it was difficult to sift through on a first, cold sitting. I had to rewind back to the beginning a few times to understand all of the exposition and the characters. Thankfully, after watching the Dune (1984), that gave me the perfect buffer to fully appreciate this Dune. The characters were more familiar. The conflicts were more digestible and the technology was not even close to being as cringey as they were in the first film. I wouldn’t say watching the Dune (1984) is a requirement for first time viewers, but I’ll just say that it can help you appreciate the story and how far this remake has come with its updates. I would highly recommend watching Dune on the biggest screen, with the best audio quality you can find. I can’t express enough just how fun of a viewing experience it was to see. If you prefer, you can also watch Dune on HBO Max as it will release there as well.

"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," “This is only the beginning,” says the desert nomad Chani (Zendaya) near the end of Dune, the long-awaited adaptation of Frank Herbert’s influential sci-fi novel from the French Canadian writer-director Denis Villeneuve. Given that this 155-minute-long epic covers roughly half of the story told in the book’s several-hundred pages and is explicitly framed at the beginning as Dune: Part One, this cryptic utterance, one of the few lines the character speaks, stands as a promise of a second installment to come. Or, depending on your tolerance for dour and deafening space operas, a threat. Whether Chani’s vision of a second chapter will come to pass depends on how Villeneuve’s gargantuan $165 million undertaking fares at the box office and on HBO Max this weekend. Since its publication in 1965, Dune has become one of the top-selling science-fiction titles of all time. It’s also become a white whale—or in the story’s own cosmology, an elusive giant sandworm—for visionary directors. As explored in the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune, the mystical Chilean-born filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky spent much of the 1970s trying to mount an impossibly vast production that was to star his own son in the lead role alongside a cast that would have included Orson Welles, Salvador Dalí, Gloria Swanson, Alain Delon, and Mick Jagger. David Lynch’s 1984 version starred, among others, Kyle MacLachlan, Patrick Stewart, and Sting. The film was regarded at the time as an incomprehensible flop, though it has since attracted a cult following. Other directors approached to film Dune over the years have included David Lean (who ultimately turned the project down) and Ridley Scott (who worked on developing an adaptation for seven months, then, overwhelmed by the scope of the project, moved on to make Blade Runner instead). Herbert’s Dune series—he followed the initial novel with five more—combined spiritual, ecological, and anti-colonialist themes into a dense weave of interlocking stories about two families, the Harkonnens and the Atreideses, fighting it out for control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of a prized substance called “spice” (or, in the books, “mélange”). This substance is both necessary to fuel interstellar travel and functions as a kind of performance-enhancing drug; thanks to their exposure to the spice, Arrakis’ desert-dwelling Fremen people have eerie bright-blue eyes, exceptional fighting ability, and, it is implied, psychic powers. They aren’t the only ones. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the teenage scion of the powerful Atreides clan, is taking lessons from his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, a sort of secret priesthood made up of women with highly developed supernatural skills; for example, they can compel even their enemies to do their bidding using a creepy digitally augmented voice. (Dune’s immersive sound design, by Mark Mangini, is one of its most unusual elements. If you see this movie in a theater, you might want to bring earplugs to protect yourself against the ambient roar.) Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) has been assigned by the emperor to lead the forces colonizing Arrakis. It’s a powerful post but also a dangerous one, given that the Harkonnen family, who has controlled the planet for 80 years, is not thrilled to give it up. The head of the Harkonnens is the formidably repulsive Baron (a barely recognizable Stellan Skarsgård), a Jabba the Hutt–like figure who plots his schemes from a bathtub bubbling with black oil and, when feeling especially evil, levitates into the air to float above his interlocutors like a menacing Goodyear blimp. I should note that nearly all the plot details above were reconstructed from research conducted after seeing Dune. The experience of sitting through the movie itself is more about watching unimaginably huge rusted metal blobs—in the year 10191, spacecrafts come exclusively in organic shapes—land very, very slowly atop endless expanses of sparkling sand. There are also many scenes of military pageantry, with soldiers lined up in precise geometric formations and seen from on high in images that recall Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda spectacles. The social order of the Dune universe exists somewhere between fascism and feudalism; planets are fiefdoms controlled by individual families, and skill in battle, embodied by Jason Momoa as the affable warrior Duncan Idaho, is among the most highly prized values. Yet this society is also covertly matriarchal, with the Bene Gesserit pulling spiritual strings from behind the scenes. Dune’s production design, created by Patrice Vermette, is its true star. Against the backdrop of all this awe-inspiring vastness, there is something faintly comical about the slight-framed, baby-faced Chalamet striding through the sand in a long black coat like that one goth kid you knew in high school. Herbert’s book series questioned the “chosen one” ethos of conventional science fiction, but Villeneuve’s adaptation, at least so far, appears to endorse the notion that this skinny white boy was born to rule the universe. Since the Fremen he is apparently fated to lead are all darker-skinned and vaguely coded as Middle Eastern, this makes for an uncomfortable racial dynamic, which is only exacerbated by the fact that few of the actors playing Fremen hail from that part of the world—besides Zendaya, there is Javier Bardem in a barely there role as an honorable Fremen leader. Sharon Duncan-Brewster stands out, in a role gender-swapped from the book, as a pragmatically minded ecologist who advises the newly arrived colonizers on the nature and culture of the planet Arrakis. And Momoa and Josh Brolin, as soldiers with a long-standing loyalty to the Atreides family, bring gruff warmth and, in Momoa’s case, a welcome dash of humor to their roles. Isaac and Ferguson, as the savior-to-be’s parents, aren’t given a lot to do other than make noble sacrifices for the sake of their son. Chalamet doesn’t really belong in the role of the tormented rebel leader (even though he brings tremendous panache to a similar role in a current release, playing a charismatic student activist in Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch). Still, in a movie created on this grand a scale, individual performances and characters are subsumed to the world-building machinery that surrounds them, and on that score, Dune delivers. Villeneuve’s craft team has collaborated on creating a spectacle that leaves the viewer in awe. The aircraft that carries our heroes over the dunes resembles a hovering metal dragonfly. The spice-guarding sandworms, as long as a city block and revealed to the viewer only after nearly an hour of suspenseful teasing, are marvels of monster design; I could have done with 20 percent more sandworm time, and would return for a sequel just to see one ridden into battle by a triumphant Timmy. Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s omnipresent score have a stately grandeur that, after the first hour of “whoa, dude” trippiness, starts to verge on the ponderous. Seen on an IMAX screen, Dune is unquestionably hypnotic—so much so that I nodded off twice (each time for less than a minute, so I doubt I missed too much by way of plot). This film is a curiously paradoxical achievement: a visual and aural marvel that is also a crashing bore."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," For the silver screen, no three words are as portentous as “Frank Herbert’s Dune.” A brick-like tome of expansive myth-making, Herbert’s seminal sci-fi epic has largely been known to be “unfilmable.” On a road paved with fascinating failures, Dune has seen (or not seen) three separate adaptations: Alejandro Jodorowsky’s version remains an abandoned production and a Hollywood relic, good only for the morbidly curious and as the subject of the eye-opening documentary, Jodorowsky’s Dune; David Lynch’s ambitious, nigh-incomprehensible 1984 vision resulted in a notorious flop; and the 2000 miniseries, the bloated and faithful-to-a-fault Frank Herbert’s Dune, has been crowned by TOR.com as the “most okay adaptation.” Now, decades later,  Denis Villeneuve has set out to dispel the Dune curse, finagling a pathway through Herbert’s source material deemed too vast to be contained on celluloid.  Thousands of years in the distant future, the worlds of Dune have re-embraced feudalism after wiping out computers and “thinking machines.”  Rival houses and fiefdoms fall under the umbrella of an enigmatic emperor as soldiers ruthlessly operate as killing machines and human processors known as Mentats serve as court advisors. And behind the curtain? The Bene Gesserit, a pseudo-religion of all-female operators that tinker with bloodlines and manipulate events, accruing power in the shadows to serve the ascension of the human race. Dune focuses on the all-important planet of Arrakis, an inhospitable desert planet that is the sole repository of spice melange, the only resource that enables faster-than-light travel in the absence of computing and artificial intelligence. The novel, and the film, begins with a precarious transfer of power as the prestigious - but incredibly dangerous - stewardship of Arrakis is being handed over from House Harkonnen, led by the sinister Baron Vladmir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), to House Atreides, led by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). The Duke - along with his rank and file of Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley) - is wary that Arrakis is the ultimate poisoned chalice: an opportunity to ensure the legacy of the Atreides name, but also a dangerous proposition flanked by the treacherous Harkonnen on one side and the Fremen - the unpredictable and unfriendly Arrakis natives - on the other. Much of the narrative, however, centers around Paul Atreides (Timotheé Chalamet), budding superhuman and Leto’s heir. Trained from birth by his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson with the standout performance), Paul has nascent talent with “The Voice,” a power by birthright that compels those within earshot. In addition, the young fighter finds himself laden with visions of a Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya) as he is torn between two messianic prophecies: he is either the “Mahdi,” the Fremen savior foretold, or the Kwisatz Haderach, the centuries-spanning end-goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program. Confused? Well, you shouldn’t be. Not for long, anyway. Denis Villeneuve, writing the screenplay along with Eric Roth (A Star is Born) and Jon Spaihts (Doctor Strange), wisely splits the difference between Lynch’s impenetrably baroque approach and Frank Herbert’s Dune’s ultra-faithful turgidity. Herbert’s original text - an engulfing cross-section of metaphors that weaves together themes of colonial oppression, religion as control, and ecological decay - is almost overwhelming to parse, but Villeneuve has crafted the first half of an epic that truly makes you wonder why Dune was ever labeled “unfilmable.” Purists might balk at the film’s excision of its more esoteric and ponderous elements, but the deft script doles out exposition naturally and carefully: Necessary information is gracefully folded into House Atreides’ orientation on Arrakis, while other bits of in-universe mythology - such as the Bene Gesserit and the abandonment of “thinking machines” - is easily inferred between the lines. Dune reaches back in time to a type of blockbuster we never see anymore - an opera for adults. At a time in our popular culture when subtext is dying, Villeneuve refuses to hold our hands or pander: gone are the prerequisite quip-every-minute of our lowest-common-denominator entertainment, and gone are the lengthy explainers for exactly what’s going on.  With an immense scope to match Herbert’s maximalist prose, Dune features a stunning marriage between cinematography and production design. Patrice Vermette’s brutalist constructions - colossal angles and shadows that seemingly transmogrify people into dust - clash spectacularly with the arid sparseness of Arrakis, all the while framed by Greig Fraser’s sumptuous wide-lens compositions. Even its future tech is not our tech; having done away with computing, the machinery of Dune is characterized by the creak of the analog - spice harvesters are lumbering beasts of burden, and nimble ornithopters resemble insects more than modern aircraft. It all blends seamlessly into the film’s perilous palace intrigue, with an ominous feeling that these intergalactic chess pieces are at the mercy of destinies written and prophecies fulfilled, and on a scale beyond human comprehension.  Dune’s cast is largely excellent, playing out political oneupmanship so effectively it’s easy to overlook that much of Part One’s narrative is setting pieces in place. And here’s the big rub on the film, like its title card says, it’s very much a Part One. Timotheé Chalamet disappears into the role of Paul Atreides, selling his journey from wavering heir to battle-ready warrior, but halving his arc leaves a distant, unsatisfying taste. And there are fantastic emotional beats within Dune, especially with Rebecca Ferguson’s Lady Jessica as she grapples with her son’s possible destinies, but there are also plenty of places where it’s obvious that Villeneuve is forced to carve the path where he needs to go; unraveling a 412-page text, even cleft in two, is a daunting and unenviable task. The Fremen, who will undoubtedly have a much larger role in the second half of the story, feel particularly shunted. Zendaya’s Chani gets the film’s opening lines, wondering who will be the next colonizers to oppress the natives for their resources, but much of the storytelling economy crowds them towards the periphery as stock “noble savage” archetypes.  Dune is a colossal undertaking, a rich and faithful adaptation that cracks Frank Herbert’s mythic work into two halves. Part One ends just as its crescendo peaks, giving us an abrupt and inelegant ending, but through Villeneuve’s unparalleled craft and sheer force of will, it’s enough to convince me that this translation will be the best we’ll ever get. Dune seems plucked from the Hollywood reliquary: a challenging, old-school blockbuster that defies the current zeitgeist of IP domination. Like its source material, it’s an epic that tackles ageless contemplations - man vs. environment, the creep of human greed, the very nature of power - at a heady intersection. Only time - and perhaps the box office - will tell if Dune’s meditations will bear satisfying fruit for a Part Two, but with Villeneuve’s confidence and skill, it’s looking more and more likely. After all, fear is the mind killer. "
"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL,The result is a movie that seems to move both too quickly (Wait. What are the ramifications of that last conflict?) and too slowly (When are we going to get to the why of all of this?).
"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE,"While there's much to give Dune credit for as a professional achievement, it's becoming increasingly tough to celebrate cinema that aspires to so little beyond its own sense of scale - or to applaud works that refuse to resolve in a single installment."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL," ★★☆☆☆Almost every frame of Denis Villeneuve’s long-gestating adaptation of the Frank Herbert’s Dune is spectacular. Orange desert vistas, enormous circular spacecraft and pristine battalions of future soldiers are shot with gasp-inducing audacity. When Villeneuve announced this year that this was a movie that demanded to be seen in the cinema he was not exaggerating: your jaw will drop. What he didn’t reveal, however, was that Dune is also kind of boring."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," Hardcore sci-fi heads and faithful devotees of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel will huff it like the precious spice at the center of the story. Others will feel like they're on the outside looking in, awed by director Denis Villeneuve's craft and operatic grandeur but mystified by the insularity of the storytelling, which is as dry as the desert world in which the story unfolds.  This tale, set really far in the future, takes place on the planet Arrakis, a sand-covered land like the second level in ""Super Mario Brothers 3."" Arrakis is home to a sacred hallucinatory substance known as ""spice"" — technically, you could call this a ""Spice World"" — and that spice is the key to life and enlightenment for what remains of humanity in the year 10191. Harvesting that spice — it's seriously called ""spice,"" which no matter how many times you hear it is never not funny — is up to the Duke of the House Atreides, Leto (Oscar Isaac, who is in most movies these days), who comes to Arrakis to oversee and overtake the planet's spice operations, after another ruling body, the Harkonnen, is forced out. Leto's son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), is along with his father for the trek, as is his concubine (and Paul's mother), Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson); Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Zendaya and an unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgård, buried beneath what looks like 100 pounds of latex skin, also show up to play in the sandbox. Paul is a young whipper snapper with big ambitions who sees himself as a leader. He's treated like a kid brother by Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), a warrior hero whose state-derived name is as unlikely as quarterback punk-turned-FBI agent named Johnny Utah, who roamed Earth some 8,000 years earlier. Paul wants to join Duncan in battle, but Duncan basically musses his hair and tells him to go back to playing with action figures.  But Paul is more than some mere wannabe. It becomes clear over the course of the story that he's the Chosen One, the Jesus Christ/ Luke Skywalker/ Neo of this story, depending on which mythology to which you subscribe. And since two of those three references came in the wake of Herbert's novel, perhaps we should be looking at them the other way around. So why make ""Dune"" again at all? David Lynch's 1984 adaptation was famously troubled, a box office stinker that was disowned by its director and became shorthand for a certain kind of disaster. This ""Dune"" — which carries a reported budget of $165 million, and looks every cent of it — is tackled head-on by ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" helmer Villeneuve, Hollywood's foremost contemporary blockbuster architect not named Christopher Nolan, who gives it an appropriately epic look and feel.  ""Dune"" — this is only part one of the story, part two is supposedly on the way — should be praised for its rich technical achievements; it's one of the best-looking movies of the year and its visual and sound effects deserve to be experienced on as big a screen as possible, as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Rogue One"" cinematographer Greig Fraser's scope is massive and Hans Zimmer's score is bone-rattling. But the movie is a bit like picking up a small pile of sand: no matter how hard you try to hold onto it, once it sifts from your grasp, all you're left with is an empty hand. "
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune (or Dune Part One as the opening credits assure us) is a towering cinematic achievement, with stunning visuals, confident direction, impressive art and sound design, a score that blasts you through the theater (or living room) wall, and performances that pull directly from Frank Herbert’s epic novel. I have a long history with Dune, although I have not read all the novels in the series. I read Dune In high school and have re-read it a couple of times since then, but I stopped reading the series after God Emperor of Dune, where the saga gets decidedly strange. Dune wasn’t exactly written in a vacuum; there are a ton of historical and artistic influences on that novel, from Lawrence of Arabia and the historical figure of T.E. Lawrence to the conflicts that drove the Middle East and continue to this day. Herbert took every influence he had and created this epic story, so dense that it has its own dictionary in the back, and created one of the most definitive works of science fiction. Like Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings did for high fantasy, Dune has influenced science fiction for many years and will for many years to come. Adapting this material for film and television has been difficult. Alexandro Jodorowsky famously tried to adapt it in the 1970s but failed, and many of the creative team went from that project to help make Ridley Scott’s Alien. (There’s a great documentary on this called Jodorowsky’s Dune, a movie I highly recommend for anyone fascinated with Jodorowsky, Dune, or science fiction films of the 1970s.) David Lynch, not known at the time for epic science fiction, tackled it in 1984, and debate still rages on whether he succeeded or not. (My take: it’s a very interesting Lynch movie, but I’m not sure it quite works as a Dune movie.) There have been television shows as well, with varying levels of success, but the consensus is that Dune could probably never be adapted to the degree that would make its fans universally happy. It has a wide cast of characters, each given their own focus, a created history so deep that some of the novel’s chapters devote as much time to worldbuilding as it does moving forward with the story, and more symbolism and allegory than the Bible at times. It’s not unadaptable; it’s just very difficult to squeeze into a two-hour running time, not without losing something in the process. David Lynch’s Dune tries very hard to stuff it all in, and the result is a disjointed, weird movie that does have its admirers but would probably not be considered very loyal to the source material. When director Denis Villeneuve announced Dune as his next project after Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, it seemed a natural progression for a filmmaker unafraid to tell challenging stories in the genre and willing to tackle some of the genre’s sacred cows. You don’t make a sequel to Blade Runner without ruffling a few feathers, but Villeneuve made a film that I could say may be even better than the original, juggernaut of science fiction that it is. Villeneuve seems well-fitted to tackle Dune. So, is he? The answer is a resounding yes, but that’s part of the problem: this story isn’t finished. It’s no fault of Villeneuve’s; had Warner Brothers given the green light, I’m sure Villeneuve would have happily committed to another three years of Dune, as would the cast and crew. But Warner Brothers played it safe, and in doing so, severely undercuts the film’s achievements. There’s no getting around this – this is half a movie. It’s not a graceful cut, either – Dune Part One ends just when Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is getting interesting. As the story dictates, Paul, at this point in the narrative, isn’t a character of choices. He’s a character who is swept up in the universal events of the story, but he doesn’t have real agency yet. As the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul is born into royalty but is not fully aware of the galactic chess game that is being played with his family and his family’s mortal enemies the Harkonnens, led by Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård) by the ruling Emperor, who has dictated that House Atreides take custodial control of Arrakis from the Harkonnens. Arrakis is the only planet in the known universe that has mélange, the Spice, which grants long life and makes it possible for interstellar space travel.  The Atreides are walking into a trap, and even the efforts of Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) are not enough to save them from their destiny. But Paul’s coming has been prophesied – by the Bene Gesserit, of whom Paul’s mother is a courtesan, and by the Fremen, the native tribe of Arrakis. Is Paul the savior of Dune? Is he merely a pawn or something more? Dune is going to get many comparisons to Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy – both are ambitious, epic adaptations of difficult material. But The Fellowship of the Ring, although part of a trilogy (and that trilogy was dictated by the publisher, not J.R.R. Tolkien himself), was crafted by the filmmakers to be a complete part of a whole. All the Lord of the Rings films are. Although part of a larger narrative, those films have a natural progression in storytelling. They build, they have climaxes, and each film has individuality.  Dune doesn’t have that, not this version. The film doesn’t have a natural climax; indeed, Dune doesn’t have a climax at all, not in the scope of the story. What we get is marvelous, but if you’re hoping for a satisfying conclusion, you won’t get it. Dune feels like it’s just getting started right when the credits roll. This is clearly the studio’s fault – this is an expensive adventure, and while I can understand the reluctance of Warner Brothers to move forward at this time, they could not have predicted the pandemic and this film’s odd release. But the results are the same – an unfinished story. I hope that we get a sequel. I’m certain we will, and that all the talk of box office success determining whether a second film gets made is just that, but the quality of any second film will be greatly dependent on how this first film does.  I’m confident that Denis Villeneuve has an idea of the scale he’s working with, especially since the first film has some important chunks of the novel missing. It’s not a perfect adaptation of the novel; the Bene Gesserit, for example, are hugely important and are sidelined more than I would like, but a second film could raise their level of importance to the story and give the audience, especially those unfamiliar with the novel, much-needed context. If Villeneuve is allowed to finish what he started, this could very well be the definitive version of Dune. Even Lynch’s Dune was able to dive into the more esoteric aspects of the novel, and I have the feeling that Villeneuve will be able to as well if he is provided time and money. Dune Part One is worth seeing in a theater. It’s an experience of sight and sound that we haven’t seen since, well, The Lord of the Rings. If you feel safe in doing so, you should see it in the best theater you can find. If not, HBO Max is an option, but you’re going to want to turn off the cell phones and the lights and at least get yourself a decent sound bar. This isn’t a movie that is served well by distractions. Hell, I wouldn’t even go to the bathroom if I could help it, even at this film’s running time.  Dune Part One is a fully immersive film, building universes and transporting audiences as very few movies do. In the meantime, films like this do not come around often. Best see it in the grandest way possible, if you are able. And, maybe when I see the rest of it, I can even give it that coveted 10 out of 10 score. But not yet. Dune will open in theaters on the evening of Thursday, October 21, and will be available on HBO Max the same day starting at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT. Alan Cerny has been writing about film for more than 20 years for such sites as Ain’t It Cool News, CHUD, Birth Movies Death, and ComingSoon. He has been a member of the Houston Film Critics Society since 2011. STAR WARS biased. Steven Spielberg once called Alan a “very good writer,” and Alan has the signed letter to prove it, so it must be true."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Cuando Denis Villeneuve dijo que ver Duna en una pantalla de TV era “como conducir una lancha rápida en tu bañadera”, podía parecer pretencioso y solemne. Duna es la razón por la que se hicieron las pantallas enormes y los sistemas de sonido envolventes en los cines grandes. Es una experiencia para ser disfrutada, no solo vista, por streaming (como será desde este viernes en los EE.UU., y de allí su queja). Es una creación artística ampulosa en la que los colores y hasta el grano de la película, sumado a las dimensiones de los encuadres al aire libre, exigen una visión adecuada. El realizador de Blade Runner 2049, La llegada y Sicario abordó parte de la novela de Frank Herbert de 1965 -que ya había sido llevada al cine por David Lynch, en 1984, con música de Toto-, por lo que el hombre aguarda que su Duna sea un éxito y le permita rodar la continuación. El canadiense no da muchas vueltas y tras un preámbulo expone las cosas como son. Es el año 10191, y el duque Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) llega a Arrakis, un planeta árido junto a su concubina Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) y su hijo Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Fue enviado por el Emperador: debe supervisar la extracción de la especia, un polvo reluciente, un elemento capaz de lograr cualquier cosa. Los habitantes de Arrakis y que se dedican a su cultivo son los Fremens, que tienen los ojos azules por el contacto con la especia, y sí, viven más o menos como si estuvieran rodando Mad Max, ya que el clima es implacable. Paul tiene un sueño recurrente con Chani (Zendaya), así que pondrá cara de sorpresa cuando conozca a la Fremen. Parece que es el Elegido, no solo a heredar el trono de su padre. Memorable es la prueba que debe pasar de la orden femenina Hermandad Bene Gesserit, que integra su madre. Además, hay otros que quieren apoderarse de la especia, y son capaces de todo por hacerlo. Hasta desafiar a los gusanos, monstruos enormes que viven bajo la tierra y la arena. Todo es tan exorbitante en Duna que por supuesto el elenco tenía que estar a la misma altura que el diseño de producción, el vestuario y los efectos visuales. Están Josh Brolin y Jason Momoa como guerreros que guían y cuidan a Paul, Javier Bardem es un líder Fremen, y entre los enemigos, Stellan Skarsgård como el barón Vladimir Harkonnen y Dave Bautista es su sobrino. Pero lo que logra Villeneuve es una visión propia del texto original. De allí lo de creación artística, además de que Duna no se parezca a nada que se haya visto últimamente del cine mainstream, el cine comercial hollywoodense. La música de Hans Zimmer es otro elemento primordial: no solo es envolvente, sino que acompaña cuando debe y no se pone jamás en primer plano. Villeneuve, amado y vilipendiado por igual, es un cineasta con una imaginación visual única, como lo testimonia Blade Runner 2049 (aquí también hay ventiladores). A él se le ocurrieron esos helicópteros con palas de alas de libélula, y los desiertos como océanos, y los espacios abiertos. Ojalá pueda terminar su proyecto y rodar la continuación, y que este filme atrapante, seductor, impactante, no quede como escrito en la arena de Arrakis. Acción/Aventura. EE.UU./Canadá, 2021.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," The original title of this article was going to be ‘Dune’ 2021: ‘Star Wars’ who? but I felt that might’ve been too harsh for those who believe the sun of the hero’s journey rises and sets on Luke Skywalker. Instead, I will proclaim that the new adaptation of Frank Herbert’s trailblazing 1965 science-fiction novel is a masterful blend of engrossing narrative and socially relevant themes. It is a beautiful cinematic journey to behold, as viewers will bear witness to a hero’s journey with bite that manages to avoid the overdone pitfalls of that narrative. Dune: Part One tells the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), as he and his family, the noble House Atreides, are thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune). The natives of this planet, the Fremen people, have battled for years against the invaders, the House Harkonnen. The House of Harkonnen has oppressed the Fremen in order to mine the planet for a special spice that is known to extend human life, provide superhuman levels of thought, and make faster-than-light travel practical. The Harkonnen are given this authority by the Emperor until he chooses to give this power over to House Atreides. This sets off a chain of tragic events that leaves Paul struggling to find his way under a new world order. Now, for those not familiar with science-fiction stories, much of that plot overview may sound like high-fantasy jargon. Yet, the sci-fi genre has often been used as a means of reflecting real world issues through fantastical allegories, and Dune is no different. Themes such as self-determination, capitalist greed, and environmentalism are all woven into this fantasy story, making for an often tense and powerful viewing experience. Once you get the basic details down of who is who and what is what, this is a movie that can appeal to both those who like high-fantasy and those who aren’t particularly drawn to it. That is because this isn’t a film which relies so heavily on the spectacle of CGI and out-of-this-world beings to distract from a thin plot and cardboard cutout characters. The force behind this story is to be found in the characters, their relationships, and the choices they make. The basic outline of a hero’s journey is one that involves a main character who goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home changed or transformed. Often in mainstream media, the hero is a male who is sent on a journey that sees him lose his “childlike innocence” in order to embody all the stereotypical attributes of strong masculinity. There, of course, have been variations of this template in recent times, but this archetype seems the most prevalent. While Dune on the surface could be mistaken for doing much of the same, it does not. This is what helps it stand out. Timothée Chalamet as Paul is allowed to give an emotional through line of vulnerability and sensitivity in his performance that is not portrayed as a weakness of his character, but a growing strength. The actor has a subtle yet commanding presence onscreen that serves as more than just a self-insert for young boys and men who may want to be swashbuckling adventurers. He has quirks about him, and a perspective that draws you in. Unlike in other stories like these, where everyone but the main character seems to have more flavor to them, Chalamet holds his own in bringing Paul not only to life but to the forefront. That’s not to say that the supporting cast isn’t just as compelling. No character is wasted in the movie. Even smaller roles, where a character may only appear for one scene, feel like they hold weight. The women characters are not only love interests or mothers to be sacrificed for the hero’s emotional growth. Further, this is not a film that acts as if the very far off future is filled with only white people doing important things, with the singular sporadic “magical Negro” token character thrown in for diversity points. Themes of environmentalism and capitalist greed feature. The desert planet of Arrakis itself feels like its own character. It holds not only a looming presence in the plot but in the film as a whole. Director Denis Villeneuve does a wonderful job of displaying the power of the desert and its effects on the characters. This is important, as Herbert’s original novel had a strong ecological theme. Villeneuve shows us, just as Herbert put to prose, the complex relationship between organisms and their environment. What unintentional effects can people have on a planet? That was already a question being asked in the 1960s and even more so today as we deal with a world ravaged by climate change exacerbated by harmful human activity. Stellan Skarsgård, as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, will be the thing of future nightmares as he seems to represent unchecked power and greed. Baron is an appropriate (and probably not accidental) title for Vladimir, as he looks like the visual realization of a death metal robber baron, relishing in his personal fortunes amassed through cruel business practices. There will be obvious comparisons drawn between Dune and another sci-fi epic with similar beats—Star Wars. After all, Star Wars is often regarded as the most well-known science fiction film franchise, and it also happens to deal with the hero’s journey. I began this article with the comparison because I’m sure Star Wars will be many viewers’ point of reference when going into Dune. But it needs to be pointed out that the Dune novel is one that many sci-fi films, including Star Wars, have been said to owe inspiration. Dune the book came first. Paul existed before Luke, and, to be blunt, Dune the film is allowed to have a mature edge that the Disney-owned Star Wars films avoid. I didn’t feel like I was subliminally being sold toys (like lightsabers or mini Rebel cruisers) while watching Dune. Children under 12 may end up restless during the two hour and 45-minute run-time of the movie, but this isn’t really for them. This is a tale for adults to take in and ponder. Although Dune: Part One lays a lot of groundwork to set up for a clearly intended multi-movie franchise, viewers will get a good amount of action and happenings to keep them going until the next installment is released. The moments of levity are few, but the film manages to not feel overly bleak. There’s hope. Not exactly a “new hope” (shameless Star Wars reference), but a positive feeling that the source material is being done justice. Chauncey K. Robinson is an award winning journalist and film critic.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve’s eagerly anticipated adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi eco-fable “Dune” is a gargantuan spectacle, as massive a movie as you’re going to see this year and possibly the next. I’m talking huge. The Québécois filmmaker has always had a steroidal, basso profundo sensibility, with pictures like “Sicario,” “Prisoners” and “Blade Runner 2049” stubbornly refusing to let scenes evolve organically, instead pumping every interaction up with a strained seriousness of purpose and quasi-religious import that this critic often found oppressive and even sometimes silly. But as it turns out, such doomy grandeur is exactly the right approach for “Dune,” infusing tedious trade treaty talks and lengthy exposition dumps with magisterial malevolence. It’s a full-bore commitment to the material, pummeling viewers with visual splendor and a sound mix that feels like an assault. You don’t watch “Dune” so much as you surrender to it. At least I did, quite happily. Villeneuve (working with co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) has stripped most of the psychedelia from Herbert’s novel, focusing instead on a more easily digestible allegory. It’s the year 10,191 and the distant desert planet of Arakis is rich with a mineral called “spice” that must be mined as fuel for interstellar travel. The unseen emperor of the galaxy has placed the royal family from House Atreides in charge of harvesting operations, much to the consternation of the planet’s previous tenants the Harkonnen, who aren’t exactly thrilled about losing their entire income. The first chunk of the film is devoted to palace intrigue as the noble Duke Leto Atreides (a regal Oscar Isaac and his most excellent beard) attempts to broker an arrangement with the planet’s indigenous people — the seldom-seen, desert-dwelling Fremen, pointedly played by actors of color — while he and other members of House Atreides discover that someone’s been sabotaging their machinery. It’s not exactly difficult to figure out that we’re watching a story of settler colonialism in an intergalactic Middle East. The spice is obviously oil, and we can tell that the Fremen are standing in for Arabs even when they aren't accompanied by the deafening ululations of Hans Zimmer’s score. (I know it might sound strange to be concerned with the races of people playing aliens from an imaginary planet, but it is a little curious that they didn’t cast any Middle Eastern actors given the nature of the story and the “exotic” music cues heralding the Fremen.) Meanwhile, the Duke’s tremulous teenage son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) has been having visions of his death and the deaths of his loved ones, punctuated by fleeting glimpses of Zendaya looking fetching out there somewhere in the sand, literally the girl of his dreams. Paul’s mother (Rebecca Ferguson) comes from a long line of space witches, and she’s been sharpening the boy’s psychic abilities for untold tests that are about to take place. The Fremen have an ancient prophecy about a savior who sounds a lot like Paul, which is understandably terrifying to the 98 lb. weakling. Especially since all the people on this unfamiliar planet seem to recognize him for some reason. Villeneuve has fashioned the film as a throwback to Hollywood widescreen epics, awash in visual references to “Lawrence of Arabia,” “Apocalypse Now” and I think I spotted some “El Cid” in there too, among others. (It also turns into Bergman’s “Hour of the Wolf” for a few minutes when Charlotte Rampling shows up as the leader of Ferguson’s coven.) “Dune” is for the most part a smashing entertainment, with a hearty, backslapping camaraderie among Isaac and stalwart soldiers played by Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin, all having a fine time affectionately teasing the wispy Chalamet as he begins to grow into his destiny. It is, however, only the beginning. Billed in the opening titles as “Dune: Part One,” Villeneuve’s film covers what I’m told is roughly half of Herbert’s first novel, building not so much to an ending but rather a reasonably satisfying stopping point. Anyone who saw David Lynch’s garbled 1984 attempt to cram in all the source material already understands it’s basically impossible to tell the whole story within a regular running time, and indeed one of the reasons acid Western guru Alejandro Jodorowsky’s planned 1975 adaptation — which was to star Mick Jagger and Salvador Dali with a soundtrack by Pink Floyd — never happened was because no studio in Hollywood was insane enough to finance a 12-hour movie. Clocking in at a comparatively slender 155 minutes, Villeneuve’s first installment is mainly concerned with establishing the universe, leaving a perhaps inescapable air of disappointment when the closing credits roll midway through the tale. Yet what a world to luxuriate in for a little while! Villenueve’s signature has always been emphasizing the smallness of his characters relative to their surroundings, which is perfectly suited for these vast, brutalist mining installations amid the endless amber sands of Arrakis. There’s so much pomp and circumstance to the characters’ comings and goings that Isaac’s Duke Leto even makes a winking joke about how much money these pointless ceremonies must be wasting. “Dune” is what they used to call a great “landing gear movie,” meaning that whenever a spaceship is about to land you better believe you’re gonna see the entire apparatus unfolding, instead of cutting straight to the arrival. I feel a great deal of affection toward this film’s profligate grandeur, which is another reason I’m baffled by the studio’s decision to stream “Dune” simultaneously on HBO Max. An incensed Villeneuve has described watching the film on television (or heavens forbid, your phone) as akin to “driving a speedboat in your bathtub.” The statement was met with the usual hysterical online outrage you hear whenever a director like Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino dares suggest that their movies are best seen on a big screen. It’s now become “elitist” or according to some, even “ableist” to wish for the art you just spent the last three years of your life creating to be experienced under optimum conditions. And while I understand that chain multiplexes like AMC and Landmark hardly qualify as “optimum,” we are blessed with some fine independent theaters in the Boston area, with the newly reopened Somerville Theatre screening “Dune” on what I believe to be the only 4K Laser projector in the Northeast. (There was one at the Jordan’s IMAX in Reading, but that’s still shuttered until further notice.) As soon as the press screening was over I started making plans to see “Dune” again at the Somerville, but you better believe I won’t be watching it at home. Sometimes size does matter."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s “Dune” series is probably one of the most popular franchises in history that is the least known by people. Generations have read the books or encountered some adaptation or property based on them. But while many folks may recognize the nods and winks to the series in other shows and movies, if asked to explain what a “mentat” is or why the lead character may actually be a villain, the average person’s face would likely glaze over in confusion and annoyance. Herbert’s creation melds historical events, mystic branches of Abrahamic religions and the hero’s journey to deliver a story that entices with its unique nuances and worldbuilding yet also repels with the density of those elements. The idea of adapting the first book into one film has been daunting and seemingly impossible for decades. Perhaps that’s why director Denis Villeneuve didn’t set out to make only one movie — a choice that helps and severely hinders “Dune.” In the year 10,191, mankind has spanned the stars to create a galactic empire. To cover so much cosmic geography — for commerce, militarization, communication and more — navigators must use Melange (or “spice”), a substance that is found only on the planet Arrakis, to help fold space and allow for interplanetary travel. This makes spice the most important commodity in the universe and Arrakis the focal point of power. Overseeing everything is The Emperor, who assigns Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, to take over control of Arrakis from House Harkonnen, which is led by Leto’s cousin and rival, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). It’s a massive opportunity that also places a giant target on House Atreides. The Duke’s courtesan, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is aware of this impending doom due to her psychic abilities cultivated as a member of an order of psionic priestesses attempting to bring about the messiah through eugenics and selective breeding. Her son and heir to House Atreides, Paul (Timotheé Chalamet), possesses extraordinary powers and insight that also let him see the dangers that await on the desert planet. Despite knowing that it’s a trap, the Duke answers the call and seeks to forge an alliance with the Fremen, the indigenous people of Arrakis, to end centuries of the horrific injustice that the natives have faced while also bolstering Atreides’ standings in the halls of power. “Dune” has giant sandworms that can eat ships, a deadly siege resulting in brutal combat, an ancient coven of space witches, mutant creatures that travel through the fifth dimension and bizarre visions fueled by a potent psychotropic drug. These all sound fantastical and the stuff of bombastic space opera, and yet, like the book on which it’s based, “Dune” is more invested in palatial intrigue, political machinations and the characters caught in these power games. Those are some dry topics that are more befitting a television series (or, say, multiple novels) that can focus on many perspectives to make compelling arguments for each character’s motivations and to help communicate the enormous scope of events that are unfolding. That is most likely why the movie is subtitled “Part One,” a fact that has been known but is rarely (if ever) used in the film’s marketing. At 155 minutes, this is just one part of the first book in the “Dune” saga, and there’s no indication if there will be additional entries. Such a fragmented status makes “Dune” difficult to review. Firstly, for those unfamiliar with the source material, the film will most likely be a bit awkward and confusing. Despite the efforts of Villeneuve, who co-wrote the adaptation with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, there remains a lot of exposition dumping that seemingly never stops from the first scene to the last. Yet somehow, there are still many aspects of the story’s universe that aren’t fully explained and, while not crucial, would help make for a more satisfying narrative (not to mention head off a bunch of “plot hole” videos). While there is a lot of repetition of facts about the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, et al., Villeneuve does his best to present these informative conversations in scenes that are gorgeously designed and shot. The care that went into perfectly creating a distinct aesthetic for each planet, House and more is truly impressive and makes every sequence seem epic, while the framing and lighting of the characters, along with the actors’ performances, maintains a true sense of intimacy amidst the galactic conspiracies. All of those plans within plans are catalysts for events, but it’s the relationships and emotions of these characters that interest the filmmakers the most — specifically, how to cope with the knowledge of the imminent arrival of devastation and despair. Leto knows that’s he’s doomed, as his successes have only bred more enemies; Paul knows that he’s different in a way that no one understands; and Jessica knows that she’s been on borrowed time since she betrayed the Bene Gesserit to have a son instead of a daughter. And yet all three aren’t resigned to their fates, even though they literally know it’s inevitable. It’s a melancholic beauty that one rarely finds at the heart of such a wide expanse of story set amongst the stars. All of the actors do fantastic work, even if some of it is becoming old hand for them. Jason Momoa is a cavalier yet masterful warrior who loves a good laugh and a good battle; Josh Brolin plays a cynical man with a painful past who houses a caring heart inside of his cold exterior; and Zendaya’s Chani is a literal dream girl who’s different than the other women in the protagonist’s life and intrigues him with the possibility of something new and unexpected. All three performers excel in their parts, but they’re becoming familiar territory for them. Isaac, Ferguson and Chalamet are the cornerstones of the film (in terms of its narrative and heart), and they all excel, especially Ferguson, who can imbue layers of personality and emotion into a single line reading or mild change of facial expression. Chalamet occasionally becomes too much of a brooding teenager who sulks in model poses, but it’s not a far-fetched idea for space royalty to act like a petulant celebrity. As of this writing, a sequel to “Dune” has not been confirmed. Villeneuve sounded off against Warner Bros. for its day-and-date release of the film in theaters and on HBO Max, and with the exception of a couple horror movies, this strategy has led to smaller box office returns. This is to say that there may not be a second part, and if there is, it may not be made by the same people or even any time soon. While it was smart to parse the story out onto a larger canvas, without the guarantee of the rest of the tapestry, it can be seen as arrogance or a missed opportunity. The film abruptly ends without much in the way of character arc completion or narrative intrigue. There are several plot elements and characters completely missing from the film, which is a lot to leave to be addressed in another movie that will hopefully be made someday. “Dune” is incomplete and lacks a great sense of urgency to see what happens next. Peter Jackson’s “The Fellowship of the Ring” also left out a lot of parts of the trilogy to be developed in later films, but those films were being made at that time. Audiences knew it was part of a bigger story and when to expect more of it, and there were enough dangling threads that promised something entertaining and innovative. That’s why viewers wanted to head back to Middle-earth: to be with these characters, to see what happens next, and to have their expectations met and upended in equal parts. Despite the painstakingly impressive work by Villeneuve and his team to create these gorgeous and intricate worlds unlike any seen before, it’s unclear if audiences will ever get a chance to return to them and, should they get that opportunity, if they’ll still want to go back.

"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL," There's
a notoriety surrounding Frank Herbert's 1965 science-fiction novel Dune
and the attempts to adapt it into a movie. Some of that comes from a failed
attempt in the 1970s, but most of it comes from the ungainly 1984 adaptation.
The prospect almost seems cursed at this point, considering that it has been
almost 40 years since anyone dared try again. The new
attempt is co-writer/director Denis Villeneuve's Dune.
It's certainly better than the previous cinematic adaptation, if only because it
doesn't become bogged down in trying to fit every detail of the
novelincluding the whole of the story, although that's a different
issueinto a single movie. This version doesn't require an encyclopedia to
figure out who's who, what's what, and why anything is happening. The new
movie makes sense. That may seem like a low bar to overcome, but as much as
people like to say the little things matter the most, they don't mean a lick if
the big things are almost impossible to comprehend. The
screenplay, written by the director and John Spaihts and Eric Roth, takes its
time to ease us into this intergalactic world of political intrigue, revolving
around a single planet, where the most valuable commodity in the universe can be
found. Those who don't know Herbert's book, except by reputation, or only know
its story from the 1984 mess might be surprised to find how relatively simple
this tale is. Then again, Villeneuve and company are only adapting half of the
first novel in a multi-part series, so there's obviously more to it. If the
track record of getting the first book to the big screen is any indication,
someone might eventually finish a complete adaptation of Herbert's cycle before
the era in which this story is set. The
year is 10,191, and space travel and trade are fueled by a substance called
Spice, which can only be found on the desert planet Arrakis. The primary plot
involves two families from different planets: the house of Atreides and that of
Harkonnen. The latter has been overseeing the collection and refining of Spice
on Arrakis, but part of the planet's local population, called Fremen, has been
attacking the Harkonnen clan's operations. An unseen galactic emperor pulls that
family from Arrakis and offers the job to the Artreides house. That's
a lot of exposition at the start, as we're introduced to the general world of
this story and the central characters, and it's definitely not the end of the
lessons about history, cultures, various tools, and other matters that we
receive here. If one removed all of this back story and the scenes establishing
assorted locations and ships and peoples and creatures, the plot itself would be
finished within a relatively short period of time. Going through it would be
futile, since so much of Herbert's narrative has been replicated in the decades
since the book's publication, and read like the book report that much of the
dialogue sounds like here. Our
hero, who's mostly an empty vessel for things to happen to him for most of the
movie, is Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac)
and his father's favorite concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). He has been
trained in combat by members of the Artreides' military, including Duncan Idaho
(Jason Momoa) and Gurney Helleck (Josh Brolin), and in telepathy by his mother.
There are hints and rumors that Paul is some kind of messiah or chosen one, but
hints and rumors are all this particular story has time to provide. That's
because Villeneuve isn't only busy slowly filling in details about the story's
greater universe and more intimate worldsits politics, its locales, its
history, its assorted gadgets and devices and ships. He's also making sure we
take in all of these sights and visions of this futuristic realm. The filmmaker
lingers on great space ships, breaching their undersea docks or looking like
tiny insects relative to the massive entryways for interstellar travel, and the
landscape of Arrakis, its endless desert torn up by giant harvesting tanks and a
city that was built to match the color and geographic formations of sand, and
more specific spaces, such as the dimly lit halls within that city or the grim
catacombs of the lair of the floating blob known as Baron Harkonnen (Stellan
Skarsgård). The
production design and visual effects on display are intricate, seamless, and
logically designed elements of a futuristic world that is based on geometric
shapes and monochromatic color schemes. A lot of work, in other words, has been
put into bringing to life a series of blandly convincing and convincingly bland
aesthetic choices. A few organic-lookinghelicopters that are designed like
insectsand actually organicthe gigantic sphincters that are the sand
wormstouches break up the visual monotony a bit, just as a couple
performances (Momoa and, on occasion, Isaac) break through the dreary tone of
the tale itself. Dune
is a lot to take in, on account of its ever-expanding world and visual
spectacle. Because of its thin characters and sparsely incomplete plot, the
movie also leaves little to care about and consider."

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," The spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe: A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the Fremen, who have long held a prophecy that a man would come, a messiah, who would lead them to true freedom. The planet is Arrakis. Also known as Dune. The above narration comes from 1984’s Dune, the first time Frank Herbert’s legendarily unfilmable novel reached the silver screen. David Lynch was the director, and Dino De Laurentiis was the producer, but it was not the first time someone tried to bring Herbert’s 1965 novel to cinematic fruition. In the 1970s, Chilean cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky planed an ambitious no-detail-overlooked-or-left-out 14-hour movie that would have cost millions and starred Salvador Dalí, Orson Welles, and Mick Jagger. But Jodorowsky’s Dune never made it past the planning stages—though a great deal of the work H. R. Geiger, Chris Foss, Jean Giraud, and Dan O’Bannon did for Jodorowski ended up in other movies. For this, you must seek out Jodorowsky’s Dune, one of the best documentaries about a movie that never was. Then came Italian mega-producer De Laurentiis, who did manage to bring Dune to the big screen with Lynch in tow. That version—or versions—was a flop by most standards. Dune failed to make its money back at the box office, critics panned it, and Lynch has done just about everything he can to distance himself from it. However, it did introduce Lynch to actor Kyle McLachlan, so it wasn’t a total loss. That brings us to now and Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, co-written with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth. If those previous Dunes needed to fail so that this one could succeed, then so be it—though I’m not sure that’s saying much. Villeneuve and company were wise to break the story into parts, both for narrative and financial purposes, even if this means that Dune: Part One feels incomplete. Not that it matters much, the images, particularly if you see the movie in IMAX, are so overwhelming you barely notice the story.  Dune is a big movie. Massive, really. Sets and space ships and landscapes dwarf the characters. The work between the costume department (Jacqueline West and Robert Morgan), production design (Patrice Vermette), and the visual effects team are so complementary that Dune goes beyond believability into some sort of hyper-cinematic realm. Practically every movie relies on special effects these days; Dune makes them look like child’s play. And cinematographer Greig Fraser and editor Joe Walker make sure you appreciate every bit of it. Be it is a simple close-up of Timothée Chalamet’s face or a massive battle between ground troops, aircraft, and space ships. Nothing is rushed; everything is enjoyed. Some of it might come across as indulgent—say, Hans Zimmer’s score of drones and screeches—but that would be missing the point. The point here is spectacle, and Villeneuve gives you so much you almost forget there’s a story in here somewhere. The plot is cumbersome but boils down to the standard hero’s journey monomyth. The planet Arrakis contains spice. For the inhabitants, the spice is a powerful hallucinogen that has vast medicinal powers. For everyone else in the galaxy, spice makes interstellar travel possible. He who harvests the spice is wealthy beyond imagination. That’s where the House Harkonnen, led by Beast Rabben Harkonnen (Dave Bautista), comes in. Then the emperor decrees that Harkonnen is out, and the House of Atreides—led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), Lady Leto (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son, Paul (Chalamet)—is in. You don’t have to squint to see a long history of colonialism in Dune, but what the movie has to say about it will be left to subsequent installments. Instead, we have battles, magnificent sets, and Paul slowly realizing his powers and role in this story. The only real disappointment is that Dune doesn’t get much further than a standard first act before the credits roll. It’s stunning to look at but lacks stickiness. In time, we will judge Dune in relation to the subsequent installments, much like how we view individual Star Wars episodes or installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But for now, when none of those sequels exists, Dune feels unfinished. But it sure is pretty to look at.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Among the singular achievements of Frank Herbert’s Dune is how it reconciles seemingly contradictory elements, including a science-fiction realm that’s otherworldly yet politically and topographically familiar, and a narrative arc that’s both a classic hero’s journey and a pseudo-spiritual hallucinogenic freakout. As I wrote earlier this week, there is no working director whose sensibility covers the spectrum wide enough to be ideally suited for Dune, because makers of large-scale blockbuster epics tend not to be acid-dropping seekers with a flair for the experimental. Short of Bruce Dern guiding George Lucas through an LSD weekend like Peter Fonda in The Trip, any adaptation is bound to break hard in one direction or another—either conventionality or abstraction.  The new version by Denis Villeneuve, the director of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, bends unsurprisingly toward convention, which is not to say that it isn’t audacious or accomplished, or that it doesn’t have a distinctive power of its own. It should be noted upfront—as the trailers and promotional materials have conspicuously not done—that Dune is only half a movie. So much of what can be said about it now is strictly provisional, based on the confidence instilled by this 155-minute set-up and the hope that market forces dictate whether it ever gets finished. If you’re looking for further evidence of the convergence of film and television, try waiting on news of a film’s continued production as if it were an “on the bubble” network drama awaiting renewal.  Though it’s missing the mystical kick of Herbert’s novel, and has yet to fill out any allusions to real-world politics or the ambiguous turn its hero’s journey is about to take, Villeneuve’s Dune is still a formidable achievement, allotting itself the time and the scale to tell this story right. Anyone who has read Dune will acknowledge that the first 100 pages or so are a steep learning curve, immersing you in a thicket of galactic intrigue and freaky technologies so dense that the paperback comes with a glossary. The clarity and pace of this adaptation, which Villeneuve co-scripted with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, may be its most impressive quality. That may sound uninspiring, but both qualities badly stymied David Lynch when he tried to adapt Dune under impossible production constraints. It’s an expert piece of world-building.  Through a combination of simple titles, a couple of segments from “filmbooks,” and occasional narration from Chani (Zendaya), a young woman who will figure more prominently in the theoretical second film, Dune does its best to avoid jamming up the dialogue with expository info-dumps, but there’s some necessary table-setting. In the far-distant future, all power in the known universe revolves around access to a cinnamon-scented spice called melange, which makes interstellar space travel possible, allowing giant ships to zip across galaxies without moving. The spice has a similar effect on humans, expanding consciousness and extending life while seeding a kind of uncanny prescience. Melange can only be harvested on Arrakis, a harsh desert planet that would be virtually uninhabitable even if it weren’t patrolled by giant sandworms under the surface.  After decades of the vile, duplicitous House Harkonnen managing mining operations on Arrakis, the Emperor offers stewardship of the planet to Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), head of the noble House Atreides, prompting a dangerous change of location from its ocean planet. Though Leto realizes that the Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and other rivals are likely setting a trap for him, duty compels him to accept the assignment. Meanwhile, his son Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet)—a young, lithe, introspective man of destiny—is starting to come into his own under the guidance of his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the centuries-old Bene Gesserit sisterhood. Paul has visions of a profound ascension on Arrakis, tied to the Fremen, an oppressed indigenous population that has figured out how to survive on the planet.  Villeneuve isn’t given to whimsy or fun, or even the peculiar touches that Lynch brought to his adaptation, like the heart plugs Baron Harkonnen installs in his slaves or the pug that Duke Leto hauls around like a furry accessory. He directs Dune with the absolute seriousness of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, and puts a premium on the scale of Herbert’s story, expressed here through ornate slate-gray ships and immense military formations, and the bone-rattling sounds of space-age industry and a bass-heavy Hans Zimmer score. Whatever sense of giddy adventure might be gleaned from sword fights and close scrapes with the sandworms is muted by a grim sense of purpose. The tradeoff, as in the novel, is a rich mythology that’s treated seriously, with the highest stakes possible. Villeneuve doesn’t show much interest in the Middle Eastern politics that inform the book, much less the jihad that may be in Paul’s future, but cosmic justice is meaningful enough to him to keep from framing it like a lark.  Led by Chalamet, who was practically born in a lab to play Paul, the cast gives Villeneuve’s film the necessary color to pop against his austere backdrops. The livelier the performance, the better: Ferguson brings the right amount of mystery and emotion to Jessica, a woman who loves her son but harbors a conflicting agenda; Charlotte Rampling, though hidden behind a black veil, gives a sinister, imperious authority to her role as a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother; and Javier Bardem as Stilgar, leader of the Fremen, exudes the brazen confidence of a man who belongs on this harsh planet.  Walk down the staircase just inside the entrance of the Chicago Art Institute and you’ll find a space dedicated to the Thorne Rooms, a set of miniature living spaces commissioned by artist Narcissa Niblack Thorne starting in 1932. Born of Thorne’s childhood love of dollhouses, the interiors span centuries and continents, realized in astounding detail at 1:12 scale but left mostly empty, allowing visitors to use their imaginations to fill in the blanks of who might live there, what their passions might be, why they chose those tables and chairs as their own, and what might lie just out of view of the window that offers a glimpse of the world beyond the miniatures’ walls.  For a while, the exhibit included a plaque with a quote from a great Thorne admirer, Wes Anderson, taken from a 2014 Fresh Air interview with NPR’s Terry Gross. “It’s usually filled with kids and they look through the glass,” Anderson said, “and they’re just rooms but they’re so intricately detailed. They’re imaginary rooms but they evoke different periods and different places and you kind of go all around the world looking through windows into these tiny rooms. It’s a really fascinating thing. There’s something about miniatures— there’s something kind of mesmerizing about them, for whatever reason.” Anderson talks as if recognizing a kindred spirit. His love of precisely ornamented environments and formal compositions have defined his work from the start. But Anderson’s work has never been about precision for its own sake. There’s a poignancy to the way he creates spaces that, for all that exacting command, can never provide enough protection from the chaos and decay that threatens to engulf the just as exactingly realized (and often as order-obsessed) characters who inhabit them. Bottle Rocket’s Dignan’s 75-year-plan hits some snags before hitting the one-week mark. Chas Tenebaum’s obsession with his children’s safety will never make up for his loss. Steve Zissou can explore the depths of the ocean in a state-of-the-art submarine, but death finds those around him anyway. Time and history eat away at the glamour of the Grand Budapest Hotel despite Gustave H.’s best efforts. Only art—miniature rooms, films filled with lovingly realized wistfulness, or other forms—can freeze time, and in The French Dispatch Anderson uses his artform of choice to pay tribute to another: magazine journalism in general and the golden age of The New Yorker in particular. Set in the fictional French city of Ennui (rhymes with and resembles “Pahr-ee”), the film takes the form of three articles and a “Shouts & Murmurs”-style scene-setter found in the pages of The French Dispatch of Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun, a long-running (but soon to shutter) newspaper insert that’s specialized on reporting the news from abroad back to the heartland in the decades after World War II. It’s been managed in fastidious detail by editor Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray)—he loves good writing, hates crying, fiercely supports his staff when not firing them—but, as the film opens, Howitzer’s reign has come to an end. That makes the film something of a wake in the form of The French Dispatch’s greatest hits, stories inspired in varying degrees by Anderson’s favorite New Yorker pieces. Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson) kicks things off with a tour of Ennui with an emphasis on the more picturesque elements of its seedier side (rats and all). It’s followed by tales of a mad, imprisoned artist (Benicio del Toro) in love with the guard (Léa Seydoux) who doubles as his favorite model; a student revolutionary Timothée Chalamet on the frontlines of a protest engulfing ’68 Ennui; and a profile of a chef that turns into a wild crime story.  The one-line plot descriptions don’t really do justice to the filigree within the filigree found in each segment. The French Dispatch is, in many respects, maximalist Anderson. Frames contain more detail than the eye can take in in a single viewing. Segments alternate between black-and-white and color. One sequence plays host to a lengthy excerpt of a play. Another breaks into animation. (Because what’s an issue of the New Yorker without cartoons?) The cast is expansive even by Anderson standards, with newcomers like Del Toro, Liev Schrieber, Chalamet, and Jeffrey Wright joining an ensemble of regulars that includes Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, and Tilda Swinton.  If this sounds like a director trying to push himself in new directions it is—but only up to a point. There’s no mistaking this for the work of anyone else. Even the ’68 riots appear meticulously production designed. But, in spite of the sizing up, The French Dispatch also feels a bit minor, at least on first viewing. (Anderson films have a way of shifting and expanding in meaning and significance with time and repeated exposure.) The segments mix whimsy and melancholy, as expected, but with fewer of the moments that melt the heart that usually comes with that mix.  When last we saw Michael Myers, at the end of 2018’s Halloween, he appeared to be well and truly dead, killed, decades after their first encounter, by his archfoe Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) after returning  once more to trouble Haddonfield, Illinois. But, hey, not so fast. Turns out that director David Gordon Green and longtime collaborator Danny McBride (collaborating on the screenplay here with Scott Teems) had a trilogy in mind for this slasher revival. Thus Halloween Kills opens with Michael Myers emerging from Strode’s burning home/weaponized bunker, killing a bunch of firefighters, then heading to town to kill and kill again. Thanks for sharing. Excited for both Dune and French Dispatch.  Your reviews make me even more confident I will enjoy them.  I saw Halloween Kills and agree with your review wholeheartedly. The final film in the trilogy should have a little more to chew on thematically, so still looking forward to it despite the relative misfire that is Halloween Kills."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Cinematographer Greig Fraser paints gorgeous shot after gorgeous shot with his camera and lighting. The visual effects here are the best onscreen for 2021, and the giant, burrowing sandworms under the dunes are something to behold. The production design incorporates all sorts of browns and beiges and references Spanish art deco as well as streamlined Swiss design for its interiors.  The costumes are all earth tones too, echoing the sand, and Hans Zimmer’s score is alternatingly ethereal and menacing, perfect for this material.  Skarsgard’s villain is underdeveloped and could use more dialogue, and Javier Bardem doesn’t have enough to do but will figure more strongly in part two. The same goes with Zendaya’s rebel character Chani. She may be all over the trailers and the red carpet, presenting one of the major faces for the film, but the ingenue is in this go-round for only a few minutes of screentime. All in all, this is a film to be savored on as big a screen as possible. Villeneuve’s accomplishment is both artistic and accessible, a faithful interpretation of Herbert, and a big Hollywood picture that shows off its brains as confidently as its budget. It’s frustrating though that the second part wasn’t filmed with this one because Warner Bros. was hesitant to commit. Now, we’ll hope that a sequel comes, and as soon as possible. We’ll be watching those sands in the hourglass waiting for the bigger dunes to return."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," Dune — out now in cinemas and streaming on HBO Max — is a bold bet. It's not anything like Star Wars, another epic sci-fi franchise that has defined and inspired the genre. There are no lightsabers, dogfights, or space battles here. The first big scale action comes near the halfway point (though after that, it doesn't stop). Its characters don't trade quips, or ping-pong across planets on a galactic adventure. Dune is set largely on one planet that gives the film its name. And there's no humour on display here, it's all self-serious. Dune is more akin to Game of Thrones, but in space, and, minus the sex and the humour. It serves up a whole lot of palace intrigue, hints at a questionable quasi-Biblical journey, and seemingly evokes Lawrence of Arabia at times. But this is what we should have expected. After all, Dune comes from director Denis Villeneuve — he's also co-writer with Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange) and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, A Star Is Born) — who has previously given us slow-moving self-serious sci-fi stories in Arrival, with Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, and Blade Runner 2049, with Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. Villeneuve is now operating on a much grander scale with Dune, adapted from the first half (or so) of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel of the same name. The film requires a lot of worldbuilding. The first non-action half of Dune is devoted to this, with Villeneuve doing his best to make it as interesting as possible. Still, there's heavy servings of exposition, through a star-studded ensemble cast and talking encyclopaedias. Villeneuve crafts sequences of myriad lengths to explain the workings of the desert planet the film is set on. There's one to talk about the “stillsuits” that allow humans to survive in the dunes. There's a long one to set up what the planet's gigantic sandworms are capable of. Everyone talks about the worms, but we rarely see them — it's clever, like what Steven Spielberg did on Jurassic Park, but taken even further. Dune benefits from the fact that Villeneuve understands scale. He can focus on the tiny just as well as he does on the big. Dune has mosquito-sized killer drones, but also city block-sized spaceships. It's a vast spectrum, and Villeneuve handles it well, designing some memorable moments along the way. Here is a director who can finally realise the ambition of Herbert's epic, which has long been considered “unfilmable” — a point proven by disappointing and forgettable attempts on both the big and small screens in the past. But Villeneuve trips over himself in being faithful to the source material. He and his co-writers chopped and streamlined the story, but they retain its central elements. Set in a far-off future (the year is 10,191), Dune follows young white nobleman Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet who is appropriately skinny and lanky, though he's clearly not the 15-year-old that Paul was at the start of the books. His mother is Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), part of conniving but mysterious Bene Gesserit order, who whisper into the Emperor's ears and have considerable influence. That's because their all-female members can see the future and wield a superpower called the Voice — think of it as mind control by way of talking. Jessica has been training Paul in the Voice, even though she was forbidden to, because he's a boy, not the girl she was ordered to give birth to by her superiors. Additionally, Paul has been having dreams — some of them feature Zendaya, whose character Chani exists more in Paul's head than she does in the flesh — that might in fact be visions. The dreams give Dune an ethereal quality, like what you're seeing is off kilter and supernatural, which it is. Dune's writers also use them to hint at what's to come in Dune: Part Two, a movie that may possibly never get made. Although Paul was not initially a part of their plan, the Bene Gesserit believe that Paul could be a prophesised individual who can bend space and time. Given his potential Jesus Christ-type messiah status, they naturally want him protected. Though they also have ulterior motives that involve Paul's father, Duke Leto Atriedes (Oscar Isaac), who has recently gotten a new posting from the Emperor. House Atreides has been given stewardship of that desert planet, Arrakis — colloquially called Dune for the sand dunes that cover all of it. Arrakis is the only source for “spice” that makes space travel happen and grants superhuman powers. As such, spice is the most valuable substance in the universe. And those who control Arrakis are naturally going to mint money. But Arrakis is also home to the aforementioned gigantic sandworms which makes harvesting spice dangerous. And there's an indigenous population known as the Fremen, who are hostile to any outsiders given the centuries of brutal and indifferent treatment they have witnessed at the hands of great and powerful houses. As you can tell, Dune has (intentional) parallels to Earth's history of colonialism, and the atrocities that have been committed by white men, who were only interested in the resources and the associated monetary riches. Arrakis represents the Middle East, with spice an allegory for oil. Forget the annoyance of yet another chosen one narrative — something Villeneuve was smart enough to upend on Blade Runner 2049 — there's something uncomfortable about following a white boy when you're telling a story that looks at the effects of imperialism. Though Dune kicks off by suggesting it's interested in exploring that imperialist angle, the attempts at commentary are lost soon after. Dune tries to smoothen out book-Paul's edges, making him more sensitive, so his image as a saviour for Arrakis' darker-skinned natives doesn't feel egregious. But Dune needed to do a lot more. Dune continuously borrows words, imagery, music and culture from the Middle East, just like Herbert did. The Emperor is the Padishah Emperor, Paul's messianic name is Lisan al-Gaib, and Jessica's ceremonial jewellery is characteristically of that region. Yet there isn't a single main character who belongs to that place. It's all about outsiders: Paul, Jessica, Leto, Duncan, Gurney. The first book is over 50 years old, so it's natural that the text is wildly politically incorrect in parts and is lacking in representation. But Villeneuve's attempts at diversity weirdly stop at casting African American actors. Dune's failures in recognising the source's blind spots are a grave mistake. There's also a bit of otherisation going on with the film's villains. On Arrakis, House Atreides takes over from House Harkonnen who have built a considerable empire, having harvested spice for 80 years. Naturally, their chief Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is mighty upset. Dune sets up the Harkonnens like a brutal zealot force out for blood. On the other hand, the Atreides are portrayed as noble, from Leto's behaviour (he seeks an alliance with Fremen) to the way he talks (“no call we do not answer, no faith we betray”). But Dune never really wrangles with the idea that they are both villains for the Fremen. They believe it's right to land on Arrakis and harvest its resources. The movie is never able (or again, willing) to dig beneath to expose the problematic worms within. Dune is two movies in one, though I'm not sure it works as either. Aside from the worldbuilding, the first half is a lot of political machinations with characters trying to out manoeuvre others, and cultural clashes with characters trying to understand one another. Villeneuve is once again trying to make thoughtful sci-fi fare, though Dune is also more mainstream than anything he has ever done. The second half is pure spectacle. Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser's camera lingers on dragonfly-like spaceships, the explosions are both gorgeous and harrowing, and its characters battle sand and wind in a way that feels elemental. Hans Zimmer's score isn't always rousing, though it is when it needs to be. It finds a whole lot of other notes too, with the synth and vocalising giving Dune an otherworldly quality. And it is definitely watchable moment to moment, given the murderers' row of cast members. Isaac is a Star Wars veteran, Jason Momoa is Aquaman, Josh Brolin is Thanos and has been part of brilliant thriller films, and Zendaya is an Emmy-winning lead actress. I haven't even gotten to the unrecognisable Skarsgård, and Ferguson who's always fascinating in Mission: Impossible. Dune is filled with actors that would be lead stars elsewhere — but it's not able to supply them with enough material. This is Chalamet's movie after all, he's virtually in every scene, though he is too vanilla for my taste here. It doesn't help that Villeneuve require every character to treat every situation with the utmost gravity — Momoa the lone exception to the rule at times — which flattens the actors' dynamism. And going back to my opening argument, Dune is also a bold bet because it's an incomplete tale. Titled onscreen as Dune: Part One, it covers about half of Herbert's first book. You can tell that from the actors cast and their screen-time here — it's clear they will have a much bigger role in the planned Dune: Part Two. You can also tell it from the way it ends. Dune cuts out nary a resolution. It prompted me to go, “Wait, are we really going to stop here?” You might be forgiven for thinking that they couldn't finish the film due to COVID or something. Even though it runs for 156 minutes (including credits), Dune is just half a movie. Or maybe a third, if Villeneuve gets his trilogy. Spreading Dune (the book) over two movies (for now) does have its benefits. Villeneuve can take his time with the story, with its supporting roster of characters getting more time than they otherwise would. It also helps the worldbuilding. By the time Dune wraps up, you know enough of Arrakis and its evolving parts, that you will be intrigued enough to be craving for more. Except the sequel might be years away, if it comes at all, because Warner Bros. has said that it will only greenlight one if Dune performs well on HBO Max. Maybe Dune: Part Two will improve on the first film's socio-political failings too. Fremen will be a bigger part of Dune: Part Two, with Zendaya being the protagonist on the sequel, as Villeneuve has revealed. Given the focus on Paul, it seems unlikely that it will get very far in that regard. On the other hand, since it will complete the first book's story, it could reflect well on Dune: Part One as the audience will have additional context and details. Dune can't be judged as a whole because its second part doesn't exist (and may never will). For now, Dune must be evaluated on the basis of what we have. We are left with a very odd movie, one that contains a relatively straightforward tale, and is portentous by the scale it's adopted on, and how it takes time in building its world. But if you're telling Dune's story in 2021, you need to recognise the dated-ness of the original body of work and do better. Nevertheless, Dune is a brave undertaking. Kudos to Warner Bros. for giving Villeneuve the creative freedom despite the box office disappointment of Blade Runner 2049 — I imagine this might find a slightly bigger audience, though thanks to COVID-19 and that HBO Max day-and-date release, who knows how it fares commercially. Dune is a herculean effort, but it might also be in vain. And while this is the best attempt at a Dune adaptation yet, it also feels like some distance away from being what it should be. Maybe some epics are just better left on the page. Maybe Dune really is “unfilmable”, as much as I disagree with that philosophy. Dune is out Friday, October 22 in cinemas and on HBO Max. In India, Dune is available in English and Hindi. It will release October 29 in Maharashtra."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEGATIVE," Dune, the novel by Frank Herbert, is a masterpiece. Mixing economics, ecology, religion, and politics in the far future, it is a true classic of the science fiction genre, resonating for decades. Dune, David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation, maybe isn’t a masterpiece, but it is nonetheless captivating to me, inspired by Herbert but also many other influences. Denis Villeneuve’s take on Dune (subtitled Part One in the film itself) is difficult to judge. On the one hand, Dune is far from the first time an adaptation has been broken into multiple parts. However, this version feels like it ends when the meat of the story basically starts. From a story and thematic perspective, Villeneuve and his co-writers leave off in a place that offers little satisfaction.  The most enjoyable aspects of this Dune are the visuals. I spent much of the runtime in awe of the massive scale being captured on screen. After over a decade of Marvel movies, getting wide shots to evoke scale is a welcome relief. Being able to take in locations like the desert planet Arrakis across many locations and situations allows it to cast a mood over many of the sequences that take place there. While the production design is a bit sterile overall, it would be easy to argue the austerity suits many of the locations, so I won’t criticize it too much for not matching my mental impressions of the same spaces. It is also possible that more baroque designs await deeper into this adaptation. The action sequences, both large and small, are wonderfully composed, favoring visual information over everything else. Many of those picturesque wide shots evoke the kind of concept art that rarely makes it into the finished work. Villeneuve takes a measured approach to worldbuilding, delivering some exposition via audio-visual books, and the rest through dialogue. Even with that, the slim narrative buckles under the weight of all of the set up, especially since much of the exposition is teased out over several points in the story. The film tries to bring a sense of momentum and drive curiosity in the audience, but it barely reaches any sort of flashpoint. It’s a lot of information, but there’s nothing in it relating it to the characters other than when they use a piece of information we’ve heard before to make a decision.  Much of the character work feels like checking a box, things the filmmakers know need to happen because they are in the book, but not why they are important to the story. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Duncan Idaho (an oddly beardless Jason Momoa) are shown to have a close relationship, but we never understand why these two share such a bond. Duncan seems to be the biggest influence on Paul after his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and father, Leto (Oscar Isaac), but sometimes it feels like they just share scenes together to deliver more exposition. One thing that makes Dune challenging to adapt is that so much of the book is about Paul’s interior journey, and while he has plenty of dreams about Zendaya, Chalamet can only give so much nuance using just his face. It’s not that Chalamet is lacking, it’s that for much of this movie he isn’t really given much to do other than looking pensive.  Watching Dune, I wasn’t bored, but even hints at the big ideas and interesting characters that make the book such a memorable experience are few and far between. There’s not even enough here to give confidence that those aspects will be developed in future installments. The sad fact of it is that there is nothing in this film that would draw me back for another installment except that it’s an adaptation of Dune. This movie feels as if Peter Jackson had ended Fellowship of the Ring with Frodo arriving in Rivendell. That film spends a lot of time in The Shire in order to provide contrast as the hobbits’ journey continues on into more wild and dangerous places. There is very little of the ecological themes, the wrestling with the white male savior narrative, or even much political intrigue in this adaptation. Villeneuve leaves us with unclear character goals, a lot of details, and zero momentum, stranding us in wild desert territory where we have barely learned how to walk the right way. "
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve is the blockbuster’s great texturalist. In an age of ever-more plastic special effects, the Canadian director, like his Warner Brothers stablemate Christopher Nolan, has realised that what sells the movie is not how it looks, but how it feels."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL," Wondering if the Dune  movie (2021) is ok for kids? Dune is rated PG-13 for some language and violence. The 2021 version of Dune is better than the David Lynch version, but since it is split into two films, this one sets up the story for the next and is painfully long. However, young fans of Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya will want to watch this on the big screen. Is Dune kid friendly? Mostly yes, but it gets violent. Here’s what parents need to know in this Dune Parents Guide. Frank Herbert’s novel, Dune, is complex, has many layers and worlds and is said to have influenced Star Wars, which is apparent. This is tough to translate to the big screen, but Denis Villeneuve does a fairly good job, especially if you’re familiar with the source material. However, if this is your first introduction to Dune, you may be scratching your head by the end.  A lot of time is spent introducing you to the characters and players in this political drama. Dune is set in the year 10191 and the Emperor of the Known Universe has decreed that House Atreides should oversee the ongoing colonization of the desert planet of Arrakis, basically forcing them to leave their home, because there is “no call they do not answer.” Oscar Issac is Duke Leto Atreides and shares a son with his concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). She is also part of the religious order the Bene Gesserit, who have powers you don’t want to underestimate. Paul (Chalamet) is their son and is struggling with his duty to his father and title but also of his so-called Messiah calling from the Bene Gesserit. He has also been having nightmares and premonitions of what’s to come on Arrakis, including of one particular girl, part of the Freman, the desert people living there who are not happy to have visitors. Dune is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material which means this film may not be suitable for children under 13. There is less language than your typical Marvel movie, but there is some profanity in Dune including a few uses of sh*t, hell, a**, and damn. There are also uses of Deity like “oh g-d.” Dune is quite violent and some scenes are scary, but gore is kept to a minimum. There are battle and war scenes where many soldiers die, and there are weapons and hand-to-hand combat. People are shot, burned, and stabbed. One scene is difficult to watch as a character is put through a test and in a lot of pain. You see a close up of a bloody hand and bloody knife. There is a “voice” that is super creepy. A character is naked and drugged in a chair in distress, a table is strategically placed to cover full nudity. A male character is seen shirtless. Two characters almost kiss.  PG-13 is an appropriate rating for Dune. If your kids are sensitive to war and death, then this may not be the film for them. However, if they love sci-fi, then add this to their list. Dune is just gloomy. There is some humor sprinkled in to help lighten the mood, but overall, it’s pretty depressing and not necessarily a pick-me-up. Is Dune too scary for kids? It is too intense for little ones. And the length of the movie could be an issue for them. Yes, there are intense and frightening scenes, but nothing the 12+ older crowd couldn’t handle if they’ve seen films in the same genre.  The visuals are stunning, and mixed with the soundtrack, Dune is simply beautiful. However, without this cast, I would have been asleep about 30 minutes into the film, and even with the incredible acting, I looked at my watch quite a bit. Chalamet was excellent as a brooding Paul, yet brought childlike emotions into his character, making him likeable. Conflicted between his responsibilities and loyalty to father and mother, he seems human and relatable. Ferguson plays a conflicted mother who would do anything to save her son, yet also has duties to the Bene Gesserit. And those women are brutal. Then there’s Isaac as Duke Leto who knows something is shady with the Emperor, yet he’s loyal and duty calls. Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen is a creepy Jabba the Hutt dude in human form. Star Wars similarities are abundant throughout Dune.  While I’m grateful the story wasn’t rushed, it was still too dang long for part one. The imagery is breathtaking, but that can only sustain you for so long. After 2 1/2 hours, I thought to myself, what happened? Did anything happen? This is definitely a build-up to part 2. But will it be enough to get non-fans on board for part two? The jury’s still out. Perhaps I lack the sophistication to appreciate Dune for what it really offers. I wasn’t quite satisfied, but I’d still watch part two. Because seriously, I want something to happen. "
"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL,"  After being delayed a whole year due to COVID-19, Dune is finally getting its time in the sun. Adapted from Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel of the same name, director Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the film alongside Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, brings the futuristic space odyssey to life in grand and detailed fashion. It’s no secret that Dune has been deemed too difficult to adapt to the big screen, but Villeneuve certainly does a decent job making sense of the world in which the characters dwell. Ambitious, occasionally thrilling, and visually striking, Dune is mostly set up, building out a heartless world that never truly feels complete.   In the year 10191, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is tasked by the emperor to travel to the desert planet Arrakis, where House Harkonnen (led by Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Vladimir) has had control of for decades. House Harkonnen was mining the planet’s spice, a hallucinogen that also powers space travel. The control over this valuable substance has left the Fremen, Arrakis’ natives, brutalized and mistreated. Meanwhile, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), Leto’s son, is having visions of Chani (Zendaya), a Fremeni woman, and a future that suggests he will become important to the Fremen. Paul is also caught between two worlds — succeeding his father as duke and training to use mind control and persuasion (called the ""voice"") taught by the Bene Gesserit, a religious and political group in which Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is a member. At the same time, plans of a coup brew beneath the surface.   Dune is visually captivating, the wide shots showcasing Arrakis in all its intensity and beauty. There is a sense of foreboding that permeates the film, elevated greatly by Greig Fraser’s stunning cinematography. Herbert’s sprawling world and the politics that make up its conflicts are easy to understand in the film, if certain aspects remain vague. Villeneuve, Roth, and Spaihts’ screenplay explains things well enough without condescending to its audience. Dune is certainly grand and epic in scale. The tensions between House Atreides and House Harkonnen are intensely felt, raising the stakes and underscoring the entirety of the story and the characters’ decisions. Hans Zimmer’s haunting score is all-encompassing and unnerving, though the sound design is often so loud that it's hard to hear the quiet dialogue. There is enough mystery and intrigue to keep one watching, and Villeneuve knows how to create a breathtaking world. However, it isn’t enough to keep the film afloat on these merits alone.   Spectacular visuals aside, Dune is emotionally empty and incomplete. Everything the film introduces is simply a set up for something to come later on, if ever. Establishing that this is part one when part two hasn't been confirmed makes it feel as though the story is being stalled. Dune, like so many other individual franchise films — including The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Star Wars — should still feel like it can stand on its own while still having enough to connect it to the larger storyline. However, Dune’s worldbuilding doesn't amount to a satisfying payoff and there is a distinct lack of emotion with everything that happens. Its thinly drawn characters speak as though the end is near, but there is little effort made to develop them beyond their importance to the plot. The central conflict is robbed of depth, as are the Fremen, who are more of an idea than fully realized people. Dune often feels hollow, relying on aesthetics and the potential of what this world could be rather than delving deeper into what it already is. Its spectacle undermines further exploration of its characters and its slow pacing lulls the story’s progress at times.   Chalamet’s portrayal of Paul is lacking in gusto. It’s often unclear how Paul is meant to feel about any of what’s happening and that makes it hard to connect to him in any way. Zendaya is barely in the movie at all and, worse, she has so few lines, appearing primarily in dream sequences. Her character is more of a bridge connecting part one to part two, which is a shame and a waste of her presence. Isaac plays Duke Leto with militaristic stoicism and duty, but it’s Ferguson and Jason Momoa (as Duke Idaho, a soldier for House Atreides) who are the standouts. Ferguson gently conveys Jessica’s fears and wariness, and Momoa portrays Duncan with a lot of joyful energy. The rest of the supporting cast, including Javier Bardem (Stilgar, a Fremen tribe leader), Chang Chen (Dr. Wellington Yueh), and Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Dr. Liet Kynes), are all great in their smaller roles.   Dune is wonderfully diverse, but it still erases Middle Eastern and North African peoples despite Herbert clearly drawing influences from the region (Villeneuve filmed parts of the film in Jordan and Abu Dhabi). The costumes, the music, and the story all borrow from MENA cultures, language (“Padishah” is Persian for king, “Muad'dib” is Arabic for teacher or one who is respected), and Islam, and yet no actors of MENA descent are featured. It seems counterproductive to the story that is being told, especially one that so heartily takes from the area (spice is, after all, a stand-in for oil).   The film is also bloated and there is perhaps too much information to establish. Largely delivered through exposition, it makes the first half of the film feel somewhat sluggish. Anyone waiting for Dune to build towards a big, effective, and satisfying ending might be disappointed. Is Dune thrilling to behold? Absolutely. The sheer magnitude of the film is admirable and ambitious. All that said, however, Dune is missing an emotional core, with all of its characters essentially pawns waiting for Villeneuve’s next move. Whether or not part two ever happens, part one is only worth watching for the visual elements, lacking in overall depth, heart, and sense of completion.   Dune will be released in theaters and on HBO Max on Thursday evening, October 21. The film is 155 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," In 1981, after more than a decade of script rewrites and staffing changes, David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) was hired to direct the epic movie. The large ensemble cast was well chosen but the budget landed just north of forty million dollars placing pressure on all those involved.  Sadly, the movie was a box office failure, only grossing thirty million which was a disappointment to both Lynch and Universal Pictures.  To date, Lynch describes the movie as his only failure and refuses to about it in detail. With all that stacked against them, Warner Bros. Pictures decided to reignite the book, and Dune (Part One) is opening in theaters tomorrow. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet; Call Me by Your Name) is the son of Duke Atreides (Oscar Isaac; Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi) who is charged with taking over the planet of Arrakis and oversee the ""spice"" mining.  The Harkonenns, the previous stewards of Arrakis, are angered and plot revenge on the House of Atreides. The Fremen - the dwellers on Arrakis - want all the emperor's nobles to leave their planet alone.  After the Harkonenns attack and kill Duke Atreides, Paul, and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson; The Greatest Showman) must fend for themselves against the Harkonenns, the Fremen, and the sandworms. Director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) does an incredible job of balancing out the numerous details of the novel and the pacing of the film at two hours and thirty-five minutes long the movie could have been boring and tedious, but Villeneuve offers visuals that will keep the viewer engrossed.  His visuals are outstanding from the lush green landscape of their home planet to the stark and unforgiving desert of Arrakis. The cast is a veritable who's who of Hollywood A-listers, including Chalamet, Ferguson, Isaac, Zendaya (Spider-man: No Way Home), Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (Avengers: Endgame).  While Chalamet and Zendaya are excellent as per usual, it is Isaacs whose performance stands out amongst a plethora of talented thespians. While there are other books that continue the story, Herbert's initial novel has been broken up into two films and even though I went into the showing with low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised and am eagerly looking forward to the sequel.  Even at one hundred and fifty minutes, the movie doesn't seem slow or too long until perhaps the last twenty minutes or so, which is a testament to Villeneuve's direction and editing skills. With a less than auspicious legacy, Warner Bros. took a risk by redoing Dune, and I am willing to bet their gamble will pay off.  I think, despite all the horror movies coming out in the next two weeks, I believe Dune will be a box office success paving the way for the sequel scheduled for release sometime in the next two years.  I, for one, will be anxiously waiting to see what comes next and I recommend anyone over the age of 13, regardless of if they are a fan of science fiction films or not, head to the theater in the next few weeks to see this epic saga on the big screen.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," 
As The Lord of the Rings is to literary fantasy, so Dune is to science fiction. Its impact was so massive that there was a before and an after, reshaping the genre across media. At the same time, they were both generally regarded as unfilmable, even in the wake of adaptations that missed the point.
 
Dune has proved to be a particularly treacherous sandbar, impossible for adaptors to truly traverse. David Lynch's film version was cursory, and, while pretty, never truly grasped Herbert's themes of power and manipulated destiny. Similarly, the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries was as arid and lifeless as Arrakis (as for Alejandro Jodorowsky's incomplete attempt, while nice for cineastes to discuss his script had little to do with the actual story).
 
Yet, just as Peter Jackson finally conjured up Tolkien's mythology, so Denis Villeneuve (who dared to tread on similar holy ground by making a Blade Runner sequel) embraces both the mysticism and court intrigue of Frank Herbert's vast space saga.
 
The story, convoluted as it is, is familiar to many: In a very, very far future, interstellar space travel is made possible by spice, a mysterious powder found only on the desert planet of Arrakis. The noble House Atreides has been given the planet by the unseen emperor, but it's a trap, as he unleashes the vile and brutal House Harkonnen to cut them (and their political influence) off at the throat. The wrinkle is the presence of young Paul Atreides (Chalamet), the unwilling center of a sinister plan to produce an almighty celestial messiah to be bent to the will of the Bene Gesserit religious order. But prophesies are convoluted, as Paul may also be Maud'dib, the savior of Arrakis' native Fremen.
 
Dune has influenced countless books and films (most overtly Star Wars), but it's hard to imagine that this version would have been greenlit without the success of Game of Thrones. At the same time, Villeneuve shows how much fealty George R. R. Martin owes the original, not least in the framing of the doomed Duke Leto Atreides, with Oscar Isaac evoking the same pathos as Ned Stark seeing the blades coming toward him but never able to avoid them. Meanwhile Chalamet embraces the callow youth of Paul, born of conspiracy and trying to navigate how his mother, Jessica (Ferguson), wove him into grand schemes, and what his visions of Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) mean.
 
If Villeneuve's grand and epic take evokes any earlier cinematic vision of Dune, it would be the first failed take, which would have seen director David Lean and writer Robert Bolt cross similar wastelands as they did in Lawrence of Arabia. Power and destiny, rapacious imperialism and ecological devastation, colonialism and Indigenous rights, all implicit and explicit in Herbert's work. If anything, Villeneuve and co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts plant the seeds of deeper complexities that Herbert didn't develop until much later in the six books he authored. This Paul rebels against the legacy that was set in motion centuries before he was born, a well-structured foreshadowing to future events (this being only part one of what has been discussed as a trilogy adapting the first novel and first sequel, Dune Messiah).
 
This inevitably means that Dune part one is an epic tragedy, and Villeneuve makes the fall of the House of Atreides both beautiful and inevitable. The characters that meet unjust ends due to machinations, and the pain etched on the faces of the survivors (most especially Ferguson, who wears each loss until she will either crack or strike back) adds heart. Yet Villeneuve also makes both the convoluted mythos and the intricate politicking accessible. At the same time, the war waged by the sinister Harkonnens (headed by SkarsgÃ¥rd channeling Apocalypse Now Brando) is where he may most invoke Lean, the mixture of high-tech bombardment and hand-to-hand combat harkening back to Lawrence's battle of Aqaba. It's that same mix of grandeur and folly, this time on a cosmic scale.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Sure, it’s loud and possibly confusing for those viewers who haven’t tapped into the 1965 text…. But this go round [for the screen], all cylinders are firing.” Ah, the wide-screen grandeur that is Dune! All that sand makes me relish the epic 70mm moments more than a half-century ago when I savored every second of David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia in its 222-minute glory. (Dune runs but 155 minutes, but this is just Part One; as the poster art proclaims, “It Begins.”) Yup, this might be the big one this year, ripe for awards and such, and a film that everyone should soak in at an IMAX theater rather than on a puny living room or, worse, computer, screen, as it also streams on HBO Max. This immensely entertaining adaptation of the Frank Herbert science fiction classic finally arrives a month after it began playing in foreign multiplexes (and a pandemic-delayed year when it was supposed to arrive). For those of you who just ventured back from the cinema for No Time to Die, please turn back there for a real broody, cerebral punch from this star-studded, emotionally driven, and very expensively looking journey to distant worlds from director Denis Villeneuve. The Canadian filmmaker’s Arrival was my favorite film of 2016, and his dystopian Blade Runner 2049 (2017) was a stunning sequel to Ridley Scott’s original. The majestic Dune experience takes him further into the pantheon of the great auteurs, including Lean. Firing on all professional guns, just as he did with the intimate Arrival, but now adding a constantly oversized spectacle to his repertoire, it’s hard to find any fault with this extravagant venture. Sure, it’s loud and possibly confusing for those viewers who haven’t tapped into the 1965 text that is considered one of the most impressive works in the genre. David Lynch tried to tackle the source material in 1984. He failed, leaving many critics and viewers wondering if the novel was even filmable. This go round, all cylinders are firing, with the technical side (profusely enabled by the many folks who worked with him on his more recent works) blending exquisitely with the screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Villeneuve and Oscar winner Eric Roth (Forrest Gump). I haven’t read the book since the early 1970s and the film succeeds just as well for folks who haven’t turned any of its 800 pages than for the many fans. If you’ve seen Avatar, there’s a similar theme of indigenous population exploitation on an alien world. Here the underdogs are the Fremen, tribal inhabitants of the oppressively hot and sand-covered planet Arrakis. Little seen in this film, but certainly set up for a big part in the second installment (which Warner Bros. has reportedly only just been greenlit), these blue-eyed humans live underground and have a reverence for the massive sandworms that roam about this barren world. The interplanetary empire has harvested Spice, a rare resource found there, and the the mining rights have been gifted to House Atreides of the planet Caladan during the film’s opening hour, and they set about travelling there with obedient haste. There are numerous factions being set in place, and duplicity is par for the course, yet the Atreides put their best foot forward as they arrive to restart the mining operation.  Locations in Hungary, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, and Norway offer stunning landscapes befitting of other worlds, enhanced by Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Patrice Vermette’s production design.” That’s enough of the story that the uninitiated viewer should need. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Ogle at Timothée Chalamet, as Paul, heir to the Atreides throne. His mysterious dreams foretell ominous events and perhaps his future as a possible savior for the oppressed. His strong-willed mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) counsels him constantly, while his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), appears to be one of the few honest rulers left in the universe. Chalamet is especially strong as the unsure youngster growing up too soon for his liking, but eventually channels all the added responsibilities tossed his way with great aplomb. Josh Brolin impresses as the Atreides’ head of security, while Jason Momoa adds a touch of levity as the great warrior Duncan Idaho. On the evil side there is the malevolent Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a physical cross between Jabba the Hutt and Marlon Brando’s Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. A nearly unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgård, behind massive layers of makeup, oozes bile to the darkest degree as he carries out a horrendous plan. His loathsome body has eerie floating capabilities, and it’s a tremendous performance among many in the film. Perhaps the weakest showing is from Zendaya, who portrays a fierce Fremen named Chani. Her screen presence is mostly limited to Paul’s visions, so I can’t blame her for just drifting by in slow motion. While some of the cast make unfortunate departures during the film, Chani’s rise to prominence as Paul’s concubine hopefully will let her acting legs get stretched more in the next film. Locations in Hungary, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, and Norway offer stunning landscapes befitting of other worlds, enhanced by Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Patrice Vermette’s production design. Visual and special effects, sound design, costumes, editing, and a rowdy humdinger of a score by Hans Zimmer all provide just what you expect from a spectacle like Dune. It’s sensational.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Many have dubbed Frank Herbert’s 1965 fantastical science fiction novel Dune as unfilmable, and David Lynch’s ill-fated adaptation of the novel in 1984 seemed to cement that theory and it turned out to be so outlandishly bonkers. Which is why it took the new master of intelligent sci-fi, French Canadian writer-director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) to dare take on one of the most complex texts in the history of the genre. Covering only the first half of the book, Dune follows the story of the son of a noble family entrusted with protecting the most valuable asset in the galaxy. Duke Leto Atreides (an earnest and likeable Oscar Isaac) accepts the stewardship of the dangerous desert planet Arrakis — think Sahara desert but with giant man-eating sandworms — a planet which is the only source of a drug capable of extending human life. Despite suspecting that the opportunity is a trap set by his enemies, Leto takes his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Fergusson) and young son and heir Paul (Timothée Chalamet) to Arrakis with him. The Duke takes control of the spice mining operation, which is made even more dangerous by the presence of giant sandworms, but as it turns out, these killer creatures aren’t the only danger. In its new incarnation, Dune does a great job of refusing to dumb down or simplify Herbert’s text; instead it allows us to get lost in this beautifully orchestrated space opera even when it feels impenetrable. Hans Zimmer’s score adds a degree of otherworldliness to Villeneuve’s gorgeously layered narrative, while Greig Fraser’s stunning cinematography dials up the air of mystery throughout. Those who have remained immune to Chalamet’s charms so far might finally have to admit defeat. The actor, half French on his father’s side, half Jewish American on this mother’s side here demonstrates yet again that he has more range than most actors his age. Elsewhere, the film only gives us a few glimpses of Zendaya’s character with the hope of more to come in the second part, which is to follow. Rebecca Ferguson delivers a truly stunning performances as Paul’s mother. Villeneuve has given us a complex and gorgeously layered adaptation that has succeeded in bringing this truly extraordinary text to the screen with style and determination. I loved every second of this visually stunning, beautifully acted and genuinely thrilling offering from one of the masters of modern sci-fi. Don’t be put off by that ‘unfilmable’ label, this version definitely does justice to the original and is a must-see on the big screen, not just for sci fi aficionados. Wes Anderson’s love letter to journalism may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it is one of his most moving, honest and hilariously on the nose films yet. Starring an army of Hollywood’s most recognisable faces, The French Dispatch is co-written by the famously unorthodox director in collaboration with Roman Coppola, Hugo Guiness and his Rushmore star Jason Schwartzman. The film is set in a fictional French city hilariously named Ennuie-Sur-Blasé, and brings to life a collection of stories published in a magazine set up by American expat Arthur Howitzer, Jr (Bill Murray).Timothée Chalamet stars in a segment about the events of May 1968 alongside Frances McDormand and French Algerian actress Lyna Khoudri. Another memorable segment features a truly stunning performance by Jeffrey Wright playing a fictitious version of legendary writer James Baldwin who moved to France in the hope of pursuing a writing career away from the stifling chuckles of American institutional racism. Some aspects of the film might feel a little too know-it-all, but this isn’t a production for those who are newcomers to Anderson’s brand of comically stylised and overblown characters. It is a joy to watch an array of brilliant actors at the top of their game and a welcome antidote to the worthy dramas put out at this time of the year in the hope of making the award season’s lists. With many French inside jokes and groan inducing jeu de mots, Anderson has managed to give us not only a love letter to journalism, but also a love letter to French culture, even if his depiction of Frenchness often relies — one suspects deliberately — on hilariously outdated stereotypes."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," So with the David Lynch and John Harrison’s SyFy mini-series fresh in my head, where does Denis Villeneuve’s version of Dune stand? Real quick — the galaxy is in a cold war of sorts over the control of The Spice, whose properties can expand one’s mind and is also necessary for interstellar navigation… I think. As the saying goes, “he who controls The Spice controls the universe.” The story is about the power struggle over control over the mining and production of The Spice on the desert planet Arrakis. The Spice has been under the stewardship of the House of Harkonnen for the past several decades. However, in a bid to shake up planetary politics, the emperor of the “Spacing Guild” has replaced stewardship of Arrakis to the House of Atreides, which pretty much pisses off the Harkonnens. Though loyal to the emperor, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) accepts his new responsibilities with great reluctance and moves his son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and his concubine/wife, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to Arrakis. Leto is protected by his head guard, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin). In addition, soldier Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) is sent as an advanced scout to gain intel about the planet’s native inhabitants, known as the Fremen. Unfortunately, Leto is already off to a bad start as the Harkonnen’s have sabotaged much of the equipment and production facilities putting Leto behind in spice production. The sprawling narrative of Dune then shows Lady Jessica’s “religious” order known as the Bene Gesserit and how she’s been teaching Paul the ways of the order. For example, she is currently teaching Paul to use his “voice” to control the actions of others. A by-product of his spiritual training, Paul is having dreams about the future, including the fate of his good buddy/mentor, Duncan Idaho, and visions of a mysterious, attractive Fremen (Zendaya). But not all is as it seems, as the emperor put the House of Atreides on Arrakis as a ploy for Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista), to stage a sneak attack on Atreides, effectively obliterating the entire house. However, as a promise to Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), only Lady Jessica and Paul are allowed to escape the slaughter. The second half of the film follows Jessica and Paul as they attempt to meet the Fremen with the help of Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster). The Harkonnens hunt our heroes, and we glimpse the secrets of the Fremen and an even bigger mystery of Arrakis itself. Wow, that wasn’t quick. As we head into the upcoming release of Denis Villeneuve's version of Frank Herbert's Dune, I will be reviewing the previous adaptations of the novel.... Arguably, Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune is the most anticipated film to come out of the post-pandemic era… or at least, most anticipated by a...

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE,Director Denis Villeneuve's vision is evident in every frame.
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," My name is Denis Villeneuve and I’m the director of Dune. “Don’t stand with your back to the door!” This scene needed to serve four purposes. First, to establish the nature of the relationship between Paul Atreides and Gurney Halleck. Two, to give more insight about the context in which the Atreides will move to a new planet named Arrakis. Three, to induce the idea that Paul Atreides has been training for combat, but has never really experienced real violence. And four, to introduce the concept of the Holtzman Shields, and how they change the essence of combat. An Holtzman Shield is a technology that protects individuals or vehicles from any fast objects. Therefore, bullets or rockets are obsolete. So it means that man to man combat came back to sword fighting. The choreography between Timothée Chalamet, who plays Paul, and Josh Brolin, who plays Gurney Halleck, illustrate that each opponent is trying to distract his adversary by doing very fast moves in order to create an opportunity to insert slowly a blade inside the opponent’s shield. “Guess I’m not in the mood today.” “Mood?” “Mm.” “What’s mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now fight!” That choreography was designed by Roger Yuan. He developed the Atreides fighting style borrowing from a martial art technique developed in the ‘50s. This technique was called balintawak eskrima. It’s a style that involves blocking the opponent’s attack with both a weapon and the free hand. “I have you.” “Aye. But look down, my Lord. You’d have joined me in death. I see you found the mood.” Cinematographer Greig Fraser and I shot the fight like we will shoot a dance performance. The goal was to embrace the complexity of the movements with objective camera angles. We tried to make sure that the audience will understand the nature of this new way of fighting. “You don’t really understand the grave nature of what’s happening to us.” But more importantly, I wanted to feel that Josh Brolin’s character was caring about Paul like if he was his own son. “Can you imagine the wealth? In your eyes— I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkonnens before. I have. They’re not human. They’re brutal! You have to be ready.” In a galaxy far, far away, a young man in a sea of sand faces a foreboding destiny. The threat of war hangs in the air. At the brink of a crisis, he navigates a feudalistic world with an evil emperor, noble houses and subjugated peoples, a tale right out of mythology and right at home in George Lucas’s brainpan. But this is “Dune,” baby, Frank Herbert’s science-fiction opus, which is making another run at global box-office domination even as it heads toward controversy about what it and its messianic protagonist signify. The movie is a herculean endeavor from the director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”), a starry, sumptuous take on the novel’s first half. Published in 1965, Herbert’s book is a beautiful behemoth (my copy runs almost 900 pages) crowded with rulers and rebels, witches and warriors. Herbert had a lot to say — about religion, ecology, the fate of humanity — and drew from an astonishment of sources, from Greek mythology to Indigenous cultures. Inspired by government efforts to keep sand dunes at bay, he dreamed up a desert planet where water was the new petroleum. The result is a future-shock epic that reads like a cautionary tale for our environmentally ravaged world. Villeneuve likes to work on a large scale, but has a miniaturist’s attention to fine-grained detail, which fits for a story as equally sweeping and intricate as “Dune.” Like the novel, the movie is set thousands of years in the future and centers on Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the scion of a noble family. With his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul is about to depart for his new home on a desert planet called Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune. The Duke, on orders from the Emperor, is to take charge of the planet, which is home to monstrous sandworms, enigmatic Bedouin-like inhabitants and an addictive, highly valuable resource called spice. Much ensues. There are complicated intrigues along with sword fights, heroic deaths and many inserts of a mystery woman (Zendaya) throwing come-hither glances at the camera, a Malickian vision in flowing robes and liquid slow motion. She’s one piece of the multifaceted puzzle of Paul’s destiny, as is a mystical sisterhood (led by Charlotte Rampling in severe mistress mode) of psychic power brokers who share a collective consciousness. They’re playing the long game while the story’s most flamboyant villain, the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), schemes and slays, floating above terrified minions and enemies like a Macy’s Thanksgiving Day balloon devised by Clive Barker.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," From the whimsical musings of Wes Anderson (“The French Dispatch”) to the sci-fi wonderlands of Denis Villeneuve (“Dune”), this week’s releases whisk us off to evocative destinations. Also arriving in theaters is one for the family, the animated comedy “Ron’s Gone Wrong.” Should you prefer nesting at home for a Netflix and chill night with the fam, the nine-part animated series “Maya and the Three” will delight young and old alike. East Bay treasure Rita Moreno even chimes in for it. In its stirring first moments, it becomes obvious that “Star Wars,” “Harry Potter,” even “The Matrix” owe a debt to Herbert. The rite of passage story finds teenager Paul (Timothee Chalamet, ideally cast) realizing he’s destined for great things but also that he’ll the carry the weight of the universe on his shoulders as leaders war over a precious resource on a harsh and arid planet where large earthworms roam free. Much of “Dune’s” time is dedicated to the cunning political chess moves, as Paul’s parents, his caring dad Leo (Oscar Isaac) and gifted mom Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) discover they have targets on their backs. A deplorable Baron Vladimir  Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard, in hissable mode) spits out the orders for control, but his strings are being pulled by an off-camera Emperor. There are layers upon layers of intrigue to peel back and “Dunes” does require your devoted attention. It helps if you’ve read the books, but it’s not essential given how screenwriters Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth and Villeneuve making the dense story more accessible. But a word before you enter the world Herbert and Villeneuve’s team built: This is but the first part in a projected series, and it leaves you craving for more near the end when Chani (Oakland native Zendaya) first meets Paul. On the other hand, it’s nice to think there’s more wonder and magic, along with intelligent, heartfelt storytelling, to come in the years ahead. Details: 4 stars out of 4; in theaters and streaming on HBO Max Oct. 22 (but see it in a theater.) “Maya and the Three”: With its all-star voice cast — Zoe Saldana, Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna, Stephanie Beatriz and Rita Moreno to name but a few — high-caliber animation and generous dips into Aztec, Maya and Inca mythology, Netflix’s nine-part YA series is knockout entertainment that your family will want to share together. Creator/director/executive producer Jorge R. Gutierrez (2014’s “The Book of Life”)  chronicles the girl-power adventures of 15-year-old Maya, a warrior princess with an attitude that matches her wits and courage. The gods of the underworld come calling for her, demanding that she pay off a family debt and that sets Maya off on a journey to meet a vast array of gods. Each episode is roughly 30 minutes and they zip right by. Details: 3½ stars; available Oct. 22 on Netflix. “Fever Dream”: Moody, atmospheric and sensual, Peruvian filmmaker Claudia Llosa’s haunting psychological thriller methodically depicts a taut bond that develops between two mothers who connect in a rural small town in Argentina. Horror connoisseurs might be disappointed about the deliberate pace and reliance on erotic and psychological tension to supply the thrills, but this sneaky and surreal genre film isn’t interested in textbook horror tactics. Novelist Samanta Schweblin co-wrote the screenplay, based on her book, with Llosa. Details: 3 stars; available on Netflix. “Night Teeth”: A movie about model-like vampires who sink their teeth into the L.A. nightclub scene sounds like a bloody good time. While this Netflix Halloween entry from director Adam Randall has its campy moments, it’s just too long for its own good and would have been sharper if it shed 15 minutes or so. The flimsy plot finds gawky Benny (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) subbing for his older brother Jay (Raul Castillo) as the driver for fanged party types Blair (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (scene-stealer Lucy Fry), who are out for a night of targeted feeding. Randall energizes it, but you wish the screenplay would have tapped the blooming romance between Benny and Zoe earlier rather than later since Lendeborg and Fry make an adorable meet-cute couple. Details: 2½ stars; available on Netflix. “Needle in a Timestack”: The Oscar-winning screenwriter of “12 Years a Slave” stumbles badly as writer and director of this limp time-traveling romance about an ex (Orlando Bloom) trying to split up two lovebirds Nick and Janine (Leslie Odom Jr. and Cynthia Erivo) by futzing with the past. The A-list cast gives this their all, but there’s no sense of wonder, magic or passion to be found since John Ridley devotes more time on annoying scenes in which a photographer (Erivo) and businessman (Odom Jr.) are disagreeing. We are supposed to feel that they are soulmates, but really there’s no there there. Freida Pinto pops in as a possible love interest, but no one can make this misfire flicker to life. Details: 2 stars, available on Vudu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and Google Play. “A Bay of Blood”: With “Halloween Kills” racking up some bloody good box office last week, it’s time to pay respects to one of the most influential horror films of all tine — the one that partly inspired Michael Myers. Italian horror filmmaker Mario Bava’s 1971 gory and cheap release remains an effective example of the giallo genre. It uses a classic setup Agatha Christie often deployed: the suspicious death of a rich woman in a remote region and the greed and motivations of family members. Bava reportedly rushed to get this one made so he could pay off his taxes. Little did he know that he would usher in the era of the “slasher” film. All of the genre staples are present here — including a scene echoed in the original “Friday the 13th” that involved the demise of Kevin Bacon’s character, and POV shots from the killer. It’s hardly woke, though. So just be ready. Details: 3 stars; available on Shudder. “Found”: Three newfound cousins born in China and raised by three different American suburban families embark on a journey to their homeland to learn about their pasts in Amanda Lipitz’s absorbing, moving documentary. It will carry particular resonance with adoptees and their families. Details: 3 stars; available on Netflix."
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," 
It's tempting to give Denis Villeneuve's Dune (or Dune: Part One, as it's designated in the opening titles) a grade of ""incomplete,"" since it deliberately adapts only about half of Frank Herbert's 1965 classic sci-fi novel. Pending Dune's performance at the box office and on HBO Max, there may be a Dune: Part Two, which may or may not successfully tackle the second half of the novel. For now, though, Dune can only be judged on its own merits, up to and including its surprisingly satisfying open-ended conclusion.
 
As a standalone film, Dune is still a monumental achievement, an ambitious and enveloping sci-fi blockbuster that does justice to Herbert's work and marks another step forward from Villeneuve's previous powerful sci-fi adaptations Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Like those films, Dune is chilly and cerebral and may frustrate anyone expecting a modern Star Wars-style action movie. There aren't a lot of big action set pieces, and those battle sequences are never the movie's primary focus. Dune is a story about clashes between aristocratic dynasties and the devastating legacy of colonialism. The explosions are always secondary.
 
Set in the far future mainly on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune chronicles the ascension of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and heir to House Atreides, one of the galaxy's most powerful families. House Atreides has been awarded stewardship of Arrakis, where they are to oversee the production of the substance known as spice, which is both the power source for interstellar travel and a hallucinogenic drug that extends human lifespans and expands consciousness.
 
This great honor is mostly a trap, though, an excuse for the galaxy's emperor to pit House Atreides against rival House Harkonnen, so that the emperor can eliminate potential rivals to his throne. Both Duke Leto and his son are more interested in forging an alliance with Arrakis' mysterious natives, the Fremen, who may possess unknown powers thanks to their long-term exposure to spice.
 
It's a lot of plot to digest, and that's without even mentioning the ancient religious order pledged by Paul's mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul's prophetic dreams and his potential to become your standard-issue sci-fi Chosen One, or, of course, those giant sandworms. In 1984, David Lynch attempted to cram Herbert's entire novel and all its world-building into a single feature film, and the result was an incomprehensible fever dream. Villeneuve and his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth fare much better, and despite the massive amounts of exposition and the complex political, scientific and religious machinations, Dune is almost never difficult to follow.
 
But it's also aloof and clinical, with characters who often seem more like chess pieces than fully realized people, despite the strong, nuanced performances. In many ways, Paul is led by his emotions, whether his devotion to his parents or his visions of the beautiful Fremen named Chani (Zendaya), but his every action still carries the weight of destiny. Dune can come off like an adaptation of a history textbook from an alien civilization, which makes it fascinating but also slightly unreachable.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," “Dune,” the latest cinematic take on the Frank Herbert 1965 classic, now playing in theatres, is part one of the planned two-part series. So be forewarned, the two-and-a-half-hour movie doesn’t wrap things up with a tidy bow. For some, the film’s last line, “This is only the beginning,” will be a promise of more interesting movies ahead, for others, who prefer tighter storytelling and a clear-cut finale, it may come off as a threat. Director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve benefits from the parceled-out storytelling. Where David Lynch’s ill-fated 1984 version attempted to cover the complexity of the entire book, Villeneuve is given the time for world building, to explain the various and complex spiritual sci-fi elements that make up the story. Set 8,000 years in the future, the story focusses on Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of an aristocratic family and possibly, just maybe, a prophet. His father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), has been bestowed stewardship of Arrakis, the desert planet also known as Dune. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is part of the Bene Gesserit, a social, religious, and political alliance who can magically control enemies by modulating their vocal tones. Their new domain, Arrakis, is a desolate, almost inhabitable place that is home to the Fremen, a group of people who have lived on the planet for thousands of years. It is also the universe’s only source of mélange, also known as “spice.” It’s a drug with the power to extend human life, facilitate superhuman planes of thought and can even make faster-than-light travel possible. It is the most valuable commodity in the universe and those who control it, control everything. When Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård doing his best impression of Marlon Brando in “Apocalypse Now”), the former steward of Arrakis, double crosses the Atreides clan, Paul and his mother are left in the desert to die. If they are to survive it will be with the help of the Fremen—including Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem)—who call Paul “The Chosen One” and believe he has the power to bring peace to their world. Villeneuve lays out the information methodically, allowing the various story points and character motivations to seep into the fabric of the film and make an impact before moving on. There’s a lot to get through, but it doesn’t feel onerous like so many origin stories do. Also effective are the large scale, and I mean large as in you need three or four eyes to take it all in, action scenes. The entire movie is big. So big it makes even the giant humans Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista, who play swordmaster Duncan Idaho and warrior Glossu Rabban respectively, look puny by comparison. As for the action, Villeneuve pulls out all the stops, staging world ending battles with elegance. Often major battle sequences can be muddled, a blur of colours and glints of metal, but Villeneuve delivers clear cut, tense sequences with a clarity that is unusual for modern action. “Dune” is big and beautiful, with plentiful action and a really charismatic performance from Momoa. It is unquestionably well made, with thought provoking themes of exploitation of Indigenous peoples, environmentalism and colonialism. Partially because it’s an epic with no payoff. The cliffhanger nature of the story is frustrating after a two-and-a-half-hour wait. As good audience members we allow ourselves to be caught up in the world, humourless and bleak as it often is, to get to know the characters and then what? Wait for two years for the next movie? Apparently so, and the ending feels abrupt. Nonetheless, “Dune” is formidable. It’s a grim, immersive movie that doesn’t shy away from the darkness that propels the story or the high-mindedness of the ideas contained within. Eventually, when we have a part two, it will feel like one piece, much like “The Lord of the Rings” franchise, but right now, despite its scope, it feels incomplete.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE,Dune is a majestic and grim sci-fi epic.
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," At the very least, Denis Villeneuve’s ambitiously immersive adaptation of author Frank Herbert’s Dune is upfront that it is only presenting roughly half of the story. The title card proudly — some would say defiantly — reads “Dune Part One,” and even though there is no guarantee there will be a second half, that doesn’t appear to have dissuaded the Oscar-nominated (Arrival) director from playing coy about his intentions. I have no idea if Warner Bros. will ultimately feel compelled to foot the bill for a sequel. In this new age of theatrical and streaming hybrid releases born in large part courtesy of a global pandemic, it’s impossible to know what the benchmark for success will be where it comes to a massive studio blockbuster release such as this. Suffice it to say, whether or not there will ever be a Dune Part Two, your guess is as good as mine. But back to this half of the story. Villeneuve and his fellow screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) have attempted to streamline and flesh out Herbert’s prose as best they can. Yet as accessible as their script may be, there isn’t much of an emotional heartbeat thundering in this gigantic visual spectacle’s chest. With precious few exceptions, these were not characters I cared about, making whether they heroically persevered or met a tragically bitter end inconsequential as far as the bigger picture was concerned. There’s far too much plot to try and spell it all out in a simple synopsis. Keeping things basic, thousands of years in the future, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is ordered by the emperor to take over the rulership of the desert planet Arrakis and Spice mining operations from the ruthless Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of Duke Leto and his lovely concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), has been dreaming about Arrakis and its indigenous population, the Fremen. Not to travel too far into the weeds, Duke Leto is betrayed, the Baron returns to rule Arrakis, Paul’s dreams may not be fictional and the Fremen are more than willing to take up arms against the Harkonnens, who have attempted — and mostly failed — to eradicate them for generations. There’s much more to it, of course, including secrets held close to the vest by Lady Jessica concerning her son, but going into them all would take more words than a single review will allow. Just know that something is happening every second of the film’s 155-minute running time, and to Villeneuve’s credit, he keeps a solid handle on all of it. I never felt lost or overburdened by the convoluted coming and goings of all the various characters, and even if they’re only around for a scene or two, it’s still fairly easy to know who is who and what side of the conflict they are going to be fighting on. In the same breath, there’s so much work being done to ensure that all of this nonsense makes consistent sense that it’s pity that precious few of the story’s inhabitants are worth the effort of getting to know. Chalamet tries to make Paul interesting, but there’s only so much he can do during this half of Herbert’s tale. Paul is only on the cusp of coming into his own and discovering the strength to embrace his destiny. As such, he’s more symbol than person, his inner struggles falling flat in ways that grow increasingly tiresome as events build to their inevitable cliffhanger conclusion. Other characters portrayed by the likes of Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling, David Dastmalchian, Zendaya, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Dave Bautista and Chen Chang come and go, some more important or more interesting than others, but all weighing heavily on the outcome. Only Momoa — who is sensational, and delivers possibly my favorite performance in the film — and Rampling make a memorable imprint. They both leap off the screen, and it’s almost a pity they do not get a great deal more screen time. There is one human element that Villeneuve gets perfect, and that’s the relationship between Duke Leto and Lady Jessica. Isaac and Ferguson are sublime. The pair disappear into one another’s arms so completely, so effortlessly, that the heartbreak generated when they are forced apart is entirely genuine. The actors craft multidimensional portraits of sacrifice, courage, valor and togetherness that are close to remarkable. Ferguson is particularly luminous in ways that defy easy description. As to the technical merits of this production, those are beyond reproach. From Hans Zimmer’s (The Dark Knight) score to Patrice Vermette’s (Sicario) production design, from Jacqueline West’s (The Revenant) costumes to Greig Fraser’s (Zero Dark Thirty) cinematography, this is one of the more exquisitely realized science-fiction epics I’ve seen in ages. Herbert’s world comes alive in ways that boggle the mind and the senses, as Villeneuve showcases one eye-popping delight after another with supremely confident bravado. As messy and as unfocused as it may be, I admit I admire the wildly cavalier swings of David Lynch’s 1984 version of Herbert’s source material. There’s something magically madcap about it that will always garner the film a comfortable place in my heart. Does it work? No, not really, but it has a gonzo attitude I responded to as an impressionable kid and am still partial to now. Not that I’m comparing Lynch’s attempt to bring the book to the screen with Villeneuve’s. They’re very different creatures, and it’s clear that Warner Bros has given the latter far more freedom to realize his vision than Universal ever gave the former almost four decades ago. But I do bring up my feelings for that previous feature because, at least in that instance, I was (and still am) able to analyze a finished feature. That’s simply not the case here. Will my opinion on this incarnation of Dune change if Villeneuve is granted the budget to make the second chapter? That’s possible, as all the building blocks are in place to see Paul’s journey come to a satisfying end. But I can only judge what exists now, not what might at some unknown point in the (hopefully) near future. This Dune, for all its technical virtuosity, is stranded in an emotionally barren desert, and for all that is extraordinary about this production, that’s one sundrenched obstacle I’m not so certain I have the willingness to try and overcome.

"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," I listened to Chloé Zhao. The Nomadland and Eternals director and Academy Award winner has been vocal about the need to watch Dune on the big screen. The film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel opens simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max this Friday, October 22. Dune’s director, the Quebecois Denis Villeneuve (Arrival), has also strongly advocated for the cinema consumption of his film. “Dune is by far the best movie I’ve ever made. My team and I devoted more than three years of our lives to make it a unique big screen experience. Our movie’s image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters,” the filmmaker wrote in an essay published after he found out the movie would be available on streaming the same day it opened in theaters. I experienced Dune at a Dolby Atmos press screening where all those meticulously designed images and sounds stood out — to the point where my seat literally vibrated every time a ship took flight or there was a sandstorm taking place in the movie — and I’d say this is one of those cinematic events you may want to enjoy on the biggest screen possible. But I would also understand if you decide to just stay in and watch it at home. Let me also warn you. This is Dune: Part One. Villeneuve approached this epic endeavor as a two-movie adaptation. He co-wrote this first film with Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (A Star Is Born); all three screenwriters had read Dune as teenagers and were influenced from a young age by the coming-of-age story. Dune: Part Two hasn’t been greenlit yet. Its fate depends on how well Part One performs, but Villeneuve has said he’d be ready to start filming in 2022. I’m just telling you this in case you’re one of those viewers who don’t like inconclusive endings and unfinished narratives. But even if it lacks closure, the movie is a possible Oscar contender.  There’s one story that finds closure by Dune: Part One’s ending though. The one relating the coming of age and personal growth of our hero: Paul Atreides. He’s played with juvenile conviction and even looks by Gen Z icon Timothée Chalamet, who looks much younger than the 23 year old he actually was during production. By the movie’s closing credits, he’s gone from boy to young man. Set thousands of years into the future, Paul is the heir to the noble House Atreides on his father’s side and to the power of the Bene Gesserit, women able to influence someone’s actions through their Voice, on his mother’s side. Dad is Duke Leto Atreides, played by Oscar Isaac. Mom is Lady Jessica Atreides, played by Rebecca Ferguson. And I’ll admit to having spent at least half of the movie wondering whether Chalamet makes for a credible offspring of Isaac and Ferguson. I still haven’t reached a conclusion. The other half, I was trying to pay attention and follow all the initial exposition the movie packs to describe Dune’s universe to the uninitiated. (Herbert’s book has been collecting dust on my nightstand for months, and I had every intention of reading it before watching the movie. But I never did.) I don’t know how many inaccuracies the fans of the original material may find in Villeneuve’s adaptation, but this Dune newbie found the plot surprisingly easy to follow and the movie engaging, even if it lasts two hours and 35 minutes. The epic scale of Dune — and its character development — make allowances for the film’s length.  As part of the galactic Emperor’s request, the Atreides leave their home planet of Caladan and head to the desertic Arrakis. Their orders are to keep harvesting the Spice, the most valuable substance in the universe for its hallucinogenic qualities but also because it allows space travel. Arrakis is inhabited by the native Fremen, a tough civilization of blue-eyed desert dwellers who’ve perfected the art of moisture conservation. Javier Bardem plays the Fremen leader, Stilgar. His digital blue eyes brought memories of Robert De Niro in The Irishman the first time I saw him on screen. I soon became accustomed to it. Even though the movie is busting with CGI, Dune boasts the most crafty and quasi-naturalistic CGI money and technology can buy right now. Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin and Sharon Duncan-Brewster round out a luxurious cast that also includes the other Gen Z icon, Zendaya. She plays Chani, a fierce Fremen and someone Paul has been seeing in his sort-of-premonitory dreams. It doesn’t get much cooler than Zendaya and Chalamet. Look at the two of them at the London premiere of Dune. They have great chemistry in the movie. Just don’t expect to see much of her in Dune. Zendaya is expected to have a bigger role in Part Two, where she’d play the female protagonist. Dune is Paul’s story, his hero’s journey. He’s a boy conflicted about his destiny. He even asks his father if he’ll be the right heir for House Atreides. Leto shares some of the wise lessons his own father imparted to him: “A great man doesn’t seek to lead. He’s asked to and he answers,” he tells Paul. I would have preferred to hear something like “A great person doesn’t seek to lead. They’re asked to and they answer.” But then I remembered this is based on a 1965 novel. I wouldn’t have minded more of a 21st-century touch. Jessica is teaching Paul the ways of the warrior priestesses Bene Gesserit. Their Reverend Mother, played by Charlotte Rampling, feels it’s a waste Paul was graced with the Voice. He’s a male after all. Paul also spends a good deal of time training, fighting, learning. He’d rather be brooding. The movie takes its time to establish Paul as a regular boy. There’s a sequence of him in Caladan where he’s watching the sunset among the mist, the planet sketched in muted blues, greens and greys. He’s on a rocky beach, the water is choppy and he wears a long black coat. The image reminded me of the 19th-century painting The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, the quintessential representation of Romanticism. Paul is the ultimate Romantic, hence the ultimate teenager.  That very human tale is enhanced by beautiful imagery throughout. The coldness of Caladan contrasts with the heat of Arrakis; the film shot on location in Jordan and Abu Dhabi. The desert planet is painted in warm colors and heightened by the cinematography of Greig Fraser. He’s directed episodes of The Mandalorian and you’ll recognize his taste for the beauty of sand. Production designer Patrice Vermette and costume designer Jacqueline Quest dress these very distinct worlds and their people with artistry and care. Some buildings and the home of the Atreides in Caladan reminded me of Blade Runner‘s Frank Lloyd Wright influence. Then again, Villeneuve also directed Blade Runner 2049 and is familiar with that universe. Every costume seemed to intensify how a character was feeling but also the task they had at hand. I found particularly comfortable-looking and chic the suits Fremen wear when on the surface of their planet. They’re meant to conserve all the body’s hydration. “Do not run. You will only waste your body’s water,” Bardem’s character warns about how to proceed on his native planet. And the line reminded me of the ecological message that’s at the core of the novel. I felt the movie didn’t have time to properly make the argument for conservation. I hope Dune: Part Two does. "
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE,"A bold spectacle, the likes of which we seldom see on the big screen anymore, made by one of the few tentpole directors that knows how to fill every inch of the frame with awe-inspiring imagery. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Oct 21, 2021",POSITIVE," Feature adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. Denis Villeneuve has made no small plans where his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s “Dune” is concerned. You’d be hard pressed to find a film with such an epic scope both visually and narratively as the director rises to the challenge of realizing this sprawling story. Politics, religion, ecology and social mores all play a part in this futuristic tale that Warner Brothers has bet big on – to the tune of $165 million and many more for advertising – yet is seemingly cutting their feet out from under themselves by premiering it on HBO Max the same day it premieres in theaters. Employing this strategy, it’s questionable as to whether the film will make enough money to justify Villeneuve completing the story – yes, this is just the first part of the novel! But enough about what might or might not be.  Let’s talk about what Villeneuve has given us now. It’s pretty spectacular; from the very first moment, there’s an epic feel to the film as the director hits the ground running not by simply presenting sweeping vistas, mammoth starships and towering structures but by jumping in headfirst with setting up the interconnecting worlds, conflicting societies and political machinations at play.  It’s a expansive tale that suffers no fools or those with a short attention span, though credit the director and his co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts for streamlining Herbert’s, at times, needlessly convoluted storytelling. The regal Atreides family has been charged with governing Arrakis, a desert planet that contains Spice, the most valuable resource in the universe. A powerful hallucinogen, it makes interstellar space travel possible, which is vital for trade. The bottom line is, whomever controls this substance, holds sway over everything. Court intrigue is prevalent as the natives of Arrakis – the Freman – do not trust their new leader Duke Leto (Oscar Issac), though they see something in his son Paul (Timothee Chalamet), suspecting he may be the messiah they’ve been waiting for generations to appear. Complicating matters are the Harkonnens who are resentful for having been replaced by the Atreides, their leader, Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgard) plotting his revenge. Then, there’s the Bene Gesserit, a group of cosmic witches who are plotting their own power grab through a complex breeding program they think will produce a being powerful enough to take control. Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a part of this cabal though she’s defied the order by bearing a son instead of a daughter to House Atreides. So many modern movies simply rest on their visuals, the narrative an afterthought. “Dune’s” story is just as ambitious as its grand painterly graphics, it’s characters complex and fascinating as are the relationships they find themselves in. Familial ties are tested, friendships, particularly those Paul has with his father’s trusted advisor Gurney (Josh Brolin) and expert warrior Duncan (Jasom Mamoa), become stronger and a love affair between our hero and the Freman, Chani (Zendaya) though preordained, carries huge risks. It’s a complex, challenging tapestry that proves invigorating as each new narrative layer and surprise reveals fascinating complications, none of which are easily solved, each adding more intrigue which draws us deeper into the story. This is grand filmmaking of the highest order and while it may lag at times, there’s no denying the spell Villeneuve and his game cast and crew cast over the audience.  “Dune” is an immersive experience that succeeds in sweeping us away in the way only an epic on the big screen can. Do yourself a favor – go to the theater, grab a big bucket of popcorn and prepare to be wowed."
"Oct 21, 2021",NEUTRAL," Author Frank Herbert published the first book in his long-running “Dune” saga in 1965. Filmmaker David Lynch directed an adaptation of it in 1984. Then, in 2000, director John Harrison put out a three-part miniseries for the Sci-Fi Channel. There have been other versions and spinoffs since then (there are so many books, after all), but perhaps the most interesting of them all is the one that never was. That would be what cineaste Alejandro Jodorowsky failed to see to completion in the 1970s (for lots of reasons), the chronicle of which is masterfully told in Frank Pavich’s 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune. Now comes Denis Villeneuve’s turn. Dividing the novel into two parts (it was, in fact, originally published as such) and presenting just the first half in a 155-minute space epic, Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) does his best to craft a rousing tale of action and adventure wrapped up in the mystical tale of a messiah slowly rising. The result is a feast for the visual senses, but so dense in structure that it’s hard to swallow. It is almost forty years since I read Dune (the only book in the series that I have read), and I had forgotten how it is the ultimate white-savior narrative. A fellow film critic reminded me, post-screening, that Herbert took his inspiration from the history of British adventurer T.E. Lawrence in the Arab world. Ah, yes, that guy, who led revolts against the Turks of the fading Ottoman Empire in the 1910s. David Lean gave Lawrence his own great cinematic treatment in the 1962 Lawrence of Arabia. Here, he is embodied by one Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, Little Women) of the House of Atreides, who in the year 10191 (of whatever era) is brought by his family from his ocean-filled world of Caladan to the desert planet of Arrakis, to which they are posted by the ruler of their galactic federation. There, they are supposed to mine an element called “spice,” which is both a sacred hallucinogen to the locals (and turns their eyes blue) and an invaluable navigational aid to everyone off-world. Sounds like a wonderful deal for the Atreides folks, except that it soon becomes clear that the politics of it are fraught with danger. Paul has been brought up by his priestess mother, Lady Jessica (of the Bene Gesserit)—played by Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep)—to use the power of “the voice” to control others. He’s not quite at the peak of his talents yet, but already has some ability. Jessica was supposed to only have female children, but went against the rules of her order to give a male heir to her lord, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, Life Itself). She has long had hopes that Paul would fulfill a prophecy of a messiah-like figure known as the Kwisatz Haderach, though the head of the Bene Gesserit (Charlotte Rampling, 45 Years) is not happy and puts Paul through a painful ordeal. That is nothing compared to what is about to happen once everyone arrives on Arrakis. There, the indigenous Fremen people have a prophecy of their own messiah, the Muad’Dib, which Paul also, strangely, resembles. He is fated for some kind of glory, this one. Before Paul’s destiny can come even close to being fulfilled, tragedy strikes in the form of the rival house of Harkonnen, led by Baron Vladimir, a villain delivered in a delightfully hammy performance by the ever-watchable Stellan Skarsgård (Hope). Before long, Paul and his mother find themselves in the desert, trying mightily to avoid both the massive sandworms that are attracted to any rhythmic sounds (such as footsteps) and the Fremen, to whom they appear as invaders. Despite this latter fear, Paul has nearly constant dreams of one of them, a blue-eyed young woman named Chani (Zendaya, Malcolm & Marie). He is mysteriously drawn ever deeper into the dunes, where his future awaits. All of this is rendered in gorgeous detail, the tactile production design creating a science-fiction landscape as seemingly real as it is fantastical. And even if the spaceships look a bit like recycled images from Villeneuve’s own 2016 Arrival, they still impress. The movie has an equally accomplished cast. Beyond those already mentioned, we find Javier Bardem (Everybody Knows), Dave Bautista (Army of the Dead), Josh Brolin (Hail, Caesar!), and Jason Momoa (Aquaman), among many others. If one is looking for escapist fare, Dune aims to please. Unfortunately, the story as it is, especially without its second half (coming at some indeterminate time, however many years from now) is about a white man becoming the messiah to mostly black and brown people. In 2021, this narrative rings hollow and hopelessly dated. Some simple recasting could have remedied the worst parts of the Lawrence legacy. In addition, while Chalamet can usually more than hold his own, he does not quite cut it this time around. Furthermore, as that same fellow critic (Roxana Hadadi) reminded me, Herbert’s text, problematic though it may be, is at least steeped in Arab and Persian culture backed up by some respectful research. None of the actors portraying the Fremen, though dressed in desert gear, are themselves of such origins. It’s another issue that could have easily been resolved. “Dreams are messages from deep,” intones an opening voiceover, but in Villeneuve’s Dune, no deep thought has been put into the movie’s messages. It’s a shame, for there is still much to enjoy, and fans will surely love it. I, however, did not.

Dune was a sterile, visually impressive [though always predictably so] film. Acting was dreadfully 2D – to the point I couldn’t care whether the goodies or baddies died, as long as they died. Soundtrack was reminscent of so many SF soundtracks since the original Bladerunner – as were many scenes in the early part of the film. To me it was another cookie cutter, committee approved, project – and one that lacked any soul. I preferrred the original!"
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," ¿Alguna vez has conocido una persona que sencillamente no te cae bien? No es mala persona, sencillamente no conectas, aunque todos los demás parecen llevarse bien con ella. Eso me pasó con DUNE, el épico drama de ciencia ficción dirigido por Dennis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049), finalmente estrenando en cines y HBO Max, luego de varios atrasos debido a la pandemia del SaRS-CoV-2. Tengo que comenzar diciendo que DUNE es una majestuosa pieza de arte; la maravillosa cinematografía de Grieg Fraser, y la potente banda sonora de Hans Zimmer hacen de DUNE una experiencia cinemática como pocas, un filme definitivamente hecho para verse en la pantalla más gigante posible. Por mucho tiempo he leído como estos libros de Frank Herbert son “inadaptables” debido a la complejidad de su mitología, estilo narrativo e inmersos recursos requeridos. Villeneuve desafía el reto logrando un coherente arco, construyendo un mundo entendible -si acaso denso – barajeando las diversas alegorías de la historia. En otras palabras, DUNE es una escultura de Afrodita: hermosa para admirar… pero fría y sin alma. La especia no es la única substancia que esta historia necesita. En un lejano futuro, el viaje inter-espacial es posible gracias a la “especia”, una substancia que solamente se consigue en Arrakis, un planeta desértico donde el calor mata después de ciertas horas del día, y gigantes gusanos merodean bajo las traicioneras dunas, buscando atacar cualquier criatura o maquinaria. Por varios años el clan Harkonnen ha cosechado la especia amasando gran fortuna, pero el Emperador decidió otorgar la licencia al clan Atreides, liderado por el Duque Leo (Oscar Isaac). El regalo viene envenenado, pues el Emperador espera que Atreides falle, deteniendo su aumento de poder y posición en la Galaxia. No solamente por los retos mencionados, sino por los Freman, nativos de Atreides, constantemente atacando los invasores Harkonnen robando su recurso natural. Eso significa que el Duque tendrá que mudar su familia y gran parte de su ejército hacia Arrakis, incluyendo su hijo Paul (Timothée Chalamet), y su pareja Jessica (Rebecca Fergurson). Resulta que el Duque y Jessica no están casados, pues Jessica es miembro de las Bene Gesserit, una institución religiosa altamente influyente en las políticas del Imperio. De ella Paul heredó acceso a “La Voz”, un tipo de energía galáctica que, entre otras cosas, le hace tener visiones del futuro, especialmente de una joven Freman llamada Chani (Zendaya). Debido a eso y su linaje, Paul podría ser parte de una antigua profecía sobre una figura salvadora relacionada a los Freman, o quizás de la misma galaxia. Mi problema sencillamente es que nunca sentí ninguna conexión emocional con la historia, ni Paul, ni nada. Me da lo mismo quien gane esta guerra; siempre y cuando la graben en Imax. Timothée Chalamet es uno de esos actores que necesita un director sabiendo como usarlo. Su eterna expresión melancólica fue perfecta como el bobalicón ex novio en Lady Bird, o el aspirante a dandi de Little Women, pero en Paul refleja un absoluto desgano. Las únicas escenas donde Paul demuestra alguna emoción aparte de aburrimiento son con Jason Momoa y Josh Brolin. No es su culpa, todo el mundo en DUNE actúa como gente que sabe que está actuando. Quiero que piensen en The Lord of The Rings, otra historia descrita como “inadaptable”. Imaginen por un momento que los actores principales interpretaran sus personajes como Cate Blanchett interpreta a Galadriel, esa etérea criatura que parece estar elevada sobre sus pies, encima de los demás. En DUNE Paul, el Duque y Jessica se hablan entre sí con el mismo tono artificial, casi todo el tiempo. Podría argumentar que su posición de nobleza los obliga a ser tan fríos entre sí pero, la interacción de cada uno con otros personajes me hace pensar que fue decisión creativa. Este correcto o no, el resultado es el mismo: ausencia de conexión que se sienta real, orgánica. Por otro lado, es interesante ver DUNE como una pieza de histórica narrativa, identificando aquello que he visto en otras producciones. Yo le llamo “Síndrome de Star Wars en reversa”, refiriéndome a cuando la gente ve elementos que le recuerdan a Star Wars, pero en realidad Star Wars se inspiró en ellas, como por ejemplo John Carter, Flash Gordon y El Día que la Tierra se Detuvo. En DUNE verán alegorías a la batalla de clases, el abuso corporativo, el imperialismo, la colonización, el abuso contra nativos, la interferencia de la religión en la política, y los peligros del complejo militar-industrial descontrolado. Es una exquisita mezcla de temas, inteligentemente entrelazados entre sí con una lección sobre la responsabilidad individual y colectiva. Pero Villeneuve, talentoso director, se preocupa más por que DUNE se vea bien, a que la historia conecte con la audiencia. Que un personaje diga que ama a otro no es suficiente, tiene que resaltar la pantalla. No es hasta el tercer acto –en una película de dos horas y media, vale recalcar- cuando Jessica y Paul parecen despertar de su sopor, para tener momentos que se sienten genuinamente emotivos. Para ese entonces estaba más metido en la fantástica presentación visual, un banquete para los sentidos, porque debo repetir que DUNE se ve impresionante. Posiblemente mis reservas queden en la minoría. Probablemente a ustedes si les interesen las flipantes aventuras de Paul y su madre Jessica, la mágica hechicera sideral. En realidad DUNE merece ser vista en las pantallas más grandes que puedan, para apreciar la increíble obra maestra sensorial construida por Villeneuve y equipo.

"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," When a movie such as Dune is released, there is always the fear that it could be a crushing disappointment. You have all the required ingredients – lore-heavy source material, a visionary director, a cast bursting at the seams with talent, Hans Zimmer (!), and even a dodgy David Lynch version - but, like any good cake, you have to combine those ingredients perfectly to achieve the calorific goodness that is so desired. Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel had previously been labeled ‘unadaptable’ and Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) was tasked with achieving the apparently impossible job of bringing the story to the big screen. Villeneuve’s studious approach seemed a perfect fit, especially given his stellar work on 2049, and he proved to be more than up to the task here – Dune is a wonderfully realized, huge-scale epic.  The exalted House Atreides, led by Duke Leto (Isaac), is forced into war for the rulership of the planet of Arrakis against the fearsome House Harkonnen and the native Fremen. The seemingly barren planet is the only source of the powerful drug known as 'spice' (or melange) - a drug that gifts elevated powers of the mind, elongated life, and the promise of great wealth – and the mysterious Emperor has nefarious designs for the planet and the destruction of House Atreides. Leto’s Bene Gesserit (a sisterhood that trains their minds to achieve superhuman telekinetic abilities) partner Lady Jessica (Ferguson) and son Paul (Chalamet) accompany him; however, Paul has been suffering from dreams of a girl on Arrakis and troubling visions of a dangerous future that could threaten the existence of House Atreides and alter the direction of what lies ahead.  The story carries a lingering air of dread as the unavoidable threat of war and destruction is on the horizon - something that Duke Leto is extremely aware of. The trap has been sprung and House Atreides are just pawns and players in the deadly game. The ramifications and fallout from the major events further fuel the sprawling narrative leading to a conclusion that will leave you wanting more in the best way and the frequent, beautiful dream sequences including Zendaya’s Chani sprinkle an additional layer of mystery and intrigue to the overall plot. House Harkonnen is immediately presented as nothing short of devastating and their threat and power are established from the outset (Skarsgård as the Baron is deliciously menacing and vile) whilst the Fremen’s equivocating nature adds another source of question and intrigue.  Despite the resolute tone and approach, Dune saunters along at a consistent pace. Villeneuve never lingers for too long on the smaller, introspective moments nor does he extend the crunching action to unnecessary levels. Crucially, we’re afforded time with the characters, we get to know their motivations, strengths, and weaknesses alongside their place within the wider story - with such a vast ensemble, this is quite the feat. As a collective, the cast of Dune is superb. As a focal point, Chalamet displays the naivety, vulnerability, and self-doubt of Paul Atreides and the growth of the character is delivered wonderfully. Ferguson too is excellent as the conflicted partner, mother, and sister who carries a large air of ambiguity throughout. There really are no weak performances (yes, that includes Bautista too) and the star-studded cast delivers.  Alongside DoP Greig Fraser (Rogue One, Lion), Villeneuve has crafted an expansive, sweeping, and grand affair that captures the extensive scope of the story in the most cerebral and striking of ways. The shifting palettes on display are dazzling and the scale of locations, ships, and battles are presented in a majestic, looming fashion that leaves no doubt as to the grandeur and vastness of the world, and, indeed, the production itself. The sound design is similarly well-executed especially within the chaotic action sequences that fizzle with explosions, fire, and DEATH.  As the title card confirms, this is just Dune: Part One, approximately the first half of Herbert’s novel. Box office returns and streaming figures will ultimately determine whether we see the culmination of the story (of course we will...surely?) but I would've gladly watched more of Part One such was its quality. The sheer magnitude of Dune demands a follow-up and Villeneuve deserves the opportunity to complete the story – the combination of director and source material is perfect and there isn’t a director working today that could’ve taken on the task and delivered such a spectacular result. Dune is epic, bold, and breathtaking. This is awe-inspiring sci-fi at its best and the new benchmark."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villenueve over the past few years has quickly become one of Hollywood’s most reliably brilliant filmmakers, crafting one gorgeous, expertly shot movie after another that defies expectations and further solidifies his place among the best directors of his time. His latest, Dune, arrives with the highest level of hype so far (which is saying a lot for the director of Blade Runner 2049) and doesn’t do anything to endanger that trend — far from it, in fact. An epic, meticulously envisioned film that delivers on every facet of its potential while teasing the promise of more to come, Villeneuve’s Dune makes a strong argument for being the best movie yet from one of the industry’s most talented directors. Based on author Frank Herbert’s sci-fi classic of the same name, Dune is set in humanity’s far-flung future and casts Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, the heir of House Atreides, one of several powerful noble families vying for control in a far-reaching galactic empire. When the Emperor assigns House Atreides control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the most valuable resource in the universe that’s also necessary for interstellar travel, it ignites a series of events that endangers Paul’s family and threatens to dangerously shift the balance of power in the empire. The second big-screen adaptation of Herbert’s Dune (following David Lynch’s polarizing 1984 film), Villeneuve’s movie is intended to be the first of a two-part saga making use of modern visual effects and the director’s own unique visual aesthetic to bring to life a world filled with fantastic technology, wielders of powerful mental abilities, and the ever-present threat of giant sandworms capable of swallowing an entire building. Along with Chalamet in the film’s lead role, the cast of Dune also includes a long list of similarly celebrated actors, including Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem. And yet, despite a crowded cast of high-profile actors and a story long considered impossible to adapt faithfully, Dune delivers on bringing the grand scale of its source material to bold, beautiful life on the screen, thanks to Villeneuve and the talented team he’s assembled both in front of, and behind, the camera. Dune is a tale filled with opposing elements, whether it’s the nobility and humanity of House Atreides challenged by the cruelty of their rivals, House Harkonnen, or the constant juxtaposition of the carefully controlled, industrial architecture of the cities built on Arrakis against the sweeping, ever-changing wild desert outside the cities’ walls. No matter which elements are at play at any point in Dune, they’re handled with an expert’s deft touch. Villeneuve’s vision captures the contrasting elements that shape the world of Dune with the subtlety that makes each film he works on as impressive for its artistic achievement as its storytelling. His meticulous attention to detail is on full display, and the thoroughness of his world-building doesn’t waste any time drawing you in to an environment that seems as fully realized as (and perhaps more so than) the one you imagine while reading Herbert’s novel. From the gritty prowling grounds of drug cartels in 2015’s Sicario to the neon, cyberpunk dystopias of Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve has consistently offered audiences a ticket into worlds that are more than just backdrops. And Dune gives every grain of sand a sense of weight and every moment in the sun a sense of oppressive heat that makes Arrakis feels as unforgiving as the story demands. It’s a world where humanity shouldn’t thrive, and the film imparts that sense of unwelcomeness without any need for exposition. While Herbert’s novel relies heavily on inner monologue for substantial portions of the story, Villeneuve makes creative use of dreams and other narrative devices to accomplish the same feat in the film. It’s a technique that could have easily distracted from the more linear story being told and confused the audience, but Villeneuve and the film’s writing team do an excellent job of making these elements feel organic to everything else going on in the moment. That’s no easy task — as evidenced by the trail of failed adaptations leading up to this one — and it’s an element that works so well in Villeneuve’s Dune that a more faithful translation of the story would probably seem unnecessarily confusing now. That willingness to explore alternate ways to tell the same, fundamental story is a key ingredient in the film’s success at making Dune‘s complicated — and yes, wonderfully weird at times — world not only more digestible, but also more visual. Thanks to the film’s talented cast, we don’t need to hear Paul grappling with some inner turmoil when we can see Chalamet bringing his angst, anger, and emotional arc to life with all of the skills that earned him an Oscar nomination already (for 2017’s Call Me By Your Name). Like so many of his prior projects, Villeneuve’s knack for striking the right balance between what needs to be told or shown explicitly and understanding what he can rely on his actors — or art team — to convey keeps Dune rolling along at a brisk pace with little letdown in tone or tension. And there’s also little need to pause for explanation of Arrakis, the political implications of what’s occurring there, or the machinations of the empire itself. Trusting the audience to parse the information they need from the story you’re telling is always a gamble, and it’s one that pays off for the film’s lengthy 155-minute running time. While there isn’t a bad performance to be found in Dune, Chalamet’s portrayal of Paul is the one that carried the most consequence for the film, and fortunately, the actor has no trouble with any of the heavy lifting the role requires of him. Paul Atreides is yet another character shaped by duality. He’s a thoughtful, brilliant tactician well-suited — and well-groomed — to lead those around him. He’s also a character at war within himself, constantly struggling to reconcile the responsibility that comes with his powers and the destiny he’s constantly reminded of with his desire to be his own person and lead a life outside the formality and structure of his family line. He’s simultaneously reckless and regulated, conscientious and impulsive, and those qualities in conflict are part of what makes him so interesting as a protagonist. Chalamet’s performance covers a wide range over the course of Dune, almost imperceptibly subtle when called for, and a raging cascade of action and emotion at other points. Villeneuve’s camera does a wonderful job of capturing all of it and putting the audience’s focus where it needs to be in each moment of Chalamet’s portrayal of Paul, and the synergy they have in Dune is the sort that raises individual examples of great acting and camera work to another level collectively. Herbert’s Dune was first published in 1965, and we’ve seen adaptation attempts come and go over the last five decades with varying levels of what could generously be called “success.” Some got the look right but never fully grasped the story, while others embraced the complexity of the story without devoting the necessary attention — or resources — to the fantastic world Herbert created. For fans of the novel (and the series it spawned), it’s been a mixed bag, so it’s no surprise that there hasn’t been a lot of optimism around potential Dune adaptations for a very, very long time. With a history like that, it speaks volumes to Villeneuve’s achievement with Dune that the film’s scope, beauty, and execution come together in a way that makes all of those failed attempts and missed opportunities a little less frustrating. They can’t be that bad, after all, because those mistakes eventually led us — and Hollywood — to this moment, and this version of the film.

"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s hard to  be a messiah. Even before he recognizes that this is what he is, the young Paul Atreides of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, played by Timothée Chalamet, lets the grief of expectation seep into his body, down to the drowsed slump of his shoulders and the toneless, contemplative wariness of his voice. The actor’s charm is kept in check; his latent vulnerabilities are in overdrive. Paul is the heir to House Atreides, whose fief is the oceanic planet of Caladan, a stony, rainy, tumultuous world, limited in its purview and power. An unusual home for a family said to descend from the ancient Greeks. But it helps to explain why everyone seems a little down in the dumps.  In another kind of movie, this quality would maybe seem less worthy of remark. A moody teen. So what? But Dune, as Villeneuve has ambitiously sought to tell it, is above all a story of empire, to which Chalamet’s performance lends an interesting texture, soft and uncertain amid the movie’s hardness. This is Villeneuve, after all. The conspicuous sense of design, the brutalism of its sets and sounds (the latter coming courtesy of Hans Zimmer), the overwhelming aesthetics: None of this should surprise us. Villeneuve’s Dune is a thick, loud, well-fed spectacle of a movie, towering over the people in it with a brooding sense of intention — even in its quieter moments, even when wrestling through the Herbert novel’s wide-ranging, learned, quirky mysticism.

But Dune is not just about the bone-rattling heft of its flying machines or its labyrinthine palace interiors or the intergalactic tangle of its imperial politics. Villeneuve must also wrestle with the oddities of the Frank Herbert novel on which the movie is based: the Bene Gesserit witches and their strep-throat vocal manipulations; the Fremen warriors of Arrakis with their blue eyes and violent devotion to the land; the gigantic worms with their baleen-like mouths; the psychotropic desert crop called melange — a.k.a. the spice. I will never be able to un-hear Kyle Machlachan, in David Lynch’s maligned 1984 adaptation, saying it this way, in a horny whisper that now plays like an early foray into ASMR: The spice. There’s an air of mystery to it when MacLachlan says it. Villeneuve’s take is, by contrast, far less weird. It takes seriously the challenge of adapting a seemingly unadaptable novel, and keeping all its big-picture implications in full view. It earns its distinction as a faithful adaptation — and proves a satisfying movie, too.  Hero’s journeys are satisfying by design. But Dune — both the novel and this adaptation — has more going on under the hood than its veneer of hero-myth rehashing would suggest. Chalamet’s Paul seems to carry the weight of an empire on his shoulders because, well, he does. Heavy weighs the promise of his father’s crown, and an eminent war that Paul senses he will have to fight. Paul is prone to visions of the future in his dreams. But one needn’t have ESP to know that there will be a war between House Atreides and their foes, the monstrous House of Harkonnen. The Harkonnens’ longtime stronghold over the desert planet Arrakis — rich with that so-called “spice,” which happens to be essential to operating intergalactic machinery — has suddenly come to an end. This is a strategic play, apparently, the workings of an overarching empire that’s pulling the strings, and it is meant to set these powerful houses at odds.  There in the middle stands Paul, next in succession for the dukeship of the House of Atreides behind his father Leto (Oscar Isaac). It cannot be coincidence that Paul, with his long coats and inward-looking sorrow, appears onscreen in a crucial moment like a cinematic successor to Caspar David Friedrich’s “Wanderer Above the Fog,” a lone figure staring off into a void of clashing uncertainties. One gets the feeling, just from watching Paul and Leto interact, that no one is under the illusion that any particular reign will get a chance to outstay its welcome. That’s war-torn space imperialism for you. Leto’s father was a bullfighter. His reign was cut prematurely short by a bull that had the gall to fight back. So: a doomed legacy. It hangs over the wary Atreides clan with an undeniable sense of reality — literally. The head of that bull looms over the family’s long-tabled dining quarters, watching over them as they enjoy the spoils of their power.  You could say the bull has been conquered, being a trophy now. Funny how it doesn’t feel that way. To say Leto and Paul make for a reluctant line of hero-leaders would be an understatement. Villeneuve renders it overstatement. The movie’s flashy successes and curious lapses both, often enough, come down to this.  Technically, this Dune is just “Part One” of the saga. Villeneuve’s first wise move: splitting the novel in half. He told Vanity Fair that he would not commit to making the movie with Warner Bros. unless he could make it in two parts. He wasn’t the first to notice that Herbert was simply doing too much to make sense of in the space of a typical metroplex feature. Alejandro Jodorowsky planned to turn Herbert’s epic into a 12-hour movie; Lynch compressed it (and/or had it compressed) into a Tangerine Dream-y two-hour saga. Villeneuve has struck something of a bargain between the two. This approach allows him to wind his way through the novel’s flummoxing heaps of exposition with stylish, procedural efficiency — every shot assured; every special effect made to feel special. Across Dune’s many adaptations — including the SyFy TV series from 2000 and the unrealized could-have-beens by directors as varied as Jodorowsky, David Lean, and Ridley Scott — Villeneuve’s has most firmly cemented itself as a story about the geopolitical morass of war between, as Herbert put it, the “polish” of civilization and the native outliers, the keepers of the land. Co-written by the director with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, the film leans into the story’s clear blockbuster potential, trying where it can to be thoughtful about it. It is the kind of big-ticket, big-idea, big-cast epic the director has been working toward for some time now. It is a worthy attempt to carve out an intelligible path between Dune’s opposing halves, with the through-line being Paul’s displeasure at being trapped at the crossroads. On the one side, there’s the mysticism, that Messianic fate Paul inherits from his Bene Gesserit witch-mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), which has begun to plague his dreams with visions of a young Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya) — the stuff Lynch’s Eighties rendition dove into with unintentionally campy verve. And in the other corner, there’s the war-story mechanics, with all the big-budget trappings that come with them.  It all amounts to another chance for Villeneuve to lay out the most consistently impressive feat of his films: the design. From the towering, anonymous allure of the women of the Bene Gesserit, whose beanstalking strides through the film make us instinctively tilt back in our seats; to the vast and varied landscapes (the fog-misted home planet of the Atreides clan, the deadly Arrakis desert, and most especially the temples of the House of Harkonnen, so dark as to seem carved out of a vacuum of ink); to the straightforward excitement of watching giant things go boom. This is the kind of film in which the visual wizardry often has the material splendor of practical effects. It’s irresistible on that front. The spice floats through the air like live sparks or miniature jewels, gleaming with mystery and importance. When ships get blown to bits, they crumble apart as if they were wrought from mere clumps of sand. When those sand worms emerge — and everyone who loves the Dune enterprise has something at stake in the movie getting these fearsome beasts right — their desert-cloud fury feels lifelike and ugly, their maws more terrifying for being revealed only sparingly. But the new Dune has so invested itself in the story’s monolithic power that the more down-to-earth ingredients at stake sometimes feel inert. The actual drama isn’t as satisfying as the physical world Villeneuve and his collaborators have dreamed up to surround it. Take away the shock and awe of the movie’s accomplished world-building and his lively action set-pieces, and only a handful of scenes really work as scenes — which feels odd. For as human as it is, Dune’s entire story plays out in the far-future, on alien planets, and is overstuffed with costumes and little twinges of detail suggesting that this world’s idea of “normal” is a far cry from our own. That uncanny power feels segmented from the rest of Villeneuve’s vision. With the exception of seeing Chalamet get high on the spice in one captivating set piece, it’s just not quite as convincing. You can’t blame the cast. Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Javier Bardem as the imposingly reticent Fremen leader Stilgar, Josh Brolin as the fantastically trigger-happy Gurney Halleck, and a broader supporting net of supporting players all try to strike the balance that the movie needs, with the war-mongering and spice-huffing and witchery all capably accounted for. David Dastmalchian and Dave Baustista star as the yin and yang of Harkonnen’s inner circle; Charlotte Rampling brings cruel knowingness to her role as the witchiest Bene Gesserit of them all. And a wonderful set of turns from Stephen McKinley Henderson, Chang Chen, and Babs Olusanmokun, none of whom needs much screen time to sear their characters into our minds, gives the movie a dash of soul. At times it can feel overflowing with showy performances. A bald and bloated Skarsgård really does emerge headfirst out of darkness into a spotlight, rubbing his dome pensively, looking wet and slippery and villainous as a demon seal — a moment out of the Brando playbook that looks stunning but feels obvious. (Brolin, by comparison, gets a lot more mileage out of a performance that verges on Rambo levels of reactionary violence.) Two of the best turns offer a refreshing counterpoint to the occasional showing off. There’s Sharon Duncan-Brewster as a gender-reversed Dr. Liet-Kynes (played in the 1984 version by the estimable Max von Sydow), with the added benefit of an enlarged role compared to the book. And there’s Jason Momoa as the irrepressibly charismatic warrior-swordsman Duncan Idaho, whose caring concern for young Paul is the film’s most convincing emotional thread. If not for the consistent peculiarity and merit of certain actors — Henderson, Duncan-Brewster, Momoa, Bardem — it’d be easy to forget what a strange universe Herbert has bestowed on us, flashy movie tricks be damned. Why does this movie still work? Because it’s big and breathless and committed, so capably navigated in its finest moments that you can’t help but give credit where it’s due. Its flaws cannot derail the most compelling mark in the movie’s favor: the pleasure of a big, somewhat silly blockbuster. In a healthier, more robust moment for big-tent Hollywood spectacles, Dune would maybe not feel like such a big deal. But it is a big deal, in its way. The kind of mainstream-visionary deal that Tenet, with its pandemic-marred release, didn’t get to be; which Marvel and DC fare isn’t quite designed to be (with a couple of exceptions); and which long-promised Avatar sequels 2 through 200 have yet to be.  There are directors who seem to want to make the 2001: A Space Odyssey of their era. No one has. But Villeneuve is unabashedly one such Star Child-aspiring director: a striving visionary whose canvas has grown ever bigger in what feels like a short span of time. If his sure-footed, leaping strides from Sicario to Arrival to Blade Runner 2049 weren’t enough proof of that, Dune most certainly is. What’s fun and flawed about this new Dune is that, like Blade Runner 2049 before it, it wears its aspiration to once-in-a-blue moon, auteur-anointing spectacle squarely on its sleeve. So it sometimes falls into the trap of an ambition so overwhelming, it eclipses any genuine glimpses of originality or dramatic imagination. The explosive set-pieces make the movie worth watching; Momoa and Chalamet palling around make the movie worth watching. When the movie whittles itself down to the totalizing, sublime power of a well-funded action spectacle, it hits its stride. It’s in the grand opera of it all that it hits its boring stretches and false notes. Ridley Scott — a journeyman director with a few indispensable movies, a handful of really good movies, and a number of whatever efforts that haven’t been bad enough to dim the auteur cred he’s amassed over the years — came to mind each time I saw Dune. Scott was in fact mega-producer Dino De Laurentiis’ pick to helm a Dune adaptation before the project fell to David Lynch. At times, it feels like Villeneuve is evoking Scott directly, and not for the first time. It’s there in his approach to the fortress on Arrakis, which calls to mind the futurist industrialism of Syd Mead’s Blade Runner landscape, only seen by day, with a lot more dust. And those wandering dead-wife daymares that punctuated Gladiator find their echo, here, in Paul’s dreams of Chani, which at their most intriguing recall “Afghan Girl,” that omnipresent and unforgettable National Geographic cover of an Afghan woman whose green eyes nearly break the skin of the image. Villeneuve, like Scott in Gladiator, overuses the gesture. He comes back to it again and again, selling us on the idea that Paul is haunted (fair enough) while draining Chani of the very magnetism she’s meant to impress upon us. Maybe the lapses only stand out because of what’s so accomplished about the movie otherwise. Dune has pretensions to being about something. Hear Chani say: “They ravage our lands before our eyes.” See, in slow, sculptural montage, the aforementioned ravaging. It is a deliberate choice. And much of what follows, the film’s stark desert images, its views of the Fremen and the cultural reality of invasive desert warfare that their faces and wary eyes knowingly evoke, are all equally deliberate. Whether Villenueve’s saga has anything truly of interest to say in that direction, whether its depiction of empire has a backbone of ideas worthy of such grandeur, remains to be seen.  Good thing, then, that we’ll undoubtedly get to see the sequel. All this nodding toward the future means that the moral terrors underlying Part One’s visual wonders feel more outlined and gestured at than rigorous or real — for now. Much of what seems murky in this first chapter feels wrought in anticipation of the terrifying clarity we can expect of the sequel. The sorrows of young Atreides, so pervasive in this movie, may prove a useful aperture. We laugh nowadays at that line from Revenge of the Sith: “You were the chosen one!” But in effect, something similar seems to lurk ahead for Paul, whose visions have a good track record when it comes to bearing fruit. Given the substance of some of those visions, that makes for a rough prospect. Part One is good enough to make you want to stick around and see it — and to see if Villeneuve really does something with it. This movie reiterates an already-proven point: the guy’s got talent. It will be up to Part Two to show us how much further he’s willing to ride it."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," There is no such thing as an “unfilmable” book. The concept simply does not exist. What does exist is the concept of adaptation. When adapting one medium to another, excision is part of the process. Certain things have to go, certain things have to be changed, and in some cases, certain things must be added. There’s no way to capture the prose of a novel onscreen, just as there’s no way to make two readers conjure the exact same image in their heads. So yes, any book can be adapted to film, just as any film can be novelized. Sure, the result might not be an exact copy, but it is indeed an adaptation. With a property like Dune, where much of what makes the story special is in the words themselves, audiences who aren’t in the know will probably need some help understanding the plot (David Lynch’s Dune famously distributed lobby cards with a glossary of terms to ease audiences into the world of Arrakis). On the other hand, fans of Dune like myself will surely tend to view the latest version from a different angle. What I mean is that nobody goes to a production of Romeo & Juliet to see how it ends, but rather to see how this particular production handles the material. That’s exactly how I think of any new adaptation of Frank Herbert’s gargantuan novel. I know what happens already, but I simply must know how Denis Villeneuve’s interpretation looks and feels . It’s for this very reason that Lynch’s Dune has only recently become a beloved film. Yeah, it’s pretty dysfunctional in most departments, but Lynch’s interpretation of how these characters look, sound, and move is very unique, and quite entertaining (and frequently disgusting in the best of ways). If it’s your entrance point to the material, you’re on your own. But once you get it, it’s a wild ride! So with the caveat that non-Dune fans will have to do some research, I can say that Denis Villeneuve’s take is pretty awesome. I mean that literally. The scale of Arrakis has never been so grand, and the giant worms that live under its surface have never felt so huge. Shots of gigantic ships lifting off from a mountain of sand are simply breathtaking (even though I hate sand), and never does it ever feel like the flesh and blood actors are not integrated with the setting. It’s a remarkable visual achievement. This is by design, of course, since the book is way too much material for the length of a single feature (and really, it would best be served as a miniseries if I’m being honest). The plan is for two films, but with COVID-19 shaking up release schedules and box offices, there’s no guarantee that the conclusion to the story will be completed, although I am hopeful. Without a second chapter, Dune suffers greatly. As it is, the film ends at the most logical point, but it’s not a particularly cinematic moment, nor does it execute very well what should feel like a cliffhanger. I remain excited to see where it goes, but only because I know where it goes. I once described Game of Thrones as “errrbody schemin’, errrbody fuckin’, here be dragons.” To apply this same format to Dune, my description would be “errrbody schemin’, sand gets you high, here be worms.” I don’t have the room to expound upon this much further, but Dune is an adventure that occurs at the intersection of space-politics, space-religion, and space-drug trade, centered around a brooding twink (Timothée Chalamet) who might be the chosen one. It’s good stuff, and across the board the casting is perfect, most notably a beardless Jason Momoa as the hilariously named Duncan Idaho, Oscar Isaac as the stoic Duke Leto, and Rebecca Ferguson as perhaps the most important character in the whole tale, Lady Jessica. When reading Dune over the summer, I did my best to imagine my own character designs without being informed by Lynch’s visual style, and Villeneuve’s take on each and every one of them was pretty accurate to my own imagination (the settings in Lynch’s film, however, tend to favor the way I’d imagined them over Villeneuve’s). There’s a sleepiness to Herbert’s novel that is captured remarkably well here that neither the previous film version nor the SyFy miniseries was able to pin down, and while this tone may bore some, I sense it’s the type of thing that will grow to be appreciated with repeat viewings. Plot accessibility for n00bs is also likely to grow upon rewatch. Valuable to this end is the fact that the film is disinterested in expressly explaining the historical/mythological details of the world. It’s not a passive watch, and it trusts the audience to do the work. This may be off-putting for some, but in a post-Game of Thrones world it’s not a tall order. I suspect audiences are up to the task — hopefully there are enough of us out there that the second half of the film will be made."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"  Frank Herbert's science fiction opus gets a stellar adaptation worthy of the big screen. Dune is not a pop cinema spectacle that sacrifices storytelling for bloated CGI effects. French Canadian auteur Denis Villeneuve takes the time to weave a complex mythological narrative of classic archetypes. Where houses of royalty in a distant future battle for control of the universe's most valuable commodity on a seemingly barren planet. Striking cinematography, an excellent supporting cast, and rich dialogue envelopes you utterly. Dune's only significant drawback is the feeble screen presence of the protagonist. Timoth&#233e Chalamet is a capable actor, but lacks the charisma and gravitas to truly carry a film of this epic magnitude.   In the year ten thousand, the Emperor issues a declaration that roils the balance of power between the Great Houses. The brutal House Harkonnen must relinquish control of the desert planet Arrakis to House Atreides. Whoever rules Arrakis controls the production of spice, a vital element to space travel, and source of unlimited wealth. But Arrakis is a beast not easily tamed. Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his vicious nephew (Dave Bautista) cruelly oppress the Fremen, an indigenous nomadic people with mysterious blue-eyes. Monstrous sandworms also devour anything emitting a rhythmical sound pattern. "

Warner Bros. The first attempt to adapt
Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi novel—by Alejandro Jodorowsky—never got past the
planning stage.  (Frank Pavich’s 2014
documentary “Jodorowsky’s Dune” is one of the best films ever made about a
movie that wasn’t.)  The second—the 1984 film
by David Lynch—was visually impressive but incoherent, though whether the fault
was his or the studio’s remains an open question.  The third, John Harrison’s 2000 mini-series,
was faithful but visually drab. What “Dune” doesn’t do is
infuse the story with deep emotional resonance. 
Villeneuve’s vision is beautiful but chilly, frosty in human terms
despite the parched, hot desert locale in which much of the plot is set and the
fact that the characters bake in the heat. 
While it can feel rather sterile, however, the film is never less than
entrancing. Based on roughly the first
half of the book, Part 1 begins the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet)
to the realization of his destiny as the messiah of the Fremen, the oppressed,
blue-eyed desert dwellers of Arrakis, a planet that’s among the possessions of
an exploitative off-screen emperor.  He
doles out favor to the rival noble houses that vie with one another for wealth
and power, and Arrakis is a particular prize since it’s the sole source of
Spice, a valuable commodity that is mined from the desert wastelands.  Spice is essential to space travel, and
expands a user’s mental capabilities. Control of Arrakis has
long been in the hands of the House Harkonnen, headed by the bulbous, brutal Baron
Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), but the emperor has now capriciously transferred
it to Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), Paul’s father who heads House Atreides.  Leto knows that the baron will not accept the
new arrangement calmly, but has no choice but to accept responsibility for
overseeing the Spice harvest, and proceeds to Arrakis with his army and his
household—Paul, Leto’s concubine and the boy’s mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca
Ferguson), the House’s weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), swordmaster
Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), and chief advisor Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley
Henderson), and its resident physician Chang Chen Dr. Yueh (Chang Chen). Paul is a moody, sensitive
boy—qualities that are secure parts of Chalamet’s thespian toolbox—and he has
been mentored well by Gurney and Duncan. 
He has also received instruction from his mother in the ways of the Bene
Gessereit, a powerful group of female mystics, and one of its leaders, Gaius
Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), is impressed by visions Paul has had in his
dreams, and by his ability to endure the pain of the group’s mind tests."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," “Duna” es una de las películas más anticipadas del año, de eso no hay duda —no solo se trata de una nueva adaptación de la épica novela de Frank Herbert, si no también de la primera película del gran Denis Villeneuve desde “Blade Runner 2049”, y también, de uno de los varios blockbusters que fueron postergados múltiples veces debido a la pandemia del Coronavirus. Es un filme que ha sido esperado por mucha gente —fanáticos de la novela, de la ciencia ficción en general, y por qué no, de la fallida película ochentera de David Lynch— por mucho tiempo, y que prometía una experiencia única en su especie, tan espectacular a nivel visual, que solo se podía disfrutar en la pantalla grande. Lo cual no evitó que la Warner Bros. la estrene en HBO Max al mismo tiempo que en los cines… porque por supuesto. La presión debe haber sido enorme para Villeneuve, y aunque no me animaría a decir que soy ahora un fanático de esta historia, tampoco puedo decir que “Duna” sea una mala película. De hecho, se trata de uno de los blockbusters más ambiciosos que haya visto en un buen tiempo, un filme que trata de hacer muchísimo y que se toma el tiempo para hacerlo. Tanto así, que en realidad solo adapta la primera mitad del primer libro de Frank Herbert —puede que los pósters de la película incluyan solo el título de “Duna”, pero los créditos iniciales nos dicen que se trata de la Primera Parte de “Duna”. No es una historia completa, pues, y es precisamente ahí donde radica uno de los mayores defectos del filme: peca de ambicioso, y podría alejar a varios espectadores que no sean fanáticos de la fuente de inspiración original (como vuestro servidor). No ayuda, además, que haya muchísimo lore que explicar en la película, y que el guion no siempre lo haga de la manera más elegante posible. Consideren: nuestro protagonista es el joven Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), de la casa Atreides, e hijo del duque Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). El Emperador de la galaxia (a quien nunca vemos) ha nombrado a dicha Casa como los nuevos gobernadores del planeta Arrakis, un lugar absolutamente desértico, que sin embargo cuenta con uno de los recursos más preciados de este universo: la especia. El problema es que también está lleno de gusanos de arena, criaturas gigantes capaces de devorar desde seres humanos hasta vehículos y más. El punto es que el duque se lleva a su hijo, a su esposa, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), y a sus ayudantes, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) y el excelente guerrero Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) al planeta desértico, no solo para hacerse de la especia, si no también para tratar de formar una alianza con sus habitantes, los Fremen. El problema es que los anteriores gobernantes de Arrakis, la Casa Harkonnen, liderada por el Barón Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), parecen estar planeando un ataque. Y como si eso no fuera poco, resulta que Lady Jessica pertenece a un grupo de psíquicas llamadas las Bene Gesserit, y ha estado entrenando y preparando a Paul para convertirse en El Elegido, capaz de utilizar La Voz para obligar a la gente a que haga lo que él quiera. Esto resulta en una serie de pesadillas que nuestro héroe tiene noche tras noche, en donde sueña con una joven de los Fremen llamada Chani (Zendaya), quien seguramente terminará siendo alguien importante para él (y para el futuro de la galaxia). Como se deben haber dado cuenta, hay mucho que absorber en “Duna”, y al inicio, puede resultar bastante abrumador. Los personajes le cuentan todos estos detalles a Paul, quien también ve “film-libros” (hologramas) para aprender más sobre Arrakis, mencionando nombres extraños, leyendas, rumores, Casas, planetas y más. No es muy sutil, y hubiera preferido que Villenueve y sus guionistas eligiesen una forma un poco más visual de transmitir todo este lore. Felizmente, esto termina siendo un (ligero) problema solo durante el primer tercio del filme, lo cual quiere decir que el resto de “Duna” se concentra en desarrollar la historia y los conflictos entre personajes, y por supuesto, en dejar varias semillas plantadas para la eventual segunda parte —que hasta el momento, no ha sido confirmada al 100%. Lo cual podría llegar a ser un problema para algunos, porque “Duna” termina siendo una película que desarrolla todo un mundo palpable, e introduce muchos conceptos… pero que no termina. Al ser una adaptación de la primera mitad de la novela, “Duna” concluye de manera abierta, luego de unos treinta minutos finales que se sienten extremadamente anticlimáticos, especialmente en comparación a la batalla en la ciudad de Arrakis, que se lleva a cabo mucho antes, y que se siente más como un verdadero clímax. De hecho —y no creo que cuente como spoiler—, las últimas líneas de diálogo de “Duna” son “esto es solo el principio”, lo cual se siente casi como una burla (o siendo más amables, como un guiño por parte de un Villenueve que sabe, ciertamente, lo que está haciendo). No quiero sonar muy negativo, porque en general, la pasé bien con “Duna” —sí, maneja un ritmo algo glacial, al igual que, por ejemplo, la ya mencionada “Blade Runner 2049”, y sí, se siente como un teaser para lo que vendrá después, en vez de una experiencia completa. Pero lo que sí logra hacer Villenueve acá es adaptar la novela de Herbert de manera respetuosa, incluyendo varios detalles que de seguro serán importantes para los fanáticos de la obra original. El desarrollo de este universo es impecable, por ejemplo, y el diseño tanto de los planetas, como de las naves, y por supuesto, de los gusanos de arena, es verdaderamente impresionante. La película se siente épica, enorme, mostrando todo a gran escala y sin mayores restricciones —una experiencia que se debería ver en el cine —si es posible—, y que perderá mucho en las pantallas de laptop o televisión. Eso se debe, también, a que la dirección de fotografía de Greig Fraser (“Rogue One”, “Zero Dark Thirty”) logra adentrarnos en un universo increíble, presentando todos los planetas, desde Caladan (de donde proviene la casa de Atreides) hasta, por supuesto, el árido Arrakis, de la manera más verosímil y espectacular posible. Y aunque un filme como este podría malgastar a un reparto lleno de estrellas, vale la pena aclarar que la mayoría de estos actores hace un excelente trabajo con sus respectivos papeles. Oscar Isaac destaca como un duque duro pero justo; Rebecca Ferguson protagoniza algunas de las escenas más dramáticas de la cinta; Jason Momoa es carisma puro como Duncan Idaho (el único personaje con el que de verdad pude empatizar), y Josh Brolin parece estar pasándola bien como la mano derecha de Leto. Por otro lado, por más de que haya disfrutado mucho del trabajo previo de Chalamet, a mi parecer, el joven actor no logra otorgarle mucha vida a Paul. Quizás se debe a cómo ha sido escrito el personaje, pero Chalamet se ve algo perdido, como si le costara desarrollar a Paul como alguien creíble, que supuestamente debe crecer y encontrar su propósito a lo largo de la historia. Ciertamente no ayuda que Paul sea un protagonista sorprendentemente pasivo —de hecho, no logra ser particularmente proactivo hasta el final de la película, y para ese entonces, se siente un poco anticlimático. Estoy seguro que lo aprovecharán mejor en la segunda parte (especialmente debido a cómo termina este filme), pero nuevamente: todavía no sabemos si es que de verdad logrará ser producida. Habrá que cruzar los dedos, no más. Por más de que, a mi parecer, cuente con varios defectos, no se puede negar que “Duna” es un proyecto de pasión, un filme que peca de ambicioso, pero que se siente más honesto que el 90% de blockbusters que se estrenan año tras año. Desde la bombástica banda sonora de Hans Zimmer (quien nunca decepciona), hasta los excelentes efectos visuales, y la atmósfera tan palpable que Villenueve logra desarrollar, no se le puede reprochar mucho a “Duna” desde el punto de vista técnico o visual. Donde falla es en la pasividad de su protagonista, y en lo incompleta que se siente, concluyendo más con un quejido que con un estruendo. Pero incluso eso no evita que valga la pena verla, especialmente en una pantalla grande de cine. Solo espero que Villenueve realmente logre completar su visión con una segunda parte de “Duna”; de lo contrario, esta primera experiencia terminará sintiéndose más como un arriesgado (y apasionado) experimento, que como una historia bien realizada.

"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"This is a movie of Oscar-quality craftsmanship, but it lacks the primal drama of a ""Star Wars,"" the emotional interplay of a ""Star Trek"" or the engaging camaraderie of a Marvel installment."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," Facing off against a massive level of anticipation in terms of audience expectation and the prospect of fulling certain financial hopes, Dune has a lot riding on it. Despite being handled by one of the biggest movie studios, having a huge budget to work with, and featuring the work of some of the most talented filmmakers and mainstream actors currently out there, it’s incredible how a few specific choices could make or break such a film, let alone turn off the masses of people looking for great spectacle. Fortunately, Dune absolutely delivers on its promises and then some. This is a visually spectacular feature that I found myself fully immersed in. Based on Frank Herbert’s best-selling sci-fi novel from 1965, this film is “Part One” of a presumed two-part story. Set far in the future, the plot revolves around the fallout from Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) accepting the stewardship of the dangerous desert planet Arrakis (aka Dune). This planet is the source of spice, a valuable substance that motivates those who would see House Atreides fall. At the center of this is the Duke’s son, Paul (Timothee Chalamet), who possesses certain abilities that may prove him to be some kind of savior to both his people and the Fremen tribe who make up the native population of Arrakis. It would be an understatement to say there’s a lot more going on here, as Herbert’s novel (and subsequent sequels) is known for being dense material focused on royal dynasties, religion, and intergalactic globalization, among other things. It is a large credit to director/co-writer Denis Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth that Dune is not a film suffocated by its world-building or the number of characters. In a time where the complexities of HBO’s Game of Thrones are a treat to audiences around the world, and Marvel Studios can get away with relying on audiences to easily understand new references to previous entries in their 20+ film series, Dune should not be a difficult film to track by comparison. That’s not to say this film doesn’t feature an ample supply of exposition, but Dune is structured in such a way that the information given comes with so much reward, whether it’s thanks to the talented cast making the material engaging or through the gorgeous visuals on display (DP Greig Fraser and the special effects team completely understood the assignment), which fully-realize the worlds we are inhabiting. I understand as much about the character hierarchy as I do the wonderfully designed flying machines that resemble dragonflies. This is a rich film, and Villeneuve’s fandom for the novel shows in how much reverence he brings to this presentation. It is one thing to merely explain the nature of this universe, introduce some characters, and let visual effects do the rest of the talking. This film finds a lot of spiritual focus in how it follows Paul’s journey. Dune, among other things, is a coming-of-age tale. Paul’s emergence from his youth means understanding the discourse that comes with tribalism, being quick to think but not too quick to comprehend a situation, and being ready to resolve conflicts by any means necessary. A role such as this could easily be rendered dull, as we are watching a “chosen one” narrative that requires mostly reactive actions compared to the flashier characters surrounding them. Chalamet manages to do a lot with Paul, beyond just emote through his floppy hair. As the central character, he brings a spiritedness to the role without filling Paul with too much angst or naivety. He also plays well with the many other cast members. This notably speaks for Rebecca Ferguson as Paul’s mother, Jason Momoa as the wonderfully named Duncan Idaho, a swordmaster and mentor, and Zendaya as a mysterious woman Paul has only had visions about before finally encountering her. The stories around Paul all have their own levels of intrigue as well. For Isaac’s Duke Atreides, we watch a man do what he thinks is right for his House while serving an emperor asking a lot of him. Isaac does plenty to show that Leto is a warm and fair man, but one with experience. On the other side is Stellan Skarsgard’s Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, a literal beast of a man who can defy gravity. This is a character made out of various aspects of villainy, all designed to be repulsive. And yet, the control he has over his House, as well as those he has made arrangements with, makes him a force worth paying attention to. The rest of this all-star cast is well-equipped to deliver what’s needed, whether it’s the rugged nature of Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, the hot-tempered attitude of Dave Bautista’s Glossu Rabban, the iciness of Charlotte Rampling’s truthsayer, or the calm and collected disposition of Sharon Duncan-Brewster’s Dr. Liet-Kynes. A film of this kind needs to have a lot of recognizable faces to help bring audiences in. To Dune’s advantage, this cast is more than capable, incredibly diverse, and clear on the film’s mood. When considering what is taking place in this first half of a longer story, it’s clear one can only do so much with what is essentially a tragedy of epic proportions. With a clear trajectory meant for Paul, while not necessarily unpredictable, there is a need for certain levels of drama to ensue for this story to build its momentum. Does that mean Dune has no time to be anything less than serious? I would not say so. While Villeneuve’s films do not rely on levity to make the stories more comforting, that doesn’t mean there is no fun to be had. I was impressed with how this movie could be so devoted to properly representing the worlds and people while still working as genuine entertainment. It has a level of scope, allowing for major, spectacle-filled moments, exhilarating action, and genuine thrills that combine elements of wonder and suspense. And, yes, this is also a movie featuring giant sandworms. Finding a way to encompass so much without ever feeling too convoluted or out of its depth in conveying any level of emotion is the sort of accomplishment any blockbuster filmmaker should aspire to having done. At two and a half hours, the film finds a deliberate way of moving, whether that means having room to breathe or keeping a breakneck pace, as we watch characters wrestle through unprecedented circumstances for the sake of survival. Combined with a specific structure for the sake of having a stopping point, one of my main takeaways was that I need the rest of this, and soon. I can only speculate on what the rest of this story will bring (I have not read the novel, and the David Lynch film makes its own choices). However, I wonder how the complete story will deal with the variety of themes and ideas introduced in this first film. The power dynamics are intriguing and a reflection of how little things change when it comes to stories concerning who is in charge and who wants to be. Whether relating this to the Crusades or a more modern take involving western cultures invading and stripping the Middle East, it’s easy to see the parallels being drawn. One can also use the movie to understand how religious appropriation has led to specific points of view for some characters while being a true believer informs others. And, of course, the idea of harvesting natural resources from a particular region, and the devastating effects that has on all involved, speaks to so much that is happening today. Does this film adequately address every one of those themes with a level of nuanced depth that can be analyzed for weeks at a time? That’s a bit beyond the point. At the end of the day, Dune functions as pulp fiction. It happens to have a prestige quality, but this film does not need to act above its sci-fi elements. That said, it really helps that it is not a victim of sci-fi trappings. Even with a narrative surrounding a “Special” hero that will ideally save everything, Dune is a sprawling epic made with a level of confidence afforded to those who truly earn the right to use experimental choir voices provided by Hans Zimmer’s excellent original score. Of course, Dune is much more than sounds that push the envelope and sandworms. This is an experience worth its weight in spice."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," And Dune is a daunting monster to adapt (that’s just the first volume), as proven by the visionary David Lynch’s honourable, but excruciating version from 1984. Lynch attempted to condense Herbert’s complex weave of sci-fi technologies, political intrigue, ecology, religion, superstition and myth into a single two-hour film. The result was fairly incomprehensible, deadly dull yet bizarrely kitsch; one can’t easily forget the sight of Patrick Stewart storming into battle holding a pug in his arms.  In contrast, Villeneuve’s decisions to cut the book in half (Part II is yet to be confirmed, but highly likely) and play it with a very straight bat are largely successful. In his hands, the tale of a young man’s survival and self-discovery, as rival factions tear themselves apart on a treacherous desert planet, is earnest but consistently compelling. The initial set-up makes one think that Dune must have inspired George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones. The noble Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, above right, with Josh Brolin) is ordered by the Emperor to leave his home planet, Caladan, and assume stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune, which is source of the most valuable spice in the universe. Among its many attributes, ‘melange’ increases life expectancy and facilitates space travel; imbibe too much, and it turns your eyes blue.  In taking over Arrakis, the Atreides will replace their bitter rivals, House Harkonnen. And the repulsive, thoroughly evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is in no mood to give up his cash cow lightly. So the reluctant Leto knows this is a poisoned chalice, if not an outright trap. The mood as the Atreides household, including Leto’s concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), prepares to leave their fertile planet for the arid Dune is one of regret and foreboding.  Leto is not the key Atreides in this story, but Paul. On Caladan the boy is beset by dreams with the ring of prophecy about them. His mother has been teaching him powers of telepathy and mind control that are usually confined to the women in her religious sect. And when Jessica’s former teacher (the reliably terrifying Charlotte Rampling) submits him to a test involving a box, a poisoned needle and indescribable pain, he confirms that he might just be a tad special.  Chalamet already has a sort of blessed aura about him, so he’s a perfect Paul – spirited, aloof and otherworldly; he’s also played Henry V, so can more than hold his own in a fight. Alongside him as this instalment’s principal figure, Ferguson (the all-action heart of the recent Mission Impossible films) appealingly conveys both Jessica’s power and maternal concern. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa are suitably charismatic as Paul’s battle-hardened, swashbuckling mentors, while Jarvier Bardem (pictured above) and Zendaya take the reins when the action moves into the desert as Fremen, the mysterious Dune natives who are crucial to Paul’s future. But it’s unwise to get too attached to anyone, for the film’s fidelity to its source extends to Herbert’s casual way of despatching principals (one benefit of not knowing the book). Villeneuve’s script, co-written with Jon Spaihts and skilled old hand Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, A Star is Born, Mank) adopts the book’s slow-burn release of information – to the extent that the emperor’s role and motivation are still to be revealed –  as well as a certain humourlessness. As a result, the film could perhaps use a little more clarity and levity.  Yet it ends in exactly the right place, offering much food for thought over what comes next – love, war, revenge, mysticism and a lot more worm. For now, this is a formidable, breath-taking exercise in world-building."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," Paul Atreides, the handsome young protagonist of Dune, is one of science fiction’s original chosen ones. His heroic journey from plucky teenager to feared warrior has been imitated time and time again—think of Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. But the director Denis Villeneuve’s film is the first adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel to properly portray the grim tragedy of Paul’s arc; the movie is epic in scope, but it understands the quieter human underpinnings of the original work. At the heart of Herbert’s Dune series, a multi-book tale of space empires, sandworms, religious fervor, and political gamesmanship spanning centuries, was a simple observation: Great power comes with terrible burden. Dune follows the Atreides family after Duke Leto Atreides (played by Oscar Isaac) is given control of Arrakis, a harsh planet that is mined for a magical substance called spice, crucial to space travel. The Duke knows the gift is a poisoned chalice, an opportunity to fail that’s been set up by an evil baron—but still he accepts, hoping to defeat the odds stacked against him. His wife, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is an aristocratic space witch who works to mold the future behind the scenes. And their son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), might be the messiah, a baby she willed into existence against her training. He is marked from birth with the potential to change the universe’s destiny. But being at the center of a cosmic chess match is as terrifying as it is exhilarating. All of this information will seem basic to a Dune fan, but it’s difficult to communicate on-screen without massive voice-over information dumps, a tactic David Lynch resorted to in his failed 1984 adaptation. Luckily, Villeneuve’s film—billed on-screen as Dune: Part One—attempts to translate only the first half of Herbert’s first book. It has more room to breathe as a result, so it can offer newcomers to the series more clarity and spend real time developing its characters beyond familiar archetypes. The scale still feels immense—enough to capture the magnitude of Herbert’s storytelling, which blended the fall of the Roman empire with 20th-century imperialism and flung it into a far future, in which space aristocrats wrestle for control of whole planets. Villeneuve, a French-Canadian director, emerged with the indie works Polytechnique and Incendies. But his Hollywood output steadily increased in budget and ambition, beginning with dark thrillers such as Prisoners and Sicario, and then moving into the staggering science fiction of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. With Dune, Villeneuve takes on a famed best seller that defeated one of the finest filmmakers alive, and it’s his grandest gamble yet: He imagines city-size ships, helicopters that look like dragonflies, and giant worms rampaging around the desert, and pairs them with a thundering Hans Zimmer score. Dune will be released on HBO Max the same day it hits theaters, but it’s best enjoyed on the largest possible screen with a bone-rattling sound system. The grandeur was expected; Villeneuve is a rare director who actually knows what to do with a colossal budget. His movies, though, are often dismissed as chilly puzzle boxes. Although I count myself a fan of his work, I did wonder whether the large ensemble—including Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, and Charlotte Rampling—might feel like pawns being moved around on a galactic board. But he wisely places the emotional focus on the central trio: Paul and his parents, all struggling against the rigid expectations that other people—and their society—have for them. Chalamet plays Paul as someone alternately tempted by and fearful of his prophesied future, and the mythic powers that carry him further and further from normalcy. Isaac’s Duke, tinged with sadness and resignation, tries to make small steps toward a peace that he knows is unlikely. But Ferguson is the star of the show, imperious one moment and fragile the next, torn between nurturing her son’s purpose and protecting him from becoming a monster. Those finely drawn emotions made Dune resonate for me, much more than its stunning battle sequences or sweeping landscapes. Villeneuve’s sole error is that in giving himself time to explore Herbert’s novel, he has robbed himself of a proper ending—the film cuts off about halfway into the book, and you don’t have to be a reader to tell. It left me wanting much more, but one hopes this Dune won’t become another strange footnote in film history. Villeneuve’s vision can be fulfilled only if he’s allowed to complete the tale."
"Oct 20, 2021",NEUTRAL," Denis Villeneuve’s vision for Frank Herbert’s Dune is
as gorgeous and cinematic as you might expect from the filmmaker behind Blade Runner 2049
and Arrival. The worlds, the interiors, the
exteriors, the space crafts, the spice, the worm — each articulated with a
sense of wonder, as if the director himself was awestruck by what he saw.  That vision is hampered by a number of things, but the cast
is not among its faults. Though Part One contains too many glorified
cameos, even those are handled with care.  But let’s start at the top. Timothee
Chalamet, whose genuine vulnerability makes him the perfect emo savior, is a
natural for Paul. There is depth and almost humor to the performance. Even with
only the first part of his journey completed by the end of the 2 hour and 35 minute
film, his arc is clearly underway. Oscar Isaac is so wonderfully Oscar Isaac as Paul’s noble
but human father, and Rebecca Ferguson is exquisitely tortured as Paul’s mother.
Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa and especially Javier Bardem all
leave impressions with minimal screen time. Problem #1 is that Dune Part 1 is half a film. You
can make a multi-part story and still have several lovely, complete, standalone
films. Kill Bill did it. Dune did not. It ends at the halfway
point and that is exactly how it feels: 2 and a half hours to halfway there. The second concern is that the source material is a white savior
film. By casting almost exclusively people of color as the indigenous Fremen
people of the conquered planet Arrakis, Villeneuve was at least facing the
issue directly. That same laudable decision also exacerbated the situation, however,
by turning Dune from a metaphorical white savior story into a literal
white savior film, as the very white Chalamet takes on the mantle of messiah to
lead the Fremen toward salvation.  He’s a dreamy messiah whose hair is forever mussed and
hanging in his big, brown (for the moment) eyes, sure. But we know where this
is going, even if we have no idea when we’ll get to see it arrive as Dune
Part 2 is not yet filming."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," If there can ever be a moment of triumph for a director, when the anxiety of influence is vanquished – for a bit, anyway – then Denis Villeneuve might have achieved it. This eerily vast and awe-inspiring epic, a cathedral of interplanetary strangeness, is better than the attempt a generation ago by an acknowledged master. David Lynch’s Dune from 1984 was an interesting, rackety, flawed movie that attempted to cram the entirety of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel into its running time – the result was like Flash Gordon without the laughs. Villeneuve, with his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, has used less than half the book (with a second episode to come) and allowed it room to grow: to breathe and drift through unimaginably vast reaches of fictional galaxies, with images of architecturally enormous spacecraft moving into view, or delicately lowering themselves on to alien landscapes of parched and austere beauty, particularly the ravishingly pure desert landmass of “Dune”, the contested planet itself. Star Wars’ debt to Dune, and now Dune’s debt to Star Wars, has been extensively discussed (amusingly, Dune gives us moving holograms rather like the one in which Princess Leia first begged Obi-Wan Kenobi for help). But this blockpulverising film feels more like TE Lawrence’s imperious version of The Phantom Menace. This is how it ought to have been. Dune’s story takes place millennia into the future, in which the ruling class live like Renaissance Italian princes, occasionally impressing wax seals on documents with signet rings as if they have just arrived at Hampton Court by boat. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, son and heir to the distinguished Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), whose family has just been ordered by the emperor to take up the lucrative governorship of the desert planet Arrakis, or “Dune”. It is their task to suppress or appease its indigenous people, the Fremen, but get the sole commercial exploitation rights for the planet’s mineral, “Spice”, which, properly refined, gives the consumer superhuman mental powers (although oddly this transformation is never shown on screen). The previous masters, the Harkonnen, led by its obese baron (Stellan Skarsgård) are furious at their ejection, but understand that this is a political stratagem by the emperor, to undermine the overweeningly powerful Atreides family with an impossible colonial posting. As for Paul, his most intense relationship is with his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is part of a Jedi-like sorceress cult called the Bene Gesserit, led by the glowering Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling). Paul is inheriting their mind-control powers and with them weird intuitions of destiny. He could be the messianic insurgent leader dreamed of by the embattled Fremen, and particularly the defiant young Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya), with whom Paul is fated to fall in love. Villeneuve is superb at juxtaposing the colossal spectacle with the intimate encroachment of danger and a mysterious dramatic language that exalts the alienness of every texture and surface. Perhaps even more than in his previous film, Blade Runner 2049 (another audacious reinvention), the sound design and musical score of this film is compelling: it throbs, grinds and whispers through the cinema. There is a superb scene in which Paul realises that a tiny metal insect floating towards him in his private chamber is a hunter-seeker, a remote-controlled device intended to kill him. As this insidious little object with its sharp sting approaches, Paul remains still and calm until the very last heart-stopping split-second, knowing that any sudden moves will allow the device to locate his position. The other disturbing predator to be evaded in Dune is the gigantic and bizarre sandworm that snakes under the planet surface, and occasionally surfaces, to reveal its huge … what? Mouth? Anus? Or some other aperture, like the tip of an elephant’s trunk. Either way, its appearance spells real trouble for those unlucky to be close enough to make out the ring of fine hairs around that massive orifice of doom. As one character unselfconsciously says: “The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.” What Dune offers us is not quite that, more an unreality, a giant variant version of the universe, with its own culture, society, rituals, physics and chemistry. An experience is definitely what it is."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"A spectacle of epic proportions. Villeneuve's faithful adaptation is a memorable experience that transports you. A big scale space opera with an incredible cast, cinematography and sound. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Oct 20, 2021",NEGATIVE,"  The current movie world is one in which IP — aka intellectual property — is king. If some past movie or TV show has good name recognition, chances are someone out there has plans to remake or reboot it for modern audiences. Dune definitely fits those parameters even though its source material, Frank Herbert’s novel, came out almost 60 years ago, and the most well-known adaptation, David Lynch’s 1984 movie, was considered a failure.  The new version, written and directed by Denis Villeneuve, is probably one of the best-looking films of the year, but one whose complexity may leave audiences cold. In somewhat of a nutshell, the film centers on Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), whose father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), leads a group that has been designated to overtake the caretaking of Arrakis, a planet rich with a powerful spice prized by many in this particular galaxy.  Not everyone approves of the House Atreides taking over the harvesting of the spice, especially the former caretakers, the House Harkonnen, led by the portly Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård). The Atreides must also deal with the Fremen, the natives of Arrakis who only wish to be left in peace to live in the desert, as well as giant sandworms that roam the dunes and threaten to disrupt the spice harvesting.  Villeneuve, along with co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, does a great job of showing the epic nature of the story, but when it comes time to explain why it’s so grand, he comes up lacking. The mythology of the Dune world is clearly deep, but the film, despite its running time of two-and-a-half hours, takes little time to guide the audience through the intricacies of its competing factions or terminology. Instead, viewers are left on their own to understand each particular unfamiliar phrase, or most significantly, the magic powers that Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), seem to possess.  Also, anyone hoping to indulge in a bit of Chalamet-Zendaya shipping are out of luck because Zendaya’s character, Chani, is hardly in the film. Although the marketing doesn’t indicate as much, the film points out right away that this is merely Part 1 of the story. In this part, Paul seems to have a weird psychic connection to Chani, but she’s mostly shown in brief, wordless flashes, only getting a small amount of dialogue toward the end of the film.  One might think that a film that’s telling only half the story would have plenty of time to set up the character dynamics and stakes of the saga at large, but Villeneuve and his team struggle in this regard. They seem much more interested in portraying the scale — both literally and metaphorically — of everything in the film, forgetting that all of the grandiosity only matters if the audience cares about the people involved. Several significant characters meet their doom in the film, but their sacrifices and/or comeuppances have all the emotion of a business meeting.  The performances in the film are all strong enough to keep the characters interesting even when their stories are not. Chalamet, Ferguson, and Isaac make for a nice, if age-inappropriate, family, and Jason Momoa turns in one of his strongest roles to date as a soldier who has a personal investment in protecting them. Skarsgård gets to have fun in an unusual role for him, and Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem make the most of their relatively small roles.  Sci-fi lovers may revel in the idea that the vast worlds of Dune are finally getting the showcase they deserve, but anyone who wants to truly know what the story is about will either have to see the movie more than once or do some Internet research. Part 2 may hold the answers and emotion that this film does not, but it’s a curious approach to withhold even a hint of those things the first time around. 1.

"Oct 20, 2021",NEUTRAL," Culture writer Steven Kelly of the BBC may have anointed Denis Villeneuve “the sci-fi director of the 21st century” a mere fifth of the way in with decades to go (hyperbole much, Steven?). Nonetheless, thanks in part to Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, the 54-year-old Canadian is certainly leading the field by a large margin. But this is Dune. It’s not an insular time bender or long-distance sequel to an established property. This is a worshipped literary Holy Grail that has been chased by many for years and killed a few careers along the way. Even a consummate blockbuster auteur like Villeneuve had challenges. Could any Dune adaptation appease the book-is-better-than-the-movie cultists this fantasy tome carries? The dedicated fanbase who can distill their melange, play a baliset, and tell their Gom Jabbar from their Kwisatz Haderach are showing up regardless. More importantly, especially when it comes to scoring the kind of crowds to create a franchise, can the uninformed come to Dune and leave inspired and impressed? Can casual fans find the patience and headspace to take Dune’s silly jargon and pensive politics as easily as they do laser swords and sensitive energy fields emanating from a galaxy far, far away? All can be asked in a simpler way. Can the melodramatic be made mythic and can the gaudy be made truly grand? Do that and you’ve got the fans and the newbies. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune moves a great many things in spectacular fashion: sand, swords, aircraft, plots, necks, eardrums, eyelids, and more. For all its triumphant fury, what Dune doesn’t move is the heart. That is the unconquered core barrier that remains unshaken. Golly, do we ever have a jaw-dropping and cold movie! Designed to split Frank Hebert’s 1965 novel in half for an anticipated sequel, Dune focuses on a young man from the planet Caladan named Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) with two substantial birthrights. He is the lone heir of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) of the House Atreides, the new steward of the mineral-rich desert world of Arrakis. Paul is also the son of Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a Bene Gesserit conjurer whose offspring has the potential to become the messianic Kwisatz Haderach for all the known universe. Under Leto, Paul is educated and trained for military prowess and political leadership. With his mother, he is taught the supreme discipline and fortitude to achieve semi-magical dominance through a various array of Bene Gesserit metaphysical abilities.  The chess board in front of the ruling Atriedes family is one fraught with interplanetary class competition, planted superstitions, enormous sandworms, disconnection with indigenous people, competing claims for coveted spice melange, advantageous alliances, internal betrayals, and the stages set for war. The opponent in this blood feud is the warmongering House Harkonnen of the planet Giedi Prime, led by the rotund and grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). Both sides have their favored political backers in high places and boots-on-the-ground loyal subordinates (Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa for Atreides, Dave Bautista and David Dastmalchian for Harkonnen) carrying out the maneuvers of this strategic clash on the arid badlands.  Throughout this escalating conflict, Paul is tormented by vivid, melange-enhanced dreams that frame different versions of his possible future. Several cast his ascension to rebellion victory alongside the Fremen natives of Arrakis, led by the rugged Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Those fantasies include a striking Fremen wife named Chani (Zendaya) he’s never met yet. Other nightmares predict his failure and violent demise inside the heat of cruel survival duels.  If, as the movie and novel say, “dreams are messages from the deep,” which particular depth is being explored and which path will come true for Paul Atreides? To everyone else around him saying, “Dreams make good stories” and “Everything important happens when you’re awake,” they live and die by their blades and iron wills, not quizzical predictions calling for a prophet powerful enough to bridge space and time. The depth must be in the mind and the gut. Through that angle, the other binding pillar of Paul’s rise is combating fear, a classic emerging hero’s journey that has been well-told before and after Dune, and one competing with those aforementioned dreams. “Fear is the mind killer,” the movie says. All the prophecies in any given heaven can promise any number of outcomes. At some point, those successes must be fought and earned, even to the point of dealing out death, to break that distress and make a man a leader.  Timothée Chalamet is the grave vessel for the two-pronged struggle. The Call Me By Your Name Oscar nominee curiously plays both mental obstacles with the same overly blank expressions and low resonance. He furrows a brow of consternation beneath his luscious locks and guards against any extra pent-up pops of emotion in his mordant line readings. While Chalamet is not as dry as a Yorgos Lanthimos film, per se, he’s awfully close to that level, making for a rather tedious and, frankly, boring “hero” that is hard to get behind. For a movie that rarely leaves Paul’s stances, that’s a big chunk of missing moxie and spirit right in its center. That encouraging mettle has to be extruded elsewhere. Getting it from the periphery isn’t quite enough. Trying where they can, Oscar Issac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Jason Momoa offer admirable sparks of pride as the influential parents and the gallant swordsman confidantes to Paul. Zendaya hints at becoming a reinforcement in the next half, but she’s merely a far-off vision for most of this beginning part. The electricity of screen presence definitely clings to them, but the proverbial clouds are dense.  To that end, the portending is laid on thick in Dune. Screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Passengers), Eric Roth (Forrest Gump), and Villeneuve himself thankfully compress the massive narrations of the book into shortened omens of selectively paraphrased exposition. The promise of a second movie tempers the pacing and allows this opening portion to stretch and breathe with appropriate justice and due diligence. Furthermore, in a complimentary way, the sound of Dune will plaster you to your seat, whether that’s at home on HBO Max or on a proper big screen. Composer Hans Zimmer, backed by the rhythmic vocals of his Gladiator muse Lisa Gerrard and recording artist Loire Cotler, hammers out a powerhouse score that makes his “braaam” notes from Inception feel like a Fisher-Price xylophone. Tone and mood are instantly set. Combine that with engine-roaring sound design from Theo Green and you have an aural assault and the best use of Dolby Atmos and IMAX in a long, long time. It’s a shame the cinematic sound is what rattles a viewer more than the stakes and characters in this incarnation of Dune. All told, this destiny cauldron of dreams and fear makes for a heavy and grim ordeal. Yes, spectacle or not, Villeneuve’s undertaking is an ordeal at this point more than an enigmatic adventure. While the presentation is impressively built, maybe a few doses of gaudy melodrama wouldn’t have been such a bad thing. For now, this is a gorgeous, ruminative labor of exertion. Audiences will have to bank on the promise that, like the slog its source material is for three-fourths of its chapters and pages, the adventure of it all is yet to come. Call it a test, just like what’s faced by the divinely-emerging lead character.

"Oct 20, 2021",NEGATIVE,"The plot machinery grinds to a halt, as if clogged with sand, and the well-earned welcome wears out."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," Merely a few years after the publication of Frank Herbert's groundbreaking science-fiction novel ""Dune"" in 1965, filmmakers wanted to bring its incredible story to the big screen. The problem was, with the book being of such an epic and ambitious scope, a film adaptation would somehow have to bring all of that to the screen in a convincing manner: the multitude of characters, the fantastical planets, and its unique settings all presenting quite the challenge for even the most seasoned director.  One of the early attempts was by noted writer/director Alejandro Jodorowsky  (""El Topo,"" ""The Holy Mountain""), whose adaptation (documented quite well in the marvelous film ""Jodorowsky's Dune"") no doubt would've been fascinating, but sadly it never happened. The first adaptation that did get made was by David Lynch in 1984, but thanks to lots of studio interference and a forced, shortened runtime, this version turned into a pretty big mess, ultimately rushing through the events of the epic novel. Luckily, writer/director John Harrison put together a miniseries adaptation for Syfy in 2000 that turned out quite well, relaying the enormous scope of the novel rather skillfully over the course of about four and a half hours. The miniseries still stands as a great adaptation, but now, 20 years later, Oscar-nominated director Denis Villeneuve has decided to take on the incredible task of being the next filmmaker to tackle Herbert's beloved tome. He's already shown that he has quite a lot of skill behind the camera with films like ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049,"" but is he visionary enough to bring such an ambitious and truly epic tale to life? The story of ""Dune"" centers on two rival houses, Atreides and Harkonnen. As the film starts, the Emperor has declared that House Atreides, led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), will take control of the desert planet Arrakis (aka ""Dune""), the only known source of ""spice,"" which is considered the most important and valuable substance in the galaxy. The Duke's family, including his son Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), move to the planet to take over the mining of the spice, but find it something of a mess after the Harkonnen departed.  We quickly discover that Paul is no ordinary young man, learning special skills from his Bene Gesserit mother and having dreams that are of special significance, leading to the possibility that he may be the answer to a long-foretold prophecy, which is compounded by another prophecy told by the natives of Arrakis (""Fremen""). Meanwhile, the Harkonnen, led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), plot their revenge, eventually leading to a confrontation backed by a surprising co-conspirator.  It can easily be said that Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" is easily the best-looking adaptation of the novel yet. The 1984 version certainly had its charms, and the 2000 version looked great for the time, but in the subsequent years, filmmaking has come a long way, allowing Villeneuve to do so much more than was possible before. The production design, costumes, special effects, cinematography, Villeneuve's direction, on top of the score and sound, all blend together to bring these extraordinary worlds to life. The results are simply jaw-dropping to see, and are definitely fitting for the massive scope that any adaptation would require to make this unusual tale believable on the screen. However, that's what makes this next part so utterly heartbreaking. While the visuals are certainly top-notch, and brilliantly brought to the screen, the adaptation of the material itself is sadly lacking. In a similar vein to how the 1984 version rushed through much of the story (obviously a forced necessity because of the runtime), Villeneuve's new version has some strange pacing issues that see the film dragging through parts that could be trimmed down, while rushing through important plot points and events. It's a testament that I found myself asking several times ""If I hadn't read the book, and seen the other two adaptations several times, would I have any idea what's going on here?"". It wouldn't be altogether surprising to find audience members sitting through this adaptation with a rather puzzled expression on their face. As a further consequence, characters are not established very well. By the end of these two and a half hours, we don't really know much about Paul Atreides or what he's going through, nor do we know much about his mother, the Bene Gesserits, or their prophecy. And that's on top of barely even getting to see the antagonists of the story: The Harkonnen. The screenplay, by Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and Villeneuve, seems to be the film's over-arching problem. They don't take time for the important parts of the narrative or for fleshing-out the primary characters of the piece, leading to an adaptation that feels only partially complete (and not because it's only the first half of the novel). It makes it rather disconcerting that part one turned out this way because the first half of the novel is far more interesting than the second, which primarily features activities in the desert, so while I'd still like to keep my hopes up that a second film will turn out well (if it ends up getting made, that is), it would seem that that would also have to include hoping that Villeneuve and his fellow screenwriters take their time to improve the character development and pacing.  Ultimately, Villeneuve's adaptation ends up being a disappointing mixed bag. Again, the film's visual components are astounding, many of which will no doubt be top contenders for many below-the-line categories at the upcoming Oscars. However, it's all held back by a flawed foundation, resulting in an adaptation that just doesn't tell Herbert's story very well. It could very well be that part two will be a big improvement, but unless the writers buckle down and fix the vital elements that were lacking here, it would seem destined to turn out the exact same way. 2.5/4 stars."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s the year 10,191. Interstellar space travel (and therefore the known universe) is dependent on a substance called Spice, which can only be found on a hostile desert planet called Arrakis, or Dune. In a political ploy, the Emperor pits two noble houses, the honorable Atreides and the bloodthirsty Harkonnens, against each other for control of Arrakis, hoping to wipe out at least one of his major rivals. Meanwhile, the scion of House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) becomes aware of two prophesied destinies, one in which he is the all-powerful product of a religious order’s eugenics experiments, and another in which he’s the de facto ruler and godhead of Dune and its indigenous people, the Fremen. Long considered essentially unfilmable, Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune presents a far future in which feudalism, religion, and psychotropics, rather than technology, have taken humanity far into space. It’s a sprawling story with numerous contemporaneous political and ethnographic parallels, dozens upon dozens of characters, intricate plotting (more than once do its denizens refer to myriad “plans within plans”), and a healthy amount of phantasmagoria. Jodorowsky famously abandoned a (very likely unfeasible anyway) version, and of course the merits of David Lynch’s 1984, roughly two-hour condensation remain debated. Now here comes Denis Villeneuve, who has semi-recently become this generation’s go-to helmer of “smart” science fiction, and he’s basically nailed it. Lynch’s version was a narrative bastardization but a triumph of design, and acolytes of the source material have long been thirsty for a more strictly faithful adaptation of the text to fit those gorgeous, indelible images. Villeneuve’s Dune is exactly that, although he substitutes Lynch’s ornate detail for a more elegant, rigidly-lined architectural brutalism, with cavernous spaces inside and out, enormous spacecraft, and the endless negative space of a desert landscape, and that’s before you get to the gigantic, show-stopping sandworms. Filmed largely in the IMAX format, properly screened the effect is quite literally awesome. Villeneuve’s also assembled quite the cast. Chalamet does a fine job bringing both naïveté and youthful arrogance to Paul, even in his most tortured moments. He’s backed up by a lot of famous faces working some sturdy archetypes: Oscar Isaac as Paul’s father the Duke, Rebecca Ferguson as his mother Jessica (tremendous in a difficult part, all fear for her son and genuine awe at what she hopes he’ll become), Josh Brolin as a warrior poet, and even Jason Momoa as a loyal journeyman soldier. Stellan Skarsgaard and Dave Bautista also make pretty memorable impressions as the icky, brutal Baron Harkonnen and his insane, murderous nephew Rabban. For devotees of the text, seeing these images and characters rendered so impeccably might be moving in and of themselves. That minimal level of emotion might have to be the limit, though, for getting Dune made this way at all came with the compromise of filming only the first half of the book. Though promisingly actually titled Dune, Part One on-screen, the fact remains that this is only part of the story, and mostly setup for the conflicts that will play out in the back stretch. Thankfully, the dense plot — at least after a little bit of opening voice-over — is conveyed with as little mealy-mouthed exposition as possible, mostly relying on context to get the details across. Still, the finale here can’t help but feel like a bit of a downer anticlimax, and it would be a shame, after the incredible promise of this first entry, if Dune, Part Two never made its way out of the desert."
"Oct 20, 2021",NEGATIVE," Attending the morning screening of Dune at the New York Film Festival, I was hoping for an LGBTQI romantic comedy about the Pines on Fire Island. What I got was Star Bores. Clearly, there is nothing overtly queer about this adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel. Even a bare-chested Timothée Chalamet in bed sets off no sparks. As Paul Atreides, he portrays the son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, who’s assigned by the Emperor Shadda to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis.” It’s times like these when you really appreciate Wikipedia. So why is everyone so excited about controlling Arrakis and subjugating its native inhabitants? Well, it’s home to a valuable “spice” that endows its users with “a longer life span, greater vitality, and heightened awareness,” plus you need to ingest it for interstellar space travel."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,Not every shot registers as rapturous. Sometimes we're just looking at sand. And Chalamet remains more haircut than actor. Yet the film also has a credibly hard edge.
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," The patient, densely embroidered narrative invests heavily in themes of environmental, ecological and colonialist exploitation. Earnest sentiments such as “When you take a life, you take your own” go against the grain of most successful Hollywood-financed science fiction forays. Even in a post-“Star Wars” smash such as “Avatar,” still the biggest hit in the universe, the point — setting aside the anguish over genocidal imperialist conquerers — is how many enemies a noble warrior can kill under pressure, in a hurry, so that we feel good and (per “Star Wars”) wouldn’t mind putting quarters in the same game again right away. The director/co-writer Denis Villeneuve takes on less than half of Herbert’s first “Dune” novel. He and his vast army of design and effects collaborators have created a feat of visual and aural hypnosis. When the sandworms on the desert planet Arrakis rise to the surface, the toothsome sight isn’t for fright or gotchas but, rather, wonderment. When teen messiah Paul Atreides and cohorts board an ornithropter, the eight-blade dragonflyesque aircraft soars in more ways than one; it’s a triumph, one among hundreds, of digital magic, convincingly rough-hewn design and a soundscape that is truly a feat of subtle brilliance. At one point on Arrakis, the ecologist Kynes (handled with force and sublime authority by Sharon Duncan-Brewster, in a gender-switched role from the novel) says: “If you get a little higher, you’ll get a better view.” The movie, premiering simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max, does the hallucinating for you. If you’re at all interested in what a reliably compelling, stubbornly solemn commercial filmmaker can do with money, imagination and no little nerve, “Dune” is epic enough — even if there’s a wee hole in the middle, where a more compelling protagonist belongs. Timothée Chalamet is the wee hole. This is somewhat surprising, since the young actor has done so well in both period and contemporary material in recent years. Maybe it’s my fatigue with Chosen One fantasies. Partly it’s director Villeneuve’s pictorial framing of Chalamet in repose, in various moods: preoccupied Bronte hero, cliffside; psychic communicator in smoldering yet boyish close-up, about to use “The Voice” on an adversary; and so on. He’s not a big drag on the movie overall, but Chalamet’s work tends toward single notes of opaque introspection rather than chords of fuller emotion. The year is 10191.  Atreides (Chalamet) has been bred to become a  savior, though he doesn’t realize it yet, known as the kwisatz haderach. On home planet Caladan, his folks Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) get their marching orders from Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to take over the spice-mining operations on Arrakis, aka Dune, and indeed the entire planet with all its conquered citizens, known as Fremen. Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard, looking like a flying Little Face from “Dick Tracy”), former ruler of Arrakis: not happy. Always greedy. Terrible steward of Arrakin’s precious resource, which is the key (I still don’t get this part, in any version) to interplanetary travel and superpowers too trippy for a Marvel movie. Paul is a young knight, cast in the mold of King Arthur and his gang in days of old. The new “Dune” movie plays out like his quest (mostly on Arrakis) to become the much-prophesied “Muad’Dib,” who will lead the Fremen to freedom and himself to the arms of the young woman he’s dreamed about for years. The actor Zendaya plays Chani, not particularly prominent or verbal in this first installment. (If they get the green light for part two, she’ll talk more.) To what degree does Villeneuve’s “Dune” resemble a golf tee for that hoped-for second half? A little. It’s not making its first-halfness a secret. “Part One” hits the screen, right after the title, early on. “This is the only the beginning,” we’re reminded two and a half hours later. I don’t relay this information to make “Dune” seem like a chore, though to some I’m sure it will be. To me, it’s a pretty enthralling testament to Villeneuve, to cinematographer Greig Fraser, to production designer Patrice Vermette and even to composer Hans Zimmer, working without his usual bombast. Steadily, “Dune” accumulates its gallery of amazements, with some genuine suspense in key sequences, such as the rescue of the Fremen miners. Not even the conspicuous (and, I think, unfortunate) shortage of Middle Eastern actors in the Fremen ranks can thwart the achievement. Nor can Chamalet’s studious, somewhat becalmed central performance. This “Dune” is the polar opposite of David Lynch’s 1984 inchoate craziness, with Patrick Stewart running around with a pug dog and (in the movie’s standout turn) Kenneth McMillan’s lascivious, boil-laden Baron. The ideal screen “Dune” would consist of one part Lynch and two parts Villeneuve. Is there enough spice on Arrakis to make that happen?

"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"DUNE is good -- spectacular, in fact."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"For all the hype surrounding DUNE, this adaptation does not quite live up to the hysteria...good but not great."
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," You have to delve pretty deep into the cast of Denis Villeneuve’s gorgeous epic Dune before coming across a mediocrity. It’s the kind of movie that feels confident enough to bring in Charlotte Rampling for a couple scenes and trust that she can deliver the goods from behind a dark veil (she does) or let Stellan Skarsgard deliver an interstellar version of Brando’s Kurtz and have faith that it won’t be ridiculous (it’s not). Why then does the movie put the whole enterprise in the hands of Timothée Chalamet, a likeable enough actor but not exactly one who seems likely to inspire legions of desert warriors to overthrow a galactic empire? This a question whose only likely answer is that every now and again the movie industry decides one performer can be cast in anything. Right now, that performer is Chalamet. In Villeneuve’s take on Frank Herbert’s epochal 1965 science-fiction novel, which is set many thousands of years in the future when the known galaxy is ruled by an emperor and a host of squabbling royal families, Chalamet plays the hero, Paul Atreides. The intense but untested only son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul is pitched into the crucible after the Atreides family is ordered by the emperor to move from their home planet Caladan to the desert planet Arrakis where they are ambushed by the rival Harkonnens. Paul’s arc requires him to go from entitled palace-dwelling royal scion to battle-tested quasi-Jedi. Though Villeneuve has otherwise delivered a sumptuous visual feast redolent with high drama and breathtaking scenery, this is not a convincing transition for Paul. Chalamet never gives too much away as an actor. This is an odd maneuver, given that many of his roles (Call Me By Your Name, especially) are written as young men wracked with emotion. The energy he brings to Dune is somewhat dazed, toggling between passive and petulant much like the uncertain Prince Hal who Chalamet played in David Michod’s The King. This is an understandable take for a character wracked with terrifying dreams and overcoming one life-threatening crisis after another, but not the sort of personality likely to inspire followers to hurl themselves into battle. Herbert’s Paul is one of science fiction’s original Chosen One characters. Like later iterations from Luke to Neo who the character inspired, Paul is a quasi-Christ figure who combines unmatched warrior skill with a certain mystifying Zen insight that sets him apart from and ultimately above the humans who surround him. Herbert wrote much of Dune from Paul’s perspective. This put readers inside his spinning head as he juggles violent prophetic nightmares with the baffling royal intrigue which even his critical thinking and mind control education by Jessica (part of the all-female Jedi-like Bene Gesserit order) and combat training by Atreides weapons master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) cannot prepare him to master. In Villeneuve’s version, Paul’s internal struggle registers mostly as a taut tension in Chalamet’s face. This blind spot is unfortunate, because in most every other way, Villeneuve has done commendable service to Herbert’s novel. Having already shown an eye for epic futuristic vistas in Blade Runner 2049, he expands his palette with Dune to include brighter tones, an elegant design scheme marrying ancient traditions with technology thousands of years more advanced, and a sense of aristocratic ceremonial grandeur that actually enlivens rather than deadens the drama. The result is visually stunning and frequently beautiful, the blues and greens of watery Caladan contrasted with the burnt tans of Arrakis, the interior spaces vast and dusky. In some ways, it’s a far more straightforward take than David Lynch’s wonky, weird, and frequently grotesque 1984 steampunk vision and the acid hallucination that would have been Alejandro Jodorowsky’s unrealized version (the one meant to star Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, and Salvador Dali; soundtrack by Pink Floyd). Even the story’s more outré elements — like the massive and deadly sandworms that both generate the lucrative “spice” drug that makes Arrakis so valuable and make the desert-covered planet even more dangerous than its lack of water and metal-shredding sandstorms already do—are portrayed with a cool precision that does credit to Herbert’s science-based writing. For the movie’s first half, Villeneuve manages the impressive trick of covering a vast array of background exposition while still moving the story along at a pulse-quickening pace. He paints the pictures that were missing from the novel, which was more engaged with Paul’s inner struggle and deadly palace intrigues than describing things like city-sized transport ships and the helicopter-like ornithopters, whose buzzing wings give them the appearance of large metal hummingbirds. Resisting the urge of modern blockbusters to thud and thump the audience into submission, several key moments are played with an eerie quiet — a couple scenes where Imperial stormtroopers called the Sardauker float into battle with a dark grace are all the more effective for being completely silent. Most of the secondary characters are vividly represented, particularly loyal Atreides courtiers like Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa, deftly balancing charm and menace) and Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Their presence is sorely missed in the later stretch when Paul and Jessica flee to the desert and try to ally themselves with the Fremen, Arrakis’s indigenous Bedouin-like desert dwellers and the family Atreides’ best bet for getting back at the Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard, reveling in the character’s gluttonous villainy). The movie’s later sections feel truncated and not as rich. Villeneuve and his co-screenwriters Jon Spaights and Eric Roth wisely didn’t try to cover the entire novel. Instead, they called this iteration “Part One” and stopped a couple hundred pages shy of Herbert’s conclusion, when Paul has yet to convert the Fremen to his cause and unleash them like Lawrence of Arabia in a planet-spanning war of liberation. (The colonialist manipulations inherent in Paul’s rise to power in the Fremen community are only hinted at here and will likely be more explicit in a follow-up movie.) While that decision gives the story room to breathe, ending things at the moment it does also makes the movie feel like a prologue rather than a self-contained story. This is a common-enough occurrence at a time when movies are less self-contained works of art than nodes in a never-ending stream of sequels and remakes and offshoots but slightly disappointing nonetheless. Given that, it would be putting too much criticism on Chalamet to blame him (and a similarly spark-free Ferguson) for the movie’s somewhat deflating finish. Ultimately, Paul is just not a terribly fascinating hero — perhaps Lynch was onto something when he cast the flatter-than-flat Kyle MacLachlan in the role. Coming from exalted rather than humble origins, Paul is not so much dauntless as he is anointed, which is generally not a good look in a hero."
"Oct 20, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Chalamet's transformation from the young to the gritty Paul Atreides anchors and already solid and impressively rendered, technical marvel of an adaptation"
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE,"""Villeneuve approaches Herbert's text with a sense of almost religious reverence, carefully creating an intoxicatingly mysterious and undeniably immersive world."""
"Oct 20, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune, the complex, winding novel from Frank Herbert, isn’t the easiest read. Its timeline can become twisted, its plot is at times quite dense, the scale and scope of the epic massive and at times wholly unwieldy, and it takes a good bit of time for the real narrative arc to reveal itself, before things get muddled again at the end. However, the elements of the story that have mesmerized generations of fans – its hero’s journey for Paul, the galactic political intrigue, the badassery of Lady Jessica – solve a number of the book’s shortcomings. For decades, there’s been one lingering question surrounding the tale that remained unsolved: How can you bring this story to the screen without sacrificing what makes it great? Well, writer-director Denis Villeneuve and his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth have cracked the code on what made Dune seemingly unfilmable, capturing the story (at least the first half of the story) on screen in all its glory. For the uninitiated, Dune is a sci-fi epic, telling the story of young Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet, deftly balancing the complexities of a teenage boy longing for freedom while slowly coming to realize that he’s a key piece in a centuries-long game of political tug of war), heir of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, who makes the most of what little he is given to do) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, who is the beating heart of the film – presented with the hardest character to inhabit, Ferguson is utterly fascinating to watch and her choices lend so much depth to the role). The Atreides are the mortal enemies of House Harkonnen, a horrific, brutal group (as evidenced by their serpent like make-up and, well, the violence they inflict on everyone in their path) who have ruled Arrakis – aka Dune, a seemingly inhospitable desert planet that produces the highly sought after Spice – for years. When the Emperor decrees that House Atreides shall replace Harkonnen and take control of Arrakis, it appears to be a massive slight against the rich and powerful Harkonnens. But, as every character seems to innately understand – and as an audience savvy to the needs of a film such as this is familiar with – something is rotten in the state of the desert. Once Paul, Jessica, Leto, and their loyal staff – including a great Jason Mamoa as the charismatic fighter Duncan Idaho – arrive at Arrakis, Paul realizes the dreams he’s been having have been of this place and its people, potentially signaling that he has a greater purpose in this brewing war, whether he likes it or not.* *This is, of course, an over-simplification of the film’s plot, but to their credit, Villeneuve, Spaihts, and Roth do an excellent job of cutting the key elements of the plot to a manageable level, making it relatively easy to follow the story throughout. And, if you happen to be interested in diving a bit deeper into the mythology of this world, there’s always a book you can read. From impeccable casting choices (there really isn’t a single weak link in the large cast), to sweeping visuals (Villeneuve was clear that he wanted to film on practical sets at every opportunity, and it pays off in spades), to gorgeous costumes, make-up, and CGI, Dune: Part One works. The use of the actual desert as the backdrop of Arrakis emphasizes the sheer beauty and unending expanse of the dangerous landscape. Yes, the characters discuss the same, but seeing the visual makes it nearly impossible to ignore how small and insignificant they are against the unflinching power of the desert. And, with power – how it is achieved, maintained, and exerted over those without it – is the central theme of this story, seeing it play out against a world where nature doesn’t particularly care who you are, or who your family might be, makes the futility of these human battles all the more apparent. As for the issues with the film, they are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. The front half of the picture is overstuffed with exposition – necessary for the world building of the story, and hardly a shock for those who have read the novel – which occasionally lacks the finesse needed to make you forget you are being spoon fed rather dry bits of information that will come in handy down the line. That expositional nature would be less apparent – or less chafing – if the script was a bit less clinical in the early going. Characters are referenced repeatedly by their full names (the most jarring instance is Gaius Helen Mohiam’s reference to Jessica by her given name to Paul, rather than simply calling her “your mother”), key plot points are outlined explicitly rather than implicitly, and the use of an “Arrakis 101” video is helpful for those needing information on just what this desert planet has in store for our central cast of characters. For those who aren’t familiar with the novel, these instances of hand holding will be welcome* (there’s a LOT to take in, after all), but if you are familiar with the story and its characters, it might be a bit much. *I attended the film with a friend who, unlike me, has not read the novel. Aside from a handful of big picture questions – largely dealing with Lady Jessica and the Bene Gesserit, the sect of powerful and supernaturally gifted women who pull a number of the strings in the overall narrative – she found the film easy to understand and enjoyable. More importantly, she stressed that she wanted to read the book now. So, if you aren’t a Dune fan going in, you might be intrigued enough to pick up the book and see what happens in the second half once you’ve seen the film. Outside of the influx of exposition, the other misstep in the film is the lack of character development for Gurney Halleck (a great Josh Brolin) and, even more so, Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson, getting a chance to shine in a cast of much larger names). While this isn’t a real issue in this first film, I worry the ramifications of not spending time developing these characters early will lead to some problems in finding the emotional resonance with their arcs in the second part of the film. There are a lot of mouths to feed in this, part one of a proposed two-part film series, and I understand that other characters needed the time in the spotlight. But I could have done with a couple fewer dream appearances from Zendaya’s Chani (not because Zendaya isn’t great in the role – she is – but because Chani’s multiple appearances don’t add all that much to the story as presented in the film) if it would have allowed for more Thufir or Gurney this time around. Again, a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things – the film does clock in at a bit-too-long 2:35 – but something to note, nonetheless. Ultimately, Dune: Part One is a feast for the senses, hewing close to the novel but not being afraid to cut, repurpose, and streamline the story as needed. Villeneuve has created a sci-fi epic that will please fans of the source material and suck in those new to this world, its complex characters, and even more complex political machinations. And yes, it’s a film that screams to be seen in its splendor on the big screen – although there’s nothing wrong with streaming it on HBO Max should that be more suited to your comfort level. Either way, Dune: Part One is well worth your time. Hopefully you will agree, and it will generate enough money – and good will – to necessitate the green lighting of Part Two."
"Oct 19, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune: an impossible feat, a poisoned chalice, a sprawling pillar of science fiction. A lot has been written on the complexities of adapting a book like Frank Herbert’s Dune, with its mythology so steeped in detail and history that even legendary filmmakers like Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch have tried and failed to bring their visions to life (the latter has gone as far as to disown his 1984 take). Co-writer and director Denis Villeneuve – who back in 2016, made Arrival, one of the most intelligent, intimate, yet grand films in the science fiction canon – here takes a different approach: to split Herbert’s hefty tome in half. Dune is, by its title card’s own admission, merely Part I of a hopeful two-parter. It’s a risky play, considering a Part II has yet to be greenlit by Warner Bros.; whether the Canadian filmmaker’s gamble pays off will depend wholly on Dune’s box office success. However, with an unfathomable budget at his disposal, and two and a half hours dedicated solely to the book’s first half, Villeneuve is able to take the scenic route to establishing Herbert’s vision. Amidst a galactic empire fraught with political machinations, secret orders and warring factions, Dune concerns itself most with House Atreides, one of the many dynastic powers under the Imperium. The head of the House, Duke Leto Atreides (an ever-fantastic Oscar Isaac, whose repeated yelling of “desert power!” is as entertaining as it is bizarre) is tasked by the unseen Emperor to take over rule of Arrakis, a desert planet rich in the galaxy’s most valuable substance: Spice. A coveted commodity that extends life and fuels interstellar travel, spice (or melange) shares its home with colossal, territorial sandworms, and native peoples called the Fremen. Prior to Atreides’ appointment, the Arrakis mining operation had been overseen by their rival – House Harkonnen, led by Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard, ghoulish and near unrecognisable) – for over 80 years. Duke Leto senses that his unexplained promotion is a trap but, powerless to refuse the Emperor’s call, emigrates his family and their military forces to the sandy world. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, whose fine-boned silhouette cuts a lonely shape amid Dune’s vast landscapes) is the film’s archetypal hero and heir to House Atreides, a “chosen one” figure with strange abilities he struggles to control. Unsure of his place in the world, from the beginning Paul is plagued by strange visions of a blue-eyed Fremen girl (Zendaya, given little to do in a role that’s clearly earmarked for future development). They foreshadow death and ruin, but also hope – and though he may understand them fully, he knows enough to keep details hidden even from those closest to him. His mother and Leto’s concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is also a member of the Bene Gesserit, a secretive and ancient order of women who use genetic experimentation, political scheming, and religious engineering to further their own agenda. Jessica believes her son to be their long-prophesised saviour and result of a centuries-long eugenics program: the Kwisatz Haderach. It’s in how Dune paints Paul as a messianic figure that issues begin to arise. “The outsiders ravage our lands in front of our eyes. Their cruelty to my people is all I’ve known,” Chani states plainly in her introductory voiceover. “Who will our next oppressors be?” she then questions. These opening words promise a critique of Western colonialism, how it built its own wealth from looting indigenous resources, and its history of oppression – or at the very least, they indicate some subversion of the white saviour narrative that is otherwise set up by Dune’s choice of protagonist. Yet Villeneuve’s Dune fails to provide any kind of follow-through. The initial premise – that Paul is a messiah fated to free the Bedouin-coded (despite what Javier Bardem‘s casting would suggest) Arrakis natives – goes totally unchallenged. With a Part II, the whole may yet prove itself to be more than the sum of its parts; but alone, Dune Part I feels bitterly conservative. Away from its problems with storytelling, where Dune thrives is in its beauty and scale. The production design does as much heavy lifting as the dialogue in its creation of signposts, by which viewers can more comfortably navigate Dune’s expanse. Each faction and setting has its own visual identity, from the oil-spill darkness of Giedi Prime and the cool palette of Caladan, to Arrakis’ rich colouring and glittering heat. Meanwhile, the film’s vastness is emphasised by Greig Fraser’s wide and largely static cinematography, which revels in the oppressive majesty of Dune’s many worlds. Together with Hans Zimmer’s dread-filled score, full of guttural howls, wailing choirs, bagpipes, and reverberating percussion, Dune is crushing. It may seem redundant to labour the film’s enormous scale – it is, after all, a Villeneuve film – but in the case of Dune, its size and beauty truly cannot be overstated. With all this emphasis on largeness and atmosphere however, the story and its characters are all-too-often flattened by Dune’s icy heft. Emotional resonance and narrative substance are forgone in favour of grim artistic grandeur. With all the legwork Villeneuve performs to set up a future series, Dune comes out rather top-heavy: though an immensely successful exercise in world-building, the filmmaker’s favouring of spectacle leaves room for little else. By the time Dune puts in place its disparate threads and an image begins to emerge, the credits are rolling. Though Villeneuve’s is unquestionably the most successful adaptation the world has yet seen, once the awe for its artistic merit begins to dim, Dune is left feeling like the overture (albeit, one of astonishing splendour) to a grander opera. Now, whether Dune will go down as a science-fiction great or whether it will be remembered as a film that pushed the limits of visual artistry, depends entirely on whether a Part II ever gets made."

"Oct 19, 2021",POSITIVE," I awaited Dune with palpable excitement. A Dune adaptation by Denis Villeneuve! It sounded like a match made in heaven. Admittedly, at that point I hadn’t read the source material, nor had I seen the David Lynch stab. I HAD seen Jodorowsky’s Dune, the documentary detailing the Chilean cult filmmaker’s aborted attempt at bringing Frank Herbert’s sci-fi opus to life. And that alone was enough to convince me of its inherent difficulty to master on the big screen. “But Villeneuve!” I said to myself. It’s funny that I had so much faith, as I’m actually a bit hot and cold on Hollywood’s new go-to science fiction master. I thought his major breakthrough Arrival was quite good when it dealt with world shattering political ramifications, but quite ill-fitting when it turned maudlin. Blade Runner 2049 was one of the best films I saw in its year. On that strength of the neon-soaked latter film, my enthusiasm powered on. Near rave reviews out of TIFF and other festivals followed, and just before Hannah and took our own journey to a desert land (in this case, Joshua Tree), I dedicated myself to finally reading the original text. For the record, I made it to page 200. I didn’t stop out of disinterest. I plan on picking it back up, but I got caught up in other assignments and other films to review. At the very least, ahead of our screening, I felt I had the tools to properly contextualize the happenings that would unfold in front of me. And in my infinite wisdom, I augured that perhaps I could find myself rejuiced about the whole prospect, even if it meant I would be forever looking at Timothee Chalamet in my mind’s eye. As the minutes ticked by through our showing, a sense of worry began to creep over me. Why am I struggling to get into this? All the pieces are there. The bones of the story are pretty much in place, and visual factor, while a bit monochrome just by virtue of the material, was in no way lacking. Truly, it’s inarguable that Villeneuve and his crew are the first filmmakers to nail the world building of Herbert’s vision. Everything is there, the technology, the various uniforms and protective outfits, the sandworms (of course), and I even came away with a better understanding of what “the voice” is and what mentats do when they’re pulling together their calculations. Even the casting is pretty much as good as I could imagine it would shape up, from Oscar Isaac as a solidly stern if occasionally verging on bland Duke Leto, to Rebecca Ferguson‘s pitch perfect Lady Jessica. Even the supporting cast more or less fits well, and I particularly liked Josh Brolin sliding into the role of the no nonsense Gurney Halleck, while Stellan Skarsgard somehow has made Baron Harkonen an even more disgusting figure than I’ve come used to. So why did I come away, by the time the credits rolled, with a sense that something was missing? It really boils down to what Villeneuve decided to set his focus on, and in this case, it’s all about scale. Almost every shot of Dune is intended to impress, and boy does it ever. Despite the fact that our screening was a little compromised (thank you AMC employee that decided to keep the light on in the screening room, reflecting right in the middle of the screen for half the movie), the technical wizardry and sense of being transported into another place altogether is impossible to deny. And for many, that may be all they’re looking for, and more power to you. But despite that, and despite the fact that Villeneuve bifurcates the novel into two films, with Part One being emblazoned on the title card, he still made a few sacrifices in the adaptation and it let to a narrative choice I found hard to overcome. While its extremely loyal to the overall structure and “A to B to C” elements of the book, there must have been a decision made during the scripting process to cut down much of the characterization down to the bone. The world building becomes prioritized, and the emotional core evaporates. So instead of Thufir Hawat being a friendly mentor to Paul, he’s just this guy that works for his dad that he embraces once. Instead of diving deeper into the relationship between Leto and Jessica, which informs so much of her early journey in the novel, they only get a brief moment together in bed with Leto quickly saying “I should have married you”. And poor Dr. Yueh…his entire struggle becomes deleted wholesale, maybe to maintain some of the mystery, but his logic for his actions seems to come out of nowhere. And you may say to me, “Kyle, none of this matters”, but you know what? It matters to me, not because I’m some stickler for adaptations needing to reflect their source material page for page, but to instead better reflect the actual strengths of that material. I think this has been the ongoing problem with Dune adaptations in the first place. Everyone wants the visionary director to come in and bring this epic fantasy (and yes, it’s far more a fantasy than space opera) to life, but each filmmaker that has been lined up to match that line of thinking in retrospect never really seems to be the best fit for bringing out what actually works about Herbert’s vision. Maybe The Last Duel has me in a biased frame of mind, but this felt like a job for someone as workmanlike as Ridley Scott. Strangely, the film’s biggest highlight is a character who is given a good deal more material than I’ve seen in the book itself, as Jason Momoa‘s Duncan Idaho brings about the rare scenes when the film escapes the inertness that permeates much of its running time. His performance is a bit anachronistic, but I’ll take it for a character I can actually maintain a connection with. And the point at which he begins to impact the plot also coincides with where I dropped off the book, and I should say the film started to improve. Perhaps the lesson here is, as advertised, don’t read the book before you see the film. Honestly, I’m a bit envious of those that will have that experience. It’s not that I think Dune as a film is bad, it’s just pretty good, when it had the potential to be great. Maybe I’ll hold off on the rest for Part 2, if it ever happens."
"Oct 19, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Grander and grimmer than the David Lynch version, with spectacular visuals -- but curiously bloodless. In splitting it up into two films, this one feels like all set-up with little payoff."
"Oct 19, 2021",NEGATIVE," CHICAGO - Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel ""Dune"" has long seemed unadaptable. David Lynch and stars Kyle MacLachlan and Virginia Madsen gave it a crack in 1984, resulting in a strange, S&M-inspired take that condensed the 600-page doorstop to about two hours. That ""Dune"" captured the psychedelic spirit of the novel, but not its scope. And a pair of Sci-Fi (now SYFY) Channel miniseries in the 2000s had sufficient room to let the story’s ideas breathe, but suffered from budgetary (among other) limitations.  But now, Quebecois auteur Denis Villeneuve brings ""Dune"" to the big screen once again. This titanic adaptation of ""Dune"" is perhaps the most gorgeous, sharply-realized vision of the world yet. It also happens to effectively be half a movie, its huge cast of characters lost in the infinite sands of its setting, drowned in oodles of lore. To whittle the dense, complicated premise of ""Dune"" to its core: In the far future, humanity has spread among the stars thanks to a life-enhancing, space-folding super-dust known as Spice. The problem is, Spice can only be found on one planet: Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, an inhospitable planet filled with giant sandworms and an indigenous population (known as the Fremen) understandably opposed to imperial colonization.  Enter the House Atreides, a noble family recently tasked by the emperor to take stewardship of Dune after kicking out their rivals, House Harkonnen. Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and young son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) come to the planet by Imperial decree, only to walk into a trap set by the malevolent Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, enveloped in prosthetics and makeup).  The family’s only hope lies in Paul, who begins having visions as a result of his consumption of Spice. There are prophecies about the young man, prophecies which took root long before Paul set foot on the desert planet: that the young Atreides is a messiah, destined to free the Fremen and bring about a new era for humanity.  Don’t expect to get very far into that journey, however; the frustrating, albeit understandable, thing about Villeneuve’s adaptation is that it only covers the first half of the book it’s adapting. Even the title card reads ""Dune: Part One,"" a gentle indicator that the next two and a half hours are going to be filled with setup. And set up it does: The screenplay, penned by ""Prometheus"" scribe Jon Spaihts alongside Eric Roth and Villeneuve himself, spends a whole lot of time establishing the strange, alien universe it clearly wants to explore further in other installments. It’s reasonably effective, all things considered, but it’s not all that satisfying.  The writers wisely give ample space for scenes involving Paul’s budding place in this interstellar tapestry, leaning into the elements of the novel that serve as a coming-of-age story. But other scenes breeze by with the speed of Dan Brown chapters, Villeneuve cutting back to the Harkonnens for a quick explanation of that storyline before flitting back to Dune for more character-building with our main cast.  One of the major challenges facing anyone who attempts to adapt ""Dune"" for the screen is the sheer volume of characters and subplots necessary for its main story to work. Villeneuve does his level best to pick a lane (Paul) and stick to it, but it means the rest of the colors on his palette get muddled.  But if the adaptation makes some missteps, the same cannot be said of the visual storytelling. ""Dune"" looks as though every penny of its budget (reportedly in the ballpark of $165 million) was put to good use. Villeneuve conjures a fully-realized universe rich with texture, thanks in no small part to Patrice Vermette’s production design and Greig Fraser’s sand-dusted cinematography. That level of excellence exists elsewhere in the film as well. Jacquline West and Bob Ward’s costumes do more world-building than a million monologues ever could. The Harkonnens are kitted out in slick black leather to fit their hairless, pale visages, while the Bene Gesserit (think ‘space witches’ and you’re not far off) move about in sheer veils to obscure their faces and their shadowy plans for humanity.  Villeneuve has been adamant that viewers should see ""Dune"" in a theater, and it's easy to understand why: The grand scope of the thing cries out for the biggest screen possible, and the booming sound design and Hans Zimmer’s almost overwhelming score deserve suitably robust speakers. Vermette's production design blends brutalist futurism with rococo curves and impossible shapes, a mix that's truly something to behold.  But like many expensive-looking sci-fi adaptations — see Apple TV+’s ""Foundation"" for another recent example — the human element of ""Dune"" is dwarfed by the film’s big ideas and even bigger canvas. Chalamet’s Paul is all brooding insecurity, half his lines mumbled as if his jaw is wired shut; he finds moments of nuance and intensity in Paul’s furtive steps into the role of unlikely messiah, but he’s limited by the stone-faced tone of Villeneuve’s take.  Most of the rest of the characters get little to set themselves apart from their staid proclamations. The only exceptions are Josh Brolin’s grumpy Gurney Halleck and Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, action heroes set loose in a sea of self-seriousness. The reliable Rebecca Ferguson acquits herself with grace, and her work makes Jessica the closest thing the film has to a dimensional, fully-realized character. The rest, alas, are cogs in the worldbuilding machine, fighting for screentime before many of them are unceremoniously offed. As a result, ""Dune"" feels like a whole lot of place-setting, as though it’s an incredibly expensive pilot episode for a TV show that may never become a series. Here’s to hoping that solid streaming numbers and an already-respectable overseas box office take give Villeneuve the latitude to make ""Dune: Part Two."" The path is laid before him now: the story must flow.  155 minutes. Rated PG-13. In theaters, on IMAX and streaming on HBO Max Oct. 22. Dir: Denis Villeneuve.

"Oct 19, 2021",NEUTRAL," Beautifully shot, imaginatively realized and with a narrative clarity that eluded David Lynch, Denis Villeneuve’s take on the Frank Herbert epic-doorstop novel Dune benefits from being only half-told (it advertises itself as Dune: Part I). Given that, it’s not exactly a spoiler to say this Dune ends with a cliffhanger. But the story it does tell is evocative, painting a big picture and leaving the viewer – well, me anyway – with a clearer understanding of a plot I’ve absorbed before. This might be a Dune that could even be appreciated by someone unfamiliar with Dune. The parts of Herbert’s 1965 novel that later informed Star Wars are undeniable. There’s a load of exposition to start the show, a “chosen one” on a desert planet, an ancient society of defenders possessed of a mind-bending power called The Voice, and even an evil Emperor. But Villeneuve zeroes in and amplifies another of Herbert’s obvious metaphors. The desert planet Arrakis is a benighted place, cursed with being the sole source of a substance called “spice,” without which space travel is impossible. This invites colonization by major powers for this one item of immeasurable value. Middle East oil, anyone? Notwithstanding their blue eyes, the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, seem tailored to evoke Arabs of an uncertain era. Dune drops us into a shift in the guardianship of Arrakis, with the Emperor effectively ending the administration of the evil clan Harkonnen, whose patriarch is the ugly and oleaginous Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård, who’s great in anything). The new landlords will be the Atreides, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his heir Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a line of women possessed of great powers. When Paul, a male, starts exhibiting those powers, it causes great consternation. Meanwhile, even as he apparently evolves, Paul has dreams of a young Fremen woman on Arrakis (Zendaya). So off to the desert planet we go, with hearty comrades (including Jason Momoa, and Josh Brolin as Paul’s battle mentor), hints of a set-up, and an all-out engagement to follow between the Harkonnens and Atreides. What Villeneuve’s Dune is, is big. The cities on other worlds are huge, the architecture monumental. The ships are impressive, the spice-mining machines are like prehistoric creatures and the ornithopters – the desert flying machines –  are like imaginatively reverse-engineered giant bugs. And, of course, there are the worms, whose very subterranean advances cause the ground to shift. All jaw, they look like they could eat the slugs in Tremors for breakfast. To be clear, this is not a story told at a Star Wars pace. The necessary set-ups of plot and character are attended to before the spice hits the fan (the first battle scene is an hour in), but the film remains alive even in quiet moments, such that the it doesn’t feel as long as it is. (Two hours, 35 minutes)."
"Oct 19, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Dune is a perfectly staid and sensible cinematic translation of a book that has seemingly defied such a thing for decades now, and if that is all that you are looking for it to be, then you will probably like it."
"Oct 19, 2021",NEGATIVE," At the core of the film is a struggle for power over resources; a time-old tale, but in this case it’s a spice on the planet Dune or Arakis.  This spice has healing powers, longevity and the ability to fold space and time.  Of course, the indigenous people, the Fremen, using their planet’s elements to survive, are overtaken and brutally ruled by the  evil Harkonnens.  The Emperor, in order to squash the growing power of the Atreides from the planet Caladan lead by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and his witchy wife Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) who bore him a forbidden son, Paul (Timothee Chalamet), ousts the Harkonnens and places Duke Leto at the helm of Arakis.  (Are you still with me?)  A bold militaristic move by the Emperor which sets up the ensuing onslaught of battles to come. This complicated tale — this is only Part I of II — focuses upon that forbidden son, Paul.  Is he the chosen one? Is he the one all people have prophesied? With plenty of religious references, Paul is tested to make that determination.  Paul’s teacher, his mother, also questions whether or not her son is “the one” as they fight for their lives and begin to understand the power of the people and this orange spice. The cast is an all-star one with Chalamet, Isaac, Ferguson, as well as Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista  Charlotte Rampling, Stephen McKinley Henderson and many more.  Chalamet is the star as he portrays Paul who is coming into his own.   This boy is haunted by his visions, particularly of a Fremen woman (Zendaya), as Chalamet finds a small range of personality to connect us with this character.  And Ferguson’s strength as she depicts a mother who is trying to protect her son comes across as one of the best performances in the huge cast. “Dune” is a long-winded and bloated film typifying what men do to overpower others…they fight.  While there’s a glimmer of hope with the character of Duke Leto, it’s not enough.  And yes, the special effects are quite special, but the battle scenes are so repetitive and long that they become dull and ineffectual.  Perhaps Part II wouldn’t have been necessary if the writers would have focused on doing one thing…telling the story."
"Oct 19, 2021",POSITIVE," There’s something perfect about the fact that Dune – the epochal 1965 science-fiction novel by Frank Herbert – has defeated filmmaker after filmmaker for over five decades. The book, after all, is set primarily on the desert planet of Arrakis, a world whose sheer environmental hostility has vanquished several would-be colonial powers. A cinematic adaptation of Dune has proven similarly challenging to conquer, and over the years several incarnations of the project have lurched through Development Hell. Avant-garde director Alejandro Jodorowsky famously sunk $2 million into pre-production in the 1970s before his version was ultimately scrapped. (It’s tantalizing to imagine the film Jodorowsky might have delivered, given that early casting plans included Orson Welles, Udo Kier, Gloria Swanson, Mick Jagger, and Salvador Dalí.) It was David Lynch who first successfully shepherded Herbert’s novel to the big screen, but his 1984 feature – while intriguingly weird in its way – is generally regarded as a disappointment, both as a film and as an adaptation. The mixed-to-negative reaction to Lynch’s Dune perhaps inevitably nurtured a feeling that the definitive adaptation of Herbert’s novel was still out there, waiting to be discovered. John Harrison directed a relatively faithful three-part telefilm version for the Sci Fi Channel in 2000, but it failed to make much of a cultural splash beyond the author’s die-hard fan base. Subsequent attempts at a feature film sputtered out, but Dune’s cinematic prospects turned around when Legendary Pictures snapped up the rights and brought on board director Denis Villeneuve – who had reportedly long dreamed of adapting Herbert’s influential saga. Four years later – five if one includes an 11-month pandemic-related release delay – and the new Dune is finally upon us. (Or, to be precise, Dune: Part One, as the on-screen title card asserts.) Whatever else one can say about this latest cinematic iteration of the story, it feels properly monumental. This Dune is extravagant, immersive, and serious-minded, almost to a fault. Co-written by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Hollywood screenplay A-lister Eric Roth, the new feature sticks quite close to Herbert’s original text, at least in terms of its plot, a notoriously dense snarl of intergalactic politicking and bewildering mystical gobbledygook. The film does, however, excise some of the novel’s original depth, flattening its sophisticated multi-dimensionality in favor of more spectacle-focused sci-fi blockbuster aims. Perhaps this is inevitable for any cinematic adaptation, given that Dune’s most exceptional qualities are dependent to some extent on the medium of the novel. From such a perspective, the new film is arguably the best-case scenario for a page-to-screen translation of Herbert’s work. Villeneuve’s version is a suitably transportive sci-fi epic that tackles the novel’s intricate world-building and complex thematic terrain quite earnestly, even if the latter necessarily feels a little shallow. It is comparable to Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy in this respect: Although perhaps not the “definitive” adaptation that some purists would demand, it has been pragmatically yet smartly reshaped to suit the cinematic medium, while also sparing no expense when it comes to the realization of Herbert’s otherworldly vistas. Notwithstanding the story’s reputation for byzantine political and religious intrigue, Dune’s core premise is fairly straightforward. In the year 10,191, the galactic Emperor Shaddam IV revokes colonial control of the planet Arrakis from the brutal House Harkonnen and hands it to the comparatively honorable House Atreides. Arrakis’ sands are the only source of melange, commonly called “spice,” a strange psychoactive substance that is necessary for interstellar space travel. The planet is accordingly the most precious jewel in the Imperium. The story of Dune: Part One is essentially the story of House Atreides’ efforts to settle into its new fiefdom and assert control over Arrakis’ spice extraction industry. Unfortunately – spoiler alert for the most popular science-fiction novel of all time – the Emperor’s munificence is merely a pretext, meant to position House Atreides for swift elimination. These events are witnessed through the eyes of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the young heir-apparent to the house’s leader, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Adventurous and freethinking, Paul is ambivalent about his status as House Atreides’ sole scion, but he is enthusiastic about the prospect of relocating to the desert planet. Well before he sets foot on its parched surface, Paul has already eagerly familiarized himself with Arrakis and its hard-bitten native people, the Fremen. What’s more, he has been haunted by vivid dreams about the planet and a mysterious Fremen woman (Zendaya) – who may be his lover or his killer, depending on the dream. Paul’s psychic sensitivity to these visions is a sort-of-genetic, sort-of-magical gift from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). In addition to being Duke Leto’s concubine, Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a secretive cabal of female mystics who cultivate supernatural abilities and manipulate galactic politics from the shadows. Paul’s entire existence, it turns out, is tangled up in the Bene Gesserit’s centuries-spanning messianic machinations, which have also influenced the religious beliefs of the Fremen. Paul thus finds himself pulled in different directions by forces who see him variously as the inheritor of his noble house, as a prophesied messiah figure, or as an inconvenient threat to be sidelined or simply crushed. Paul is loyal to his parents, but he is also determined to write his own radical, syncretic story. His visions – which kick into overdrive once he is exposed to Arakkis’ spice – show him a future in which he is living with the Fremen people, liberating them from oppression and leading them to military victories. This barely scratches the surface of Dune’s convoluted plot and mythology, and there are easily a dozen more named characters in the film beyond those mentioned above. If one wanted to be reductionist, however, one could describe it as a sci-fi reskinning of Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Herbert was certainly not coy about the influence of T.E. Lawrence’s real-world exploits on his saga. (In one of those serendipitous historical footnotes, Lawrence director David Lean was even briefly attached to helm a Dune adaptation.) Villeneuve’s film version moderately obfuscates the obvious real-world parallels via racially and ethnically diverse casting, but Dune is still partly the story of a privileged outsider who embeds himself among a desert-dwelling people and aids them in their conflict against colonial powers. Hans Zimmer’s characteristically overwhelming score certainly never lets the viewer forget the pseudo-Arabic qualities of the Fremen, given how often the film’s soundscape is pierced by the kind of vaguely Middle-Eastern ululations that Team America: World Police was satirizing 17 years ago. Herbert was aware of the creakiness of such Chosen One / White savior stories, and Dune in part represents his effort to unpack messianic tropes by executing them as thoughtfully as he could manage. Even with its 155-minute running time and a second feature allegedly planned, Villeneuve’s Dune unavoidably loses some of the novel’s multi-layered intricacy, and thus its embrace of such tropes feels more ingenuous. Still, the film manages to add some ambiguous shading to Paul’s journey by highlighting his iconoclastic tendencies and his reactive skepticism to the schemes unfolding around him. Paul trusts his own intuition more than his myriad would-be manipulators, however benevolent their intentions. That intuition is pointing him decisively into the trackless wastes of Arrakis – which are secretly teeming with life, wisdom, and power. Even Paul’s visions are laced with uncertainty and darkness, however. At one point, he sees himself as a god-emperor leading a galaxy-spanning holy war, a potential future that prompts him to instinctively recoil in horror. The film’s biggest weakness, narratively speaking, is that it feels very much like the first half of a five-hour movie, not a standalone feature. It concludes quite abruptly, just as Paul and Jessica arrive at one of the subterranean Fremen city-states. Dune is juggling a lot of balls, thematically speaking, from environmentalism to religious prophecy to the folly of empire. Notwithstanding its exceedingly grave tone, Villeneuve’s film version does not delve too deeply into these topics, although it considers them with more adult-minded introspection than most Hollywood blockbusters with comparable budgets. It is certainly not cerebral sci-fi on the same level as the director’s prior genre efforts (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049), but it undeniably thrives on a similar sense of deliberative awe (and terror). Dune is the most action-heavy feature that Villeneuve has made to date, but despite the impressiveness of some set pieces – a nail-biting sand worm attack and a hellish Harkonnen military assault are highlights – the film is at its most compelling when it slows down to simply gawk in wonder at these worlds that Herbert dreamed into existence. Indeed, if there is one factor that makes this Dune a must-see for science-fiction aficionados – or any cinephile who delights in the medium’s power to conjure astonishing alternate realities – it is the film’s striking visuals. On one hand, Dune broadly looks the way one might imagine a Villeneuve-directed Dune would look. On the other, there are details both fascinating and terrifying in virtually every shot, thanks to absolute top-shelf work from the design crew: production designer Patrice Vermette, supervising art director Tom Brown, set decorators Richard Roberts and Zsusanna Sipos, and costume designers Bob Morgan and Jacqueline West, among many, many others. The film’s look acknowledges Lynch’s 1984 film – as well as Jodorowsky’ oeuvre – but also goes in some bold new directions, leaning into monolithic brutalist architecture, petrostate industrial grunginess, and the kind of baroque late-imperial opulence rarely seen outside of a Star Wars prequel. If the fundamental role of fantasy is to envelop the viewer in strange new worlds – and Dune is as much a neo-feudal fantasy saga as it is a hard science-fiction story – then this Dune is, in fact, the definitive cinematic version. It's as grandiose, indulgent, and staggering as Herbert’s work deserves."
"Oct 19, 2021",POSITIVE," The novel “Dune,” Frank Herbert’s 1965 science-fiction classic, summons many words to mind, but one of the most stubborn that gets stuck to it is “unfilmable.” Too long, too complex, too many characters, too much backstory, just too, too much. Well, just as Peter Jackson did with the equally unwieldy “The Lord of the Rings,” director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”) said, “Hold my beer.” In his $165 million take on “Dune,” opening Oct. 22 in theaters and simultaneously streaming on HBO Max, he and screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth have cracked the code. They’ve crafted a work that speaks to the essence of the story and will appeal to fans of the book while still engaging those who never read one of its 180,000+ words. It’s a combination of special-effects-driven, space-opera eye candy, otherwordly mysticism and internecine “Game of Thrones”-style politics that makes this seemingly impenetrable world real and accessible. He has done what David Lynch couldn’t do in his generally panned 1984 version, though that film does have its defenders. Set in some far-flung corner of the universe, at some distant point in time where a feudal system has planets ruled by various “houses” or families, this take on “Dune” — the first of Villeneuve’s two films based on the novel — is a story of colonization and rebellion. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of Duke Leito Atreides (Oscar Isaac), is in line to take over the powerful House Atreides. The emperor has just granted Atreides dominion over the planet of Arrakis, a desert world whose inhabitants, the Fremen, have had to share their planet with more powerful forces. Before Atreides, they were subjugated under the more brutal House Harkonnen, overseen by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista). What makes the hostile environment of Arrakis so valuable is the presence of “the spice,” a combination of natural resource and narcotic that, in this universe, is more valuable than gold. As House Atreides assumes control, the empire and the Harkonnen have their own plans to undermine them while the Fremen believe that young Paul may be the messiah that has been prophesied. His training at the knee of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), part of the mystical Bene Gesserit (an all-female religious order that commands respect from all the factions), and visions of a Fremen female warrior Chani (Zendaya), only enhance this idea. But even if the threads of the plot occasionally get lost, Villeneuve does such a spectacular job of world-building that it ultimately doesn’t matter. Unless you count the giant, deadly sandworms of Arrakis, there are no aliens in “Dune,” but various human cultures grasping for power and survival. The Fremen, in appearance and dress, seem very much like the nomadic cultures of the Sahel, such as the Tuareg people of Mali. (The only thing missing is some Tuareg music like the Malian band Tinariwen.) Of course, making them like contemporary humans brings up very contemporary human issues. The question of whether “Dune” is a “white savior movie” has rocketed around the internet so much that Villeneuve has been forced to address it, saying that the work in its entirety actually is a criticism of the trope of a powerful white man coming to save powerless non-white peoples. “Dune” defenders have fought back, too, claiming that the book and subsequent literary franchise — once you get beyond a basic, two-sentence summary of the plot — does not champion the idea of a Chosen One. We’ll have to wait and see where Villeneuve takes the story in the second film — “Dune” very much ends on an inconclusive note — to see how this resolves, or doesn’t. Still, “Dune” is an impressive feat, a plunge into a richly designed world that feels at once ancient and futuristic — despite the presence of interplanetary travel, warriors such as Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Hallock (Josh Brolin) still rock the swords — and wholly, fully formed. And, yes, even though “Dune” is available on streaming, it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Anyone watching this on a phone deserves a visit from the nearest sandworm.

"Oct 19, 2021",POSITIVE," There are many classic novels that have throughout history been said to be unadaptable due to their scope or complexity or just sheer esoteric nature. That’s not to say that many of these haven’t been adapted, but the success rate is variable and depends on who you ask. Whilst The Lord of the Rings received widespread critical acclaim once it was finally realised on screen, and The Bonfire of the Vanities went about as well as expected (i.e., terribly), adaptations like Watchmen or Cloud Atlas have had a more divided response. That said, no single novel has caused more frustration in the film business than Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi epic Dune. Alejandro Jodorowsky made his attempt in the 70s but couldn’t even get it off the ground, then David Lynch’s 1984 version went so badly that he disowned it, with only the Syfy miniseries from 2000 receiving anything close to positive reception. It seemed for years that Dune would remain as the one truly unadaptable novel, but it seems filmmakers are not quite yet done trying. Denis Villeneuve, fresh off of modern sci-fi darlings Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, is now on board with what many fans have been hoping will be the definitive Dune on the big screen. After years of development and a pandemic-induced delay, the result of the labours is a true epic in every sense of the word, but not one without major compromise. From very early on, it’s clear that the filmmakers’ model for adapting Dune is Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy, in that it takes a dense story full of complex lore and archaic vernacular and turns it into something more palatable for a mainstream audience. The translation is ultimately a success, making the story much more accessible whilst still retaining the core soul of Dune’s appeal. It’s a fairly faithful adaptation, though it does move some events around and fully portrays scenes only described in the book, but it’s all in service of making the story more cinematic. The film also carefully handles the heavy exposition of the novel, imparting this information either through visual storytelling or through the eyes of protagonist Paul (Chalamet) doing research on the world of Arrakis. The story itself isn’t all that complicated or original once you wade past the political intrigue and world-building, but that’s only because so many sci-fi stories from Star Wars to Avatar have pillaged from it over the years. Looking objectively at what they’ve assembled here, you could not ask for a better on-screen realisation of Dune…’s first half. Yes, following in much the same vein as Warner Bros. prior adaptation of the similarly-lengthy It, this is an adaptation set to be told in two chapters; the opening title even calls the film Dune: Part One. Whilst indeed a smart decision to avoid the rushed and jumbled storytelling of Lynch’s version, what this does mean is that the film can’t help but feel kind of unsatisfying without the second part immediately available. This is mainly because in regards to structure and pacing, this truly does feel like half of one big movie rather than a self-contained first part of a larger story; of any prior example of a novel split in two like this, it most resembles The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1. Villeneuve’s films are known for their slow pacing, but at times it feels like they are literally stalling for time, with a third act mostly consisting of Paul and Lady Jessica (Ferguson) wandering through an endless desert. There’s only one major action set piece to speak of about two thirds of the way through, with a few smatterings of heightened tension sprinkled throughout, but this is mostly just two-and-a-half hours of set-up for the next movie. Most crushingly of all, the screenplay fails to find a satisfying midway climax on either a spectacle or emotional level, ending on a pretty tepid one-on-one duel and then a character pretty much turning to camera to say “we’ll be back in Part Two!” When even The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 has a more satisfying finale, you’ve got a serious problem. It’s hard to say ultimately if splitting the book in two was the best idea, but it’s a decision that ultimately feels like the compromise between creativity and finance. Making one four-hour epic in the vein of Zack Snyder’s Justice League might have been the best way to adapt the book from a storytelling perspective, but that would be taking what is already a box office risk and turning it into a Heaven’s Gate-scale disaster; remember, Villeneuve may be a critical darling, but he ain’t box office gold. Perhaps if the two films were made in tandem and Part Two was guaranteed to release within the next year, it would be more acceptable, but that second part is entirely reliant on this first film doing well, and that is far from a certainty. Don’t let all this doom and gloom get you down, because what they’ve made so far is absolutely phenomenal; on par with Lord of the Rings in terms of scale and faithfulness to the source material. The ending of Dune: Part One, though, would be like if The Fellowship of the Ring had ended on our heroes just setting up camp at Parth Galen, rather than the exciting forest battle and tragic turn of events that lead to the splintering of the Fellowship. Whilst Dune is unlikely to entice a mainstream audience on the pedigree of the novel alone, its all-star cast just might. Timothée Chalamet makes for an excellent Paul Atreides, capturing that eerie mix of boyish wonderment and precocious intelligence that make him likeable and yet otherworldly. Yes, he’s a cold and reserved protagonist, but he’s meant to be and Chalamet manages to bring a sense of humanity to his otherwise unrelatable predicament. The film has majorly beefed up the role of Lady Jessica into as much a mentor to Paul as his male role models, and Rebecca Ferguson does a fantastic job of balancing that shaky dichotomy between teacher and mother. Oscar Isaac and Josh Brolin are both great as Leto Atreides and Gurney Halleck respectively, but they aren’t in the movie as much as you might expect. Stellan Skarsgård is absolutely disgusting in all the right ways as the diabolical Baron Harkonnen, though the visual of a giant slimy obese man floating about like a rotund vampire may induce more giggles than frights. Dave Bautista has a far more engaging and menacing presence as the Baron’s nephew Glossu Rabban, but alongside David Dastmalchian’s Piter De Vries, he is relegated to little more than a trumped-up henchman. Zendaya and Javier Bardem are great with what they are given as the Fremen tribespeople Chani and Stilgar respectively, but their roles are little more than extended cameos for Part Two. The real scene-stealer is Jason Momoa as the gung-ho swordsmaster Duncan Idaho, who brings his natural charisma to the role and adds some much-needed relief to the otherwise very serious proceedings. Going through every cast member would take far too long, but it’s safe to say all do an exemplary job no matter the size of their role; a true testament to the “no small actors” axiom. More than his love for the material or experience with the genre, what most excited many about Denis Villeneuve tackling Frank Herbert would be how he conceptually translated the world of Arrakis to the silver screen, and on that level he does not disappoint. Dune is a painstakingly realised and lusciously detailed movie on a visual and auditory level; a masterwork of every technical craft unseen since the efforts of Peter Jackson and Weta on Middle-earth. Every piece of production design is to die for, from the insect-like spaceships flown by the members of House Atreides to the cavernous lairs of the Harkonnen family. So much of the technology of Dune should be familiar to anyone with a passing familiarity with sci-fi, but the unique ways it visually realises force fields and breathing apparatus makes the whole world feel far more original than it is underneath; the accompanying stellar sound design and exemplary visual effects work only amplifies this feeling. Greig Fraser’s cinematography, whilst occasionally too dark during night-set scenes, is jaw-dropping whenever it fully takes in the scope of worlds like Caladan and Arrakis, but the real show-stopper is Hans Zimmer’s gargantuan score. Whilst still undeniably his work, it sounds wholly unique and unlike anything you’d expect from him and it just kills. It’s a truly distinctive mixture of sounds and rhythms pulled from all kinds of cultures and eras, mashed together into something that still sounds like a blockbuster score but from far off in the future. I haven’t heard anything quite like it, though if I had to I’d compare it most to Kenji Kawai’s music for Ghost in the Shell, or Ludwig Göransson’s work on Black Panther. Seriously, who else but Zimmer could work bagpipes into their music and make them not only sound futuristic, but also badass? If nothing else, if you find the storytelling at all unsatisfying, there is always something about the film’s presentation to latch onto and enjoy on a pure aesthetic level. When you get down to it, Dune has all of the right ingredients to make a genre-defining piece of filmmaking on the level of the original Star Wars, but regardless of its phenomenal pedigree, it is incomplete and with no guarantee it ever will be. At times, it almost feels as if the filmmakers are stalling for time, stretching out the story to further justify the two-part structure, when it might have been better off keeping it tight and finding a better note to leave off the story for now. It’s a film that will certainly appeal to diehard fans of both Frank Herbert and Denis Villeneuve, but it’s going to be a hard sell for the average moviegoer, and it’s their support that will make or break moving forward with Part Two. It is, after all, an arthouse blockbuster in every sense of both words. Only the eventual worldwide box office will let us know (it seems to be doing pretty well internationally so far), but if it fails, Dune may go down in film history in the same breath as Andrew Stanton’s John Carter (and I’m one of the five people who liked John Carter). It’s a movie that may well improve in retrospect when and if the second part is completed, but for now, the best thing I can say is that Dune is an unfinished masterpiece."
"Oct 19, 2021",POSITIVE," There are spaceships the size of oceans, ferocious desert creatures fit to swallow cities, and sand storms destructive enough to give T.E. Lawrence nightmares. As Villeneuve introduces us to the vast (and vastly complicated) universe of Frank Herbert’s novel – set many tens of thousands of years into the future, when interstellar space travel is the norm, computers are obsolete, and human civilization has become only semi-recognizable – the filmmaker builds a world (or worlds, rather) with magnificent skill, intense imagination and a near-fanatical devotion to his source material. Decades prior, Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch discovered that you have to be more than a little crazed to adapt Dune, what with its royal houses, interplanetary grudges, hallucinogenic natural resources and secret sorority of female psychics pulling all of the universe’s strings. But Villeneuve’s new film – after Blade Runner 2049, the director’s second go at reviving a creative property once deemed inviolable – proves that the Canadian director is just the right kind of big-screen madman. Yet for all of the movie’s mammoth outréness – I almost forgot about its levitating Jabba the Hutt-sized villain – the most gonzo element of Villeneuve’s Dune is that its full on-screen title is Dune: Part One – and there is no telling when Part Two may or may not be made. There was no filming back-to-back, like on Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and the sequel has yet to be officially greenlit by studio Warner Bros. I acknowledge that compressing all 863 pages of Herbert’s 1965 book into one film is a fool’s errand (see again Lynch and Jodorowsky, plus that 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries that no one likes to talk about). But to go into production on such an epic act of storytelling by cleaving the story in two without an absolute guarantee on the delivery of the second half is a special kind of optimistic outrageousness. For all of Dune’s magnificent achievements and ambitions, audiences (whether they have read Herbert’s story or not) are destined to leave Villeneuve’s film wanting and waiting – possibly forever. So, with that caveat, most of Dune: Part One’s 155 minutes are tremendously entertaining. It looks and moves like a true Hollywood bonanza: All the many millions and millions of dollars it cost to make the film are right up there on-screen, its IMAX-sized visuals designed to shock and awe. Even before he made his English-language debut with 2013′s Enemy, Villeneuve has been accused of possessing a cold eye, distant and unsparing. I’m not sure that’s quite right. The director operates at a remove, but only so that his audience can approach his film’s intimidating, towering objects (be they characters, stories, cities and/or entire worlds) with as much careful caution as he deems necessary. You start at a distance, then gently become deeply immersed. In Dune, as Villeneuve sweeps us from the lush greenery of the planet Caladan to the harsh desert environs of Arrakis – Hans Zimmer’s pounding, thudding, relentless score carrying us along – the filmmaker ensures that we feel the otherworldly weight and intensity of this universe. Villeneuve and his co-writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts are almost as successful in digesting Herbert’s supersized themes – colonialism, environmental destruction, religious folly – and overflowing narrative. The film’s first half-hour tidily packs in a whopping amount of exposition, introducing us to the powerful Atreides dynasty, composed of the kind but firm Duke (Oscar Isaac), his enigmatic concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). For reasons mysterious and foreboding, the unseen Galactic Emperor has just awarded House Atreides stewardship of Arrakis. The sand-covered planet, previously ruled by the brutal House Harkonnen, is home to the universe’s most precious natural resource: “Spice” – which, in addition to being a prized hallucinogenic for the planet’s indigenous Fremen people, is an essential element in powering interstellar travel. Once the Atreides clan is on Arrakis, they encounter enemies both familiar and unknown, leading to a full-scale war that hinges on the strange dreams plaguing Paul. There are sword and gunship battles, electronic body shields, plenty of talk about Paul’s messianic potential, and, yes, those pesky sandworms: gargantuan, sphinctoral desert beasts that consume everything and everyone in their paths. It’s all highly engaging, adventurous material, even if you’re the type of person who runs far away from anything involving the words “prophecies” and “space guilds.” Certainly, there are moments when things fall apart. The motivations of a key character like House Atreides doctor Wellington Yueh (Chen Chang) remain frustratingly underdeveloped, and the screenwriting trio speed past explaining just what Lady Jessica’s membership in the secretive Bene Gesserit order is all about. Then again, it’s not as if Herbert’s original prose gave them much of a head start. The author was a genius in fantastical world-building, less so in constructing beautiful and interesting sentences. But even if Villeneuve tasked his actors with reading out Herbert’s dialogue verbatim, they’d find a way to make it sing. This is a tremendously stacked cast, including regular Villeneuve collaborators (Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian) and powerful newcomers to the director’s repertory company. Chalamet, for starters, is perfect for the role of the privileged, frustrated and conflicted Paul. Isaac, up until now playing eager bucks, transitions well into the kind and patient patriarch role. Jason Momoa provides much-welcome levity as the gung-ho warrior Duncan Idaho, who might as well be called AquaDune. And Ferguson walks away with the film with what amounts to a series of well-executed stares. It is a shame that Javier Bardem and Zendaya (who’s featured front and centre in roughly 50 per cent of the movie’s marketing), have about 10 minutes of collected screen time as members of the Fremen. But that’s what happens when you film a story that, just as it approaches a crucial dramatic turning point, stops cold. Maybe one day, not too far into this planet’s future, we’ll be able to see how it ends. In the interest of consistency across all critics’ reviews, The Globe has eliminated its star-rating system in film and theatre to align with coverage of music, books, visual arts and dance. Instead, works of excellence will be noted with a Critic’s Pick designation across all coverage."
"Oct 19, 2021",NEUTRAL," arkonnen spice harvesters grow rich from the dunes of Arrakis, having governed the planet for nearly a century. But upon an Imperial decree, these austere masters suddenly vanish, giving way to a new clan to take control of the invaluable property. “Who will our next oppressors be?” In the year 10191, on Caladan, the homeworld of House Atreides, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul (Timothee Chalamet) prepare to depart for Arrakis, where the patriarch will soon be in charge of providing spice to the Emperor, whose cagey space guilds use the unique component for interstellar travel. Dreamy visions of blue-eyed girl Chani (Zendaya) and educational film-book recordings proceed to fill in the gaps for viewers, hinting at the trading of spice and its significance as both a drug and a fuel; the desert-dwelling rebels on Arrakis, known as the Fremen; and the gargantuan sand worms that burrow under the ground, making the collection of spice so hazardous. From the opening moments, there’s an undeniable grandiosity to the picture, with the music, spaceships, costumes, weaponry, sets, and props constructing mesmerizing worlds of wonder and fear. It’s as if the intensity is turned all the way up, though it infrequently ebbs, preventing each subsequent set piece from being any more exhilarating than the last. This is largely due to Hans Zimmer’s score, which thunders and pulses with deafening percussion and bellowing voices, elevating even middling sequences and segues that should be calmer and subtler. It’s not surprising, however, that writer/director Denis Villeneuve would handle this sci-fi epic with enthusiastic ferocity; after “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049,” Frank Herbert’s seminal adventure (and one often described as unfilmable) isn’t something to be trifled with. And it’s been a long time coming; audiences have been waiting anxiously for an accurate, big-budget, earnest, visionary-led adaptation of what is routinely described as the greatest (and best-selling) sci-fi novel of all time. Villeneuve stays remarkably loyal to the source material, though the dialogue has been updated considerably for the sake of this visual medium and for clarity. Yet that decision comes at a price; as his morbid space opera unfolds, a wealth of characters and locations appear for short periods before they meet untimely demises or are abandoned to introduce additional characters and locations (character development takes a backseat to character inclusion). Rather than aggrandizing certain roles to aid with the setup, and excising others whose removal might not only speed up the pacing but also suitably beef up alternate personas, nearly all of the book’s characters make an appearance, no matter how minor or forgettable. Unlike typical, modern movies, where action or thrills thrust audiences into the middle of the story at the start, “Dune” commendably – yet un-commercially – begins slowly, developing its enormous collection of interconnected, rivalrous fiefdoms and warriors (complete with hierarchies, spies, politics, and the supernatural powers of a witchlike cult of galaxy-wide superstition-planters) and the various factions involved with spice-harvesting. As a result, hours pass before major events come about; the attention to littler details routinely makes this arrangement seem better suited for a miniseries, since the full tale couldn’t be trimmed down to a single outing, and the action sequences themselves aren’t the main draw. General audiences might grow weary of the consistent strangeness of Paul’s visions and the focus on visual designs rather than action, but the look of Arrakis and its inhabitants (and invaders) are absolutely stunning (in some ways, it reminds of “300,” with its ever-odder conglomerate of denizens, each boasting singular clothing and armory and customs). Additionally (and part of what made the novel so impactful), the prophecies, languages, religions, rituals, ecology (how rare!), and fantasy elements (like a much darker take on the galactic clashes in “Star Wars”) are fascinating; “Dune” was surely one of the first properties to merge biblical tales (along with Islamic references and nods to Lawrence of Arabia) with sci-fi milieus on such a grand scale. Certain technologies and symbolism might be more impalpable, but the seriousness with which the actors take the material (as well as the severeness of the tone and atmosphere) evens out the jargon-heavy scenes. This is one of those productions that will be easier to follow if viewers are already familiar with the premise, though one of its best accomplishments is that it’s so drastically different from the 1984 theatrical version that it hardly warrants comparisons. “It will take time.” Unfortunately, as visually stunning as “Dune” is, it can’t escape the fact that it’s merely the first of two parts; a few plot points have been altered to achieve a cleaner stopping place, but the story clearly – and disappointingly, after a two-and-a-half-hour investment – isn’t over. In fact, major players such as Feyd-Rautha and Emperor Shaddam don’t even make an appearance. It’s difficult to fully appreciate (and judge) a piece of a story as anything other than the fragment that it is, even if Villeneuve’s acumen for visual imaginativeness is extraordinarily spellbinding.

"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE,"  Based on Frank Herbert’s iconic novel of the same name, this latest adaptation of Dune tackles the first part of an epic story of revolution, warring families, and the power of destiny.  In the distant future, the intergalactic Imperium thrives on the fuel known as melange or ‘spice’ which is an addictive substance that can cause visions, prolong life and enable space travel. The noble House Atreides is charged with being the new stewards for the only source of spice - the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.  However, a trap is laid for the Atreides by their arch-enemies House Harkonnen, prompting the young heir Paul Atreides ( Timothee Chalamet ) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to flee for their lives into the desert where destiny awaits them.  Capturing a scale, grandeur and weighty ambition not seen since the likes of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, Denis Villeneuve brings the stylish filmmaking that saw his film Blade Runner 2049 become so revered as a modern sci-fi classic but with an added personal touch noted from his film Arrival. Choosing to only adapt part of the mammoth novel was a wise choice, enabling Villeneuve to flesh out the lead characters and build a vibrant world for them to inhabit. Importantly, the casting has been wonderful here. Timothee Chalamet completes his ascension to Hollywood leading man status, capturing the difficult character of Paul. Simultaneously boyish but weighed down by fate, in touch with his femininity but still a man’s man, Chalamet brings charisma and gravitas in spades. Another piece of pitch-perfect casting is Rebecca Ferguson as the concubine Lady Jessica. Much of the plot in Dune is a result of Jessica’s decision making and her duty to her religious practices as part of the matriarchal order known as the Bene Gesserit, with Ferguson delivering regality, serenity, danger, and power to the screen.  The rest of the ensemble are also excellently cast, from Jason Momoa as the charming swordsman Duncan Idaho, to Oscar Isaac as the noble Duke Leto Atreides, and Charlotte Rampling in a brief turn as a solemn priestess, Reverend Mother Mohiam.   Of course, such an epic would be incomplete without its villains. Stellan Skarsgard is thoroughly repugnant as the monstrous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen but in manner that does not feel hammy in the slightest. Dave Bautista also brings suitable brutality to the Baron’s violent nephew, Count Glossu Rabban.  The Fremen as a whole are quite distant characters in this first instalment but one hopes they get fleshed out further in the next instalment. Appropriately, the expansive and often shifting landscapes of the planet Arrakis are so vividly observed in Villeneuve’s vision, with gorgeous cinematography from Greig Fraser and terrific production design across the board.  These are aided by Hans Zimmer’s alien-sounding and ethereal score which sounds fresh and familiar all at once, giving a whole new dimension to the film.  The gritty sensibility of Villeneuve’s vision pushes the influences of historical empires and aristocracies and brings to life the complex themes of colonialism, feudalism, religion and the corruption of power. Should this film series not continue after this it would be a crying tragedy that such a story epically told does not get to continue. Dune is the sci-fi epic of a generation that is breathtaking, thought-provoking and gripping with a cast at the top of its game. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson are the true stand-outs. "
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," A young messiah finally finds his calling — after two long hours and change —  in “Dune” (which, it should be noted, is actually “Dune: Part 1,” although this fact is not exactly well advertised in the film’s marketing material). “It Begins,” as it says, quite accurately, on one of the posters for the new film, gorgeously adapted by director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”), from a smart screenplay he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, based on novelist Frank Herbert’s beloved, legendarily unadaptable 1965 sci-fi opus. The story does reach a nice stopping point, however, if you set your expectations accordingly: for what turns out to be the first half of one gigantic bedtime story, set in the year 10,091, on the inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis, whose nickname lends the movie its title. Arrakis is the repository of hallucinogenic “spice” mines: the source of what’s known as “mélange” that extends life and enhances mental abilities, and that everyone in the galactic empire wants. It is sure to give you vivid dreams (the movie, not the spice). Perhaps not quite as vivid as those experienced by the film’s psychic hero, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the heir apparent to his father’s dukedom, and all that spice. But vivid nonetheless. Imagine sand as far as the eye can see, massive sandworms and spaceships that look like levitating office buildings, as well as something called ornithopters, which are a cross between helicopters and dragon flies. To survive in the heat of Arrakis, everyone who arrives there wears a “stillsuit,” which recycles the body’s sweat and urine. It’s all pretty spectacular and awesome, in the original sense of the word: instilling wonder and a little bit of fear (as well as a touch of disgust). Here’s where the fear comes in: As the film gets underway — majestic, epic, with a trumpeting score by Hans Zimmer that could have been written for elephant and alphorn — Paul and his parents (Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson) are relocating to Arrakis. The move is at the behest of an unseen emperor, who has kicked out the planet’s previous overseers of spice production: the Harkonnen, let by a Jabba the Hutt-like baron (Stellan Skarsgard). It might help to think of the whole thing as a kind of Mafia turf war, set in space: Enemies and treachery are everywhere. The Harkonnen want their drug market back. And maybe the new job on Arrakis isn’t really a promotion for the House of Atreides after all, but a way for the emperor to get rid of them, assisted by his henchmen, the Sardaukar. Making matters worse are the planet’s oppressed natives, the Fremen — free men — who seem to hate everyone. But all that is really the backdrop to the saga of a hero’s rise. It’s the more stirring of the two narratives, and one that rests squarely on the unlikely, narrow shoulders of Paul, whom some say could be the One: the “Mahdi” of legend, sent to lead the Fremen, like the Israelites, out of slavery. Paul, you see, has been blessed/cursed with strange and as yet untapped abilities, inherited from his mother, a member of an all-female order called the Bene Gesserit. (Get used to the pseudo-religious gobbledygook. It comes fast and furious. Between that and the loud soundtrack — and the fact that several characters are telepathic and/or communicate via sign language — a lot of what might otherwise be explanatory dialogue is missing or unintelligible.) Villeneuve was correct, it seems, in insisting that he be allowed to break the book into two pieces. There’s a lot going on here — a quasi-biblical space opera, part “Lawrence of Arabia and part mobster movie —  and spreading it out over two movies has allowed him to take his time with the story and tell it richly, and without rushing. (For an object lesson on how not to adapt “Dune,” see David Lynch’s 1984 version, which, even at 137 minutes, felt overly condensed and frenetic, without the source material’s sense of grandeur and, well, spaciousness.) The movie is eye candy, to be sure. But its cast is substantial: Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa as retainers of the Duke; Javier Bardem and Zendaya as Fremen rebels, the latter of whom keeps appearing to Paul in dreams. Then there’s Paul, whom characters keep referring to as a boy. Chalamet is well cast: an almost too pretty slip of a man who harbors hidden strengths and intensity. When at last he learns to harness it, it lands with satisfying heft, even if it makes you wait, in a mix of frustration and fulfillment, for the next chapter."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s seminal novel Dune has influenced countless subsequent works, including the beloved Star Wars franchise and the Wheel of Time series. The expansive world building, mythology and exploration of timely themes inspired a new breed of science fiction, spawning several film adaptations and spinoff television shows. And yet, film adaptations have historically been troubled, with David Lynch disowning his 1984 adaptation and cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky’s take failing to make it to the silver screen. So who better to adapt Herbert’s seminal work than the man behind the expansively complex (and yet, incredibly emotional) sci-fi blockbusters Arrival and Blade Runner: 2049? Like his previously contemplative entries, Villeneuve pulls connecting themes from Herbert’s influential novel to once again explore the flawed, but enduring, nature of the human condition. To the uninitiated, this is an almost impenetrable universe filled with treachery, exploitation and houses and figures bound by fate – but like the newly cultivated plants on the desert world of Arrakis, there’s also hope beginning to take hold.  There’s no denying the fact that, like Foundation, this is a dense and hard slice of science fiction which certainly won’t be for everyone. Villeneuve devotes a significant section of the lengthy two and a half hour runtime to world building – on an incredibly grand-scale – establishing the various planets inhabited by numerous royal families which co-exist under the ruling Imperium. In a similar vein to Game of Thrones, this is a weighty political drama and for the first 90 minutes, Villeneuve assembles the key players – along with their motivations, dreams and weaknesses – on the (often precarious) board. The deliberate pacing is considered – building up the tension with a grand sense of dread and foreboding – until we finally touch down on the fated planet of Arrakis, home to the coveted natural resource known as spice. Gone is Paul’s inner monologue which predominantly narrates the unfolding events in the novel, as Villeneuve relies more on imagery revealed in hazy dreams, unspoken glances and reactive body language. The hugely visual director doesn’t spell things out for viewers with voice-overs and heavy dialogue, instead leaving it to his impressively talented cast to do the majority of the heavy lifting. In result, it would be easy to buckle under the enormity of the role, but Timothée Chalamet manages to capture the quietly observant nature, confusion, and weight of lead Paul Atreides. Admittedly, without the first person narrative, it is harder to connect to the young noble finding his feet, but Chalamet holds his own with an impressively layered performance. The actor truly finds his feet in the latter half of the film, as the political drama evolves into more of a survival thriller. Oscar Isaac is impressively regal as the just ruler of Caladan, Duke Leto Atreides. Determined to honour his appointment by the Emperor, despite his better judgement which senses its a trap, Leto is an honourable and stubborn man. However it’s Rebecca Ferguson who shines most as the emotionally complex Lady Jessica, who finds herself torn between the love for her son and his father with her religious order of the Bene Gesserit. Jessica’s divide between two worlds acts a fascinating introduction to the more fantastical and religious elements of Herbert’s novel – with the predominantly female order challenging the (often) pre-conceived notions of women in sci-fi. Jessica is a trained fighter, a talented empath and an individual who can control others with their voice, who often bests and overpowers the ruling men around her. The Bene Gesserit order also upends the often religious undertones of the underpinning mythology of science fiction, leaving you to question the typical chosen one narrative. Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin are also brilliantly cast in their respective roles, bringing an impressive strength and real physicality – but more importantly – humour to the dutiful warrior roles. Both share an endearing chemistry with Chalamet’s Paul, particularly Momoa, that you instantly connect with and root for. However, where Villeneuve unfortunately fails is in casting MENA actors in notable roles, particularly standing out when it comes to Javier Bardem’s character, Stilgar. As we spend more time on Arrakis, the planet’s oppressed people – known as the Fremen – are finally revealed, but disappointingly the MENA actors that are included, are predominantly in minor roles or hidden behind masks. With a novel which explores oppression, religious mythologies and environmental themes based on the Middle East – this could have been a real opportunity to feature true representation in a big budget blockbuster. This is a true feat of visionary filmmaking. The extraordinary pairing of sumptuous production design and score makes for an impressively immersive cinematic experience. The intricately detailed costumes, particularly the Arrakis stillsuits, are so well realised, along with the unique sets and expansive filming locations which clearly delineate between worlds. The Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime is darkly oppressive and malevolent, while the expansive blues of the Atreides’ homeworld of Caladan is reminiscent of the beauty of the Nordics. Furthermore, the sweeping and spice filled desert of Arrakis stretches for miles – filmed predominantly in the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan, and the Rub’ Al Khali desert in Abu Dhabi – the size and scope really is breathtaking (along with the vast size of the sandworms). Hans Zimmer also manages to top his ethereal Blade Runner: 2049 score with an epic cacophony of beating dreams infused with primal and powerful female vocal linex, which gives Junkie XL’s new Wonder Woman theme in Zack Snyder’s Justice League a run for it’s money. Dune is one of the biggest and most ambitious blockbuster spectacles committed to film yet. The size & scope is truly epic, with Villeneuve building on his previous sci-fi entries for a true cinematic experience. Hopefully the box office results and HBO Max numbers will reflect the scale, as it’s still unknown whether the director will get the go ahead to film a second instalment.

"Oct 18, 2021",NEUTRAL," Directed by Denis Villeneuve.
Starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Stellan Skarsgård, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Chang Chen, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian, Charlotte Rampling, Babs Olusanmokun, and Benjamin Clémentine. Feature adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction novel, about the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the most valuable asset and most vital element in the galaxy. Supposedly, in Dune, fear is the mind-killer. However, for the first time in his masterful portfolio, Denis Villeneuve almost feels afraid to venture into artsy territory or the unknown. Bluntly, Dune is his most straightforward and conventional work (which might please fans of the Frank Herbert novel Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth are adapting, seemingly staying far away from replicating anything about the critical and commercial bomb that was David Lynch’s envisioning). It’s still a visual stunner with an appropriately epic score, but it’s also shocking how little there is to care about on an emotional scale despite over an hour of well-crafted world-building and some unexpected significant character deaths (especially considering the title specifies that this is only Dune: Part One). Of course, that exposition is necessary. There’s no questioning it, as viewers are immediately shown a variety of planets ranging from House Atreides’ oceanic Caladan to the desert planetoid Arrakis (which also goes under the titular nickname of Dune), and currently run by House Harkonnen. There are also groups referred to as the Fremen; generally, minorities left for dead surviving in the harsh conditions, which also happen to be populated with gigantic sandworms capable of devouring entire ships, let alone people. Arrakis remains contested over due to its abundance of melange (commonly referred to as “spice”), a drug that grants numerous abilities while also darkening the eyes blue of those that consume unhealthy doses. It’s also nearly impossible to stay away from in the thick of the desert, as spice visibly blows in the air like embers. On Caladan, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, showing new acting chops as the quiet type unsure of if he wants to take over for his father one day as a political leader and battle general, admirably wondering if anything really changes under different and so-called improved leadership) trains with his mother Lady Jessica Atreides (an empowered Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood embracing the supernatural. Specifically, Jessica is in the process of teaching Paul an otherworldly voice power that functions as instant persuasion to do anything that’s commanded. Paul also undergoes more traditional preparation, such as swordsmanship sparring with Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck (a sequence that allows for the flashy touch of blue and red illuminations of the body, signaling protection or a fatal injury) and Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho (effortlessly the most charismatic of the bunch), who also doubles as a close friend. Herald of the Change (Benjamin Clémentine) is also in the process of taking Arrakis away from House Harkonnen and gifting it to House Atreides, something that results in anger from one and skepticism from the other. Paul is also experiencing strange visions of death and a mysterious Fremen woman (Zendaya), growing increasingly concerned for those around him. Thankfully, Paul is also close to his father, Duke Leto Atreides (a thickly bearded and levelheaded ruling Oscar Isaac), notably during a tender conversation where dad professionally doesn’t seem too concerned if his son follows in his footsteps or not. He seems to think Paul will arrive at that position regardless, but they have pleasant respect. Elsewhere, Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista, using his physical presence and body language to make the most of a character that’s severely underwritten, at least from this half of the story) plots with his grotesquely flabby and floating uncle Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård, unrecognizably covered in makeup effects and other CGI) on how to get rid of House Atreides while still honoring the wishes of the Emperor. From their ghostly white and icy look to the malevolent energy they radiate, they are more fascinating than the heroes on the surface. At one point, Dave Bautista has an entire dialogue with some indescribable substance as his uncle transforms back into the flesh; it’s not only the closest Denis Villeneuve gets to something imaginative beyond expensive explosions and chase sequences, but is the eye-raising weirdness that the entire experience should have aspired to be rather than glacially moving through over an hour of table-setting and intrigue. Nevertheless, the money is put to good use, whether it be from sleek metallic armor to vast landscapes (there’s a breathtakingly tense wide shot of characters trying to outrun a sandworm) to the all-out war that breaks out during the third act (accompanied by slick acrobatic melee combat that is a splendor to behold). Dune also feels emotionally empty, as if the writers were so concerned with introducing the world and copious amounts of terminology in a consumer-friendly digestible way that they forgot to draw these characters. There’s only one death that came close to eliciting a reaction, but it was more due to the blaze-of-glory fight-until-the-end execution rather than anything resembling a satisfying arc. At the very least, Paul starts to be pushed in interesting storytelling directions and is forced to start using some of his powers before he is properly ready. Still, the ending reeks of inevitable white savior territory to be continued. Again, it’s also dazzlingly constructed with several fight sequences, aerial maneuvers, innovative equipment, and marvelous sights that elevate whatever familiarity and outdated tropes there are to be found. The final hour of Dune also appears to be an exercise in filling in as much story as possible but with a narrative thrust sorely missing from everything preceding it. One could say Dune needs more spice. To its credit, it is immensely watchable and does feel like the first half of something much more epic that could go down as exceptional hero’s journey sci-fi."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE,You get so absorbed in the world and it's so interesting.
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE,I feel like it honors the Dune legacy and totally one-ups it completely.
"Oct 18, 2021",NEUTRAL," Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic Dune has been called unadaptable. That hasn’t stopped anyone from trying to bring the influential sci-fi novel to the screen. Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to bring it the screen in the ‘70s, though it fell through. David Lynch adapted the novel to the screen in 1984, though it was an infamous critical and commercial flop. Then there was the 2000 miniseries that was on the Sci-Fi Channel (before it was SyFy). The allure of the spice is too much for ambitious filmmakers to ignore, and now Denis Villeneuve takes his crack Frank Herbert’s epic. The resulting Dune (subtitled in the opening as Part One) is half of a movie, a sci-fi epic that is fundamentally incomplete. The reality is that Denis Villeneuve has confirmed what we all suspected – Dune is unadaptable. Dune isn’t a disaster, but it is a bloated, icy work that is nigh impossible to connect with on an emotional or intellectual level. The first problem facing anyone adapting Dune is trying to cram its vast and dense mythology into an easily digestible package. That’s simply to grand of a task for the screenwriting team of Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth. The events of Dune mostly take place on the desert planet of Arrakis, a nearly inhospitable world where a mystical drug known as spice is mined and refined. Spice production has been overseen by House Harkonnen, led by the bloated villainous creature Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). The Harkonnen spice operation has had them in protracted war with the natives of Arrakis known as the Fremen, who see the spice as a religious sacrament and want to expel those that seek to ravage the resources of their home world. When the Harkonnen leave the spice operation on Arrakis, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is assigned by the Emperor (an unseen intergalactic ruler) to take over the spice mining operations on Arrakis. Soon, Leto Atreides will take his wife Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) along with trusted confidants and servants Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) to the desert planet. For Duke Leto Atreides, taking over the spice mining on Arrakis is a task fraught with danger. Not only does he have to try and make some kind of peace arrangement with the native Fremen, there’s also plenty of opportunities for subterfuge from the shadowy enemies of House Atreides, including Baron Harkonnen’s ruthless minions like Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista). But young Paul Atreides has attributes that no one else in the universe possesses, due to his connection to the mystical psychics known as the Bene Gesserit through his mother. He has dreams that show him the future, including a mysterious young Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya). But soon, a betrayal will rock House Atreides to its core and will change the landscape of Arrakis forever. If the plot summary provided seems like it’s a bit much, well, it’s because it is. The vastness of Dune can seem intimidating because its dealing with so many characters and their own little subcultures, and Villeneuve seems to be so enamored with the intricacies of this world that he makes no effort to rein it in just a little. The result is a movie that is simultaneously overstuffed and incomplete. There’s little brevity to be found in Dune, as its teeming with scene after scene of expository dialogue that tries to make sense of everything but is lacking anything to propel the plot forward in a compelling way. A lot occurs in Dune but little grabs the attention of the viewer as everything is just dragged out due to some glacial pacing that wears on the viewer’s patience. While Dune is effectively the hero’s journey of young Paul Atreides, the film is just such an overstuffed prologue that the character feels more like a passenger than a protagonist. Timothée Chalamet is one of the most captivating young actors working today and yet his work here feels practically pedestrian. Perhaps Chalamet is incapable of presenting the inner turmoil of his character because there wasn’t much written for him, but Chalamet is just the most noticeable of the film’s highly capable cast sold short by a script that is dedicated more to the minutiae of mythology than presenting captivating characters. It’s a real problem for the movie as you sit through two and half hours of sci-fi lore and walk out with little connection to any of the characters, but especially the story’s more important Fremen characters, including Javier Bardem’s Fremen leader Stilgar and Zendaya’s Chani. The Oscar-winning Bardem gets a handful of lines in his two scenes. Worse, though, is that Zendaya’s Chani isn’t even presented as a character. Most of her screentime in the film are as a part of Paul’s prophetic visions, meaning the character isn’t properly introduced until just before the conclusion. Villeneuve is trying to telegraph through these dreams that Chani is an important character. How important? Well, you’re going to have to wait until Dune: Part Two, if it’s ever made. It’s hard to think of a better example of Dune’s failures to be captivating on a sheer visceral level than the film’s use of the infamous sandworms. Here are these vast, deadly creatures that can consume massive pieces of machinery in a single gulp. But Villeneuve is either incapable or uninterested in creating any tension throughout Dune. It’s due in part to the film’s languid pacing, the director would rather drag out scenes than speed them up to give them even just the slightest bit of immediacy. Not everything about Dune is bad. For one thing, the film definitely has a look. The costume and set designs are nothing short of incredible. Each location has its own unique look and feel, and the vast amounts of CGI employed in the film is tiers above the standard Hollywood blockbuster. Cinematographer Greig Fraser captures the immense scale of the worlds that Villeneuve has brought to life, and his keen eye ensures that the film is always presenting something eye-catching. After sitting though two and half hours of tediously paced sci-fi mythology, Dune ends with a line that made my blood boil – “This is only the beginning.” Then what in the hell did I just spend two and half hours sitting through? Normally I’d have no problem with an ambitious Hollywood blockbuster just setting hundreds of millions of dollars aflame to make some off-putting sci-fi epic. But I was incapable of connecting to Dune. In the end, it represents just another average Hollywood tentpole, purposefully incomplete to tease to the next massive installment. This isn’t a gripping politically charged sci-fi allegory about imperialism. It’s the longest teaser for a sequel in movie history. Overstuffed and incomplete, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune isn’t quite a disaster nor is it a good movie as it’s much more devoted to honoring Frank Herbert’s vast mythology with grand visuals than delivering a complete story with compelling characters. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls. This is a very sloppy and bad review. Not a bad review because it says the movie is bad, but because the review in itself is poorly written and as incomplete as the movie (as the author wrote). You can tell that the reviewer doesn’t have any clue about the books and you can also tell that he had absolutely no desire to do some research. I guess the guy behind this article had a bad day or he simple wants to swim against the (main)stream to show how independent he is."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," When the last line of a movie that lasts two and a half hours is, “It’s not the end. It’s just the beginning” and they actually mean it, you know you’re in for a lot of exposition. By the way it looks, for sure. By the story? Probably, though that’s a little tougher sell — but ultimately worth your while. A tremendous cast helps. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and possibly a messiah, though Paul is a little reluctant on the latter front. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is a member of the Bene Gesserit, mystical women who for centuries have been working to produce The One — which Paul seems to be. Jessica quietly trains him in their ways, like the use of the “Voice,” which allows its user to control the mind and actions of others. Meanwhile Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) train him for battle. He’ll need all of these skills and more. House Atreides is taking over supervision of Arrakis, the planet where Spice — crucial to space travel but also sacred to the Fremen, who live on Arrakis — is mined. It’s a blow to House Harkonnen, led by the squishy, evil lump, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (an unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgard), who had been mining Spice there for ages. The Fremen also believe Paul may be the savior they have looked for for centuries. For his part, in addition to thinking it all sounds like a bunch of superstitious nonsense, Paul is troubled by his dreams — and haunted by the enigmatic woman who appears in them. That’s Zendaya, as Chani, a Freman woman, and for most of the movie in Paul’s dreams is the only place she appears. (Again: part one.) Arrakis is a barren desert that makes Arizona look like the Garden of Eden. The heat of the day can be lethal. Then there are the sand worms, the famous monsters drawn toward any rhythmic movement in the sand, like walking — or mining. Villeneuve orchestrates an exciting escape scene when equipment malfunction requires a breakneck evacuation of a mining operation. The general state of the equipment is one of the signs to Leto that he may have been set up to fail. There are others. Through it all, Paul remains rather enigmatic. Maybe that’s a family trait, too, because practically everyone is. In part that is because in some ways the film is one big long table setter. In part it’s because the royals can be a rather formal bunch when they want to be, hiding their emotions. In part it’s just because that’s what the story is. Then again, Leto is out there flying helicopters with insect wings where rotors should be, zipping around with the best of the pilots. They’re an interesting bunch. Palace intrigue will send Paul on the run with Jessica through the desert sands, dodging deadly heat and worms along the way. They’ll also finally encounter the Fremen, led by Stillgar (Javier Bardem — the cast does not lack for star power). And Paul will meet Chani. The stage is set for … part two. Just like that. Sit and think about what you just saw — you’ve got a while. All fair enough, I suppose. A tale this massive needs some time to be told. The problem is the making of a second film isn’t set in stone. If it doesn’t happen, it would be a huge letdown. Again, 155 minutes is a lot of time for throat clearing, but by the time the film is done Villeneuve is hitting his stride. He has created a complex, intriguing world. So many things have been set in motion — but just that. As beautiful and as ambitious as “Dune” is, as the last line says, it’s just the beginning."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s most ambitious project to date finds the director shepherding Frank Herbert’s impossibly dense sci-fi novel Dune to the big screen. It’s a daunting task, considering the novel’s nigh-impenetrable combination of politics, technology, religion and colonialism, and previous failed attempts at wresting the material into a coherent adaptation — Alejandro Jodorowsky’s infamous 1970s endeavor that fell apart in preproduction and a much maligned (although completed) 1984 version by David Lynch — have earned the novel a reputation of being “unfilmable.” Presented here as the first part of a longer saga, Villeneuve’s approach is far and away the most cinematic version of Herbert’s work, but whether he has found success where his predecessors did not is a question whose answer hinges largely on a follow-up film that doesn’t yet exist. Dune wastes little time setting the table, mostly because there’s a massive amount of information to convey, and it would be forgivable to find oneself overwhelmed by the various names, locations and titles swirling about. Here are the basics: after nearly a century of controlling Arrakis and its rich deposits of mind-altering, life-sustaining spice, House Harkonnen has been ordered to vacate the desert planet and turn control over to Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides, who arrives to assume control of the mining operations with his concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and teenage son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Leto harbors suspicions about the motive behind the sudden change in leadership, as does stone-faced warmaster Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), but the promise of untold riches and an opportunity to advance the standing of House Atreides while charting a legacy for Paul to carry onward are too attractive to ignore.  Paul’s mixed feelings about his role in that legacy, his ties to the shadowy order of the Bene Gesserit to which his mother belongs, and recurring visions of the blue-eyed indigenous Fremen — with whom Leto hopes to broker a peace after decades of their tribes being ground under the heels of House Harkonnen — have saddled the young heir with plenty to fret over. Paul may have been deemed the future of House Atreides, but he suspects his path might lead elsewhere, and that’s before the grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) dispatches legions upon legions of vicious fighters to exterminate his rivals.  Villeneuve’s past sci-fi works Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 were marked by stunning visuals, but those films pale in comparison to the immensity of Patrice Vermette’s staggering production design. Everything about Dune feels enormous, from its sprawling desert vistas to its cavernous strongholds to the gargantuan sandworms that prowl beneath the surface of Arrakis, capable of swallowing mountainous harvesting machinery in a single gulp; a desperate attempt to flee one of these colossal beasts around the one-hour mark is one of the film’s most exhilarating sequences. In fact, the bulk of the onscreen action is riveting, but these moments arrive far too infrequently, with a significant portion of the film’s hefty running time devoted to exposition.  And therein lies the biggest problem with Dune: regardless of its visual splendor, grandiose sense of scale,  and impressive cast, the experience feels incomplete and somewhat hollow by virtue of only being half a movie. The film stops on a dime just when it finally seems to be gaining momentum, and due to a complicated series of behind-the-scenes decisions made during the throes of a worldwide pandemic, the future of Dune remains up in the air. If given the opportunity to see his vision through to completion, Villeneuve might very well deliver one of the most magnificent science fictions epics of all time, but if not? Well, at least this one is incredible to look at, if not quite satisfying. Dune succeeds in leaving the audience thirsting for more, but much like the conflicted protagonist at its center, the film’s legacy will be defined by where the path leads next. "
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Behold! Denis Villeneuve has adapted Frank Herbert’s iconic 1965 science-fiction novel Dune with all the might and majesty of a true maestro. A verifiable fireworks-show of audio-visual brawn and storytelling prowess, Dune as translated by Villeneuve is a rare cinematic treat that implodes on the screen, sucking audiences into a dizzying vortex of feuding empires, space zen, and chosen-one heroics, resulting in one of the most electrifying science-fiction space operas of this generation and one of the very best films of the year. The only knock against it – and it is a reasonably-sized knock – is that this first film in the planned (but not yet green-lit) two-parter only encompasses half the total story, leaving viewers desperate for a conclusion that may or may not come to fruition. A true auteur, Villeneuve has carved out a niche for creating grandiose and intelligent science-fiction films that regularly win over critics but tend to stumble at the box office. His last two films, Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, garnered critical accolades and Academy Awards both but were met with relatively meager financial returns. With Dune, an intergalactic epic that commands every penny of its $165M budget, the risk of middling box office returns threatens the cinematic return to the world of Arrakis, where Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya) battle for spice, sustainability, and supremacy. The tale of House Atreides’ unwelcome arrival on the desert planet of Arrakis, a story notoriously dense but painstakingly unpacked by the script from Villeneuve, Jon Spaights, and Eric Roth, stews in the nuances of Herbert’s themes while offering enough genuinely thrilling set-piece sequences to keep the more action-oriented entertainment-seekers in cahoots with those hoping for something deeper. From the wowing psychedelic visual tapestry to the lean-forward-in-your-seat action and the bevy of intriguing performances propelling the plot along, Villeneuve’s offering proves that all-too-rare coalescence of adult-oriented storytelling and pure cinematic extravagance. In short – it’s a dizzying wonder to behold. Nearly ten thousand years in the future, this story begins when Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), a formidable, honorable military man and ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is sent by a shadowy emperor to take command of Arrakis. Arrakis is a wasteland but a wasteland of great importance, its natural production of “spice”, a substance used both as inter-dimensional space travel fuel and – for the locals – a hallucinogenic supplement, making it an essential holding. Warring house Harkonnen – led by the slimy (literally and metaphorically) Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård)- doesn’t take kindly to the imposition, setting off a feud set to undo one of the great houses.  In addition to the basic this-house-versus-that-house foundation, there’s space witchcraft, underground desert societies, giant sand-cryptids, and prophecies of a chosen one. Dune is widely regarded as the “best science fiction story of all time” by virtue of how foundational the story is: Herbert’s tale encompasses the wide world of grand myths and hero’s journeys. There’s a reason Jorodowsky’s ill-fated version of Dune (never to actually be filmed) went on to inspire the visual makeup of George Lucas’ Star Wars. This is prototypical sci-fi, fastened to a band of sturdy archetypes. The mythological stuff Carl Jung may himself have dreamt up. And Villeneuve has brought it to life with unyielding style and an impressive cast, fully committed to their stake. Rebecca Ferguson impresses as the mysterious Lady Atreides, a psionic concubine and follower of the unsettling religious doctrine known as the “Bene Gesserit”; Josh Brolin steps in as the unlovable strategist Gurney; Jason Momoa shows off his natural charisma as fan favorite Duncan Idaho; Dave Bautista rages as Harkonnen underling and nephew of Vladimir known only as “Beast”; and Jaiver Bardem appears as a leader amongst the Arrakis locals, known as “Fremen”, Stilgar. Villeneuve allows his cast to sink into the weirdo grit of their roles, to revel in the strangeness of these characters and the world they inhabit. Our hero Paul comes of age caught between two worlds – that of his father’s status and nobility and his mother’s mysticism – his future clouded by the compulsion of destiny. A child of Caladan damned to Arakkis, where perhaps an even greater fate awaits. The chosen one/white savior narrative may be a tired trope in 2021 – Avatar, The Last Samurai, Cloud Atlas, The Great Wall and The Help are just a few such examples – but this Dune hues close to the source material in that regard. This is, after all, the source from which those stories cribbed. Trusting Herbert’s vision and translating even the granular bits to the screen, Villeneuve makes fidelity matter, with very grain of sand in this infinite ocean of it proving important in some sense or another. Whereas too many modern big-budget seem to pander to a blasé sense of blockbuster conformity, Dune champions eccentricity and adopts its own peculiar identity, making for that rare sumptuous blockbuster that doesn’t feel like it’s been dumbed down for grade-schoolers or whittled away to fit into a familiar aesthetic box. Instead, the spectacle arrives fully-formed and singular, complete with moments of grand-scale space battles that pulled me to the literal edge of my seat in a manner I haven’t felt in quite some time. Epic is the only suiting descriptor. As is so common with a Villeneuve feature, the remarkable composition of the production elements never go unnoticed; the ambitious and arresting visual effects set atop Patrice Vermette’s jaw-dropping production design; Bob Morgan and Jacqueline West’s stark and utilitarian costumes; Hans Zimmer’s aboriginal-inspired score, his most memorable in some time; and Greig Fraser’s transportive, evocative cinematography, a flurry of shadowy whispers and sun-blasted promises that ties the whole thing together. On Arrakis, sweat and tears are repurposed as drinking water so that inhabitants may survive its scorching heat. With Dune, you can almost taste the sweat and tears put into its making, the grand scale of this endeavor. Just as with the Fremen, those sweat and tears have been repurposed for our consumption, in the form of astounding cinematic mastery, dripping off the screen for audiences to hungrily lap up.

"Oct 18, 2021",NEUTRAL," Dirección: Denis Villeneuve Reparto: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Zendaya  Título original: Dune País: EE.UU. Año: 2020 Fecha de estreno: 17–9-2021 Género: Ciencia ficción Guion: Eric Roth, Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts Fotografía: Greig Fraser Sinopsis: Cuenta la historia de Paul Atreides, un joven brillante que ha nacido con un destino más grande que él mismo. En esta epopeya, deberá viajar al planeta más peligroso del universo para asegurar el futuro de su familia y de su gente. Mientras las fuerzas del mal se enfrentan para hacerse con uno de los recursos más excepcionales del planeta, que tiene el poder de desbloquear todo el potencial de la humanidad, solo los que logren dominar sus miedos podrán sobrevivir. Con su épica intimista, su universo de tonalidades sombrías y su vocación de trascendencia, Dune de Denis Villeneuve aspira a devenir una cima del “blockbuster de autor”. Y cabe decir que esta adaptación de la primera mitad de la célebre novela de Frank Herbet va sobrada de recursos de eficacia probada, constantes del cine de entretenimiento contemporáneo como la narrativa coral, la monumentalidad con aroma a píxel y una contundencia audiovisual destinada a extasiar los sentidos. Algo más problemático resulta el intento, por parte de Villeneuve, de singularizar su acercamiento a la obra de Herbert, empleando elementales flash-forwards para ilustrar la presciencia del héroe Paul Atreides (un Timothée Chalamet en su salsa melancólica) y aliñando el relato con colorido multiétnico: guerreros al estilo samurái, sonidos tribales, el toque latino de Javier Bardem… Lejos queda la excéntrica y muy valiente apuesta de David Lynch, en su adaptación de 1984, por un coro de voces en off que capturaba con rigor el tono interiorizado de la novela de Herbert.

"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE,"We need sensational cinema right now, that we can all enjoy, and Dune emphatically delivers."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," In his 1965 sci-fi novel Dune, Frank Herbert presented a strange world thousands of years in the future. Having long ago rid itself of thinking machines, humanity has reverted to feudalism and strict social controls. Rival noble houses rule the known universe on behalf of an emperor. Mental conditioning and mind expansion have replaced advanced technology. Soldiers are trained to be fighting machines while human computers called Mentats act as court advisors. Behind the scenes are the Bene Gesserit; to all appearances a religious order, they are in fact a cynical shadow power, manipulating aristocratic bloodlines and engineering myths and religions on primitive planets for their own ends. Without artificial intelligence, the business of navigating space at faster-than-light speed has come to depend on a mind-altering drug called spice, which can only be harvested on the planet Arrakis, colloquially the Dune of the title, an inhospitable desert world with giant sandworms and an unfriendly local population known as the Fremen, whose lifelong exposure to spice has given them characteristic glowing blue eyes. In essence, the questions Herbert was posing were not unlike those raised earlier by the mathematician and cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener. In his popular books (including the influential The Human Use Of Human Beings), Wiener asked what kind of society we might be building as we came to rely more and more on computers and automation. If we imagined our technologies as a human underclass, we might see that it wasn’t advancing us toward a less stratified future. A related concern was whether we were not only ruining our planet in pursuit of natural resources but becoming addicted to them.  But there were also questions that were Herbert’s own, about the future of religion and the use of belief as a form of control. These ideas (which Herbert would continue exploring over a series of books) distinguish Dune as a work of science fiction rather than, say, a space fantasy. Yet they are the hardest aspect of the novel to bring to the screen. What Denis Villeneuve’s sleek new adaptation gets right, immediately, is the galactic, millennia-old scale: gigantic architecture, humongous spacecraft, vast landscapes, big ugly sandworms. No other recent film has looked quite so huge. It’s worth noting here that the actual onscreen title of Villeneuve’s film is Dune: Part One. The script (by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth) covers only the first half of Herbert’s novel, and the result ultimately feels like half of a movie. Fortunately, it’s an ambitious one, made with the same stylistic intelligence that Villeneuve brought to Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, his earlier forays into smart sci-fi. Having come a long way from his arthouse roots, he has emerged as one of our most reliable and talented directors of suspense and effects. With floppy hair and an aloof air, Timothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the wet, Hebridean planet of Caladan. Trained by his Bene Gesserit mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul possesses some budding superhuman abilities. He is also having apparently prophetic dreams about Arrakis and an unknown Fremen woman (Zendaya). The unseen emperor has recently given the Atreides clan control of the arid planet, which had been ruled for decades by the cruel, sadistic House Harkonnen, headed by the villainous and often literally slimy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Assisted by their loyal men-at-arms Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), the Duke and his family travel to Arrakis, aware that their new fiefdom might be a trap. While most characters would be lucky to have one messianic destiny, Paul, as we soon learn, has two. He may be the Kwisatz Haderach, the being whose coming is the goal of the centuries-long Bene Gesserit breeding program. Or he may be the foreign savior of Fremen prophecy. Some Fremen treat him and his mother with religious awe; others, like the Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem), are skeptical and hostile.  This is, of course, a gross oversimplification of the plot, which is a tangle of dynastic politics, dual loyalties, court intrigues, assassination attempts, and mystical overtones. Villeneuve lays it out slowly; it takes some time before the characters even set foot on Arrakis. There are tests to pass, servants to meet, local leaders to win over. With the exception of travel between different star systems, nothing in the world of Dune happens instantly: spice is gathered by colossal lumbering harvesters; power is handed over in ceremonies; plans are laid far in advance; warfare in basically medieval. In an age of fast-moving effects creations, Villeneuve demonstrates that slowness can be suspenseful. It’s the dreaded approach of the all-devouring sandworm and the eerie menace of elite troops who float down silently to attack. This is not the first attempt to translate Herbert’s novel to the screen. The midnight-movie auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky developed an unfilmed (and arguably unfilmable) adaptation in the 1970s that was later chronicled in the documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune. In 1984 came the David Lynch version, which raced through a compressed version of Herbert’s plot in a bit over two hours, turning it into grotesque, baroque space opera; despite its shortcomings as coherent narrative, it remains a unique take on the blockbuster, and one of the era’s most memorable and varied showcases of production design. Much later came a 2000 TV miniseries, which is notable mostly for featuring some of the ugliest costumes to ever grace the small screen.  Despite his obvious talents, Villeneuve is not an esoteric, psychedelic voyager on the order of Jodorowsky, or an oneiric artist on the level of Lynch. If anything, his Dune might be accused of playing the story too straight, toning down its headier and stranger elements. In trying to distinguish itself from the numerous other visual interpretations (not just in film and TV, but in comics, book covers, computer games, etc.), the film opts for hard surfaces and geometries with more than a touch of monumental fascism. But there are still plenty of peculiar sights: The ‘thopter aircraft the characters use to get around resemble helicopter gunships mated with a dragonfly, and the mouth of the redesigned sandworm looks like a horrific toothy sphincter. (For the purists, it should be noted that it still has a triple jaw, though it’s now pharyngeal.) Some narrative shortcuts are unavoidable; like Lynch’s version, for instance, the new Dune opens with extended expository narration. So is a sense of distance from the characters, given the fatalistic plotting of the source material, which also makes the scattered attempts at levity feel forced. But Villeneuve has a few tricks up his sleeve. The cast is uniformly strong, and it’s a credit to his direction that all of the performances—from Momoa’s boisterous Duncan to Charlotte Rampling’s imperious Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam to the “inhuman” Harkonnens—believably inhabit the same world. There’s also the effective use of flash-forwards; in providing cryptic glimpses of events beyond the film (to be presumably covered in Dune: Part Two), Paul’s visions reinforce the impression that all of this happening on a larger-than-human scale, with destinies to be fulfilled.  There is some craftsmanship here, too, that is hard not to admire—for instance, the way Villeneuve manages to balance a large, effects-heavy battle scene (which he directs with aplomb) with simultaneous intrigue inside the Atreides compound by making the interior sets big and cavernous. This gift for visual dimension is key, because what Dune offers, despite its often monochromatic futurism,  is a kind of entertainment that was a far older Hollywood’s stock-in-trade: that of stars and titanic spectacle. In an odd way, the movie feels like an update of a Cinemascope epic, with impressive vistas, an overall sense of exotic grandeur, and a deliberate pace.  If there’s a big idea here, lurking like the mammoth sandworm, it’s about the symbolism of power. It may be signified by futuristic castles, traditions, family crests, loyal aides, or the Duke’s prized signet ring. But ultimately, power lies in the infinite, untamable, and largely empty desert; in order to master it, that’s where you have to go. However inconclusive as a story, the resulting film is a rarity among the overlong effects-heavy blockbusters of the last decade: One actually wishes it didn’t have to end so soon."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune is a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. Not many films can leave you in awe, where its immersion and the dreamlike patience of its intricate world-building overwhelms the senses both beautifully and poetically. And yet director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Sicario) accomplishes just that. Such emotional engagement and esteem are indicative of how Villeneuve has exponentially approached science fiction in recent years. Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and his latest spectacle represent the growing evolution and resurgence of the genre, and the rise of ambitious filmmakers who have been steadily pushing its capabilities; where its engagement is not solely reliant on its visual aesthetics but places equal measure on the dramatic depth that underpins its characters. With grace and ease, it pulls its audience deeper into a thought-provoking narrative that either subverts our expectations or dares to question the essence of human nature. Annihilation, Ad Astra, Inception and Ex Machina are recent examples.  But Villeneuve has crafted something special by fulfilling a life-long dream with Dune. Because it’s not solely about telling a comprehensive intergalactic ‘coming of age’ story, about political intrigue and exploitative greed, power, space colonisation and subjugation for spice (for he who controls the spice, controls the universe). Villeneuve is intent on making the audience feel every passionate weight and soul in his grandiose adaptation of Frank Herbert’s renowned book anthology. It is a stark contrast from David Lynch’s 1984 version, well-documented for its on-set troubles, Lynch at odds with a big-budgeted spectacle, studio interference, and compromised editing to ensure a two-hour running time. It’s an unfortunate set of circumstances, and time has been kind to it to grant it cult status. But time has allowed for this iteration of Dune to deliver the best possible version for the big screen, losing that 80s campy flair for a more serious encapsulation, and utilising the best in modern technology. This is a different beast altogether. For those familiar with Herbert’s book or Lynch’s version, the latest adaptation follows the same pattern. But the real skill to Villeneuve’s direction is its accessibility towards the Dune mythology. For all the different houses (Atreides, Harkonnen, The Emperor, Fremen), cultures and languages, the emphasised care and meticulous attention always finds a way to bring its concept right down to Earth.  As Chani (Zendaya) introduces the history of Arrakis – a mixture of beauty followed by its subsequent oppression – spice exploitation mirrors the countless wars fought in Africa and the Middle East over their natural resources, most notably in the aftermath of The War on Terror. Science fiction has always been a gateway to explain the brutalised predicament of our natural world, but at its heart are the basic principles we deeply connect with – family, friendships, love, loyalty, betrayal, and destiny. The subtle evocation of the ‘bull’ and ‘matador’ throughout the film shows how much nuance it’s willing to draw upon when it’s wrestling with those dynamics of power and control. Part one – as Dune is titled – is sealed with a fate by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) in answering the Emperor’s call to manage the spice production on Arrakis. Alongside his heir Paul (Timothée Chalamet), his concubine and Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and the entire House Atreides clan, they travel to the perilous planet of Arrakis to uphold humanity’s fate. Hoping to combine forces with the Fremen – the planet’s original inhabitants – their efforts are hampered by production sabotage, desert space worms and a devastating plot to wipe out the entire Atreides bloodline. Splitting the films makes logical sense knowing how extensive the material is. The script – written by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth – emphasises its slow-burning character-building and the complex relationships that populate Dune’s landscape. It is a father trying to impart wisdom and responsibility on his curious son. A mother (who can weaponise her words using ‘the voice’), who believes her son is a path to a new future, and a son who’s struggling to understand his gift whilst living up to the expectations that have been set before him. All this, set against the backdrop of scrupulous turmoil by those who want to shape the future for their own gain. There’s no escaping the ‘white saviour’ tropes, but a lot of weight is placed on Chalamet’s young, generational shoulders to carry this adventurous story through. And he does so with aplomb. It’s his ability to instil a conflicted gentleness and restraint to his performance where he’s always at odds with his surroundings and his place in the world – a feeling made more potent the more he becomes acclimatised to Arrakis. Like all good character stories that Villeneuve has a knack for bringing the best out of, the audience is allowed to feel that same burden as Paul does, as if we’re experiencing the intensity of his dreams of Chani or the psychological effects of the spice right alongside him. Such craft and ingenuity only add to the immersive experience the film encompasses, and the various ramped-up dramatic shifts in its consequential third act. When you’re surrounded by a phenomenal cast, that performance is magnified. Rebecca Ferguson’s duality between complicity and compassion adds to the mystique of her character. Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho adds a loveable and charismatic levity. Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Vladimir Harkonnen inhabits an unnerving and ethereal existence. Even Zendaya, who graces the screen with a dreamlike demeanour, cannot be chalked up as a cameo performance (despite her limited time). Every actor plays an integral role where their arcs are given significant breathing room with an invested stake in Dune’s intricate story. The film’s only weakness is the lack of MENA actors in a film steeped heavily in its Arabic culture. But those relationships are equally matched by how much Grieg Fraser’s cinematography expands that cinematic canvas, taking full advantage of that IMAX screen (which is highly recommended). It’s a captivating technical marvel, showcasing its incredible production values in costumes and design. But that reality sinks in by Villeneuve’s complete and utterly unapologetic engagement in the film’s visual poetry. Whether it’s a sandworm devouring a spice miner, the attack on Arrakeen, or the ruthless Sardaukar silently dropping into action, it relishes every opportunity to inject reflective pauses in its action to put into perspective the scale and depth to Dune’s world-building.  But it is Hans Zimmer who delivers a score for the ages, his best since Gladiator (a statement I do not take lightly). It exquisitely complements Villeneuve’s vision, working in tandem as it evokes Dune’s emotive otherworldliness. There’s room for the big-sweeping motifs we know and love from the composer, but this is far more of an enriched involvement. It’s a spiritually poignant subversion of his previous work, enhanced by the inclusion of female voices, which ensures the genre is never a male-dominated affair. It’s like we’ve been all waiting for that next big epic story to lose ourselves in, that next Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings, and Dune indulges in that call. It is cinema at its finest, an extraordinary effort in scale, scope, craft, execution, and imagination that rightly puts it on a path as one of the best films of the year."
"Oct 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Most films are eagerly awaited by someone; with Dune, that wait has been substantial for many. Frank Herbert’s 1965 book was a franchise starter, and also a game-changer that led directly to Star Wars, so it’s no surprise that film versions have been mooted for decades. There’s even a feature film about the abortive making of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s un-filmed version, a tv show with James McAvoy and William Hurt, and David’s Lynch’s famously stilted 1984 version, and that might have been the end of that if Canadian film-maker Dennis Villeneuve hadn’t fancied it. The man behind Enemy, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 seemed like an ideal choice to make sense of a deeply tricky property; who would have guessed space-mice and bagpipes would make such a difference? And different it is, because this Dune looks and feels very different from previous versions in one striking aspect; it makes sense. Yes, even if you couldn’t tell the House of Atreides from the House of Harkonnen, Villeneuve’s Dune takes a classic story and tells it with admirable simplicity, over 150 minutes of complex space opera compellingly told. The narrative has a 60’s feel, spice, drugs and Vietnam all seem to have influenced Herbert’s vision. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet, finally showing his leading man chops to good effect) is a chosen one who might well lead the sandy people of Dune in revolt against their colonial oppressors, but who are the real enemies? The Emperor is kept off-screen for now, but with Paul’s family and the House of Arteides taking control of an industrial spice operation on desert planet Arrakis after the previous occupiers left abruptly, what political machinations are clicking into gear? An opening credit immediately clarifies that this is ‘part one’ of an adaptation of the novel, but it’s still immensely satisfying; the final duel in the sand tops off a narrative that’s stronger for being stripped down to the key elements. The film’s look is dynamic, almost like a silent movie, and Villeneuve knows how to use special effects to develop rather than smother a narrative. There’s high-end support from Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Charlotte Rampling, Rebecca Ferguson and others; for once, all the stars have lots to do, with bags of exposition detail handled in an accessible, creative fashion. The overall effect of Dune is overwhelming in the right way; you’re left wanting more, a quality rarer than intergalactic spice in the world of blockbusters. While movies like Star Wars and The Matrix have borrowed from the world of Dune, it’s something of a relief to finally see a great story told well. I’ve made a habit of mocking other bloggers about their interest in invented titles like Sandworms of Panopticon IV; The Chyrizalids of Bazingoid 5, but if I’d seen a movie like this at an impressionable age, I might well have embraced the fantasy world from the get-go. With a mind-blowing sci-fi production, a terrific Hans Zimmer score, and all the pieces falling into place, Dune is the must-see movie of 2021 so far, and has the potential to be an iconic Godfather-level franchise for grown-ups in the years to come. The first one is the best of the trilogy, by the third it’s a bit of a slog, there’s all sorts of appendage books too but I haven’t done those.  That’s right, maybe I didn’t make this clear. This is the first half of book one. Part Two will be the second part of book one. That’s why we need part two.  I honestly didn’t know this until I sat down in the cinema, but I think it’s worth telling people about, otherwise you’ll be expecting a whole not of narrative that hasn’t even been shot yet….focus on the ears! Yeah hopefully by the time I get round to seeing it part 2 will be in the works. Otherwise it’s a bit of a let down.  All ears sorted, we’re steady as she goes now. So, my previous attempts at leaving a comment were directly on the site.
Now I am trying through the reader. Since Fraggle’s went through, I’m hoping this will too. As much as I can be about any movie, I think so.
I will be debating about whether to watch it on Prime, and shell out the blasphemous amount of money they want, when it hits Stateside. It is really hard for me to justify 20 to watch a movie once :-/
But the thing is, I do want Part II to exist. I hope Villeneuve has fully storyboarded when the Zagorth commander returns the scared pearls of Ufonia; I love the way the space mice just act like it’s no big deal !  See, look at you picking up the lingo like an old pro! We’ll have you talking like on old scifi nerd in no time and nobody will ever know it was just a sudden thing. I think you should hire yourself out to indie SF writers so you can produce names for their planets and systems. You’d make a mint! (5cents at a time, but still, a mint!) If I could capture the moment that Lord Graal summoned the cyberpanthers of Mazog to free him from his plastic prison, then it’ll be all worthwhile.  Dune can be most interesting as a galactic adventure and society that doesn’t need so many exotic creatures like Star Wars.  All the people roles are humanoids and yet it somehow wasn’t too human-centric.  That reaffirms Frank Herbert’s unique mark on the SF genre.  Denis Villeneuve’s too. This really awakened an interest in sci-go that I have not felt for a while; as you say, less jazzy than the imitations, but grounded in recognisable human behaviour. It’s a landmark movie. I watched it at the cinema on Sunday and it was a true cinematic experience. We knew the visuals were going to be gorgeous but what blew my mind was the sound. Not just the score but the incredible sound mixing. For those that know the book, when Paul and Jessica used “the voice,” it sent shivers down my spine, in a good way! I want to see it again, and I really really hope Part 2 gets made. That intergalactic subtitled burp before the title cards set the tone. Comedian Ronnie Corbett has a catchphrase “I won’t do the voice…” which came to mind in these scenes. It made the Lynch version look like a cosplay of this one; like you, I hope people turn out and make Dune a sandy tentpole. have spoken to a few people who surprised me my liking the Lynch version. Like you, I can’t watch it, it’s so awful! Unless there’s a re-cut, I’ll be avoiding it…the tv version looks better, but it won’t be as good as the new 2021 version! I totally agree. Wasn’t sure if I would like it, but it was way better than I imagined, and I’m looking forward to part 2! I may be way ahead of the curve too on this.  But I agree with Ralph Fiennes who would bring quite a distinction to the role as Jose Ferrer did. Because I like Virginia Madsen as the Emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan, in Lynch’s Dune, I now wonder who will be cast as Irulan for Part 2 of Villeneuve’s Dune.

"Oct 17, 2021",POSITIVE,This film truly feels like a sci-fi masterpiece.
"Oct 17, 2021",POSITIVE," Most of us who've read Frank Herbert's 1965 novel Dune have experienced it in the form of mass-market paperbacks so thick and dense they could double as wheel chocks for a Cessna. If you've made it all the way through even once, the spine on your personal copy will have been battered into submission such that it takes on the appearance of the Bonneville salt flats — rough, faded, riddled with spidery cracks.  This has less to do with any degree of ardor you may or may not have brought to your experience of reading the book, and everything to do with the sheer number of times you found yourself shuttling back and forth and back again between your current place in the proceedings and Herbert's extensive glossary in the back.  The world of Herbert's novel is made up of many worlds, many ruling galactic Houses, many competing infrastructural interests working to seize power through means both overt and skullduggerous, to say nothing of the thousands of years of interstellar intrigue and bloodshed that take place before the book opens.  That density of reference and cross-reference is, of course, a contributing factor to the novel's enduring appeal — the sense that Herbert did the hard work to fully imagine both his characters and the forces that shape them, and place them into the deeply stratified society of the worlds he depicts. It's also a major reason why efforts to adapt the novel, and its sequels, have confounded directors from Alejandro Jodorowsky (whose aborted attempt is the subject of the excellent, if unimaginatively named, documentary Jodorowsky's Dune), to David Lynch (who actually made a deeply idiosyncratic and profoundly muddled film version in 1984), to John Harrison's straightforward yet undercooked 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries. Any successful adaptation of Dune must strike a fine balance, nodding toward Herbert's densely interwoven galactic network of competing and overlapping interests without letting all those voices subsume the surprisingly clear, even archetypal, reluctant-hero narrative at the work's center.  Any adaption attempted today must also deal with something no previous version has had to address as directly: our growing, long-overdue contemporary cultural skepticism towards Chosen One narratives, particularly those of the White Savior variety. Make no mistake: Dune is a Chosen One narrative writ galactic — a White Savior story on an epic, sweeping scale. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, who spends much of the first hour or so of the film brooding Byronically in long frock coats on windswept promontories overlooking the sea) has been genetically engineered to be a leader known as the kwisatz haderach. (Yep, an italicized term already, in the first sentence of the premise description; if that concerns you at all, this movie will not be your jam.) His father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have been tasked with taking over the desert planet Arrakis (aka Dune, keep up), the sole source of a mind-altering spice that makes interstellar travel possible. They are taking the planet over from the vile Harkonnens, a House led by an evil Baron named, it may not surprise you to learn, Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgard, getting a second use out of his Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again fat suit). During its reign over Arrakis, the House has cruelly dealt with the planet's indigenous population, known as the Fremen — humans perfectly adapted to harsh desert life.  Paul keeps having gauzy, prophetic dreams featuring a Fremen named Chani (Zendaya) that director Denis Villeneuve shoots as if they're the world's most arid Dior commercials. Over the course of the film, young Paul starts to come into his power, reluctantly realizing that he may in fact be the subject of not one but two prophecies — the powerful kwisatch haderach forseen by the shadowy space-witches known as the Bene Gesserit, and the religious savior called the Mahdi by the Fremen. Hello! You, who don't know a Sardaukar from a Shai-hulud, who couldn't pick the Shadout Mapes out of lineup of Shadouts, are in for a treat. Villeneuve has made a grand, epic film that features the kind of action and spectacle you're likely expecting — but he hasn't let the sheer staggering scope of the endeavor sway him from his penchant for moody introspection. As he did in Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, he works in the genre of science fiction but lets his camera linger on his characters' expressions and body language, grounding viewers in the realm of human emotion even as massive spaceships explode and giant sandworms roar behind them. His screenplay distills Herbert's hilariously dense network of galactic institutions down to the major players. You'll miss some nuance, maybe, but that's why God made wikis for you to consult on the way home from the theater. The film also, importantly, contemporizes the book's stilted dialogue, and in so doing willingly trades any sense of mythic portentousness for something looser and more alive. You'll catch visual shout-outs to Apocalypse Now and Lawrence of Arabia, among many other films, and Greig Fraser's cinematography will dazzle you with its sense of immensity and emptiness. You'll think the film drags a bit in the middle, and that it ends on a weirdly anti-climactic note, and you'll wonder why the promotional material featured Zendaya so much, when she gets only a handful of lines at the very end. You'll be very right on all scores — this is only the first half of the story, after all.  Knowing that bit of information will save you a lot of concern and confusion, trust me. If you know the story in full, you'll watch each scene unfold, idly (and later on, not-so-idly) wondering how far this massive, stately ocean-liner of a film can possibly get before ending. That's because Villeneuve's pacing is never anything less than even and deliberate — you'll feel each story beat landing, one after the other, in unhurried succession.  You will likely admire the efficiency with which the screenplay trots out this or that bit of Herbertian lore. And while Villeneuve's judiciously steady, even-keel approach may make you may miss Lynch's idiosyncratic, subconscious, quasi-Jungian riffing on the source text (""The toooooooth!""), you certainly won't miss the 1984 film's relentless, inescapable voiceover.  Knowing in advance exactly where Villeneuve chooses to end Dune: Part One will help you relax into the storytelling and the spectacle of the thing. Yes, you'll maybe wince at those moments when the score busts out a call-to-prayer as Paul performs some quasi-mystical feat — a choice that seems at once unearned and on the nose. And even a filmmaker as drawn to emotional nuance as Villeneuve could do much to turn the book's villain — the cartoonishly eeeeevil Baron Harkonnen — into anything but the one-note baddie he is. But in moments big (a sandworm attack) and small (a quiet conversation between Isaac's melancholy Duke and Chalamet's sullen Paul), Dune plays itself out with an assured confidence that encourages you to settle in for the long (2 hours and 35 minutes!) haul — and eagerly (!) await Part Two."
"Oct 16, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 vast sci-fi novel, Dune, puts on a conquest to rein in its material with atmosphere. It’s hard to ignore the gorgeous nature of the film – often feeling like you’ve been transported into another world entirely. Mentally, you think every rumble of a spaceship, every grain of sand on the desert planet Arrakis, and every glassy stare of each character as they scan something in the distance. As we’ve seen from Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, Villeneuve has a penchant for setting up an otherworldly atmosphere. In naming Dune his “dream project,” there’s a considerable amount of detail and care with the two-and-a-half-hour-plus excavation. The daunting task was fitting all of Dune’s themes, such as political tensions, betrayal, strife over natural resources, and mind-altering powers in a way that fans and non-fans alike can embrace. Along with writers Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve certainly had a daunting task ahead of them. Herbert’s novel almost feels like an impenetrable conquest that Hollywood can’t pierce. 2021’s Dune is a movie event in every sense of the word, where cinematographer Greig Fraser sought to make every environment divergent and profound. When you visit the Atreides home base of Caladan, the oceans are plentiful, and waves feel all too real – in contrast to the hot, barren terrain of Arrakis. Just from the look, you can get the sense of division between the house of Atreides and the Fremen, a group of people who live on Arrakis and have adapted to the rough year-round weather. The House Harkonnen, an overarching autocratic body, has been inflicting cruelty on the Fremen, as their planet has a rich resource called Spice. It’s used for various things – healing properties, fuel, and hallucinogenic qualities. The emperor has placed Atreides in charge of the place. Duke Leto (Oscar Issac) accepts, but recognizes that there is potential to be backstabbed. That’s the geopolitical layer. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has destiny ahead of him. He’s having vivid dreams of a blue-eyed girl named Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen, along with other visions of death and conquest. His mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is a part of a religious sect called the Bene Gesserit who can use their voice to mind control. Paul shares brief time with both Leto and Jessica for different reasons. Leto looks to him as the heir to the throne, while Jessica tries to instill discipline in him to use his abilities. Although concise, it’s a good differentiation to how the patriarchal/matriarchal struggles can play out. In speaking about the scale of this film, it’s so large that it needs anchors. One comes from the weighty and terrific score by Hans Zimmer. Its minimalistic hums with drums, bagpipes, and occasional lead-in choruses will bring a steady and robust rumble to your seat. The other is an attempt to make the vast elements of this story digestible, even though it feels like a constant barrage of information arriving in your brain matter. That’s the trouble that David Lynch’s 1984 version found. How do you make this theme-rich story into something that follows the lines of cohesion? Villeneuve succeeds in some ways, but really because there’s a hope of future narratives to flesh things out. 2021’s Dune is constructed with more films in mind and will leave you wanting more from it. All the performances are as good as needed, but hopefully, the emotional elements are more abundant as we advance. Chalamet, Issac, and Ferguson all serve their characters well. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa play Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho, two mentors of Paul on opposite sides of the spectrum. Gurney has a tough-love element with a hatred towards the Fremen, while Duncan has a more relaxed, approachable side. Zendaya shows up in the latter part of the movie to have a more prominent role in future installments, as Javier Bardem as Stilgar, a leader of the particular Fremen tribe. If you remember The Cell, that’s the manner in how Villeneuve introduces Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). His stature is enormous and can morph in height as he becomes more confrontational. It feels like it’s mainly bottled up to be used later for all the creepiness that we see. World-building is the primary focus here, but there are extreme elements of danger and action. Especially once the sandworms are introduced and the house Atreides get ambushed by the Harkonnen. So, this Dune is fighting a constant battle, being its tempered restraint in the story and the gigantism displayed on the screen. You almost want to join the call from the bleachers for a sequel to see if Villeneuve can pull this off to a full degree. Especially with the film’s conclusion that slams shut like a trapped door.

"Oct 15, 2021",POSITIVE," “When you have lived with prophecy so long, the moment of revelation is a shock,” says a character in Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s foundational 1965 sci-fi novel Dune. A native of the desert planet where much of the film and novel are set—Arrakis, aka Dune—she is commenting on how Dune’s new ruling family seems to be falling in line with the messiah prophecy her people, the Fremen, have long held dear. But she might as well be talking about the film itself. For decades, people have been trying to put on film Herbert’s supposedly “unfilmable” source material, which contains a galaxy of information—a thick glossary of vocabulary and concepts, a heavily omniscient narrative (any given scene may be interrupted by multiple characters’ thoughts), a thicket of tangents, intricate politics and attendant betrayals, ethnographies of various cultures, and a messiah character, Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet here) whose rise to prominence means different things to different groups within the book, politically and religiously. His existence is said to bridge space and time, past and future. He has the entire universe on his shoulders, and Herbert’s universe is a big universe indeed; it reportedly took him five years to research and write the original Dune novel. For those who don’t know a Kwisatz Haderach from a hole in the wall, this may already seem like too much. At screenings of David Lynch’s 1984 stab at Dune, a glossary was distributed to help orient theatergoers. That they were expected to consult the distributed sheets in the dark underlines the exercise in futility. Lynch’s Dune was high-profile (Sting was in it!) and heavily hyped, and then consequently disappointed at the box office. (Alternately silent-movie severe and laughably messy, with the effects alone showing he bit off more than probably anyone could chew at that point in technology, the movie is nonetheless a wacky good time). Beloved Chilean-French art-film maverick Alejandro Jodorowsky famously failed at adapting Dune in the ’70s (his aborted production, which was to feature design by Alien’s H.R. Giger and acting from Salvador Dalí, was immortalized in the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune). The Sci Fi channel has adapted Dune and other books in Herbert’s series, though under budgetary constraints typical of that network’s productions. In short, Dune has never been done right on film, and yet the belief in its possibility has endured. Every time, it’s been, “Maybe this time.” Well, this time is in fact the time.  Villeneuve’s Dune—subtitled Part 1, as it covers roughly half of Herbert’s first Dune book—is, above all else, elegant. The director has carved a coherent, albeit still complicated, story out of an unwieldy slab of imagination. Expository sequences, like the introduction of the antagonist Baron Harkonnen, that went on and on for pages in Herbert’s book, are far shorter in Villeneuve’s impressive distillation (courtesy of a script by him and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth). With a story like this, which traces the House Atreides’s doomed transition from their homeland of Caladan (which resembles Earth) to running Arrakis and how Paul’s multiple birthrights fit in, one can easily get tangled in details. If anything, Villeneuve plays a little fast and loose—while watching, I had to wonder if I’d be drowning in sand were I not already intimately familiar with Dune. I can see that what Villeneuve rushes past and asks you to accept—for example, a human computer or mentat named Thufir Hawat (played by Stephen McKinley Henderson) whose eyes go all white when he performs his calculations—might be indecipherable to the point of distraction. I’m not a big fan of movies or TV shows that require prior research for comprehension (a big issue I had with Game of Thrones), and I understand that the unfamiliar may wish they had remained unfamiliar upon entering Villeneuve’s world. There are a lot of big asks here. Herbert’s story is simplified but not dumbed down. But there’s a lot to love here, most especially the imagery. Villeneuve shuffles renderings of Herbert’s ideas on and off screen with a certain, “Hey look at this!” glee. A remote-controlled assassination device called a hunter seeker looks like a flying shrimp. You feel the wall-shaking presence of a sandworm, a giant creature on Arrakis that could use a megalodon as a toothpick. The Atreides’ space travel vessels are all brutalist marvels. The aircraft used on Arrakis—the ornithopter—has four sets of wings that move like a dragonfly’s. There’s an overhead shot of a few thopters flying over the dune-strewn sands of Arrakis that I want to see again, in the way I like to revisit paintings. This is a routinely eye-popping movie, which is no small feat considering that the color palate on Arrakis is essentially a spectrum of beige. Well-known mycophile/psychonaut Paul Stamets claimed Herbert told him that psilocybin had a considerable influence on Dune—most prominently in its spice, a psychoactive substance mined only on Arrakis that allows for advanced cognition and distant space travel. As if an extension of Terence McKenna’s “stoned ape” theory of evolution, which posits that magic mushrooms were responsible for the evolutionary leap from homo erectus to homo sapiens, Herbert’s spice is an even stronger consciousness-expanding substance. And so from a purely visual perspective, Villeneuve makes good on Dune’s legacy. This movie is a trip, and not only that, it’s a good one. Still, there’s at least a little nudging of optics by Villeneuve. The movie opens with a monologue from Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen who populates Paul’s dreams in advance of their meeting. “My planet Arakkis is so beautiful when the sun is low,” are the first words she speaks at the start of the movie, in stunning contrast to the way Arrakis is spoken about by so many of its non-native characters. Jessica and weapons master Gurney Halleck both refer to Arrakis in the book as “this hell planet,” and Leto calls it “a hell I’ve reached before death.” The perspective has always zeroed in on Dune’s inhospitable nature, that no one would ever elect to go there were it not for the import of the spice (he who controls the spice controls the universe, the saying goes). But Chani, right up front, provides us with a different lens. The outsiders who mine the spice “ravage our lands in front of our eyes,” she says. “Their cruelty to my people is all I’ve known.” In describing the Imperial transition of Arrakis from the House Harkonnen to Atreides, Chani wonders: “Why did the emperor choose this path, and who will our next oppressors be?” As crucial as this framing is, Chani is somewhat inconsequential to the overall narrative here, though she’d be more prominently featured in the proposed second movie, as the section of the book that would cover is much more focused on Paul’s dealings with the Fremen. Zendaya has maybe 15 minutes of screen time in total. About two-thirds of the way into this Dune, a major invasion occurs that leaves the House Atreides under siege. If much of the movie leading up to that point feels like setup (and I really don’t think that it does, but I know this is a common complaint), then this burst of action is certainly the payoff. Then the action recedes a bit and Dune settles into something more bleak and contemplative. The pacing feels irregular, not quite what we expect from a tentpole whose trajectory (typically on the backs of flying superheroes) goes up-up-and-away until the credits roll. Dune’s rhythm, in contrast, is more like a sand walk—the irregular way the Fremen pass over their planet’s sands so as not to summon the sandworms underneath who are attracted to surface staccato. I’m not sure to what degree this rhythmic likeness is intended, but it works! It all works. Pure spectacle is in Dune’s DNA. This is the strongest argument yet for returning to the movies during a pandemic. This is a shock of the most welcome kind."
"Oct 15, 2021",POSITIVE," Is Frank Herbert’s 1965 science fiction best-seller Dune unfilmable? Alejandro Jodorowsky spent several years and $2m trying to turn the book into an epic starring Salvador Dali and Mick Jagger. David Lynch’s 1984 version at least made it to the screen, though make sense it largely did not. (The producer Dino de Laurentiis, who slashed Lynch’s five-hour cut to just over two, later confessed that “we destroyed Dune in the editing room”.) Whereas those directors are visionaries, Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) is a journeyman with visual flair. On the evidence of his Dune, this may be what is needed to wrestle the unruly material into shape. His first smart decision is not to compress Herbert’s novel into a single film. (A trilogy is on the cards if this one is a hit.) His second is to remember that, for all its monsters, melees and skulduggery, Dune is a coming-of-age story in which a young man dreams of a woman in a far-off land. Setting out to find her, he finds himself in the process. This is Paul (Timothée Chalamet), heir to the House of Atreides, the ruling family on the “homeworld” of Caladan in the year 10191. The word “planet” seems to have fallen slightly from favour in the 102nd century, though coffee has survived, thank God. That said, some of the preparation techniques – using spit in lieu of water, for instance – wouldn’t pass muster at the better high-street chains. Saliva latte, anyone? Paul’s father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), has been appointed steward of the desert world Arrakis, long exploited for its precious hallucinogenic spice “melange”, which extends life, facilitates interstellar travel, and turns the eyes of the indigenous Fremen people a piercing electric blue. It is one such creature, Chani (Zendaya), who has been materialising in Paul’s dreams. The Duke aims to bring a kinder stewardship to Arrakis than his predecessor, the savage Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), but imperialism with a smile is still imperialism. Like any good adolescent waking up to the ills of the world, Paul feels a burning sympathy for the underdogs, such as Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who tells the Duke that “the desert was ours long before you came”, then spits on the floor as a sign of respect. They’re all at it. Paul has his own burgeoning powers to grapple with. His mother, Lady Jessica (the vivid Rebecca Ferguson), has passed on to him her supernatural abilities. “You made me a freak!” he fumes, as she shudders with a mix of fear at his anger and pride at his strength. It’s like watching Hamlet and Gertrude in space. The pleasure of Chalamet’s performance, and the film in general, lies in how nimbly it moves between the grand and the parochial. Paul has a momentous destiny before him but he can still be a whiny little squirt, shrugging off combat training (“I’m not in the mood”) and telepathy practice (“I just woke up”). Chalamet, with his gooey eyes and upside-down triangle of a face, plays Paul as surly yet diligent, like James Dean revising for his mocks. This contrast between an interior life and its far-reaching responsibilities is felt throughout a film that thrives on disparities of scale – as in the cuts between a hulking spaceship and a shot of Paul picking a blade of grass, or from a tiny jerboa to the immense sloping sand dune that it uses as its playground. Villeneuve and his cinematographer Greig Fraser dramatise the abundant space without over-filling it, using small details (a frieze, a shaft of light) to suggest a surrounding vastness. Though he lacks Lynch’s transgressive imagination, Villeneuve provides a powerful sense of motion and inevitability as Paul is drawn across the galaxy towards his fate. And his Dune has its own concentrated strangeness, from Hans Zimmer’s booming score, which incorporates what sounds like a chorus of screams, to the sight of Charlotte Rampling, as the intimidating Truthsayer, whose elongated black hat-and-veil combo makes her resemble a postbox in mourning. The heart can’t help but sink slightly at any two-and-a-half-hour movie that announces itself as “Part One” and closes with the line, “This is only the beginning.” By the end, though, it is possible to feel admiration and even gratitude for a blockbuster so clean and curious in detail, and so comparatively short on bombast. Roll on Part Two – but hold the saliva latte."
"Oct 15, 2021",POSITIVE," And, yes, I know Frank Herbert’s source material novel was published a dozen years before George Lucas’ cowboy space opera and no doubt influenced Lucas. But we’re talking about cinematic adaptations here so that’s my opener, and I’m sticking with it. Herbert’s 1965 landmark novel is so dense and layered and enormously complex that many have long believed it was folly to even attempt a big-screen adaptation, and that was certainly borne out in David Lynch’s 1984 version, which even David Lynch didn’t like.  But Villeneuve (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Arrival”) is a master at creating mind-boggling futuristic worlds, and he tops himself with the overwhelmingly striking imagery in “Dune.” Whether we’re gazing in wonder at some of the most gigantic spacecrafts in movie history, the fashionably functional battle costumery, the helicopter-like ornithopters with multiple blades that make them zip about like menacing insects or the spectacularly vast and forbidding sand-and-spice desert planet of Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, this is a feast for the senses. “Dune” is set in the year 10191 (none of that 30 years in the future nonsense here!), in which the Emperor of the Known Universe has decreed House Atreides should oversee the ongoing colonization of the desert planet of Arrakis, the source of the most valuable commodity in the world: a glimmering “spice” that is essentially a drug that can produce longer life spans, increased vigor and other powers. (In the original work, it’s clearly a metaphor for oil as well.) Once Duke Leto and his troops and his family are ensconced on Arrakis, they have to contend with not only the deeply distrustful Freman who are tucked away in the most forbidding trenches and corners of the planet but also with the villainous, grotesquely oversized, Jabba-the-Hutt-like Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), the former steward of Arrakis, who has been booted from the planet and will stop at nothing to exact his bloody revenge on House Atreides.  Thanks to the magnificently malevolent performance by the great Skarsgard and some Oscar-worthy makeup and special effects, Vladimir Harkonnen is one of the most memorable antagonists in recent film history. As we continue to marvel at the color-coordinated battle gear, the stark and vast interiors and the beautiful yet daunting outside world of Arrakis, Chalamet’s Paul struggles to interpret his dreams, which often feature a beautiful Fremen warrior named Chani (Zendaya), who seems to hold the key to his fate.  Meanwhile, Paul’s almost apparition-like Aunt Gaius Helen Mohiam (it’s Charlotte Rampling beneath the veil) puts Paul to the test in harrowing fashion to determine if he is indeed the chosen one. And, oh, yes, there are some terrific battle sequences and some emotionally impactful deaths, and we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Javier Bardem acting as if he’s doing Shakespeare onstage as he plays Stilgar, the leader of a cunning and dangerous Fremen tribe. It will quite likely be two or three years before we see Part 2, which is still in pre-production. But now that the stage has been set in such lavish and epic fashion, it’s not unreasonable to expect the remainder of the journey to be even more impressive."
"Oct 15, 2021",NEUTRAL," Unless you’ve been under a rock the last two and a half years you surely know that Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is finally being released to both theatrical and home audiences via HBO Max on October 22nd. Like me you may have had some of your most blissful cinematic moments with Villeneuve. From his enthralling detective drama Prisoners to his otherworldly narrating fish in Maelström Denis has constantly shirked convention and brought to life a visual story that feels fresh or an improvisation on the previous tools of cinema. Which is a long way of saying that walking into a Villeneuve film feels very much like walking into a Spielberg. You have expectations, how could you not. And unfortunately those expectations were unmet. Anyone familiar with Dune knows the moments that are cinematic and has personal moments that are cinematic to them, the ones that played like a filmbook in their heads, whether it’s the thopter rescue sequence on Arrakis, Paul reaching into the box, the hunter seeker sequence, or the siege by the Harkonnen. You will have personally had these sprawling crystal clear visions of cinematic splendor or stark pieces of affecting drama in your head. And that’s precisely where Dune begins to fall apart; nothing feels personal. Intimacy is missing between the audience and the vistas of Arrakis, the characters of Dune, and it’s storyline. From the lack of world building to the poorly framed miniatures on screen meant to erupt as yawning behemoths, even the worlds of Calladan and Arrakis are small. They lack character, their meaning to the audience is clouded and we’re nearly always briskly trotting somewhere new with Paul which keeps us from ever becoming invested in the characters around him, which are the true magic of the world. Despite the scaling issues, the drop off from Villeneuve’s recent SciFi film collaborators is noticeable. The step down from Roger Deakins in Blade Runner 2049 with some of the best cinematography in the last decade and Bradford Young in Arrival with a intimacy and love sickness that somehow feels woven into the imagery to recent Adam McKay collaborator Greig Fraser is severe. The layered compositions are absent, instead stark cold images hang like laundry on screen, uninteresting and rigid. Obscured by nothing and harshly naked. The images aren’t zhuzhed up, they don’t seem to have been made with an effort to make them more appealing, or framed in a way to exemplify the scale we should feel we’re witnessing. Not just the cinematography but the whole film seems like more than this team was capable of taking on. But I must commend the splendor and effectiveness of Hans Zimmer’s score. Using an assortment of wind instruments to make the sands and billowing winds of Arrakis come to life aurally. With Bagpipes, wind chimes, and what seems to be the sounds of wind itself used in tandem with other musical components. Zimmer schemed out and achieved something big through small choices to conjure the atmosphere of an otherwise meaningless place. Huge performers like Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin scarcely have a moment of solitude or development. Everything is reactionary, and what brief exposition is achieved is typically narrowly focused on Paul in ways that don’t inform the feeling of the further picture at large. Stephen McKinley Henderson’s portrayal of the Mentat Thufir Hawat is one particularly effective bit of casting that allows one of our era’s great character actors to use his miniscule moments to humanize and embolden the sentimentality of what we’re witnessing. Chalamet is restrained, perhaps those not looking for a 14 year old boy will be more moved by his performance, but with all the other poorly stacked bricks underneath him Chalamet’s Paul fell apart. Over acting in moments and seeming like stone in others. Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother Mohaim thankfully does lots of heavy lifting unquestionably in mere moments. As does Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Oscar Isaac is sturdy, believable and as you might expect from my previous words underused. In Dune’s case I think it’s safe to say the volume of talent has nothing to do with it’s issues. But rather the strategy at play to employ the available resources. If I were an audience member inexperienced with the narrative I think I would be lost. Failing to grasp the script or grandeur of the beginning of this otherworldly tale. Unsure of it’s religious names and their meanings, unclear on the topography of Arrakis, the distance of Calladan to Arrakis, where exactly the Empire is located(not to mention what they are), what the guilds are, or how interstellar travel is achieved from the spice. In essence this is nothing more than a proof of concept standard comic book hero origin story. The fact that at the end of the film we’re unclear not only all the things I mentioned but the very reason why Paul appears to be some sort of a religious figure to this planet is presumably an enormous reason why it fails. Frank Herbert’s Dune is a novel built on meaning, stakes, loss, hope, gains, and language itself. The fact that none of those strength are transitory into this representation of the narrative by Villeneuve despite the two additional writers that worked with him raises questions not only about the draft of this film. But the drafts of part 2 and further should they be allowed the chance to make further entries. You can’t remove the heart of Dune and still succeed in telling it’s story. Perhaps my most biting piece of criticism would be to look at the exposition of Episode 1: The Phantom Menace of Star Wars. How clearly and how effectively it sets up the entire arc of what’s going on with the empire and in comparison how entirely unclear and incidental that understanding is conveyed to the audience, especially those unfamiliar with the sprawling tales of Frank Herbert on which it’s based. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t focus some attention on the bungled enterprise that was bringing Lady Jessica to life on screen. She not only lacks character but seems to be a constantly crying and cold woman. Nearly all we see is her crying, being silent, or harshly instructing Paul. A far cry from the intimacy and confrontations she shares with Duke Leto, Thufir Hawat, and Paul in the first novel. The very moments of the plot where her intimacy and character and complexity come to life have been erased, rushed passed completely without being compensated for. Leaving one to wonder how much is on the cutting room floor and why they would favor a shot of palm trees rather than a sequence under their new citadel on Arrakis that if you’re familiar with you’ll know is one of the most transitory moments of the novel in conveying the character of this mother and son to the reader. Dune isn’t a bad film, but it’s so cold, distant, and unsplendorous that it could be easily mistaken for the next high budget Amazon project that has no staying power. The excruciating wait for Dune did no favors for what was already a middling exercise in adaptation of a storied novel. If anything, maybe now we’ll all have a renewed appreciation for the undertaking of Lynch in his adaptation to tell the whole story (roughly) and establish the Empire and its politics and factions all in one feature. Any way you slice it Dune fails to live up to its expectations, fair or unfair as they may be. We’ll see if Denis gets to make Part Two but for now I’m not counting on it."
"Oct 15, 2021",POSITIVE," Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen, tells us of her planet Arrakis’s beauty as the light wanes, Spice shimmering in the air.  But Spice is highly valued throughout the empire, enabling inter-stellar travel, and the Harkonnen who have been harvesting it have been brutal in their treatment of the Fremen.  Meanwhile on the planet of Caladan, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has been seeing Chani in his dreams and will become mired in politics and betrayal when the emperor decrees that his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), will assume the role held by the Harkonnen in “Dune.” Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen, tells us of her planet Arrakis’s beauty as the light wanes, Spice shimmering in the air.  But Spice is highly valued throughout the empire, enabling inter-stellar travel, and the Harkonnen who have been harvesting it have been brutal in their treatment of the Fremen.  Meanwhile on the planet of Caladan, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has been seeing Chani in his dreams and will become mired in politics and betrayal when the emperor decrees that his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), will assume the role held by the Harkonnen in “Dune.” I’m still waiting for Alejandro Jodorowsky’s “Dune,” the legendary unmade movie chronicled in 2013’s “Jodorowsky’s Dune,” but in the interim we have cowriter (with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth)/director Denis Villeneuve’s (""Blade Runner: 2049"") adaptation of Frank Herbert’s science fiction classic hoping to do what David Lynch couldn’t back in 1984.  Villeneuve’s is definitely coherent and features a few thrilling moments, but it is also a big, lumbering affair too reminiscent of “Star Wars” with a dash of “Apocalypse Now” that takes over two and a half hours to conclude by telling us ‘This is only the beginning.’
The film takes a lot of time introducing its main characters, many of whom won’t survive ‘part one.’  When he isn’t dreaming, the young Atreides is being prodded by his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to learn the mind control powers of the Bene Gesserit, something she is admonished for by Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), as the Bene Gesserit are an all female religious organization.  But Jessica believes her son to be what the Fremen call the Mahdi, a Savior the Bene Gesserit have been carefully plotting through breeding.
The Atreides arrive on Arrakis hoping to fulfill their mission with more compassionate rule, the Duke having sent Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) ahead of time to form an alliance with the Fremen, but Leto’s suspicions that the emperor has set him up prove true.  While betrayals run deep, there is one motivated by the life of his wife who also supplies the Duke with a method to poison himself along with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) when the time comes.
Kidnapped by Harkonnen during an attack aided by the emperor’s own army of Sardaukars, Lady Jessica and her son overcome their captors to find themselves far out in a desert where giant sandworms threaten.  They will be accepted by both Duncan’s contact Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani after Paul successfully counters a challenge set forth by Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun).
Director of photography Greig Fraser has chosen a dreary palette, Caladan gray and shadowy, Arrakis all sand.  The film’s overall design is unmemorable except for its helicopters, designed to both look and operate like dragonflies.  Scenes set on both Caladan and Arrakis cannot help but recall various locations from the “Star Wars” franchise (ironic given Herbert’s book’s influence on Lucas) and Baron Harkonnen’s introduction is pure Colonel Kurtz.  Hans Zimmer’s score is predictable.  Everything about this film feels serviceable rather than surprising.
That is not to criticize the cast, who all acquit themselves well, Momoa in particular adding some much needed levity.  Isaac makes his character’s loss hit hard.  Chalamet plays Paul as a dreamer stepping up with more and more confidence, but one gets the impression he will be further tested in a concluding film.  The film’s other prominent players are Josh Brolin as Atreides weapons master Gurney Halleck, Stephen McKinley Henderson as security chief Thufir Hawat, Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet Kynes and Chang Chen as Dr. Wellington Yueh.  Dave Bautista is typecast as Beast Rabban Harkonnen.
Speaking of other film influences, this adaptation features a weird new element that feels ripped out of a Christopher Nolan movie, the totemic presence of a bull and matador sculpture representing the Duke’s father, a reference that would make more sense for Isaac’s Gomez character in “The Addams Family” (and yes, I understand the bullfighting is referenced in the book).

Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is given royal stewardship to the vital and dangerous planet of Arrakis, the galaxy’s only source of the precious spice called “mélange.” Political intrigue and betrayal force him to protect his concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and his son and heir, Paul (Timothee Chalimet), and he must put them into the hands of the ferocious Fremen warriors who inhabit the hostile planet in “Dune.”
Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, Dune, was one of my all time sci-fi favorites when I was growing up in the turbulent ‘60s and it got more than one reading. Then, back in 1984, Hollywood continued serving the science-fiction bug started by the “Star Wars” craze and hired David Lynch (yes, the “Twin Peaks” and “Eraserhead” David Lynch) and spent a boat load of money on the lavish production. The resulting “Dune (1984)” was, well, a dud.
37 years have passed since the failure of that first try and Warner Bros hopefully thinks the world forgot all about it. This time around, they hired an experienced sci-fi director with Denis Villeneuve and, co-writing the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, they come up with a two hour and 35 minute PART ONE to the “Dune” saga.
House Atreides is just one of the families controlling the intergalactic empire in the year 10191 and there is a constant jockeying for power in the realm. This ongoing political intrigue is the beginning of the beginning of the story, “Dune.” If you have not read the book, look up a good synopsis of the story to give you some firmer footing when you watch.
The elements of the original story are all there and the filmmakers do a good job in laying the groundwork for the large and capable cast. The money is up there on the screen with flashy CGI that effectively lay out this distant future universe. The production looks great and puts us into the harsh desert world of Arrakis with its coveted spice and, more important and deadly, the sand worms that protect the planet and its Freman habitants.
The problem that I have with this part one of the story is that I know all of the really good stuff takes place in the second half. Thus, knowing the book and story, I knew I was only getting a snack posing as a banquet and will have to wait some undefined time before we get the rest of the story.

In 2016, when discussing David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune,"" in which she played Princess Irulan, actor Virginia Madsen said she thought the filmmakers were out to make ""Star Wars for adults."" Two years later, when he was first announced to adapt the novel anew, director Denis Villeneuve said the same thing. A full year after it was intended to hit multiplexes, Villeneuve's attempt to bring the storied novel to life will arrive in theaters simultaneously with its home release on HBO Max, a pandemic content strategy the director has been vocal in criticizing. 





Under normal circumstances, wondering whether or not ""Dune"" will be a success at the box office would be an irrelevant question in reviewing the film's quality, but given the strange nature of this adaptation, it's unfortunately a very important topic. In trying to unpack the dense and layered 412-page novel, Villeneuve and his collaborators, screenwriters Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, cleaved the book in two, with this film covering (roughly) the first half of the book. But because the studio was leery of committing to filming both halves before releasing the first, we won't know if the rest of the book will be adapted until after more number-crunching post-opening.
That means ""Dune"" ends on a cliffhanger and arrives missing significant chunks of its source material. (Princess Irulan, for instance, is never even introduced.)





Villeneueve's ""Dune"" is a stunning achievement in terms of awe, in terms of spectacle, and in its standing as one of the few new films that can genuinely lay claim to needing to be seen on as big a screen possible. But what it peacocks in visual splendor it lacks in depth in a way that feels hard to excuse, especially for a film with a two-and-a-half hour runtime. 
Ultimately, ""Dune"" is ambitious to a fault, for what use does the marketplace of ideas have in a ""Star Wars for adults"" when the vast majority of adults these days seem to prefer the comforting, weaponized nostalgia of endless ""Star Wars"" ephemera?

For the uninitiated, ""Dune"" is a sci-fi epic set in a far-flung future, exploring a cosmic feudal society and the desert planet of Arrakis alluded to in the title that this society circulates around. Arrakis is an unforgiving terrain where ""spice,"" a drug essential to interstellar travel, is harvested; whoever controls the spice controls the universe. The film begins as House Harkonnen (led by Stellan Skarsgard's Baron) is commanded by The Emperor to cede control of Arrakis to House Atreides (led by Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto), prompting the entire Atreides clan, including Leto's son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), to move from their home world of Caladan to this dangerous new planet. 





There, they find themselves the center of an elaborate trap, with threats on all sides from the Harkonnens who want their cash cow back, forces within the Emperor's circle working against them, the Bene Gesserit's centuries long machinations coming to the fore and the Fremen, Arrakis natives tired of seeing new oppressors come and go. Also, Paul might be some kind of messiah. It's ... a lot.
What follows is an intricate web of political intrigue, dense mythology requiring artful exposition dumps, and a story that in some ways feels familiar even to newcomers. The novel, from 1965, was massively influential on mainstream science fiction in the ensuing years, so even outside of the 1984 film, ""Dune"" has thoroughly permeated the pop cultural consciousness. That means this is a film that comes with a heavy burden of needing to please ardent fans of Herbert's work and those otherwise unfamiliar with the source material. Villeneuve struggled to find this balance but didn't come to this battle unarmed.





""Dune"" has assembled one of the most stacked and pedigreed casts in recent memory, including Zendaya, (Chani, a Fremen woman featuring heavily in Paul's prophetic dreams), Rebecca Ferguson (Paul's Mother Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit concubine), Jason Momoa (charismatic swordmaster Duncan Idaho), Josh Brolin (weapons master Gurney Halleck), Dave Bautista (Glossu Raban, Baron Harkonnen's bloodthirsty nephew) and Javier Bardem (Stilgar, a Fremen tribe leader). Coupled with Greig Fraser's striking cinematography and Hans Zimmer's thunderous, oppressive score, ""Dune"" is doubtless one of the most visually appealing and aurally sumptuous viewing experiences to come out of Hollywood since Villeneuve's last megabudgeted sci-fi epic ""Blade Runner: 2049.""
While that film was certainly more colorful, more zeitgeist-y, and tethered to a classic in its own right, ""Dune"" is better paced, more sharply written, and bears the mark of a filmmaker who has learned from his last tentpole effort, having grown as a storyteller for his trouble. On a surface level, ""Dune"" works remarkably well. The locales are dazzling and well realized. The texture in the world-building is impressive. It looks, feels, and sounds astonishing. But digging deeper reveals some drawbacks. 





Having a veteran scribe like Eric Roth bringing his pen to the table certainly helps to distill the complex web of the film's plot into something somewhat digestible, but audiences will have a split reaction to the narrative. Viewers who have never read the books before will likely be enveloped by the richness in the visual storytelling, too hypnotized by the presentation and engrossed by its depiction of this world to want for more in the way of characterization. People more familiar with the story might be too frustrated by how much is left aside or abstracted to the point of nothingness to care how pretty the pictures are or how much collective gravitas the cast has amassed. It is easier to be pleased with what is presented when unaware of what is missing.
This split runs through every aspect of the film. Chalamet's central performance is captivating, to be sure, but so much of his character's interiority is lost through the way his story is told. There is so much to keep track of, regarding motivations, circumstance and positioning, that paying attention to the galactic politics and its ensemble cast will be enough work for a viewer whose concentration will be repeatedly and abruptly interrupted by Zimmer's cudgel of a score. So while it's impressive to see how good Villeneuve has gotten at grafting his arthouse sensibilities to the multiplex, it's still a little sad how much depth is lost in translation. Great if you just like seeing a gorgeous space opera writ as large as financially possible, but less so if you yearn for more from your science fiction.

Great if you just like seeing a gorgeous space opera writ as large as financially possible, but less so if you yearn for more from your science fiction. The last notable time a beloved filmmaker worked this hard to spend more than $100 million in studio money on making a franchise film ""for adults"" was in 2011, when David Fincher thought ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" could be an antidote to a direction the industry has veered even further into. But he was wrong. The era of star-driven, not IP-driven, major motion pictures made ""for grown-ups"" might never come back, but it certainly couldn't explode in the wake of the underwhelming returns that greeted ""Dragon Tattoo."" Sure, that film's R rating didn't help, but even with a PG-13, Villeneuve is fighting an uphill battle here. Compare ""Dune"" to ""A New Hope,"" the first ""Star Wars"" film. Obviously, it began a sprawling saga with endless spinoffs in various media still continuing to this day. But watching it as its own entity, it is a satisfying experience. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Even if audiences left wanting more, they could still be sated by the picture they'd just watched. ""Dune"" doesn't function that way. It isn't even like ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" where the entire trilogy was produced and filmed back to back. As it stands, ""Dune,"" which is titled onscreen as ""Dune: Part 1,"" just stops. It's a movie that is thrilling and engaging and easy to be swept up in, until its closing 20 minutes or so when becomes increasingly clear this is not a story you can pause mid-way through in any meaningful fashion. But the nature of the film's structure isn't likely to inspire the hunger for more the filmmakers here seem to think it will. Best case scenario? ""Dune"" does well domestically and a sequel gets greenlit in the next few weeks — one which won't reach audiences for another few years at the earliest. And not for a sequel or because they loved this world so much they just have to have seconds, but to literally get the rest of the story they paid to see. In an attempt to counter-program against the Marvels of the world, for whom a sprawling shared universe can protract forever off the strength of dogmatic fervor, Villeneuve and company have made ""Dune"" the Kickstarter project of tentpole motion pictures. No matter how well made it objectively is or how beloved the story, this, in the end, is an expensive proof of concept asking audiences to crowd-fund interest in ... finishing the damn thing."
"Oct 15, 2021",POSITIVE," With its Star Wars aesthetic and 2001 sensibility, Dune will put willing viewers under a sci-fi trance. The movie—a second attempt to adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, after David Lynch’s disastrous 1984 Dune—rumbles and buzzes in your ears while presenting vast alien landscapes and massive, levitating spacecraft before your eyes. There’s a tactile quality to the film—the way softly glowing lamps float alongside characters in dark hallways or fabrics drape around them and flicker violently in the wind—that makes everything feel simultaneously graspable and out of this world. But is Dune, directed by Denis Villeneuve from a screenplay by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, more than a sensory experience? Thanks to a stronger screenplay (paring away some of the lore and nomenclature) and richer performances (particularly by Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson), this Dune more deftly navigates the denseness of the novel than the earlier version. But the story is still too leaden to allow for either the emotional pull of Villeneuve’s Arrival or the existential angst of his Blade Runner 2049. As for Timothee Chalamet, who stars as Paul—the son of a duke who is sent to the title planet to mine its resources but falls in, after much interplanetary political intrigue, with the mystical, indigenous Fremen—he’s more at home in this material than one might expect (certainly more at home than Kyle MacLachlan was in Lynch’s picture). But it remains to be seen whether Chalamet—along with Zendaya, who plays a Fremen woman—can overcome the somewhat troubling archetypes they’re playing. (He as the white savior; she as the exotic native.) This is, it turns out, Dune: Part One. I’ll be curious to find out if Part Two will embrace these tropes or have the courage to interrogate the story’s colonialist implications in the subversive manner of another key (and sandy) text from the 1960s: Lawrence of Arabia."
"Oct 15, 2021",NEGATIVE," Say what you will about David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune—many people have said many unkind things about it over the years, because it's a mess—but the movie has some indelible components. The bladder-headed Guild Navigator in his interstellar traveling tank. The floating lunatic Baron Harkkonen. The incomparable Brad Dourif with his classic litany of giddy gibberish (""It is by the juice of Sappho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, the stains become a warning""). And let us not forget Sting, in his wing-embossed codpiece. Lynch didn't have final cut on Dune, his third feature film, and so was at the mercy of his producers, who demanded a manageable two-hour movie to keep theatre owners happy. This forced the director to jam the whole of Frank Herbert's weighty 1965 novel into a runtime too cramped to accommodate it. It was an experience Lynch has cursed ever since. Now director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film, Blade Runner 2049, was also an '80s exhumation, has taken his own run at Dune. Villeneuve has only been given a bit more time for his picture than Lynch was (this film runs just over two and a half hours)—but then his new Dune only covers the first part of Herbert's book. The second part, which contains much of the story's action, will require a second movie, the making of which will presumably be contingent upon the ability of this one—which is long and dark and slow—to find an audience. Maybe it will. Because the picture is gorgeous to look at, filled with moody grey interiors, imposing brutalist architecture, and endless reaches of wind-sculpted desert. The story, more clearly presented this time, remains the same. It's set 10,000 years in the future, in part on the ocean planet Caladan, home of the noble Atreides family; in part on the ugly industrial planet Giedi Prime, stronghold of the unspeakable Harkkonens; and principally on Arrakis, the parched planet known as Dune, which is the source of the coveted spice called melange. The spice enables space travel and psychic abilities, among other things, and on Arrakis it is ferociously guarded by giant sandworms, and by a native tribe called the Fremen, who resent their long oppression by off-world colonizers and now are fighting back. Presiding over this universe is an emperor, unseen here, who is setting the Atreides clan up for a fall. He has tasked them with responsibility for all spice-mining on Arrakis, which is currently being supervised by the brutal Baron Harkkonen. As played by the late Kenneth McMillan, the Baron was the most grossly entertaining character in Lynch's film; here, portrayed by an unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgård, rising up from a vat of black mud to begin his daily round of despicable activities, he is a darker, less amusing presence. The Baron's goal is to crush the hated Atreides family: Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac); his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson)—who's also a member of the witchy Bene Gesserit order of black-robed female schemers; and their son, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Like Kyle MacLachlan, who played Paul in the earlier Dune, Chalamet isn't given a lot to do in the movie's early innings, being mainly called upon to keep his hair tousled and endure a bit of excruciating pain. And since Isaac is heavily burdened with the weight of familial nobility, charisma duties fall to Ferguson (a veteran of the ongoing Mission Impossible franchise), who gives a subtly commanding performance as a woman of fearless devotion to her family and her spiritual order. Dune's cast of characters is as crowded as ever, although a little less confusingly this time. Weighing in on the Atreides side are Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, and Stephen McKinley Henderson. Doing their dastardly best for the Harkkonens are Dave Bautista and David Dastmalchian (occupying the role of wily stooge Piter de Vries in a more subdued fashion than Brad Dourif once did). And tiptoeing through Paul's dreams is the Fremen beauty Chani (Zendaya), who's due to get a little more screen time in the next movie, if it gets made. The film benefits greatly from Hans Zimmer's score—a jolting, hammer-of-the-gods electronic assault that's sometimes more interesting than what's happening onscreen. But while you'd expect contemporary computer-animation technology to have improved on the effects in Lynch's film, that's not quite the case. There's one great shot of Chalamet and Brolin running through the desert with a titanic sandworm rising up behind them, but generally the worms seem quite similar to their predecessors of 30-some years ago. And the huge, clunky techno dueling armor worn by MacLachlan and company back then—one of the most ungainly creations in big-budget FX history—has been improved only slightly by Villeneuve's fizzling update, which makes it seem as if the duelers are blowing a fuse. Like so much else in the movie, not a cause for great excitement. One of several unusual things about the Velvet Underground, who recorded four albums' worth of incomparable music from 1966 to 1970, is that they've never sounded dated. There's no annoying phasing on their records, no phony neo-Beatles string-quartets. In its two classic lineups, the band consisted of a couple of guys with guitars; a self-taught drummer who was partial to mallets and tom-toms; and, in the beginning, a German actress and fashion model named Nico. The music they left behind must have sounded great at the time, you'd think, because it still does. But very few people cared. Writer-director Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine) is clearly a passionate Velvets fan, and he has managed to put together a documentary about the group, which couldn't have been easy given that they left behind so little live footage. Haynes has finessed this challenge by broadening the scope of his film to take in the downtown arts scene of Manhattan in the early 1960s—the place from which the band emerged and roping in such witnesses as John Waters, Jackson Browne (Nico's onetime guitarist), Jonathan Richman, noted scenemaker Danny Fields, and avant-garde eminence La Monte Young, all of whom have interesting or at least piquant things to say. The story is by now well-known. In a metropolis rich in experimentation in music, writing, and cinema at the time, droll singer-songwriter Lou Reed came together with college pal/guitarist Sterling Morrison, sister-of-a-friend/drummer Maureen Tucker, and classically trained Welsh expatriate John Cale, who played piano, bass, and a very edgy viola. They hit it off, and since Reed had some songs—some great songs, like ""Femme Fatale,"" ""Venus in Furs,"" ""All Tomorrow's Parties""—the group went into a studio and had their mentor, Andy Warhol, cough up the $1500 required to record them. Warhol also contributed an additional vocalist, the emphatically blonde-and-beautiful Nico. Neither that first album nor its followups (including the brilliant Loaded) did much business. But the magic of the Velvets' music is vividly suggested here in live clips—not always of the band itself but of its environment: downtown clubs like the Dom, and Warhol's Factory, and a clip of Nico's small part in Fellini's La Dolce Vita, a token of the art-film frenzy of that moment. All those things are gone, and, to the detriment of Haynes's documentary, so are Nico, Morrison, and Reed. But the music they once made with the Velvet Underground won't likely to be fading away any time soon. Start your day with Reason.

"Oct 15, 2021",POSITIVE,"The feeling you had when you first saw A New Hope or Fellowship of the Ring for the first time, is the same feeling this epic film makes you feel. Pure sci-fi cinema!"
"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE,"Hollywood, this is how you do a spectacle blockbuster with prestige and richness while letting the visionary filmmaker have full creative control."
"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," Adapting any beloved piece of fiction from book to screen is a daunting task, but for Frank Herbert's 1965 science-fiction epic Dune, that daunting task is something more than just a challenge. It's been an outright nightmare, in a sense, with the book considered by some to be ""unfilmable"" due to its complexity and, indeed, numerous failed attempts came about in the 1970s, followed by David Lynch's critically panned and commercially disappointing 1984 film. Upon hearing that Denis Villeneuve was taking on the world of Dune, many were left intrigued and apprehensive at the same time. Now, Villeneuve's Dune has finally arrived and it is not only easily the best adaptation of Herbert's classic, it is a work of cinematic grandeur, bringing the far-flung world of Arrakis brilliantly alive in a way fans have only dreamed, but it's not a film without flaw. Much of Villeneuve's Dune is spent in exposition. There is a lot of ground to cover in establishing the story, which largely centers around House Atreides, a powerful faction operating in an empire called the Imperium. After a rival house, the brutal House Harkonnen, is mysteriously removed from its long-term appointment overseeing the mining of the galaxy's most valuable substance, Spice, on the planet Arrakis, the Emperor tasks Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) to take on that appointment -- an appointment Leto is aware is likely a trap. At the same time, Leto's son Paul (Timothee Chalamet) has been having prophetic dreams of Arrakis and its people, the Fremen -- particularly of a Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya). As things play out, House Atreides arrives on Arrakis, and it has indeed all been a trap, and despite the destruction of, well, everything, Paul and his Bene Gesserit mystic mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) manage to escape and survive, not to mention the strong implication that Paul is, in fact, the prophesied ""Chosen One"" as foretold by the aforementioned Bene Gesserit. That is a lot of ground to cover and, while that doesn't even scratch the surface of Dune as a story, Villeneuve's film does pull this primer of sorts off somewhat effortlessly with its dazzling visuals. Everything in Dune feels sharp and oversized and pristine in that high-science-fiction sense. It's, very bluntly, art moving across the screen. There is no detail missed in Dune, from the desert world of Arrakis to the watery, oceanic world of Caladan to the grim Harkonnen homeworld Giedi Prime. Everything is distinct and fascinating. If Dune the novel inspired so many works after it, this film will visually inspire the future as well. Where Dune missteps a bit is both in its pacing and in how it leans into some of the more problematic aspects of the novel. While the idea of Paul as the Chosen One and his role in the future of Arrakis and the empire more broadly is fascinating, the film doesn't manage to move too far from a ""white savior"" complex. Even Chani's opening voiceover being decidedly anti-colonialist in asking who their next oppressors will be, Paul Atreides smacks of white savior complex -- most of the Fremen are portrayed by non-white actors while most of House Atreides is white. That isn't to say the performances aren't strong; Chalamet's Paul is well-crafted and Ferguson's Lady Jessica is outstanding, while Jason Momoa is a delight as Duncan Idaho and Sharon Duncan-Brewster is an absolute standout as Liet-Kynes. The acting in the film is solid, it's just the implication that is a bit jarring -- and one could argue that much of the outstanding cast isn't utilized nearly enough. That leads to criticism about the film's pacing. Dune is a long film and it feels like a long film and yes, it does move slowly, but what makes it perhaps a weakness for the average moviegoer, as opposed to a die-hard Dune fan, is that right when things start to get interesting, that's when the film comes to a halt. Yes, Villeneuve stops the story in the middle. If we want to know what's next, we will have to hope for Part Two. Even with the missteps and the half-finished feel of having to wait for a ""Part Two"" -- something that, at this point, isn't even a guarantee -- Dune is a genuinely fantastic film and truly a cinematic experience. The best and closest adaptation of Herbert's novel to date, a truly sumptuous and decadent visual affair, even with a bit of discomfort in terms of the hero versus the ones needing a hero, Dune is an absolute vision given life. Here's to hoping we aren't left just dreaming of more."
"Oct 14, 2021",NEGATIVE," Of all the great Hollywood curses — from the making of The Exorcist to the ill fates that befall Superman actors — perhaps none occupies the imagination as much as the doomed efforts to adapt Frank Herbert's Dune. David Lynch's universally maligned attempt in 1984 is remembered as one of the most spectacular box office bombs of all time. The director considered it to be such a ""total failure"" that he replaced his name in the credits with the pseudonym Alan Smithee. A young Ridley Scott also made an unsuccessful attempt, ultimately departing the uncompleted project to make another sci-fi film instead. Most mythical of all was Alejandro Jodorowsky's planned 15-hour adaptation with an intended score by Pink Floyd and appearances by Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, and Salvador Dalí — a vision so delusionally (and hallucinogenically?) ambitious that the failed film became the subject of a documentary. Now Denis Villeneuve's adaptation, out this Friday, is being celebrated as the curse-breaker. But in truth, his Dune joins this line of failures because it repeats the mistakes of its source material. Villeneuve's Dune is too Dune-y. Published in 1965, Dune is the first chapter in the chronicle of Paul Atreides, whose father, Duke Leto, is appointed by the emperor to manage the nearly inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis, where spice — an addictive drug essential for space travel — is mined. Arrakis was previously managed by House Atreides' greatest enemy, House Harkonnen, a ruthless, Soviet-like people who conspire secretly with the emperor to take the planet back. Caught in the crosshairs of this political melee are the indigenous people of Arrakis, the Fremen, who consider Paul — who is the culmination of a centuries-long eugenics program — to be their reluctant messiah thanks to a prophecy planted by the shadowy religious sisterhood to which Paul's mother, Jessica, belongs. Herbert's Dune was enormously influential to the science fiction and fantasy community, a progenitor of Star Wars, The Wheel of Time, and Game of Thrones. With its Byzantine politics, its absorbingly strange worlds (requiring four appendices, a glossary, and cartographic notes), and a female-forward plot that was relatively unusual for the genre when Dune first published in 1965, it's remained a popular read through the years, selling millions of copies worldwide (and even appearing in Instagram ads as a sort of status prop). It's a book I've personally revisited over the years and enjoyed immensely, even despite its flaws. Understanding Dune this way requires picking and choosing parts of the text. It's not the only, or even the most natural, interpretation. But Villeneuve's film, as an uncritical adaptation, leaves the door open to exactly this understanding. And because his Dune is intended to be one installment of a trilogy, this first movie never gets to the parts of the series that firmly upend the portrait of Paul as the übermensch hero of the Fremen. Dune: Part Two (let alone Part Three) has yet to be greenlit, which means right now we're left with a standalone picture that serves as a testament to the murky, and easily warped, politics of Herbert's work. Fans have attempted to defend Dune over the years, arguing that Paul's reluctance to accept his fate as the Fremen's messiah is intended to complicate what would otherwise be a white savior narrative (the Fremen are clearly inspired by Arabic and Islamic cultures, while Paul — always depicted in film adaptations as being of white European ancestry — is loosely modeled on Lawrence of Arabia). Villeneuve himself falls into this camp, arguing that his movie is ""the opposite"" of a white savior story. Other fans have likewise defended the books by pointing to Herbert's numerous quotes about how his series is intended as a cautionary tale against zealotry, idolization, and hero worship. Still, even a galaxy brain take that Paul ultimately isn't the hero of Dune doesn't change the fact that he's the protagonist or that all his foot-dragging about being the messiah to the Fremen makes him, as Carroll writes, ""look like the Nazi Einsatzgruppen who pitied themselves for being forced to endure the difficult task of committing mass killings to build the thousand-year Reich."" Additionally, that the Fremen are so easily duped by a manufactured prophecy doesn't exactly imbue them any meaningful agency. Not to mention the mere fact that ""'the Arabs are destined to kill everyone in a religious war' is not a good look, no matter what complicating factors are in play,"" as historian Paul B. Sturtevant dryly points out on his blog. Villeneuve could have used his adaptation to interrogate the text and frustrate fascist readings. Instead, he seems to have been most interested in high-gloss visuals and, as he put it in an interview with Nerds of Color, an outcome that feels, to him, ""authentic, it feels honest, and true to the book."" Unfortunately, this means he parrots Herbert's mistakes. Take, for example, Villeneuve's inability to envision anyone but the French-American actor Timothée Chalamet as Paul: ""We were like, 'who should play Paul?' And we both said, 'It's Timothée Chalamet.' It has to be Timothée ... There was no plan B,"" the director further recalled to Nerds of Color. But there's no reason Paul had to be a white character, a casting decision that emphasizes the never-fully-subverted colonialist undertones of the story. Likewise, while Herbert used the language and culture of the Middle East as aesthetic inspiration, Villeneuve's Dune veers uncomfortably close to Orientalism with its superficial borrowing of Islamic dress, language, prayer, and musical influences. There are no Middle Eastern actors in any of the principal roles, and while the cast is on the one hand impressively diverse, that ""one-ethnicity-fits-all casting"" — as critic Hanna Flint has put it for SyFy Wire — doesn't absolve the film from the fact that it borrows from Arab Islamic culture without following through in its casting choices. Further, if the Fremen are to be ethnically diverse in their appearance — Zendaya, who is Black, plays the Fremen woman Chani, while Spanish actor Javier Bardem plays the tribal leader Stilgar — it gives even less credence to Villeneuve's insistence that a white man had to play Paul. Likewise, American costume designers Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan were supposedly inspired by ""the clothes of desert people such as Bedouins and Tuaregs"" in dressing the Fremen, while Hans Zimmer's score includes ""vocals bordering ululating,"" as The Observer points out. All of this is an effort in exotification, conveying that Dune is set in ""another time, another planet."" Of course, the ""exotic,"" ""otherworldly"" inspiration is the cultures of millions of people in our own world. It's only exotic in the West. And there was no reason Villeneuve had to do ... well, any of this. Case in point: He notably removes from the script all traces of Herbert's vilely homophobic writing of the Baron Harkonnen, which had no place in a 21st-century adaptation. But had Villeneuve not been so single-minded about otherwise making his adaptation of Dune so Dune-y, there might have been opportunities for him to direct a script that more effectively communicated the best version of Herbert's ideals, or that more forcefully subverted the white savior reading, or that unequivocally rebuffed any fascist or eugenic interpretations Villeneuve should know are coming. As African history graduate student Katherine (Hyun-Joo) Everett writes in a remarkable blog post for Ohio State University about this very issue, ""Although Herbert was great at conceiving how white, Western systems of power are inherently flawed, he was not able to imagine any better alternative. A way to move beyond the issues within a traditional Dune adaptation would be to more seriously consider Afrofuturism."" But why stop there? To quote Sturtevant, the historian, ""maybe, just maybe, this is not the f--king time"" for another Dune adaptation. Or, at least, not one that has so little interest in challenging its source text in any significant way. Perhaps it's not that Dune is cursed — it's that we haven't managed to take its caution against hero-worship to heart: Villeneuve should have realized idolizing Herbert's story would only lead him astray.

"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," That’s great news for the millions of fans of Frank Herbert’s epic 1965 sci-fi masterpiece “Dune.” It’s startling, and gratifying, to see one’s mind’s-eye images from the novel up there on the big screen courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve and his creative filmmaking team. Those titular dunes, undulating to far, far horizons, inspired by a visit made to the dune-shaped central Oregon seashore in 1957 by Herbert, a Northwest native born in Tacoma and educated at the University of Washington. The desert scenes were shot in Jordan and Abu Dhabi. Above all, the book’s humongous, iconic sandworms, churning beneath the sands like express trains of death, their vast mouths consuming all surface dwellers unfortunate enough to attract their omnivorous attentions. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a slender noble-born youth with unique gifts, including the ability to see into the future. His father, Duke Leto (played with gravity and authority by Oscar Isaac), regal and doomed. His mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, animated by her character’s sense of protectiveness toward Paul), the duke’s concubine, endowed with singular powers to guide men’s behaviors with special vocal intonations. Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), a character with one of the most excellent names in all of literature, master swordsman and devoted guardian of Paul. And so many more. And all deserving to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Villeneuve intended it that way. Never mind phones or tablets. His governing mantra clearly was this: Go big. Make it worth people’s while to get out of the house and see a picture that is a genuine epic, a grand-scale enterprise worthy of its immense, multilevel source material. The story spans planets and is rife with intricate intrigues, promotes an environmental message (water is so scarce on Arrakis that people must clothe themselves in special suits to reclaim their body’s moisture to survive) and features immense set-piece battle scenes. Himself a fan of the novel, Villeneuve made the picture for fellow fans. But not only for them. He made it, too, for people who have never read the book. And now they won’t have to. The movie has captured the book with amazing fidelity. Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky tried in the 1970s to make “Dune” but couldn’t get his vision off the ground. David Lynch crashed and burned in 1984 with his version, disavowing it and blaming his inability to secure the final cut to make the movie he envisioned. Villeneuve succeeds not only thanks to his inspired mastery of the story’s visual elements. He succeeded also by casting Chalamet in the lead role. Chalamet — fast rising thanks to his acclaimed performances in such movies as 2019’s “Little Women,” 2018’s “Beautiful Boy” and 2017’s “Call Me By Your Name,” which earned him a best-actor Oscar nomination — handles the part of Paul with great delicacy. Paul is a multifaceted character, a youth evolving into manhood and then something beyond that, a godlike figure revered by the warlike but oppressed Fremen, the first inhabitants of Arrakis. Chalamet takes ownership of the role, and the picture in a key early scene in which Paul is forced to endure a painful test administered by the stern and powerful Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood (Charlotte Rampling). It’s a relatively simple scene. She orders Paul to place his hand in a mysterious box. If he removes it, he will be killed. Pain grows the longer his hand remains there. The camera stays on his face and it reveals gradually increasing levels of anguish and eventually angry wordless defiance. It’s a great job of subtle acting. Opposing Paul is the immense (in the book he’s described as so big he requires a suspension system to support his bulk) and monstrously cruel Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), head of a rival baronial house. Aligned with Paul is the Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and a young Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya), who Paul has glimpsed in dreams that foretell the future. With Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, from a screenplay by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, based on the book by Frank Herbert. 155 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material. Opens Thursday, Oct. 21, at multiple theaters and on HBO Max."
"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," Epic sci-fi drama starring Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. In the year 10,191, Paul Atreides and his mother, Lady Jessica, accompany Paul's father the Duke after he is made steward of the resource-rich desert planet Arrakis. Paul begins to feel that his destiny is tied with that of the planet, but powerful enemies of House Atreides are plotting the family's destruction."
"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of people who are going to see Denis Villeneuve’s new adaptation of Dune, which will finally be in theaters next week following a grueling pandemic-driven delay: general audiences looking for an epic sci-fi blockbuster, and fans of the classic 1965 Frank Herbert novel, on which the film is based. This dichotomy also extends to reviews of the film; how a critic feels about Dune will depend significantly on how familiar they are with the source material. As someone who has read Dune at least a dozen times and seen David Lynch’s deeply flawed but compellingly bizarre 1984 adaptation roughly as many, it’s obvious which camp I fall into. I can only speculate on whether Villeneuve’s Dune will make sense to newcomers, but for the many fans, Villeneuve has delivered the version of Dune long prophesied.  The ostensible superhero of Dune is first introduced to us as a 15-year-old boy named Paul, heir to the noble Atreides family and destined from birth to wield terrifying power. Over the course of the book, Paul’s father is murdered, and he flees to the remote reaches of the desert planet Arrakis, where he falls in with the planet’s native tribes, the Fremen, and eventually leads them on the backs of the planet’s enormous sandworms to defeat his mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, and to claim imperial rule over the known universe. A close reader of Dune (or a casual reader of Herbert’s five sequels) will absorb that Paul’s hero’s journey ends not with paradise but with a murderous interstellar jihad. Lynch, who has disavowed his own adaptation and still hates to discuss it, missed this completely. The 1984 film ends with Kyle MacLachlan’s conventionally heroic Paul summoning rain from the heavens above Arrakis to shower upon his awestruck legions. Never mind that this isn’t a power Paul has in the book—and never mind that if it were, it would instantly kill the sandworms on which his political dominance rests—the real issue is that Lynch cast Paul as a literal messiah, which is a fundamental misreading of Herbert’s authorial intent. Villeneuve, a true devotee of the book, does not repeat the same mistakes. No one is going to make it rain this time around, and the script repeatedly makes clear—as Herbert’s book did—that the religious beliefs that lead the Fremen to recognize Paul as a messianic figure are lies seeded by outsiders for the purpose of political manipulation. Paul—here played by Timothée Chalamet, who actually looks like a teenager—is callow, stubborn, argumentative, and possessed of a superficial idealism that can easily slide into cynicism. In short, he is a budding false messiah, and while Villeneuve has chosen to adapt only the first half of the novel (it remains uncertain whether the second half will be greenlit, though it would be criminal if it isn’t) in order to give all of its complexity room to breathe, it should already be clear to a careful viewer that things are not going to end happily ever after for Chalamet’s Paul, or for the universe he’s destined to conquer. Let’s back up a bit. What exactly is Dune about? This is a dangerous question to ask a fan, but I’ll try to sum it up in two meaty paragraphs. Dune is set 10,191 years after the Butlerian Jihad, an event that itself takes place at some indeterminate point far into our future, in which humankind overthrows the “thinking machines” that will eventually enslave us (in a sense, Herbert predicted social media and the inevitable backlash against it) and develop a galactic imperium without computers or robots. Instead, human minds will be unlocked and made to serve the functions of computers through a combination of mysticism, intensive training, eugenics, and above all, psychoactive drugs. The most powerful such drug, the spice melange, is mined only on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, a harsh desert world with no surface water, roamed by giant killer sandworms and populated by the spartan Fremen tribes. The spice is highly addictive, and ingesting it can extend life, stimulate prescient visions, and enable interstellar navigation. It empowers a secretive male order called the Spacing Guild to monopolize space travel and also empowers a secretive female order called the Bene Gesserit to manipulate elite bloodlines in a millennia-long quest to engineer a male superbeing, the Kwisatz Haderach, who can see through time and space. While these two orders wield influence behind the scenes, ostensibly the universe is run on a feudal model by a league of Great Houses dominated by one Emperor with the power to assign planetary fiefdoms. The novel begins when the extremely lucrative fiefdom of Arrakis, which allows for control of spice production, is transferred from the vile House Harkonnen to the noble House Atreides, which we quickly come to realize is walking into a death trap set by the Emperor. When that trap is sprung, what will become of young Paul Atreides, who may also be the final product of the ancient Bene Gesserit breeding scheme? That’s an awful lot more complicated than “a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,” and for years Dune was widely understood to be unfilmable, given the abortive effort by Alejandro Jodorowsky (which was never made but which became the subject of an entertaining documentary), the messy and commercially unsuccessful attempt by Lynch, and the competent but forgettable SyFy Channel miniseries released in 2000. “Unfilmable” is really the wrong word, though, since Herbert’s vision was always richly cinematic, and whatever else one wants to say about Lynch, he certainly orchestrated some memorable imagery. The open question is whether general audiences can ever make sense of such a richly imagined and politically, economically, ecologically, religiously, and morally layered fictional universe. I used to wonder that myself, but after the massive mainstream success of HBO’s Game of Thrones, which is every bit as complex, it started to feel like Dune was due for another try. Villeneuve, to his great credit, doesn’t hit audiences with dense paragraphs of exposition like those above. He understands that a successful film is one that transports us, and that with stunning visuals, a first-rate cast, and an economical script, we’ll come along for the ride without asking too many questions. The words “Butlerian Jihad” are never uttered in the film, because general audiences don’t need to know why the future is ruled by feudal houses or why there are no computers. They also don’t need to know, for instance, why the armies of the far future fight each other with knives instead of laser beams. Herbert has an answer (if a laser were to hit the personal energy shields that his belligerents typically wear, it would set off a nuclear blast, whereas slow-moving melee weapons can penetrate shields at close range), and Villeneuve knows what that answer is, but he’s less interested in telling us than in showing us what combat with knives and energy shields would actually look like (it would look sick). He also knows what an ornithopter should look like (it should look like a mechanical dragonfly the size of a military helicopter) and how many teeth a sandworm should have (a whole lot). He read the same book so many of us read, and he imagined everything exactly the way Herbert described it.  Herbert’s protagonists, many of whom possess heightened mental abilities, frequently think to themselves using italicized sentences like this, a device Lynch replicates with constant, dreary voiceovers. Villeneuve, rather than boring us with internal monologues, has his actors convey their inner thoughts through body language. At the same time, unlike Lynch, he depicts the various otherworldly forms of communication often referenced in the book, in particular forms of sign language (always subtitled) used to convey secret messages, or a wonderful scene in which a “cone of silence” is projected above several characters to drown out their voices to anyone standing outside, including the audience. Villeneuve’s fealty to the core ideas of the book and to the unique textures of Herbert’s universe exceeds Lynch’s, but at the same time he takes many more liberties with Herbert’s infamously ponderous dialogue: Here, actors like Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, and Josh Brolin (who respectively play Duke Leto Atreides, Paul’s father, and the warriors Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, who serve as surrogate uncles to Paul) are given quippy, Hollywood-friendly lines. The trailers make this last feature seem like it might get annoying, but in the actual film, it serves to keep the audience grounded in an otherworldly universe. One principal who is too dignified for one-liners is Paul’s mother, the Lady Jessica, played by a standout Rebecca Ferguson in what was always Dune’s most emotionally affecting character arc. From one of the very first scenes, Jessica instructs Paul throughout the film in the Bene Gesserit “weirding way,” which Lynch comprehensively misrepresents as something involving little Walkman-like devices that can blow things up, as opposed to what Herbert actually describes: pinpoint control over bodily reflexes, facial expressions, vocal pitches, and so on, enabling adherents to withstand intense pain, to master hand-to-hand combat, and to control other people with firmly voiced commands. Lynch doesn’t bother trying to capture any of this, but with the aid of his skilled cast, Villeneuve if anything does a better job with it than Herbert does with his sometimes labored exposition. The feature of the novel that has held up worst, by far, is Herbert’s decision to emphasize the villainy of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (played here by Stellan Skarsgård in a fat suit) by making him a pederast who lusts after enslaved teenage boys, as well as his young nephew Feyd-Rautha (played in Lynch’s film by a codpiece-clad Sting and in Villeneuve’s by no one—he’s the only major character from the first half of the novel not to appear at all). Lynch faithfully recreated Herbert’s grotesque homophobia on screen, at the height of the AIDS epidemic. In our mercifully more sensitive times, Villeneuve has left out this aspect of the book and, in general, has given the Harkonnens less screen time than Lynch did—perhaps in recognition that their scenes were always a bit of misdirection. By portraying the Baron as obese, greedy, genocidal, and gay, Herbert was trying to contrast him with the kinder, gentler, and decidedly heterosexual Duke Leto, thereby misleading readers into expecting a crude good versus evil story. But while the Harkonnens may lack redeeming qualities, the Atreides were never meant to be as straightforwardly benevolent as they initially come across, and Villeneuve grasps this. Early in the film, Chalamet’s Paul is critical of his own family’s quasi-liberal conceit that they can run Arrakis as an extractive colony without oppressing their Fremen subjects, and of the Bene Gesserit’s religious manipulations of those same subjects. But by the film’s end, Paul has decided to exploit the Fremen himself in order to enact his revenge on the Harkonnens and the Emperor, has personally killed one Fremen in combat, and has experienced prescient visions of the galactic-scale killing that will follow from his actions. Even with two hours and 35 minutes to cover half of a 500-page novel, there’s only so much justice Villeneuve can do to Herbert’s vision. I had hoped that a classic dinner table scene full of palace intrigue that Lynch left out might make it to the screen, but no such luck. The book’s detailed planetary ecology, reflecting Herbert’s obsessive fascination with desert flora and fauna, receives less attention than it might have in our climate-conscious times. The metatextual aspect of Herbert’s novel, in which events are repeatedly described in hindsight by an in-universe narrator with her own political agenda, is entirely left out in favor of a more conventional narrative structure. But ultimately these are quibbles; Villeneuve has made a heartfelt cinematic epic that is true to its source material both in its rich details and in its emphasis on the dangers of absolute power; that will hopefully inspire new readers to delve into that source material; and that is worth donning a mask for a few hours to watch on a huge screen. Just pretend you’re wearing a stillsuit."
"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," When I first heard the announcement of a new adaptation of Frank Herbert’s magnum opus Dune, I think I might have groaned and said, “God, not again.” Even with the cult followings that Lynch’s now-disowned 1984 version and SyFy’s plodding 2000 miniseries have amassed, there has yet to be a version that had the kind of mass appeal that gets butts in seats.  There is no hand-holding through the setup of this film. Instead, the viewer is thrust into the middle of the story, even before a single studio logo appears on screen, with a growling and guttural voice (or rather, Voice) telling the viewer about Dreams. In particular, much import has been placed on the dreams of young Paul Atreides (Chalamet), son of Duke Leto Atreides (Isaac). Chalamet plays the young Duke in waiting with a teenaged sensibility: brooding one moment, snarling the next, only softening long enough to look adoringly at his father.  While this portrayal may grate on some viewers, it’s important to remember that Paul is all of fifteen years old when these events transpire. “A great man doesn’t choose to lead,” Leto says to his son. “He’s called to it.” It’s a lesson that Paul doesn’t understand yet, standing on the windswept rocks overlooking his oceanic homeworld, but will before the two-and-a-half-hour runtime is up.  If you remember the enormous alien pods in Arrival or the Dalí-inspired spider that hovered over the apartment blocks of Toronto, you know that Villeneuve is the rare director who truly grasps the power of scope, both in terms of storytelling and of visuals, and how one informs the other. Dune transitions from lofty, open-air rooms to cramped vehicles and billets like lungs expanding and contracting with every breath. Large ships pour out of the massive, tubular Heighliners of the spacing guild, which, in turn, echo the giant sandworms that move in the oceanic depths of Arrakis’s desert. More often than not, scenes set in these massive spaces feel all the more dangerous, while the sweaty confines of a two-person tent become cloying with tension. The grand, sweeping shots of both rain-drenched Caladan and the sterile, almost crystalline desert of Arrakis are so astounding you forget there are characters on screen.  Villeneuve is the rare director who truly grasps the power of scope, both in terms of storytelling and of visuals, and how one informs the other. While the story moves along at a nice pace, there were still times when Villeneuve’s dazzling visuals overwhelmed the plot. If there is any fault to be found in Dune, it’s there. The story can, at times, feel flat compared to the beauty of the landscape, the breathtaking shots composed by DP Greig Fraser, and the pounding, ululating score by Hans Zimmer. Still, overall, this adaptation manages to do what none of the previous adaptations have: it gives context.  Even with such strong performances, spectacular sets, and heart-stopping action sequences (hello, Shai-Hulud, you big beautiful boy), Dune never gets too bogged down in its own mythos, and I can’t help but wonder if that’s a good thing or not. The ending, not wrapped up but paused at a vital junction in the story, hinges on the success of this movie to get Part II greenlit.  While an incredibly fun and engrossing film in the moment, it doesn’t leave much of an aftertaste. I found nothing objectionable in Dune (I’m not getting into the white savior discussion here, but trust me, I have a lot to say about it), there’s also nothing much you take with you when you leave. Maybe a headache from all of those drums, Hans.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?"
"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," I’m going to be honest that this review took me a bit longer to write. This is not so much because I had the trouble finding the words but because a Ted Sarandos-triggered depression has been kicking my ass since the screening ended. Wednesday was slightly better but at some point, I have to put words to screen. There’s a lot to be said about Dune. The question is what hasn’t been said by now. For this film in particular, you’ve probably already made up your mind. You’re either the person tweeting non-stop about the greatness that is Dune or you’re not. I went into this film with an open mind. Didn’t read the book. Didn’t watch the earlier David Lynch film. I’ll do me and you do you. The story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) falls along the traditional hero’s journey during a galactic struggle for power. In order to see the survival of his family and people, he has to take a journey to the most dangerous planet that exists. There’s more to his story but things unfold little by little. He has a way of seeing events happening in the future (The Force, anyone?). But almost as soon as they arrive on the planet, things soon take a turn for the worse. Frank Herbert’s story has a lot going for it. It’s a coming-of-age tale with a backdrop set against rivalries, tribal clashes, social oppression, and ecological disaster. You have both a father-and-son and mother-and-son story at the heart of it. This type of story is bigger than just science-fiction. While sci-fi may be what drives this film, the story itself could be in any genre. At the same time, there’s so much story to tell that it cannot be told in just one film. You cannot blame filmmakers for finding a way to retell the story in their own words and under a different title! This is a story that is so relatable. The book was released in 1965 so yes, it came before Star Wars. More on this in a moment. During the film’s final half hour, you get a sense that this half of the story is coming to an end. But at the same time, you also know you’re going to be waiting a bit for the second half. It’s a big screen spectacle and it shows all throughout from the cinematography through the visual effects. Both aspects are astonishing. And again, you need to experience it on the big screen. Like I told the local rep following the screening, I could not imagine my first viewing being on HBO Max. I understand why someone would go that route especially with safety precautions. This film is over two and half hours so I can understand the need to be extra precautious. But if it is at all possible, please see it on the big screen. Note: the studio is not paying me to say this–I’m stressing it myself.

"Oct 14, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s rare when a soundtrack shines as a star among its top-billed cast. But in “Dune,” the music written by Hans Zimmer is the decisive element in the film. Other aspects are significant — Timothée  Chalamet, the presence of Oakland native Zendaya — but it’s the soundtrack that makes this movie so distinctive that it colors the experience. Zimmer has written scores for many other films, including “Inception,” “Gladiator” and “Dunkirk,” but his “Dune” score is particularly distinctive. It sounds entirely synthesized, though there seems to be a wordless choral element as well. This sonic ever-presence has a marked effect that underscores everything, from intimate conversations to flamboyant action. Usually, soundtracks work to pump up the action and calm down the quieter scenes. Here, the soundtrack makes everything feel of a piece —  the dramatic and the placid, the public and the personal — creating the sense of something strange and unfamiliar. The music never insists that we identify emotionally with the characters. Rather, it makes sure we never forget we’re watching an entirely alien universe. Of course, neither the movie nor the soundtrack could work if Zimmer were imposing his point of view on the material. He doesn’t. He just brings out what’s already there, and what’s there is a genuine and reasonably successful attempt to create science fiction at its best — not the usual thinly disguised portrait of modern anxiety, but something bigger: a complete and utterly realized other world. “Dune” is based on the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. David Lynch made a film of it in 1984 that wasn’t well received. This one, directed by Denis Villeneuve and hitting theaters on Friday, Oct. 22, after its Mill Valley Film Festival premiere on Wednesday, Oct. 13, is better. It follows the book, and it takes its time. (Though maybe too much time — it runs 155 minutes and covers only roughly half the book.) Timothée  Chalamet (“Beautiful Boy,” “Call Me By Your Name”) plays Paul, whose father (Oscar Isaac) is the duke and sovereign of a planet and whose mother (Rebecca Ferguson) has potent mental powers that she hopes to cultivate in her son. The action begins when the emperor arrives and confers upon the duke the control of Arrakis, a wild and dangerous planet that is also the universe’s prime source of spice, an element that instills health and youthfulness and that also makes space travel possible. Reluctantly, the family makes a trip to Arrakis, half expecting that the duke’s appointment is some kind of setup. From there, things get complicated. A rival local government is against them, and mining spice requires going deep into the desert, where there are gigantic, man-eating worms hiding beneath the surface. There are also the indigenous people of Arrakis, the Fremen. Some of them are friendly, some unfriendly, and all of them experts in desert living. The movie’s length is, at times, a challenge, but “Dune” is so original and contains so many strong scenes that the length mostly isn’t a problem. Villeneuve dresses Chalamet in black and makes good use of his lankiness, filming him in long shot so that he looks like a thin, dark sliver moving across the desert. Chalamet appears either interesting enough to be gifted or too insubstantial to matter, and that’s essentially the question of the movie: Does he have what it takes to be a leader? Chalamet’s physicality makes a nice contrast with Stellan Skarsgard, who appears in an enormous fat suit as Baron Harkonnen, the evil adversary of Paul and his family. The actors are vivid, particularly Chalamet, who must grow in the role, and Ferguson, who goes through the film seeming rattled yet spiritual. Javier Bardem and Zendaya have featured roles as Fremen. Zendaya doesn’t get to say much, but her grave and arresting aura makes an impression nonetheless. If there’s a sequel, her role is certain to expand. And there should be a sequel. The modern sci-fi that we usually see in movies is so limited in comparison — the same old movies about postapocalyptic dystopia, or alien invasion, or computers taking over. Not only are they boring, but they’re earthbound and keep audiences earthbound, mired in the same thoughts they had walking into the theater. M“Dune”: Science fiction. Starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. (PG-13. 155 minutes.) In Bay Area theaters and on HBO Max starting Friday, Oct. 22."

"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE,"DUNE is a strong film and a beautiful adaptation of Herbert's book. It's cold-blooded, imaginative, and robust; this is the kind of epic sci-fi we need. That is due to the artist at the helm, Denis Villeneuve is a brilliant filmmaker and storyteller."
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE," One of the reasons I appreciate Denis Villeneuve’s take on this science fiction classic might be one of the reasons that would drive science fiction fans crazy. Because as lush as this film looks, its script is also measured, dialogue controlled. You won’t find those lengthy and impeccably detailed narratives that some relish, but make my brain fog. Because this Dune has a lot to say, and makes sure it is accessible to all who are open to it. Never fear: there are many breathtaking visuals strategically placed in this tad too lengthy story of Paul, a young man whose intuitive understanding of his universe is as precarious as it is revealing. There are the expected good guys and bad guys, but almost all are softened enough to make them more interesting than they might be in lesser directorial and acting hands. And the messages (yes, there are messages) drawn from Frank Herbert’s original 1965 novel are perhaps even more pungent now than they were in the prescient two part publication. Because we’re not just dealing with saving humanity here, we’re dealing with saving the precious resources of the planet. The seemingly ubiquitous Timothee Chalamet stars as young Paul and is ably supported with nice turns from Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and particularly Oscar Issac, who makes his, let’s face it, robber baron, a man of complexity. But in this first chapter it’s the relationship between mother and son that fuels the storyline and Rebecca Ferguson brings just enough quiet energy to engage us in not just her child’s, but her own battle. We’ll see another terrific young actress, Zendaya, step up in chapter two, a sequel which might be years in the making. I’ll wait."
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE,"Villeneuve digs into Herbert's imagination with two hands, maintaining blockbuster appeal and fan devotion to the sophistication of this universe."
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE," For all its globe-trotting spectacle, the true story in Dune from director Denis Villeneuve never really gets off the ground. And that’s clearly the point. It’s really Dune: Part One and even titled within the movie as such, the first half of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel about a young man named Paul (Timothée Chalamet) who is chosen by destiny to settle some interstellar feudal disputes on a treacherous desert planet. Utilizing “chosen one” narratives within the backdrop of pre-Enlightenment societal structures certainly has room to be fresh and exciting. And in many ways, Dune is just that, particularly when it comes to its constantly reinventing production design, which has already earned it an Academy Award or two by default. Brought to screen, there’s something inherently fascinating about seeing age-old hierarchies from the Dark Ages seeping into lo-fi high-tech in the far-flung future. In 2021, it’s easy to imagine society regressing into disturbingly oppressive territories, now more than ever. But this is where the vigorous writing of Dune hits a sandstorm of faithful adaptation; the difference between this being merely a good film and not the masterpiece it tries so hard to be and probably should be. To make Paul a compelling protagonist, Dune needed to reset the playbook for this 56-year-old story, already adapted to film once before by David Lynch in 1984. As it stands, our connection to Paul’s emotional journey is as hollow and empty as the massive halls and structures he inhabits over the course of this 155-minute film. This is Villeneuve’s sprawling follow-up to Blade Runner 2049, his first real foray into franchise filmmaking and likely his peak sci-fi film. In both 2049 and his 2016 standout, Arrival, Villeneuve has shown his impeccable vision for telling intimate character stories within larger-than-life bubbles of cinematic grandeur. He also tends to work with down-to-earth screenwriters. Even Sicario, a less ambitious film, by comparison, gave Villeneuve a unique lens on border warfare through multiple perspectives. It’s not that Dune comes off as a blemish on Villeneuve’s record, or something foreign to what the director has made in the past. If anything, it’s almost too much of everything. The apt generational comparison might actually be The Fellowship of the Ring. Also an overlong, risky part one to a big-budget spectacle that is seemingly out of fashion due to its aging source material. Peter Jackson nevertheless succeeded in carving out an entirely new fandom out of Tolkien’s opus fantasy because he simply got the characters right. Not just right in the sense that they match the spirit of their printed counterparts, but right in the sense that modern audiences could either love them for the first time or all over again. Neither was off the table. In contrast, it takes hard work to fall in love with Dune. And for some, that won’t be a hindrance. The performances are impressive and convincing, as expected, with Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson putting in extra effort to lend prestige to what might otherwise strike as silly and absurdist dialogue. The same goes for Stellan Skarsgård’s flavorful, villain, a short nod to Mad Max: Fury Road.  Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem provide serviceable accounts, but they’re more like fresh-dyed action figures than living, breathing characters. They’re not quite memorable or earth-shaking, which is all the more noticeable in a film that is otherwise blasting the screen for your undivided attention. Much will be said by many in regards to how Dune successfully brings epic scale through sight and sound. Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s score couldn’t be more intertwined with the overall art direction and atmosphere, a moody combination of Biblical chic and 80s synth-rock. The sensory details here are so immaculately creative and unpredictable, you can’t help but notice that the underlying story is an afterthought. A first draft of a bare-bones outline intended to be filled in later, but never quite. Here’s hoping the eventual destination outshines the journey thus far.

"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE," With mythology and world-building on par with The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, Dune is cinematic and momentous. Considered among many circles as one of the hardest stories to adapt, Frank Herbert’s science fiction epic has been attempted in the past. None, however, come close to Villeneuve’s attention to detail. From languages, planets, religions, cultures, and races, Dune takes time to introduce viewers to a new world. With the original Dune story is not as universally known as The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, many viewers will come into the film fresh, giving Villeneuve a world-building goal, not unlike James Cameron’s Avatar. With an opening title sequence that lets the audience know this film is part 1 of a larger saga, the promise of the future weighs heavy on the film, giving it an added sense of mystery. Dune accomplishes something many blockbusters today fail to do, being true to itself. In a landscape where films rely on modern pop-culture tropes, an overreliance on comedy, and an almost desperate need to not take itself so serious, Dunegoes the opposite direction. Closer in tone to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Dune is not afraid to be self-serious in its density and scope. Villeneuve takes time with each layer of mythology, with incredible wide-shots detailing the sheer scale of the world being created to close-ups into the eyes of specific characters, blending a personal touch in a massive universe. Dune features a star-studded cast, led by Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides. By definition, Paul is not too different from Frodo, Anakin Skywalker, Neo, or Harry Potter. Each has a responsibility, burden, faith, and prophecy thrust upon them, a destiny that they must fulfill, or die trying. Chalamet continues to prove himself as one of the best young stars in the industry and he plays the Chosen One trope well in Dune. Atreides feels believable, pure, and different from other characters in the film, an important distinction for the protagonist and Chalamet fulfills the role well.  Joining him is Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica and Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, parents of Paul and key characters in the world of Dune. Rounding out the cast is Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Zendaya as Chani, a mysterious girl representing a future to come and a premonition for Paul to follow. With well-known names taking on major and minor roles, Dune feels very Hollywood, yet rooted in fantasy and old-world storytelling, another comparison to The Lord of the Rings.  A certain element of Dune that did feel lacking was the lack of Middle Eastern representation. In a story that is heavily inspired by Arab and Islamic traditions, stories, and concepts, Dune can sometimes come off delving too close to the white savior trope. While there are MENA actors in the film, most are relegated to side characters or part of the planet Arrakis’ culture. There are certain themes of Arrakis representing how western countries pillaged Middle Eastern countries for oil, represented as a spice in the Dune mythology, and much of it works. Still, having more primary characters be of MENA descent would have further elevated the mythology that Dune is creating on film.  Composed, conducted, and produced by Hans Zimmer, Dune‘s score is just as impressive as the visuals. Kinetic, full of life, somber, and with a mix of new and old-world sounds, Zimmer is simply at the top of his game here. The score can be considered a character of its own. Sometimes, the score is simply backgrounded support to the protagonists on screen, other times it becomes the main character, serving as the primary language for the visuals on screen. Villeneuve’s directing style is present throughout, yet he manages to transcend genres with how he interprets the world he is adapting. In the long run time, Dune only manages to adapt a small part of the overall story, and it promises much more to come. The film flashes forward to movies to come many times, and audiences who are eager for more can only hope that Warner Bros. pictures announced a sequel soon after release. Though with the much-debated and lambasted HBO Max day-and-date strategy, it remains to be seen how well the film does in traditional markets.  Overall, Dune is a masterclass in filmmaking. Denis Villeneuve is at the top of his game, Hans Zimmer delivers with a beautiful score, and the entire cast led by Timothée Chalamet delivers. Stunning visuals, perfect world-building, and layered storytelling make Dune one of the best films of the year. "
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One, co-written with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, has many shortcomings. But it succeeds nevertheless because it gets the most important thing right: the mood. Namely, the mood of prophesied destiny. And it’s hard to imagine a more fitting adaptation. David Lynch, not having read the book when he took on the 1984 adaptation, apparently didn’t see this, so his film is a (notably Lynchian surrealist) drag, and it would have been so even without the meddling of producer Raffaella De Laurentiis. Villeneuve’s talents are uniquely suited to this project. He’s said that he needed to make Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017) first to prepare, and it shows: Dune has the scope and production design of the latter, the narrative theme and score of the former, and the exposition and crude characterizations of both. (It’s only Amy Adams’s performance in Arrival that gives her character nuance.) Dune is a triumph of production design (by Patrice Vermette). Everything is ginormous and angular, giving the sense of a spacious prison house – the courtyard of the palace on Arrakis especially feels like the Green Zone in U.S.-occupied Baghdad. Adding to this effect is the limited physical acting: outside of fights, people just stand and talk, and protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) does even that with minimal affect, at least until the moment he grows into his twin birthrights of Duke and Messiah. That brings us to the theme of prophecy and destiny. In other words, time, on both the personal scale of Arrival and the vast one of the fate of the universe. The best scene is the build-up to the Gom Jabbar test, a secret trial by fire. Paul, the test’s subject, can’t be told what it is, so his mother, Lady Jessica (an astounding Rebecca Ferguson), and the royal doctor (Chang Chen, speaking Mandarin), who do know, can only give vague warnings in hushed yet dire tones. Fear of the unknown indeed. This personal scope is expanded in two ways. Paul keeps having visions that one by one prove true; a scene in which he uses knowledge thusly gained to ask for aid affirms his authority, and Chalamet beautifully displays newfound mettle while Ferguson’s face reveals Jessica’s awe and, at the same time, the sense of loss that parents feel when they realize their child is now grown. Not every scene can be so full of import, however, and there are a number of ineluctable bridging sequences that Villeneuve makes good use of by attaching to them Hans Zimmer’s score, this time less droning than in, say, Inception (2010), and with more Orientalist percussion and vocals. Either through music or dialogue, we’re always reminded that what’s happening before our eyes are only signs and wonders – the truly important story is yet to come. Fittingly enough, the film ends right after the indigenous Fremen accept Paul as one of their own, and just before they teach him how to ride one of the massive underground sand worms that devour anything traversing the sands of Arrakis. With the dialogue so occupied by theme, there’s no room for much else. The film has a handful of expository devices, but most of the exposition is crudely stuffed into the dialogue. Even so, the storyworld is so complex that much on screen is left unexplained, inadvertently making the world feel lived-in, much like that other (unofficial) adaptation of Herbert’s novel, Star Wars (1977). The actors work hard to give naturalistic line readings, and Jason Momoa’s stand out in particular: as Duncan Idaho, the military leader of House Atreides, he speaks in gruff spurts, toned down by warm affection for the royal household. And I appreciated seeing Momoa clean-shaven. But as far as characterization goes, line readings are basically all the actors have, with the notable exception of Ferguson’s Jessica, consumed with worry about her son and the destiny for which he may not be ready. Ferguson’s performance perfectly balances the two awesome emotions of prophetic knowledge and maternal ferocity, sometimes switching between them in between lines. In contrast, Josh Brolin’s emotional transition is much clunkier.  He plays the lieutenant commander who trains Paul when Duncan is away and has to switch, in the same line, from avuncular warmth toward Paul to the martial fury needed to train him for war. Altogether, what we have on our hands is an exemplary handling of time and prophecy, those most abstract of narrative themes, held together by dialogue salvaged by earnest acting, and filler scenes buoyed by visuals and the score. It’s the best thing Villeneuve has done yet."
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE,"An all-consuming and downright stunning technical marvel from Denis Villeneuve, bolstered by more masterful work from Hans Zimmer."
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE," Lynch’s film, at 137 minutes, is a simplified, condensed version of the book, especially when compared with director Denis Villeneuve’s 155-minute rendering of the first part of Herbert’s expansive work. Villeneuve’s movie is as impressive as it is frustrating. The on-screen title is “Dune: Part One.” And it plays as a place-setting for events to come, yet, filming on the latter part of the book has not even begun — and no release date for a sequel has been announced. The universe he has created is richer and more detailed than the 1984 movie. Villeneuve emphasizes three points: the economic impact of the coveted mélange spice found on Arrakis, which makes the planet so coveted by various factions because of the spice’s abilities to extend life and enhance mental abilities; the religious beliefs and prophecies of the planet’s primary inhabitants, the Fremen; and the political machinations of the Bene Gesserit, the matriarchal order that tries to manipulate the bloodlines of the various royal houses throughout the known universe. One of the biggest differences between the two movies is the presentation of the lead protagonist, Paul Atreides. As portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan in Lynch’s movie, Paul seems more mature and confident in his abilities. He does not shy away from assuming the role of the messianic Kwisatz Haderach. Timothée Chalamet’s Paul is younger and less self-assured than MacLachlan’s interpretation. He is doubtful about his abilities — or even his desire — to accept his calling as a leader or a savior. One of the drawbacks of this new version is that not much really happens. The movie is slow but not boring, though it does feature extensive exposition and considerable political intrigue. The movie’s biggest selling points are its visuals and locales, especially the many shots of the vast deserts for which Arrakis is alternately called “Dune.” The performances also keep you invested. Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother, shows more maternal instincts and is less sure of her son’s potential than in the earlier movie. Oscar Isaac is a more pragmatic, weary and wise Duke Leto Atreides, extending the hand of friendship to Stilgar (Javier Bardem), leader of the Fremen. Bardem, who has little to do in this movie, will probably get more screen time in the hoped-for second part. Also in the cast is Zendaya as Chani, Paul’s future love interest; Josh Brolin as Gurney Hallack, one of Paul’s mentors; Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, the master of the sword and a friend of Paul; Stellan Skargsård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, sworn enemy of the House of Atreides; David Bautista as the brutish Beast Rabban Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron; and Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. For those, like myself, unfamiliar with the book but with a general knowledge of Lynch’s movie, this “Dune” will seem familiar, yet different — but in a meaningful way. Villeneuve has added more meat to the bone and that benefits the movie and the moviegoer. The most exasperating aspect of “Dune” is its ending. Even after more than 2½ hours, you are not tired. You want to continue this journey with Paul Atreides but are cut short. And, yes, to his credit, where Villeneuve stops the movie is at a logical point. So, it is very possible that he will be able to complete and conclude this spectacle as soon as possible. I, for one, cannot wait."
"Oct 13, 2021",POSITIVE," A couple of years ago my book club chose to read Frank Herbert’s 1965 scifi novel Dune for one of our summer selections. The whole point of book club is to get me out of my reading comfort zone so I dove in hoping to enjoy it…and I did not. It was a beast of exposition and ambling plot that went nowhere. None of us but one enjoyed the book and I hoped to never hear about Dune again. Then of course the movie was announced directed by auteur Denis Villeneuve and of course it was delayed last year due to the pandemic. I feel like I have been hearing about this movie for ages. First the endless casting announcements and then trailers and other publicity as it became delayed. The hype for most was building to a promise I knew the film would not be able to meet- ‘the next Lord of the Rings‘ or ‘Star Wars‘ and I knew from the book that’s not what Dune is unless they strayed far away from the source material. Today we finally arrived at the big screening day and I had moderated expectations, which is what I recommend for each of you. Don’t go in expecting to hate it- that’s idiotic but expect a well made scifi movie and that’s what you will get. That’s right. I did actually enjoy Dune despite my dislike of the book. I don’t love it and it has its issues but it’s about the best you could do in making a Dune movie and what more can you ask of filmmakers? The strengths are in the visual effects and production/sound design. The acting is also all competent and they keep the story moving fairly well- far better than the book or some of Villeneuve’s other scifi films. My problems with the film is in the character development. Timothee Chalamet does a good job with Paul but the character is flat and doesn’t grow in the way we need for this type of Chosen One story. In addition, none of the side characters stand out or are particularly memorable (no Samwise or Han Solo types in the bunch). It also has no comic relief or lighthearted moments to allow the audience to breathe away from the action. As I said, the visual effects are strong but in the last third of the film there are a lot of night scenes obfuscated with sand storms. I know this is partly intentional as the story has become darker but it lost some of its visual flair to a muddy sameness by the end. I know many will disagree with me, but I also was underwhelmed by the Hans Zimmer score. I thought it was bland and missing the dynamic theme we need in such an epic story. After I see a film I always ask ‘did it succeed in doing what it’s trying to do?’ and I think with Dune the answer is yes. Sure I had some critiques but for a very difficult novel to put on film they did a good job and certainly fans of the source material will love it. When you get a chance to see it let me know what you think! I went to see Dune last night with my Mrs for a birthday treat  and it’s very hard work, I would have probably left if I was next to the aisle but I was quite centrally seated and didn’t want to disturb anyone who might have been enjoying it, amongst all the bangs and explosions my wife managed to fall asleep twice. So all in all most disappointing, I should have gone with the first option and gone to the pub. Shawn in Caleta de Fuste. Even Herbert himself wouldn’t have found the words to describe how good this film is. A life-long Dune fan to other Dune fans, they didn’t ruin it. They might have somehow elevated Dune to another level and I didn’t think that would ever be possible. See it as a soon as possible on the biggest screen you can find. Also Done 2 is soon going to release."
"Oct 12, 2021",POSITIVE," When Denis Villeneuve was confirmed to be making Dune his next movie, I was skeptical like a lot of people. Personally, Frank Herbert’s book did nothing for me, and that’s coming from a sci-fi junkie. There are a bunch of people who consider David Lynch’s adaptation a cult classic, but it was also a gigantic flop that appealed only to a niche audience, and Villeneuve already had one of those on his resume with Blade Runner 2049. In short: the world of Dune has never meant much to me…until now. My goodness, Dune is everything you could want from a huge, star-powered Hollywood movie event full of spectacle and grandeur. Within moments you’ll forget all about what Lynch did before and be totally wrapped in the spice war that has enveloped the royal House of Atreides. It’s incredible how far Villeneuve has come. Since Prisoners he has been operating on another level, and Dune is the culmination of everything leading up to now. Visually, it’s absolutely breathtaking to behold, from the insect-like crafts to the shimmering shield armor worn by the Atreides, to obviously the desert landscape of Arrakis which appropriately looks like someplace you could be lost forever if you aren’t swallowed up by the mammoth sandworms. Hans Zimmer’s ominous, ethereal score delivers on every level, too. Villeneuve hasn’t been shy about his desire to turn this into a franchise, establishing Dune as a clear “Part 1”. In doing so, the film is largely set up during the first hour, as Timothee Chalamet embodies Paul Atreides, heir to House Atreides and a boy with a messianic destiny. Visions, some showing death on a massive scale, others of the beautiful blue-eyed Chiani (Zendaya) of the Freemen, occupy his mind. His father, Duke Leo (Oscar Isaac) has been put in charge of the desert planet of Arrakis, where spice is the most valuable commodity in all of the galaxy. But the Fremen who live there reject the violent rule of past outsiders, mostly the warmongering House Harkonnen. Leo hopes to build a lasting partnership with the Fremen and not rule them with an iron fist, but political mechaniations by the Emperor and those within House Harkonnen conspire to doom House Atreides from the start. Dune wraps itself up in political machinations for a good stretch of its 150+ runtime, but at no point does it ever drag. In part that’s due to the slow evolution of Paul, who grows more confident as things get deadlier for House Atreides. There’s also the mysterious maneuverings of his mother, Lady Jessica, played with enigmatic force by Rebecca Ferguson (Honestly, does anyone do mysterious and dangerous better than her?), and sisters of the Bene Gesserit who have big plans for Paul…assuming he can survive.  Action is initially sprinkled in by measured doses, most of it by the movie’s most exciting character, Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, the swashbuckling hero of House Atreides. Momoa’s big personality leaps off the screen, and he has by far the most physical moments in all of the film, often battling hordes of Harkonnen solo. Josh Brolin as Paul’s grizzled mentor Gurney Hallack also gets his share of excitement, and I was happy to see veteran character actor Stephen McKinley Henderson getting quite a lot to do as mentat Thufir Hawat. Other prominent actors get only a few minutes to shine, with the promise of much greater exposure if the sequel happens. Zendaya’s Chani is one whose presence looms large, although she is rarely seen until the final act. The same goes for Javier Bardem as Fremen leader Stilgar, although he makes an impression. Too bad we don’t see more of Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista in their Harkonnen roles, as the villains are thinly-drawn in this first chapter. Of course, the film really lives and dies on Chalamet’s performance, though. I’m not one of those who necessarily subscribe to him as this great actor, but I like him when taking on characters that must grow into power. He’s exceptionally good at depicting Paul’s hesitancy to embrace his future, while becoming the leader that he is meant to be. Dune is Star Wars-level space drama and easily one of the best movies of the year. My biggest complaint is that I wanted more, and I wanted more quickly. As long as Villeneuve is involved, Dune is the must-see sci-fi on the big screen right now, and you’ll want to see it on the biggest screen possible."
"Oct 12, 2021",NEGATIVE,"For a film set in the desert, it's one of the coldest and lifeless things I've seen in a while."
"Oct 12, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s film of Frank Herbert’s “Dune” looks exactly as it should on the big screen — epic in scale, baroque in design, fatalistic in outlook, grim in its life-or-death stakes.  So as faithful to the spirit of the novel as this adaptation is, as wonderfully as visionary Villeneuve cast it, as stunning as the “Arrival/Blade Runner 2049” director’s production design and art direction team makes it, this pretty picture often plays as ponderous. “Dune” gives us the dreams of its hero, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), heir to the dukedom of House Atreides. Again and again, we’re teased with flash-forwards thanks to Paul, son of not just Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), but of his witchy spellbinder of the Bene Gesserit mother (Rebecca Ferguson). This “chosen one” has glimpses of a possible future, which creates impatience in the story as it plods through everything it takes to put our hero in those more-exciting-than-what-we-see-here dream scenes from “Dune 2” and/or “3.” Even though Villeneuve & Co. realized that Herbert’s book was going to take multiple films to cover, unlike David Lynch and his producer Dino DeLaurentis, by pacing this “Dune” exactly like Lynch’s — both films give us our first taste of the Sand Worms” one hour in — he all but ensures the slowest “origin story” franchise film in ages. House Atreides, led by Duke Leto, has been given the “fief” of Arrakis, sending him and his vast armed clan to take over the spice mining on this forbidding desert planet whose natives, the Fremen, aren’t keen on “Outworlders” making a mess of things and giving them nothing in return.  The Duke, his concubine Jessica (Ferguson), his son Paul and most trusted lieutenants (Jason Mamoa, Josh Brolin and Stephen McKinley Henderson) and palace guards will take over from their bloodthirsty rivals, House Harkonnen, led by its bloated ogre of a Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his thuggish nephew (Dave Bautista).  Arrakis is a poison pill for Atreides, a hellishly hot place infested with people-and-machinery-devouring sand worms, wracked by terrorist attacks from the Fremen. The Duke hopes to pacify the place by “negotiating” with the natives and fixing everything the Harkonnen messed up. “Dune” takes us from grand, oversized sets to striking Norwegian coastal cliffs and the stunning desert vistas of Abu Dhabi as it immerses us in this universe of intrigues and a Chosen One’s martial and ESP Bene Gesserit training from Mum. And the film introduces us to an arid world where shade is a life-saving must just after sunrise, where water is so precious it has to be recycled in special suits and spitting isn’t the insult it is in much of our world, even though it’s just as gross. But Mamoa and Brolin are macho delights, Ferguson soulful and scheming, Isaac and Sharon Duncan-Brewster (playing an Imperial ecologist) make strong impressions and Stellan Skarsgård, almost buried in (Digital?) prosthetics, tickles as an embittered, bloody-minded beast with little control of his “appetites.” Hans Zimmer’s score leans heavily on the Arabic influences that inspired Herbert, whose novel gave much of the Western world its first taste of such words as “jihad” and The Mahdi.” David Lynch was forced to suddenly squeeze in two thirds of the novel into the ruinously-rushed last 45 minutes of his “Dune,” and Villeneuve faces no such dilemma. But his take on the tale dawdles, pretty much from his opening scene to the anti-climactic finish.  There’s a trick to making first-film-in-a-franchise films, and while the sweep of this one is every bit the eye candy fans could hope for, Villeneuve, the screenwriters and I must add composer Zimmer don’t so much stick the landing as let their picture peter out.  Cast: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Mamoa, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Javier Bardem, Chen Chang, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård. Credits: Directed by Denis Villeneuve, scripted by Jon Spaihts, Denis Villeneuve and Eric Roth. based on the novel by Frank Herbert. A Warner Brothers release."
"Oct 12, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s a new day. In 2021 the New York Film Festival was live and in-person and exhibited a wide array of international films that broke new ground, featured veteran Black actors at their best and blockbusters that will be in movie theaters and on streaming services later this year or early 2022. These are some of the most intriguing.  Dune (***1/2) In 1984, filmmaker David Lynch brought Frank Herbert’s 1967 cult-classic science fiction novel Dune to the big screen. It was 90% pageantry, 10 % verve and a complete snore. The first 30 minutes of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 adaptation feels similar; it’s stunningly beautiful, but initially act/adv/dra fans will wonder: “Where’s the beef?” Lots of setup, countless characters, deadly rivalries and no action. Keep the faith. Once the footage meticulously lays out the groundwork, momentum builds and what comes is eye-catching and kinetic. Like a Star Wars movie, only set among high sand dunes and not outer space. In the year 10191, the desert planet Arrakis has been fought and lusted over for years due to one of its precious minerals. Different groups vie to run the planet, and all are led down the same path of destruction as they’re deviously manipulated by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). He pits the warring factions against each other—like pawns. The latest noble family to take the bait is the House of Atreides, run by the Duke (Oscar Isaac), his heir Paul (Timotheé Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). With their fierce militia, they take over the planet, are tasked with harvesting the natural resources and dealing with the locals. Good luck.  There are enough players and conflicts to stretch this storyline out and spawn spinoffs indefinitely. Sci-fi screenwriter Jon Spaihts (Doctor Strange), drama writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) and writer/director Villeneuve (Arrival) are the right team at the right time. As their story pans out it is easy to track who’s who and what’s at stake. The deep beige sand dunes and valleys with gigantic sand worm monsters and fierce combatants sustain tension. Paul and Jessica’s odd mental telepathy powers and slick warrior skills performed by characters like Duncan (Jason Momoa) are fascinating. The entire cast excels: Zendaya (Spider-Man: Far from Home), Sharon Duncan-Brew (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), Josh Brolin, Chen Chang, Dave Bautista Babs Olusanmokun (Wrath of Man),Benjamin Clementine and Charlotte Rampling. Production designer Patrice Vermette, cinematographer Greig Fraser, film editor Joe Walker, costume designers Bob Morgan and Jacqueline West and composer Hans Zimmer (The Lion King) should dust off their formal wear for Oscar night, they’ll need it. What a spectacle. This is the event movie audiences have been waiting for and theaters have been coveting.  The French Dispatch (**1/2) In this quirky nod and a wink to journalism, writer/director Wes Anderson and co-writers Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola return to their more esoteric brand of humor (The Royal Tenenbaums). It’s almost like they’ve walked away from a more accessible formula (The Grand Budapest Hotel, $170M at the box office). Intact, is Anderson’s penchant for creating zany, odd cartoonish characters: It’s the final days of an expatriate U.S. magazine whose staff works in a satellite office in the quaint French town of Ennui-sur-Blasé. They’re all about to lose their jobs, which mimics real-life as journalists today are constantly on the precipice of unemployment. Scribes and art film fans may relate to this tedious parable. But Anderson, his crew and this inside-joke movie may have overplayed their hand with average viewers.  It’s as if Anderson told the entire cast (Jeffrey Wright, Bill Murray, Léa Seydoux, Timothée Chalamet, Benicio Del Toro and half of SAG) to act weird and maybe people won’t notice that this film is one-note. The cinematography, costumes, production design, set decoration and art direction are gorgeous and ingenious. Would have been a wonderful short film. But as an 1hr 48min feature film, the footage continues long after the joke is over and punchline has been delivered.  The Tragedy of Macbeth (****) There comes a point in every year when audiences see a film they believe is this year’s masterpiece. This is that time, that film. Joel Coen (O, Brother Where Art Thou) has created a magnus opus that sets a high bar few other films vying for annual awards will reach. He reinterprets one of Shakespeare’s most famous plays, Macbeth, keeping the most pivotal parts. Some potential viewers may have forgotten the crux of the plotting, but not the most famous lines: “Double, double toil and trouble;” “What’s done cannot be undone.” Scottish general Macbeth (Denzel Washington) is warned by three witches (Kathryn Hunt) that someday he will be king. Heeding that prophecy and egged on by his ambitious wife Lady Macbeth (McDormand), the impatient general kills the current king, becomes the new ruler and murders more people during his uncontrollable fits of paranoia. A rebellion erupts, aiming to overthrow him. Themes of greed, deception and ruthlessness mirror the U.S.’s recent political spectrum and should enthrall audiences with its timeliness. Shot in stunning black and white (cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel) with the most arresting production design (Stefan Dechant), art direction (Jason T. Clark), set decoration (Nancy Haigh) and regal costumes (Mary Zophres) vivid images from this film will mesmerize audiences as much as the penetrating dialogue, treacherous plot points and Coen’s gifted direction and writing. Comparisons to the style of Laurence Olivier’s classic 1940s Shakespeare adaptations and early twentieth century German expressionism are noted, but Cohen’s netherworld seems unique and new in its own way. Not filmed as a stage play, not set in real surroundings. When Oscar acting nominations are handed out, expect Washington’s brooding performance and McDormand’s scheming portrayal to top the lists. Award nominations should also be given to Alex Hassell as the sleezy vulture Ross, Bertie Carvel as Banquo, Moses Ingram as Lady Macduff and Corey Hawkins (Straight Outta Compton) as the brave and righteous Macduff. Every element of this work of art is beyond excellent. Who could have guessed that sheer ruthlessness could be so damn astounding? "
"Oct 11, 2021",POSITIVE," Avantgarde mastermind Alejandro Jodorowsky had a production in the '70s with Orson Welles as the villain and Pink Floyd writing the soundtrack that never materialised. David Lynch's attempt in 1984 was so reviled by the director that he has since completely disowned it from his filmography. Even when you consider the works that 'Dune' has inspired - 'Game of Thrones', 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', musical works by Fatboy Slim, Iron Maiden, Grimes - there is a daunting task ahead for anyone who wishes to tackle it. Yet, with all of this weight and circumstance around 'Dune', there is still a fascinating, entertaining spectacle to experience. The sheer size of the filmmaking is worth the price of the ticket alone. The cast is huge, but you never get the sense that anyone is itching for more screen time. It's set thousands of years in the future, but it all feels familiar enough to be understood. It has a wide reach of planets, houses, factions, and lore, but it's focused essentially on two characters - a mother and a son - fighting for survival in a harsh climate. There's no extraneous exposition in 'Dune', nobody is sitting down to explain what a Mentat is, but it does give one or two scenes over to a little clunky dialogue to help smooth things out. Of course, not everyone has read 'Dune', 'Dune Messiah', or watched the drearily under-budgeted TV series in the early aughts with James MacAvoy, or forced themselves through David Lynch's bizarro efforts with it. With Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune', you won't need to. It is slick with its twists and turns, navigating you through sandstorms and court intrigue with ease. The script never loses touch with its source material but doesn't feel beholden to it either. The production design is spectacular, and the cinematography captures all of the natural wonders of the Jordanian desert as a canvas for Arrakis. Hans Zimmer's score, influenced with guitar symphonies and Middle Eastern wails, lays atop a powerful sound design that demands you see it in a cinema. The script, written by Oscar winner Eric Roth, Jon Spaiths, and Villeneuve, knows just when to pull back from the edge before it loses people. 'Dune' isn't a wham-bam blockbuster spectacular, however. It's far denser and considered than that. If you saw any of Villeneuve's previous work - 'Sicario', 'Arrival', 'Prisoners' - you'll know that pacing can be slow, but it's building towards something much more lasting. Unlike the disposable pleasures of comic-book franchises, 'Dune' is a work that will stay in your brain for days and weeks afterwards. It throws fun and frolics out the window, and deals with a dark confluence of colonisation and commerce, and prophecy and politics. Across the cast, each ably performs their roles. Oscar Isaac's beard gives all the commanding presence, and his dynamic with Timothée Chalamet is intriguing, if a little stunted. As to Chalamet, you can tell that he's trying to grapple with the role - both literally and figuratively - and it works. His sense of unease and awkward mannerisms are layered with the fact that he knows that some terrible destiny awaits him beyond the edge of his sight. Rebecca Ferguson, who typically plays ice queens and femme fatales, has a warmth to her performance here that is quite affecting. Even though he only appears in a couple of scenes, Stellan Skarsgard's monstrous villain leaves a lasting impact, while the supporting cast of Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are all lined up and ready for the second chapter of 'Dune'. If it can sustain this sense of wonder, and maintain its integrity and vision into the next chapter, and if audiences turn up for it, 'Dune' might just topple its own descendants and claim its place as the foremost sci-fi saga of our time. "
"Oct 10, 2021",POSITIVE," Slam it to the left, if you’re having a good time. Shake it to the right, if you know that you feel fine. Chicas to the front.  This Spice Girls hit does not feature in Denis Villeneuve’s new screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune, which has a Spotlight screening tonight at the New York Film Festival, although it sure would have livened things up a bit. All the talk of Spice in the movie though got the song stuck in my head. Villeneuve’s Dune is of course more concerned with an interstellar colonial future of Desert Power in 10191, the year the film opens in, than Girl Power in 1997 (though the movie is populated by some strong female characters). So I’ll drop the Spice Girls talk. For now, anyway. With stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser, imaginative production design by Patrice Vermette, and some breathtaking shooting locations in Hungary, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, and Norway, Villeneuve’s film is an utterly transporting cinematic experience that’s well worth a trip to a theatre to see it on the largest screen you can (it was shot on IMAX cameras). Yet despite its myriad impressive attributes, including a stellar cast delivering spirited, committed performances, the film does nevertheless lack a little…well, spice.  Set thousands of years in the future when humans have colonized the Known Universe, there’s some beautifully detailed worldbuilding, with Mark Mangini’s sound design, the exoticism of Hans Zimmer’s rich score, and distinctive costume design by Jacqueline West and Robert Morganall all contributing, along with the film’s absorbing visual style. However when it comes to the dialogue, with a screenplay by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth, there’s a sustained imbalance between that worldbuilding, which sometimes feels expositionary, and the development of a compelling narrative. The characters are well-defined though, and despite the epic scope of the movie the plot never becomes unwieldily; partly thanks to the decision to split the source material into two parts, with this film serving as the first.  We meet our young hero, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), just as his noble ruler father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, bringing a soulful strength to the role) and his people are charged by the Emperor with the task of leaving their home planet of Caladan to take over control of the inhospitable planet of Arrakis. Paul has already been learning about the place—the heat and gargantuan sandworms which make life their particularly treacherous for the uninitiated (the desert mice are super cute though)—as well as the ways and the language of the planet’s residing human civilization who have adapted and evolved for survival there, the Fremen.  The planet’s worth to the colonizers comes from its abundance of Spice, “the most valuable substance in the universe”, prized as fuel to power their space travel among other uses, while for the Fremen it is appreciated for its health and mind-expanding properties. Spice is beautifully rendered in the film as a fine gold glittery substance that shimmers in the sunlight.  Ahead of their big move, Paul’s sleep has been disturbed by some troublingly vivid images of Arrakis which he believes might be prophetic. The girl of his dreams is a Fremen warrior named Chani (Zendaya), whom we only meet as things are drawing to a close, although she does permeate the film through Paul’s visions of her and Zendaya’s natural screen presence.  There’s a focus on Paul’s family life, with a touching dynamic developed between father and son, including one scene that unfolds like a teenager coming out to an accepting parent, as Paul opens up to his father that succeeding him as duke might not be what he feels he’s destined for, and his dad telling him whatever he decides to be he’ll always be his son. Whereas Paul’s close bond with his mother, and father’s concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), has been forged in secrecy. Believing that he may be the chosen one, she has schooled him in the mysterious and powerful ways of the Jedi-like Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit, involving using The Voice as a form of mind-control.  Although there are a few moments of levity here and there—there’s a nice exchange between Paul and master swordsman Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) with whom he has a close fratneral friendship, about Paul’s svelte frame in contrast to Duncan’s more traditional action hero bod—generally though the tone is a pretty sombre one. While the colour palette, largely made up of funereal black and various shades of brown and grey, although stylish and fitting for the desert planet setting, becomes a little dispiritingly drab after a while.  What helps to keep the film consistently engaging though is its terrific cast, breathing life into dialogue that verges on the dry. Chalamet is captivating as the contemplative lead, both cerebral and emotional, while Charlottle Rampling makes an indelible impression as fiery Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who tests Paul’s self-restraint and willpower in an intense, standout scene. Credit should go to the Emmy-nominated casting directors Francine Maisler and Jina Jay for some inspired choices and with such consistency in the performances, Villeneuve is clearly a skilled director of actors, something that isn’t always prioritized on scifi movies of this scale filled with effects. When it comes to those effects, there’s a tangible quality to elements like the spacecraft in flight and fast moving sandworms, with no discernible difference in look between what was achieved in-camera by Paul Lambert’s impressive visual effects and Gerd Nefzer’s special effects, while crucially there aren’t any gratuitous FX-filled or action sequences, what’s there always serves to immerse us in the world of the movie.  Towards the very end-of-part-one feeling close of the film, Dune takes on a rather languorous pace and is in danger of feeling overlong with a running time of over two and half hours. Nevertheless there’s plenty to savour here throughout and I’m looking forward to a spicier part two.  Dune will be released in select theaters in 2D and 3D and IMAX and HBO Max on October 22nd 2021. It will be available on HBO Max’s Ad-Free plan in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos (English Only) on supported devices for 31 days from theatrical release."
"Oct 9, 2021",POSITIVE," A 37-year gap is certainly a long wait. I’m talking about none other than Frank Herbert’s 1965 seminal sci-fi novel, ‘Dune’, which was previously adapted for the big screen back in 1984. That film, directed by David Lynch, may have been a cult classic. But it was a huge flop both critically and financially at the time of its release. Now, fast forward to the present time, we finally get another big-screen version of ‘Dune’. Originally set to be released last November but forced to postpone due to the ongoing concern of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have a strong feeling that Denis Villeneuve is capable to pull off the feat admirably. Besides, his previous experience in directing thought-provoking cerebral sci-fi films in ‘Arrival’ and the sadly underappreciated (at least from the mainstream’s point of view) ‘Blade Runner 2049’ speak for itself. Before I go straight to the review, here is what you need to know about the film. Set in the year 10,191, we learn that Harkonnen has ruled the desert planet of Arrakis for decades, where they have gained enormous profits from their spice-mining operation. The spice, which is a sacred hallucinogen, has the power of prolonging one’s life and other benefits. Led by the sinister Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, in heavy makeup) along with his nephew, Rabban (Dave Bautista), he rules the planet with the iron fist and oppresses the indigenous people of Arrakis a.k.a. Fremen. However, Harkonnen’s days of governing Arrakis are over when the Emperor decides to hand over the responsibility to Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) of House Atreides from the homeworld of Caladan. While Duke Leto is happily obliged, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen refuses to give up and he is looking for whatever ways necessary to rule Arrakis again. The film also focuses on Duke Leto’s young son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), who has been constantly plagued with recurring visions of the future, particularly his mysterious involvement with the Fremen girl (Zendaya). Also, a warrior-in-training under the mentorship of Duke’s two military advisors including Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Paul is equally groomed by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to master the art of mind control via the ‘Voice’. Denis Villeneuve wasn’t kidding when he said, “It has been dreamed, designed and shot thinking IMAX” during an interview at this year’s Venice Film Festival. After watching ‘Dune’ on IMAX, I must admit it is an immersive experience. The film is as cinematic as it gets, the kind that you should consider watching this on the big screen if possible instead of streaming it on tv. It helps that Villeneuve favors lots of practical effects over CGI, where the latter is only used to enhance the scenes. Similar to what he did in ‘Blade Runner 2049’, his largely practical approach makes the overall experience all the more palpable. This includes everything from the large-scale sets and props to the desert planet of Arrakis, which isn’t shot using the greenscreen but actually filmed on location in Jordan and Abu Dhabi. Even the CGI sandworm is physically imposing no matter it moves swiftly under the sand or shown in a giant close-up, complete with long teeth shaped like needles. ‘Dune’ also gets an extra boost from Patrice Vermette’s spectacular production design while Greig Fraser’s cinematography is a first-rate technical marvel. Hans Zimmer’s familiar musical composition that evokes ominous dread is put into good use throughout the film. Although his score tends to get too loud in certain scenes, it’s hard to deny that Zimmer’s overall effort plays a significant part in grabbing one’s attention upon watching the film. The action, however, is a mixed bag. Earlier moments such as Paul and Gurney’s shield-enabled swordfight training and the daring rescue scene are praiseworthy in terms of their overall staging, tension and suspense. But once the action takes place mostly in the dark, as evident during the sudden ambush of Harkonnen’s army against House Atreides, the film loses its sense of kinetic flair. Besides, shooting action setpieces either in the dark or low-light settings are usually an ill-advised creative choice. They are usually difficult to decipher what’s going on in the scene, making it hard to appreciate or enjoy the staging of its action setpiece. This, in turn, made me frustrated because I’m sure Villeneuve is more than capable to do better in the action department. Or maybe it has to do with the budgetary concern, even though the film is already blessed with a reportedly $165 million at his disposal? As for the plot, the film may have been plagued with expositions but Villeneuve has the knack of telling his story in a hypnotic way possible. He knows how to grab your attention, which instantly reminds me of Villeneuve’s same strategy seen in ‘Blade Runner 2049’. Then, there’s the all-star cast. Timothée Chalamet is perfectly typecast as a conflicted young man, who is unsure of his own destiny. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson along with Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin all deliver solid supporting turns in their respective roles. Stellan Skarsgård, in the meantime, channels the late Marlon Brando-like Colonel Kurtz from ‘Apocalypse Now’ in his antagonist role as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Too bad some of the actors aren’t given ample room to shine in their performances. Among them includes Javier Bardem, who plays the leader of Fremen, Stilgar while Zendaya is largely underutilized as one of Fremen’s warrior-fighters. Dave Bautista is equally wasted as Baron’s nephew, Rabban. Overall, if you can look past some of the flaws in this film, ‘Dune’ remains a remarkable achievement that David Lynch tried and failed more than 35 years ago. Whether the film is getting the chance to continue the story (Villeneuve splits ‘Dune’ into two parts) will depend on its overall box-office total. Otherwise, we will be left with unresolved questions since ‘Dune’ ends with a cliffhanger.
"
"Oct 9, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune, the famous science-fiction novel by Frank Herbert is so complex to adapt to film that even Alejandro Jodorowsky gave up while David Lynch was incapable of taking it to a superior level in the 80s. But now, the Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve, whose experience in the sci-fi genre spawned admirable works such as Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), was able to mount a galvanizing adaptation of the book with the right dark tone, impressive tech details and unpretentiously efficient imagery.  Compellingly structured, the film entertains and intrigues with sober magic, ominous figures, prophecies and premonitory dreams, fierce battles and a systematic sense of danger that is enhanced by a superb orchestral score by Hans Zimmer, who turned down Christopher Nolan’s Tenet to compose for this one. The imagination of Villeneuve, who counted on the help of Eric Roth (Forrest Gump; Munich) and Jon Spaihts (Prometheus; Passengers) in the screenplay, benefited from a perfect casting and the laudably poised work of his visual effects team. Although the cast attacks their roles with matching intensity, Timothée Chalamet as the gifted Paul Atreides, and Rebecca Ferguson as his sect-member mother, deserve special mentions. This is the first of a two-part adaptation, and I’m already eager for the other half to arrive. If you love to dive in fantastic space odysseys and imaginary worlds, go for it because it’s all done with that harmonious balance proper of the great filmmakers."
"Oct 9, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune has had a laboured journey to the big screen. The infamously hard-to-adapt story has been taken on by Hollywood a few times in recent decades with dreadful results. David Lynch's 1985 travesty has gone down in history as one of the most reviled films of all time (despite having now reached cult status as a film considered so-bad-it's-good). On top of that, in 1975 Alejandro Jodorowsky optioned to film Dune as a ten-hour feature; a quest that was never finished. Although adapting Dune has long been considered box-office suicide, Villeneuve has created a coherent, intelligent, and - dare I say - exhilarating film. From the instant Dune begins it is obvious Villeneuve has taken his time with Herbert's 1965 novel. Straight away, viewers are given the film's title card: Dune - Part One, forewarning cinemagoers that, even when the credits roll, the story is far from over.  Chalamet has proven time and again how adept he is on screen, but his performance as Paul is supremely impressive. He deftly plays a frustrated teenager while also displaying the knowledge of a thousand lifetimes, creating a fantastic kaleidoscope of range. Between bubbling anger and growing abject terror for his own fate, Chalamet is stunning to watch throughout the entire film. It's often difficult to take your eyes off him. Duke Leto has been gifted the fiefdom of Arrakis (colloquially known as Dune) by the galaxy's emperor. When the Atreides arrive on Arrakis it is the Duke's job to rule fiercely while continuing the harvest of the spice, Melange - a substance that can only be found on Dune. On top of allowing for interstellar travel, spice also prolongs human life, making it the most valuable asset in the universe. Isaac carries the weight of this dangerous task on his shoulders with a tender yet substantial performance. From commanding a legion of warriors to giving his son gentle reassurance; the former Star Wars actor is one of the main draws of this space opera epic.  As a member of the cunning Bene Gesserit clan, Lady Jessica's character introduces a collection of concepts into the film, including The Voice, the Gom Jabbar and the Lisan al Gaib. The resurgence of these timeless narrative hooks will ensure science fiction cinema will never be the same again. Villeneuve's script and pacing have somehow made even the most opaque pieces of the Bene Gesserit culture approachable in Dune - but it is helped immensely by Ferguson's stellar performance. The Mission Impossible star is easily the standout actor in the movie. She delivers some truly heartbreaking moments that are borderline haunting. It will be a joy to see her continue in the upcoming trilogy (please, Warner Bros, give us the entire trilogy).  Ferguson isn't the only excellent piece of the Dune puzzle: Villeneuve has built (another!) beautiful world. The sheer scale of everything he has created - from spaceships to buildings to landscapes, etc - evoke a daunting feeling of a real, endless, unknown universe looming over you. With the same flair and delicacy exercised in his previous movies (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, et al) Villeneuve is the absolute master of world-building while making it look as beautiful as possible. The dangerous baking desert vistas are expertly contrasted with cold, stoic interiors where betrayal seeps from the very walls. Every single frame in Dune could be its own portrait, with a few standout moments that will be dissected for years to come. Perhaps the most impressive parts of Dune come from Herbert, rather than Villeneuve. The director has not only used the most important parts of the original author's novel but has - in some cases - expanded and improved upon them.  Villeneuve takes his time in exploring the story's more heady sci-fi themes originally penned by Herbert in the 60s. This allows him to give each of the concepts an almost tangle weight and purpose, so that when the likes of the Shai Huluds, the Fremen and the Sardaukar are introduced they are far more formidable forces of nature on screen.  That isn't to say Dune is lost in time - quite the opposite; the casual film lover will also find much to love in this thrilling adventure. On top of indulging in fight scenes that rival moments in the John Wick series, there are also short spells of dog-fighting with the ornithopters that are truly pulse-racing.  If you are a Star Wars fan, a sci-fi fan, a film fan, or just a fan of objectively great movies, you must see Dune on the biggest screen available to you. Then watch it again. And again. This is a film to be savoured for as long as possible."
"Oct 9, 2021",POSITIVE," Two-parters can often be a tricky proposition for telling a complete story. There is always a risk that the story will remain unfinished if the sequel doesn’t get made. Allegiant was a recent example that killed off the franchise without completing the story. The major concern with the latest attempt to bring Dune to the big screen for me was whether the second part would come out. Given the epic nature of the original novel, it makes sense that they would divide the movie into two parts. (Tellingly, the film is titled Dune: Part One). It needed the breathing space that a two-parter can afford, provided they can tell the complete story. When it was announced that Denis Villeneuve would take a shot at bringing the infamously unfilmable sci-fi classic Dune to the bring screen, I mixed feelings about it. Dune, being his follow-up to Blade Runner 2049, a movie that deservedly got a lot of respect but ultimately was too slow and took too long to get to its point. But as the movie progressed, he more or less assuaged my fears as a fan of the book. The film still gets a little overlong, but Villeneuve has successfully brought Dune’s world to the big screen with stupendous gusto. The 1984 David Lynch adaptation was famously desperate trying to explain the various plot points through voiceover. But Denis gets plenty of time here to let the story breathe as he has one more movie (hopefully) to tell the complete story of the ascent of Paul Atreides. It also allows him to introduce the characters and the vast world of the Dune Universe properly. Explaining the story of Dune can get a little confusing, but the makers follow the story fairly faithfully. The patriarch of House Atreides, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), is assigned to be the ruler of the planet Arrakis by the Emperor of what is the Known universe. Allegories plenty abound; the rest of the story is about the various machinations of different groups trying to destroy the family and how the Duke’s son, Paul Atreides, accepts his destiny and fights back for his family. It was also great that he does very little hand-holding and lets the audience discover the world as the movie progresses. Apart from a short voiceover, in the beginning, he avoids it for the rest of the film. The downside of this is that newcomers to the Dune series might find it tricky to keep track. It requires your complete attention to ensure that you do not lose out on the details. Since it is part one of a continuing storyline, it ends in the inevitable cliffhanger, which might disappoint some who want closure in a single story. But the sheer scale of the world Villeneuve created is magnificent and gives it a feel of a grand sci-fi movie. The cinematographer Greig Fraser also avoids the campy look of its 80s predecessor, adding to its epic scale. Their confidence in the source material and assured stamp on the film is clear here. Another factor that helped in raising excitement for the movie is its stacked cast. And boy, is it stacked. Villeneuve has cast actors who make an impact irrespective of the screen time, ensuring that they shine. Timothée Chalamet is perfect as Paul Atreides and truly makes you believe he was destined to play this part. The story (at least in the first book) revolves around the evolution of his character in the classic hero’s journey, and Chalamet sells the gamut of emotions the character goes through throughout the movie. Rebecca Ferguson might seem dubious as Paul’s mother, but after the initial apprehension gets over, she complements Clement perfectly. Stellan Skarsgård as the villain Baron Harkonnen also makes an impact despite his short running time. Though some actors get very little screen time given the expanded nature of specific roles in the second half, the excitement level increases tremendously when all these brilliant actors share screen space. They ensure you want to continue the journey with them onto the sequel. Fans of the series would find much to rejoice with this adaptation, even if some newcomers to the series might be left cold. Some might even say that the movie adds nothing new to the sci-fi genre. That has nothing to say about the film itself. But say a lot about the original novel’s tremendous impact and how much of it inspired and has been imitated subsequently. One thing is sure, though, Denis Villeneuve has undoubtedly created the definitive version of the sci-fi masterpiece. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Oct 8, 2021",POSITIVE,"It's well worth seeing and I certainly hope the second half gets made. But it's a slog. Gorgeous and eerie, it drifts along when it should be charging ahead. It's a film of painterly vistas, haunting music, and woozy reveries, defined by stiff dialogue."
"Oct 8, 2021",POSITIVE,"Villeneuve seems to be channeling David Lean here with an epic, jaw dropping film. A star turn by Timothee Chalamet. The film has some flaws, but it's still a cinematic treat."
"Oct 8, 2021",NEUTRAL," There has to be some level of anticipation and expectations when it comes to Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, not only because it’s the French-Canadian filmmaker’s first movie since Blade Runner 2049, and not just because it was delayed by a year, but also because it’s a much-read and in some circles beloved sci-fi classic by author Frank Herbert. Also, there was a famed and nearly-disastrous David Lynch adaptation from 1984 from which only a few fans of Herbert’s book ever recovered. To be fair, Lynch probably knew that Herbert’s work was going to be a difficult and expensive prospect, and one would imagine that Villeneuve was aware of that, as well. (If you’ve seen the doc, Jodorowsky’s Dune, then you also know that the Chilean cult movie auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky also gave it a try.)  But let’s put aside any confusion that Dune might be a remake of any kind, since Villeneuve clearly went back to the original source material for his version. There’s no real way to simplify the story, because Herbert’s novel was a great example of early sci-fi world-building. Essentially, it takes place amidst a  war between three factions for the planet Arrakis, which offers a valuable spice that offers healing powers and life extension. House Atreides is led by the Duke (Oscar Isaac) with his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) being taught how to use his inherited powers of “The Voice” from his mother (Rebecca Ferguson). Atreides has just made an accord with the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen, and have arrived to live there, but the malevolent House Harkonnen is not going to give up their access to their spice so easily, and therein lies the conflict. Paul also has dreams about a mysterious beauty (Zendaya), and oh yeah, he might be the prophesied Messiah of Arrakis. If elements feel familiar, it’s good to remember that Herbert wrote the original novel in 1965, years before Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, and also before we even put a human on another planet. That also means it was before any Star Wars, any Mad Max movies, and well before Keanu Reeves’ Neo was declared to be “The One” in 1999’s The Matrix. In other words, Herbert’s novels have been and continue to be hugely influential on anyone who has ever written the words “science fiction” on a piece of paper or word processor. Dune also takes place within a world that involves so many foreign words and usage one almost needs a glossary going into it in order to not be immediately lost within the first hour, which essentially just sets things up. Things pick up midway when Paul and his father go out to investigate the spice mining on Arrakis, only to witness one of the planet’s enormous sandworms bearing down on a spice harvester, requiring them to step in for a rescue. As you might expect, Villeneuve uses the same broad painterly strokes as he brought to his sequel Blade Runner 2049 a few years back, in order to create the largest landscape and tapestry for his characters possible, although that doesn’t mean he bothered using much of a palette since the entire film looks rather drab and monochromatic. That’s not to discount the work of the director’s go-to Production Designer Patrice Vermette, whose contributions to the film’s design involves a lot more than a world made up of sand dunes, whether it’s the horsefly-shaped ships or the even larger locations that we often see only briefly.  A lot of credit for the more fantastical elements must be given to the visual effects team under VFX Supe Paul Lambert. The costume work by Costume Designers Jacqueline West and Robert Morgan is quite exceptional, as they’ve given quite a wide spectrum of outfits for the characters, whether it’s for leisure, fighting, or surviving in Arrakis’ harsh landscapes. While Cinematographer Greig Fraser ASC, ACS is able to capture the epic scale of Villeneuve’s vision, the lack of color ends up being a major hindrance, and there similarly doesn’t seem to be much differentiation between the lighting of interiors and exteriors. Maybe the one craft or crafts that really stands out, possibly more than any other aspect of the movie, is Hans Zimmer’s bombastic score that’s given far more room to deliver the power he’s able to bring to this sort of big-screen experience. As much as I love this score and feel like it’s one of the year’s best, I feel bad for Johnny Greenwood, who has at least two (maybe three) amazing scores that may have finally gotten him an Oscar, and along comes previous winner, Zimmer, to steal away those chances.  Likewise, the sound work by Supervising Sound Editors Mark Mangini and Theo Green, Re-Recording Mixer Doug Hemphil, and Recording mixer Ron Bartlett — all returning from their Oscar-nominated work on Blade Runner 2049 — is quite worthy, although sometimes you may wonder if the sound is good because it’s loud, or if it’s just loud. (Sadly, I didn’t get to see the movie in IMAX or Dolby, which likely would have enhanced the sound even more, as well as the size and scope of the entire film.) As gorgeous as Dune looks, almost all the performances are generally emotionless and not particularly nuanced other than maybe Stellan Skarsgard’s delightful Baron Harkonnen. Villeneuve has managed to amass another great cast, but it seems like many of them have little to do but recite lines, other than those who actually get a chance to fight. Zendaya barely has a chance to appear in the movie despite her character narrating the opening. But even the fights seem like glorified lightsaber battles with the addition of everyone having security shields, which rarely do their job of protecting the wearer. While there are some fantastic set pieces and action moments during the middle hour of Dune, it ends with a downturned third act where Paul and his mother are wandering across Arrakis, stranded until they encounter a group of Fremen, including a leader played by Javier Bardem. Dune is a movie that lacks emotion but also lacks much in the way of tension, and after 2 ½ hours, the movie just ends with the equivalent of a “To Be Continued…” — to be fair, the opening title literally says “Dune Part 1” —  but some may find that a little disappointing, especially since a 2nd part hasn’t actually been greenlit by the studio yet. Dune is roughly half a good movie, but that’s only because it really is only half a movie. In some ways, it got me more excited about going back and reading some of Herbert’s novels, rather than waiting to see if this does well enough to indeed warrant its necessary conclusion. How much will Dune have to make to warrant that sequel, and is Warner Media hoping that the movie will get their streamer HBO Max enough new subscriptions to warrant another movie, especially when this one looks so expensive? Only time will tell, but hopefully, Villeneuve will use a second film’s runtime in a way that offers more in the form of entertainment for the Herbert novitiates? Dune is currently playing in overseas markets, but it will open in North America in regular and premium (i.e. IMAX, RPX, Dolby) theaters starting Oct. 22. It will also be on HBO Max. It recently had its United States premiere at the 59th New York Film Festival."
"Oct 8, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune is a spectacular time in the theater. Villeneuve's craft is on full display, as he effortlessly combines a brilliant cast with top tier visuals. What an experience."
"Oct 8, 2021",POSITIVE,"Both technologically innovative and narratively faithful to the original text, Villeneuve's Dune is bolstered by its seamless special effects and star power above all else."
"Oct 8, 2021",POSITIVE," The strangest thing about Denis Villeneuve’s Dune—or Dune: Part One, as it’s titled on screen—is not anything that happens in the story, or that it took Hollywood so long to re-adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel after the 1984 film by David Lynch. Rather, it’s that a new work based only on a single source can arrive amidst a sea of sequels and shared universes and still feel like it has its tendrils in so many other texts. Dune is enormous in scale, and that enormity is matched by its evocations of a vast and winding history of the Middle East—which is to say, the Middle East that has existed in the Western consciousness for decades, across books, films, video games and other media, all of which have cross-pollinated to create a nebulous identity. The film itself is mostly fine, with breathtaking visuals broken up by a less captivating story that often drags its feet (despite several great performances). But its place within Western traditions—both real and imagined—is strange, unsavory, and fascinating. One of the rare Hollywood films where the story begins even before the studio logos, Dune kicks off with a harsh and mysterious whisper about dreams, before the Warner Bros. water tower slides across the screen. An odd introduction, though one that frames not only the story as a dream of sorts, but perhaps even the film’s making, as a studio product written, developed, budgeted (etcetera) with closed eyes, and heads filled with fantasies about Star Wars, Lawrence of Arabia and Herbet’s novel, side by side with memories of mid-2000s American news broadcasts. These are all distinct entities which share similar aesthetic hallmarks vis-à-vis “the Muslim world,” with varying degrees of verisimilitude. Villeneuve’s film collapses this history—of Western media’s perspective on the Middle East—whether or not it means to. Dune ★★1/2
(2.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Denis Villeneuve
Written by: Jon Spaihts, Denis Villeneuve, Eric Roth
Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson
Running time: 155 mins. The film’s sprawling plot elements are established with more clarity and more panache than in Lynch’s version—action and dialogue stand in for dense exposition, while seeds are planted more carefully along the way, through character interactions. It wastes little time establishing who’s who, from the militaristic House Atreides—Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), their firm but kindly leader, his love Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of a secret matronly order, and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), a prince who searches for purpose and appears to dream of the future—to the desert planet Arrakis, where most of the action unfolds. Also known as “Dune,” the planet is littered with giant sand worms, populated by Bedouin-coded locals called the Fremen, and mined by colonial forces for a spice, “melange,” that’s part drug, part intergalactic fuel. The details are mostly unimportant, outside of knowing that an unseen Emperor has granted House Atreides the right to mine melange, thus replacing the gloomy House Harkonnen, led by a cartoonishly rotund Baron named Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård in an airy fatsuit). The names and concepts date back to Herbert’s books, which were inspired by accounts of mid-19th century wars between Imperial Russia and Muslim tribes in the Caucasus, but over time, Arrakis has stood in for whatever conflict the Western world has wrought on “the desert”—call it prescient, or merely aware of the flow of history. The 1984 film, for instance, was a perfect match for the era’s Afghanistan conflict between American and Soviet forces. In the new version, the minor Fremen character Chani (Zendaya) hints at this dynamic in her opening voiceover. As she explains the recent history of her planet, and the handover of power from the Harkonnens, she wonders not about freedom, but about which colonial powers will rule them next. In this vein, Dune: Part One is mapped onto the post-9/11 “forever wars.” Little in the plot needs to change for this to happen but some of the designs are tweaked specifically for this parallel, like the interiors of the bug-like helicopters, which closely resemble modern U.S. military equipment. Atreides’ weapons master Gurney Halleck feels plucked out of a modern Hollywood war film, between his gung-ho bloodlust and the tough presence of Josh Brolin, who Villeneuve previously cast as a CIA operative in 2015’s Sicario. The general attitude of House Atreides towards the Fremen is one of othership and disdain, unless of course someone like Duke Leto wants to harness their strategic power. It’s an obvious and not altogether terrible approach to critiquing American militarism, but it soon breaks down in amusing fashion, when the father-son duo is revealed to have been coaxed into colonizing Arrakis, summoning forth the pervasive lie about the Bush administration being fooled into invading Iraq. Is it a stretch to draw such a comparison? Yes, and no. On one hand, the plot of Dune existed for nearly 40 years before the aforementioned events. On the other, such volatile subject matter is never far from the production’s mind, and the movie is, by its very nature, part of a larger history wherein images and stories about the Middle East are contorted, not only as a means to comment on the region, but to reaffirm the West’s conception of itself. The blue-eyed, golden-haired Luke Skywalker was once a victim of the ruthless “Sand People,” monsters draped in Bedouin garb, and his heroism was partially established in contrast to their villainy. These optics exist all across western sci-fi, and while Dune: Part Two may eventually subvert them, Part One plays like an unapologetic fixture of that legacy. Lawrence of Arabia served as a partial inspiration for Herbet, so the story of T.E. Lawrence—a real person with real experiences—becomes watered down and takes the shape of Paul Atreides, who similarly wears desert clothing with the culturally appropriate fit, presaging his entrance into Fremen culture as their Western savior. However, unlike Lawrence, who travelled and studied extensively, Paul’s familiarity with Fremen customs is despite him having spent no time at all with the locals, who feature only briefly in the film, and are a mostly homogenous bunch, whose faces are obscured behind their keffiyeh. Most of what we learn about them in Part One is their combat rituals, and their prophecy that paves the way for the heroic ascendancy of the clairvoyant Paul, like a white Prophet Muhammad hearing the word of God.  Perhaps the presence of more Middle Eastern actors might have helped balance some of this iffy-ness, but Hollywood has created few Middle Eastern stars despite making the region a frequent setting for the last 20 years, so it has a built-in excuse. Besides, Dune (much like Aladdin) isn’t exactly the kind of story that can be decoupled from its permeating orientalism, without which it would barely exist. However, while the characters and dialogue always circle this ugly dynamic, the film is actually at its most thematically effective when cinema’s otherwise most useful tools—people’s faces and their words—are removed entirely. Dune is spellbinding when it captures architecture shaped by oblique light, sleek ships gliding across an unforgiving desert, and enormous industrial machines extracting natural resources from beneath the sand. At 155 minutes in length, the film has plenty of room for such scenes, where individual characters are no longer the focus, and the terrain tells its own story.  These images echo, more directly and more powerfully, the central conceit of colonial forces sucking a culture dry. Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser speak volumes with the way they portray scale, with human beings and their airships being dwarfed by these extraction devices, and the devices in turn looking minuscule and insignificant when the desert (via those gigantic sand worms) eventually strikes back and returns things to their natural order.  If there’s a cut of Dune: Part One that’s all establishing and wide shots, it would probably play like a sci-fi remix of documentaries by Ron Fricke or Godfrey Reggio. It would also avoid silliness like composer Hans Zimmer—whose percussions are certainly propulsive—accompanying every third close up of Paul with vocals bordering ululating. Or the sloppiness of coding House Atreides as a Western military power while dressing their women in vaguely Middle Eastern clothes. Or the disappointment of carefully choreographed hand-to-hand fights lacking any real weight or impact (Jason Momoa’s energy notwithstanding, as Paul’s fantastically named mentor Duncan Idaho). Almost every tangible fixture pales in comparison to the film’s haunting atmosphere, from the way its interior and exterior locations envelope the senses, to the way its premonitions create a haunting tapestry of pictures and ideas. These visions don’t quite work when they portray entire scenes, which have little bearing on this half of the story, but when Paul straddles the line of consciousness, these moments become fleeting and ethereal, as they portray impressionistic hints of people and events—or even design elements, like desert sandals or scarves twisting in the wind, brief shots which strip the film’s exoticism of displeasurable context, and briefly transform it into something dreamlike and inviting. That is, until the two-part saga’s awkward and tensionless midpoint jolts you awake. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Oct 8, 2021",POSITIVE," This beginning has no end. Which may sound gnomic, but is simply the God’s honest truth. Director Denis Villeneuve, attempting to create what some say is impossible, (a popular film that does justice to Frank Herbert’s sprawling yet intricate sci-fi saga), decided the 1965 classic could not be contained by a single movie and has plans to shoot a Dune Part 2. But Warners have yet to greenlight that project. If enough people go to see Dune, it’ll happen. Think of this as an interactive endeavour. We, the audience, are about to be woven into the myth. Villeneuve, (who, back in 2016, made Arrival, one of the most tender and jolting sci-fis ever) knew from the start he wanted Timothée Chalamet to play the part of high-born, idealistic teen, Paul Atreides. The film, amongst other things, is an ode to Chalamet’s subtle charisma. And, aside from one bout of uncalled-for nostril flaring, the 25-year-old actor is magnificent. Androgyny is his thing and, in many of the tight close-ups, he’s as pretty as the young Elizabeth Taylor. Decked out in a long coat and boots, he also resembles a willowy, raven-haired version of Saint Exupery’s Little Prince. If you adore tenacious girly-boys (and what sensible person doesn’t?), your heart, while you watch Dune, will never stop skipping. As the film begins, Paul’s father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac; ace), is handed a poisoned chalice. He’s put in charge of a sandy planet, Arrakis aka Dune, that’s rich in a coveted, hallucinogenic substance known as Spice melange. Arrakis was once controlled by Leto’s rival, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). The Emperor, a “dangerous, jealous man”, is playing games with his powerful subordinates. By the time Leto, Paul and Paul’s mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson; brittle, angsty and SO sexy) arrive on Arrakis, it’s clear forces are at work to undermine the house of Atreides. Paul - who has inherited supernatural gifts from his mum - has dreams that foreshadow death and destruction, but also hope, in the form of cool young rebel, Chani (Zendaya; scrumptiously defiant). She’s a member of a dark-skinned, blue-eyed Arrakis tribe, called the Fremens. Might an alliance between Paul and the Fremens be in the offing? David Lynch’s 1984 take on Herbert’s book was famously full of information dumps. And the lead characters all looked like they’d just stepped out of a salon. Here, by contrast, the dialogue feels light and airy and the harried humans are perfectly in sync with the surreal sandscapes. Every voluptuous dune has substance as well as style. Villeneuve and his cinematographer use all sorts of fancy aspect ratios. What this means is that your eyes constantly feel as if they’re being stretched in crazy directions. It’s far out, even before Paul, in a helicopter, reacting to air-borne Spice, hears voices telling him to go with the flow and experiences an ecstatic kind of free-fall that some will view as spiritually transcendent and I’d call “well druggy”. A matador motif also works beautifully. At one point, a major character, whose father was a fan of the red cape, sits draped in a chair, looking like a dying bull. He’s naked (only a table corner spares us the sight of his crotch) and, once seen, this bizarre image is hard to shift. Cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who once tried to turn Herbert’s book into a 14-hours of mind-blowing footage, would surely approve. This movie, in case you can’t tell, was made for the big screen. Watching it on a small screen would be like eating ice-cream in a sauna. Does Dune work as a family movie? Kids raised on Star Wars may be frustrated by the fact that the plentiful fight scenes mostly take place on solid ground. George Lucas and J.J. Abrams had fun with the dark spaces between planets. Here, the liveliest encounters take place in Arrakis, in the blazing sunshine. Still, young’uns will appreciate the fact that when warriors get hit, their limbs light up like arcade machines. They’ll also enjoy twinkly-eyed, super-loyal Atreides aide Duncan (Jason Momoa; entrusted with the film’s best quips), along with tantalising shots of sandworms (think elephant trunks, crossed with field mushrooms) and an adorably big-eared desert mouse. Purists will want to know if Villeneuve has taken liberties with the text. The answer is: just a few. Jessica was always powerful - she’s big mates with a group of frosty, psychic nuns. But, here, she gets to engage in her own bit of ritual combat. Another change: planetologist Kynes, a man and part of the colonial mission, in the novel, now has a deliciously sly smile and a powerful fist. As brought to life by Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Kynes is one of Dune’s highlights. Peter Jackson was wrong to divide The Hobbit into three parts. Villeneuve was quite right to break up Dune, though it does cause a few problems. Herbert didn’t buy into the superman myth, quite the opposite, and the novel ends on the most ambiguous of notes. But the first half of the book definitely encourages us to view Paul as a great hope. As a result, what we see, in these 155 minutes, is somewhat low on twists and (if you know nothing about the book) actively misleading. Villeneuve describes Herbert’s novel as his “bible” and Villeneuve, himself, as far as many sci-fi fans are concerned, walks on water. At the risk of sounding like a heretic, I think it’s too soon to declare this enterprise divine. But I was gripped, throughout, and I definitely want there to be a Part 2."
"Oct 4, 2021",NEGATIVE," There are many reasons why Dune is considered the greatest science fiction novel ever written. A few of them might be why non-readers watching Denis Villeneuve's $165 million part-one adaptation will find aspects of its intergalactic plot, messianic themes and warring characters somewhat similar to established films like Star Wars, Stargate or The Matrix. Frank Herbert's seminal book, first published in 1965, walked so many future sci-fi properties could run. But Dune is not a novel to be adapted lightly. The foundational mythology, ecology, theology, politics, philosophy and history late author Frank Herbert borrowed and rebuilt into this Universe, set 20,000 years in the future, is so dense that copies come with several appendices and a glossary of terms to guide readers. His epic fantasy is set in the year 10191 on a hostile desert planet called Arrakis, where noble Houses battle each other and the native warrior-people over the control of spice, the most valuable element in their society known as the Old Imperium. He positions the contextual minutiae less in the dialogue and more in the narration; in the mood, tone and rhythm; in Herbert's vast descriptions of this futuristic environment and the diverse people who inhabit it. Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to adapt the book and failed when his unmade 1970s film proved too expensive, too long and he too much of a risk for studios to help him realise his expansive dream. David Lynch succeeded in 1984 but his completely white-washed adaptation felt overstuffed even though it offered various moments of camp excellence. But Dune's latest foray onto the big screen should earn Villeuneuve some applause. Timothee Chalamet takes the lead as Paul Atreides, the heir of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), head of a respected dynasty, and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit, a matriarchal order with superhuman abilities which she has long been teaching her son. When the Padishah Emperor takes control of Arrakis away from Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and gives it to Duke Leto, a new conflict emerges. House Atreides must relocate to the desert planet and find a way to secure their survival by convincing the Fremen, the secretive and fearsome native population, to join powers against their former oppressors. The Harkonnens’ diabolical plot soon takes hold and forces Paul and his mother into hiding amongst the dunes, where giant sandworms roam and his prescient powers manifest to reveal a foreboding future. The execution of several action set-pieces is brutal and gripping. A stillness engulfs one scene where a team of Sardaukar - the Padishah Emperor’s soldier-fanatics - land at an abandoned scientific site previously occupied by Fremen warriors. The place is empty until the natives rise up out of the sand to attack their foe. Later, Jason Momoa’s swashbuckling Duncan Idaho takes on a band of Sardaukar himself in a fretful yet fiercely choreographed corridor fight sequence. The granular detail of Villeneuve’s world-building is often breathtaking. From the dragonfly-esque ornithopters and the ominous costuming of the Fascist-esque military to the frequent bull-fighting motifs and the recurring appearance of a desert mouse, book fans have plenty of references to Muad'dib and his ancestry to enjoy. The artistic application of CGI has allowed the sandworms to be realised majestically; their ferocious teeth-filled mouths dilate like an all-seeing eye while textured sound-mixing makes their travel under and through the dunes, causing sand to grandly displace, mirror waves crashing on a choppy ocean. Wide shots convey the full devastating destruction raining down on Arrakis like fire and brimstone. Han Zimmer’s score adds to this oppressive quality. At moments it’s a strain to hear key bits of dialogue, but it is as much of a living, breathing character as any of the cast. Drums function like a heartbeat murmuring with intense anticipation while the layered use of the human voice, God’s perfect instrument, so to speak, reinforces the overt religious symbolism in this story about a young man engineered to become an omnipotent prophet and the catalyst for a new feudal power structure. The script does well to lay the groundwork for this scheme which tees up Herbert’s overarching anti-messiah message. Along with pointed narration by Chani (Zendaya), a young Fremen woman Paul often dreams about, and clever exposition scenes reminiscent of those audio guides you get at museums, the basic bones of this complex plot can be understood. Still, its delivery is overly subdued, with not a significant amount of the story being pushed forward and a lot of character development being skimmed over. Of course, Chalamet’s teen chosen one is the lynchpin and he certainly looks the part. The actor reveals small flourishes of Paul’s personality and emotional rigour, but more often than not, he looks dead behind the eyes and unable to convey much of the internal confusion, turmoil, affection even, that is taking place on his tumultuous journey of self-discovery. But the most overriding issue, for this critic at least, is the total lack of significant Middle Eastern and North African representation in the cast despite the very clear influence of MENA, Islamic and Arab culture on the desert planet and this universe in the original book and this film. I’ve written before about the importance of Fremen characters being played by MENA actors not least because their language is mostly made up of Arabic words, like “Mahdi'' (‘the rightly guided one”) and “Lisan al Gaib” (“the voice from the outer world”), respectively. Though it's notable that jihad, the phrase frequently used in the book, has now been replaced with ""crusade"" and ""holy war"".  One can easily observe the Bedouin and Amazigh inspiration behind this nomadic community on the page and the screen, through the Fremen’s penchant for Keffiyeh, group feeling unity and strength in their ability to survive in such a dangerous environment. These ideas, as well as the cyclical nature of dynasties and civilisations, were reflected in Tunisian sociologist, philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun’s 14th Century book of Islamic History, “The Muqaddimah”, which underpinned much of Herbert’s sci-fi series. Then there’s the fact Villeneuve shot most of Arrakis in Arab countries; Jordan’s Wadi Rum and Abu Dhabi in the UAE provided the vast beauty and brutality of this fictional desert planet landscape. The pale, flat-roofed buildings of Arrakeen, the planet’s seat of power which, in the book, was transferred from the city of Carthag (sound familiar?) under Harkonnen rule, is reminiscent of North African architecture. If the overarching storyline about Imperialist colonisers stealing a powerful fuel from the native population doesn't remind you of a certain 20th Century Western conflict with the Middle East, the Knights Templar colour scheme of the Sardaukar certainly hints at a 12th Century one. A holy war no less! With all this rich, Maghrebi and Middle Eastern culture, aesthetic and historical references on display, once again I must ask: where are the significant MENA actors? Dune is a complex novel with complex characters who toe the line between good and bad. There are no real heroes and motivations are often dicey so these people exist in the grey area of morality with Fremen characters like Stilgar and Chani still among the more admirable figures. What an opportunity it would have been to cast the likes of Egyptian actor Amr Waked or French-Algerian actress Lyna Khoudri in these roles. The rest of the Fremen - those whose faces aren't masked and have speaking roles - are made up of actors of Guyanese, West or East African heritage. This wouldn’t be a problem at all if there were at least some MENA actors to reflect the diversity of that region which Villeunueve claims to care so much about and admitted to using as inspiration: “I feel true that I’m right in doing it this way. It feels authentic, it feels honest and true to the book.” No, Denis. It’s corruption; one that erases the Middle East and North from MENA and which, mostly, only people of our heritage will care about. We’re used to being vilified, maligned or erased on screen. We’re used to having most of our representation in Hollywood limited to plane hijacking or suicide bombing or perverted sheikhs or refugees or having non-MENA actors replacing us in our own stories. Like Dwayne Johnson who is playing Black Adam, the first MENA superhero character to get his own solo movie. Can you imagine the outrage if The Rock was cast as Black Panther? Or Shang-Chi? People wouldn’t stand for it. But in a post-9/11 world where Arabs and Islam are still considered too dangerous and foreign to pass the racial profiling in studio boardrooms and casting call discrimination, too taboo to be given the same equal opportunities for positive or nuanced representation as other ethnic minorities are now slowly beginning to benefit from, must we continue to wait and bittersweetly watch films like Dune that take but do not give back? Villeneuve has certainly achieved the grand scale of his vision, and truly other blockbuster franchises should take note of his artistic attention to detail. It’s just a shame that vital elements of the story, character building and MENA representation have been lost in his translation.

"Oct 2, 2021",POSITIVE," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzCanadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”/”Siccario”) bravely directs Frank Herbert’s so-called “unfilmable” sci-fi novel classic, a remake of David Lymch’s 1984 film (receiving mixed reviews and a miss at the box office) and a follow-up to the documentary on it by Alejandro Jodorowksy. This version gets it right, as it films it in a dream-like version. It’s co-written by the director, Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts.It tells in a stunning way a mythical sci-fi tale of the desert planet Arrakis and the clan it must fight to survive.In the year 10191, the supreme ruler of the Imperium is Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV. Under him are several conflicting Houses, each having their own ruling family. We are kept informed of developments by the narration of a blue-eyed female warrior native Fremen, Chani (Zendaya), as the hostile desert planet of Arrakis (Dune) is under the rule of the evil House Harkonnen and its ruthless and corrupt leader Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård). The desert planet is the only place in the world that produces an invaluable “spice,” a healing product with hallucinogenic powers, that also is used as a rocket fuel, the only kind in existence, needed for interstellar travel. But the Harkkonens are venal and destroyers of the land, and are at war with the Fremen, the native population, who for safety flee to live in caverns under the sand.Other problems on the desert planet is that it’s extremely hot (almost unlivable) and the place’s vibrations bring out dangerous sandworms that impede the spice production, which results in the employment of a complex system of harvesting.Because Dune is mismanaged and floundering, the Emperor appoints from the ocean planet Caladan the compassionate Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) to replace the House Harkonnen as rulers. Duke Leto ties to get a peace between the former rulers and the natives, but gets instead a civil war which probably means his House of Atreides will fall to the House of Harkonnen unless it can figure a way to beat them in battle.Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), Duke Leto’s brilliant son and heir, who possesses superhuman mental powers inherited from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and is also a martial arts and swordplay expert, arrives on the Dune hoping to be the heroic messiah-like figure needed to save his people and the world.The film ends on an inconclusive note as the House Harkonnen battle to take back the planet and its profitable “spice” harvesting business.

"Sep 27, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune is visually fantastic, with an excellent direction by Denis Villeneuve and an immersive soundtrack. One of the best films of the year. A must see in theaters, a wonderful experience. We want more. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Sep 25, 2021",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert’s novel is one of the most influential works of science fiction — and one of the most unadaptable, the kind of uniquely sprawling epic that has broken many great filmmakers, from Alejandro Jodorowsky to David Lynch.  Yet, Denis Villeneuve’s epic space opera finally offers Dune the adaptation it always deserved, preserving the novel’s complex lore — as well as its political threads — and delivering a narrative as giddily entertaining as the original Star Wars.  Yes, the rumors are true: This is only half the story laid out by Herbert’s novel. But against all odds, Denis Villeneuve made a film that feels complete, even as it had this writer salivating for Part Two as soon as the credits rolled. For those unfamiliar with the books, Dune is set in the far, far future, when the known universe is ruled by a feudal-like system of great houses. They are led by an all-powerful emperor whose power depends on the “spice melange.” This naturally produced narcotic enables everything from faster-than-light travel to the prolonging of lives for the rich and powerful to extraordinary mental powers for a select few. The only place in the universe this psychotropic spice is harvested is the inhospitable planet Arrakis, where House Atreides has been sent under orders from the Emperor to serve as the planet's stewards. Broadly, Dune follows Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), heir to House Atreides and son of Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), who sees his family attacked by treacherous enemies and is forced to wander Arrakis in order to survive. The Fremen, indigenous inhabitants of Arrakis, speak of an ancient prophecy waiting to be fulfilled, and Paul learns his destiny is amid the planet’s unwelcoming, unforgiving sand dunes. The best compliment one can give Dune is that it doesn't feel like a two-and-a-half-hour epic, though it certainly looks like one. Villeneuve, whose visual sensibilities have been formidably established by serious-minded sci-fi epics like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, brings the same weight and solemnity to this film’s pacing and visuals. Dune is a dense, at times inaccessible story with long stretches of silence and myriad establishing shots of the desert; its story unfolds meticulously and without haste. But such an approach is necessary to convey the grand sense of scale in Dune, not to mention the intricate political, cultural, religious, ecological, and social systems interconnecting within Herbert’s story.  The unique tone of Dune serves another purpose, as the film seeks to establish itself as a new franchise player in the crowded fantasy sphere. As if to position the film as a new Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, Villeneuve spends much of the runtime enticing his audience to invest in this strange new world, luxuriating in rich details and moving the story through cultures and locations that all feel marvelously distinct from one another.  With magnificent costumes and sets that follow geometric designs in ways both futuristic and curiously ancient, Villeneuve’s Dune is impressively unique in its world-building. More than mere WWII-era fighter jets in space, the film turns spaceships, for example, into unusually round edifices that could have been drawn from an Apple designer’s sketchbook. And remember when Rogue One introduced the largest number of planets ever seen in a Star Wars movie, yet they all felt identical save for different climates? Dune doesn't have that problem. From Arrakis to Caladan to Giedi Prime, each new location's climate informs everything about its civilizations, as architecture, color palettes, and set decor all foreground the filmmakers’ dazzling imagination. Giedi Prime appears born of an H. R. Giger nightmare, while the hellish deserts of Arrakis inform not only the kinds of vehicles and wardrobes used to survive constant sand storms and scorching heat but also the ways its inhabitants behave and what customs they follow.  There is certainly something to be said about the way Dune (both the movie and the book) appropriates Arab and Islamic culture, history, and symbolism to tell the story of Paul, who belongs to neither culture, but the film at least draws a clear, distinct line between how the Fremen act and the unbowed, unbent, unbroken nature of Arrakis itself, showcasing a crucial nuance within the worlds it depicts.  Of course, one cannot write about Dune and not mention its iconic sandworms; this film does them justice. These enormous beasts are treated more like the shark in Jaws, used sparingly but effectively in order to heighten a sense of dread and tension. The excellent sound design and cinematography make small tremblings in the sand evoke those cups of water rippling in Jurassic Park. Hans Zimmer delivers yet another rousing score that mixes grandiose and operatic sounds with a surprising rock style, lending Dune a unique sonic palette to match its visuals. Even with an ensemble cast as large and impressive as the one on display in this film, Dune finds the time to give every character screen time, whether it's Oscar Isaac's stoic Duke, Stellan Skarsgård's genuinely scary Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, or Rebecca Ferguson's enigmatic and remorseful Lady Jessica.  Without a doubt, however, this movie belongs to Jason Momoa’s intrepid Duncan Idaho and Timothée Chalamet's soldiering Paul. Momoa's Duncan showcases the terrifying battle strength of Khal Drogo, though Duncan is also roguish and playful in the vein of Han Solo. He delights himself by fighting like a demon, yet this version of the character is also a fun, warm presence whose close bond with Paul is grounded in sincere affection.  Meanwhile, Chalamet gives arguably the best performance of his young career as Paul. Subtle and subdued, maintaining a stoic and regal demeanor before strangers but quietly breaking down in front of those he trusts, this is a young man who understands the burden of being a chosen one. He knows the path of his hero's journey will be paved in the blood of others. Indeed, Dune interrogates the idea of a “messiah” in a way no other genre movie of this scale has, focusing less on the actual person than on the concept of an ""anointed one"" and what belief in such a figure can do to a group of people. Villeneuve made a film that tells a complete story, though it ends on a cliffhanger that can be taken as an invitation to riot, should Part Two fail to materialize. This is not, however, an Avengers: Infinity War-style ending, closing out during a second act. Instead, Dune feels more like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, a story that clearly had more to give but still delivered a satisfying conclusion to its first chapter. We would be missing out on plenty if Part Two never comes to be, but Part One is still a saga worth watching and rewatching. More than anything, Dune feels like the start of a story that will soon become the stuff of sci-fi filmmaking legend."
"Sep 22, 2021",POSITIVE," by Walter Chaw I couldn’t get through the Lord of the Rings trilogy when I was a kid, but I devoured Frank Herbert’s Dune in a fever and read it again immediately. I have a tactile memory of it. Mostly, I was haunted by the frequent use of passages from the diaries, histories, and philosophies of one Princess Irulan, inserted throughout the text to give the book’s story a sense of lost time, immense. I wouldn’t experience this feeling reading something again until years later when I finally got into Proust, this thing where you read it in the present, but the text is irretrievably past. You’ve arrived at the dock, but the ferry, impossibly beautiful and decked out with incomprehensible pleasures and mysteries, has left, and it’s not coming back. Princess Irulan opens the book by warning us not to be deceived by its hero, Paul, having spent the first fourteen years of his life on a planet called “Caladan”–that his story is inextricable from the fate of a place called “Arrakis.” It reminds me of the many epitaphs for T.E. Lawrence. Herbert told his son that he left multiple threads unresolved in Dune so its readers would want to revisit it–return obsessively to it to follow different paths, suggestions, prophecies. I think it’s why I’ve read four or five of the subsequent Dune novels only once and retained so little of the stories they tell and the answers they provide. It’s like Arthur C. Clarke’s sequels to his 2001: A Space Odyssey novelization: I don’t actually want to know what’s inside the Monolith. I didn’t understand Dune as a political allegory when I read it as a child. Nor did I understand it as either a criticism of colonialism or, contrariwise, a paternal white-saviour defense of colonialism. I didn’t trace it back to Rachel Carson’s groundbreaking 1962 environmental study Silent Spring as a cautionary eco-horror tale. I didn’t know that the language Herbert invented for the Fremen, the “native” residents of a desert planet, Arrakis, modelled on Arabian Bedouin, was cobbled together from Arabic, Navajo, Finnish, Russian, Old English, Turkish, Romani, Serbo-Croat, and Aztec. In Denis Villeneuve’s new adaptation, he even adds Mandarin in place of what Herbert describes as a “Northwest Caucasion” language called “Chakobsa,” mentioned mainly in a 1960 book called The Sabres of Paradise. It’s said to be a language exclusive to royalty. When I heard the Mandarin in Dune Part One (hereafter Dune)–where and how it’s used–the feeling for me of being included in this, one of my true foundational texts, was exquisitely, uniquely devastating. Add to its impact how it’s spoken by an actor, 張震, who is the star of A Brighter Summer Day, a film that provides for me a bridge to the Taiwan of my uncle’s and my father’s youth. 張震 gives Dr. Wellington Yueh, one of the arch villains of my childhood’s imagination, a level of pathos I couldn’t have imagined. Can I disentangle my reaction to him and this film from the emotional payload of his representational importance to me in this context? Nope. There are representational opportunities presented by this Dune painfully squandered as well. One should fairly expect that a film set in the desert and revolving around colonial forces battling over its invaluable natural resource at the expense of its native inhabitants would have a greater Arab presence in its cast. The primary representatives of the Fremen are Spanish actor Javier Bardem and American Zendaya. There are excuses for this, but I’m not going to make them. I will say that I no longer trust white people to adapt white properties and, in the process of adapting them, to make problematic things written in 1965 something to suddenly be championed and celebrated. I used to wish that Star Wars would honour its Asian roots in its central saga. Now I’m glad it didn’t bother. Keep it. Toshiro Mifune was right when he let Alec Guinness play Obi-Wan Kenobi. The end result of white people attempting “representation” is Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The core is white. The core will always be white. Dune is a well-meaning “Islamaphilic” piece that treats the Fremen as idealized “Free Men”–the way we treat Native Americans as Children of the Earth imbued with a mystical connection to the planet given to arcane rituals and notions of civil discourse. Stilgar (Bardem), when first meeting his new colonial steward, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), spits on the ground as a sign of honour. For desert people, you see, the sharing of moisture is a demonstration of respect. I don’t see much benefit in asking an Arab actor to represent his culture as strange and disgusting. For the uninitiated looking to make literal sense of it all, Dune is going to be tough, though what Villeneuve has done, brilliantly, is to offer up its Byzantine exposition as background noise to a flow of epic and at times overwhelming imagery. David Lynch’s cult classic interprets the book’s impenetrable genealogies and palace intrigues as a Keseyian Kool-Aid acid test of body horror and costume camp. I like both approaches, bolstered by a genuine love of the source material’s grand-bordering-on-bloated operatic pretension. (Fans of George R.R. Martin have no room to criticize Herbert’s relatively clean prose.) For this adaptation, however, find something akin to Visconte’s The Damned, a film released a few years after Dune was published that follows the fates and fortunes of a doomed family of wealthy industrialists who, after losing their patriarch along with his wife and children, fall into hedonism, betrayal, and madness. More than its broad thematic similarities, note how Villeneuve’s expansive style mirrors Visconte’s, with both artists exploring the corruption of the aristocracy (see also: Visconte’s The Leopard) as a process of progressive rot and florid, moral decay. In Dune, Duke Leto has been given the desert planet of Arrakis in order to, ostensibly, oversee the mining of the Spice “Melange,” whose hallucinogenic qualities make hyperspace travel possible. An obvious analogue to oil, although it was not obvious to me as a kid. Instead, I have always thought of the “Spice” as opium–the addictive, society-destroying bogeyman of stories my dad used to tell me about how the British stole Hong Kong from us. Duke Leto goes to Arrakis with his family in tow: wife Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a priestess in a powerful religious sect called the Bene Gesserit, and his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). They are surrounded by attendants and bodyguards–military leaders, philosophers, ambassadors, academics, all there in support of Duke Leto’s first order of business, i.e., to build a coalition with Arrakis’s Fremen population. Their home on the planet is Arrakeen, a city-state recently left by the ruthless Harkonnens, led by the grotesque Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew, Rabban (Dave Bautista). The Harkonnens are not happy to have lost the post, but what the offscreen emperor wants, the offscreen emperor gets. Duke Leto sends the master of his guard, Duncan (Jason Momoa), ahead of him to infiltrate the Fremen and gain their trust. And then one night, the Emperor, who is distinguished by his excess, reveals how this “gift” of Arrakis for Duke Leto and his House is a means for him to eradicate a faction he finds threatening. When I first read this book, I had never at that time encountered anything that was so willing to assassinate major characters. When the dust settles, what’s left is Paul in the desert with Jessica and his dreams, which are, one by one, becoming prophecy. Of all the things I didn’t expect to see in Dune, it’s a series of direct references to Antonioni’s Red Desert in Paul’s “awakening.” Sufficed to say that my copy of Dune is 521 pages. This film ends around page 316. There’s too much plot in Dune and it’s to Villeneuve’s credit that rather than pare it all away, he presents it as Kazuo Ishiguro presents the birth of the twentieth century: via the butler Stevens’s perception of it in the employ of Lord Darlington. That is to say, as whispers in the halls, heavy intimations, bloody portents and their brutal outcomes. Empires rise and fall while the centre, a perfectly-poured cup of tea, holds. It’s the minute details of Dune that Villeneuve absolutely nails. The way the spines on a tiny drone ruffle up like the hackles on a dog. The way the Ornithopters are exactly like helicopters, had the creators of helicopters been more literal. The way the massive sandworms, attracted to rhythmic noises at odds with the constant shifting/slithering of Arrakis’s particulate surface, emerge like divine judgement, their maws the vaginal leviathans of Freudian nightmares. Each attempt at Dune (save the miniseries, which makes the mistake of trying to be Kenneth Branagh’s Hamlet rather than Michael Almereyda’s)–Lynch’s, Jodorowsky’s aborted version, now Villeneuve’s–has taken on the problem of how best to evoke the feeling of reading Dune. This one, finally, is exactly how it feels. Villeneuve’s film is ineffably strange and shockingly familiar. Look at the dials in the Ornithopters, which resemble Jimmy Stewart’s panel of gears and clicking meters in The Spirit of St. Louis; or the mini-projector that teaches Paul about the history and customs of Arrakis; or Baron Harkonnen’s oil bath, during which Villeneuve and his incredible cinematographer Greig Fraser (Bright Star) focus not on the abomination, but on the way the liquid’s surface refracts light and coalesces in bubbles and whorls."
"Sep 22, 2021",POSITIVE," Take one multi-book fantasy and add one film-maker with a cult following. The result, 20 years ago, produced the massively popular The Lord Of The Rings trilogy (2001 to 2003). That recipe is again tested in this adaptation of the first of Frank Herbert's Dune space fantasy novels from the 1960s to 1970s about warring families, giant worms and a drug that sounds like space opium - all operating within a galactic empire. This movie, the first of a planned franchise, performs the key task of world-building with stylish efficiency. Much of its 150-minute-plus run time is spent on a show-and-tell of the massive chess board and its pieces. It is a daunting job. Not only is there a need to explain who is who in each feuding aristocratic family, the disposition of their military and their religious beliefs - which include a Chosen One doctrine and the order of priestesses that uphold it - but there is also a rundown of the ecology and human cultures found on the key locale, the sand-strewn planet of Arrakis. French Canadian director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve gets the job done without resorting to voice-over or text crawls, nor getting bogged down in self-indulgent minutiae. The elegance of his potted socio-economic overview makes the exposition behind Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace (1999) look as clear as mud. His clan, on the emperor's orders, is about to take over stewardship of Arrakis, the only source of spice, the stuff that prolongs life and makes faster-than-light travel possible. House Harkonnen, the former stewards, are unwilling to take their hands off the money faucet that is spice. The film ends inconclusively, with sequels expected to pick up the pieces. Villeneuve, known for ""big ideas"" science fiction - he directed 2016's alien-contact movie Arrival and 2017's android-Pinocchio story Blade Runner 2049 - adapts Herbert's sand-and-spaceships fantasy with his trademark minimalist approach. For example, supporting characters, such as Taiwanese actor Chang Chen's Dr Wellington Yueh, a healer in House Atreides, have had their stories pared to the bone. Villeneuve prefers that his ships move at a stately parade speed, or not at all. In colour and texture, the craft, largely unlit and windowless, look as if they were carved from granite. Instead of bizarre pets or fish-headed officers, he believes, correctly, that there is enough otherworldly visual stimulation in the grotesque visage of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). The sandworms, meanwhile, get a whole Jaws-style entrance. Paul's Chosen One coming-of-age journey is the dullest section of the film, largely because it is today impossible to find a fresh way to flog this dead horse of a young-adult genre story thread. Villeneuve, to his credit, deals with it by being brisk - what might have been Paul's tedious process of denial, grief and acceptance has been skimmed."

"Sep 20, 2021",POSITIVE," “This is just the beginning,” one character says two and a half hours into Dune, just a couple of minutes before the end credits. It’s a line that plays like a hard sell—or maybe a plea?—for a sequel that, technically, hasn’t even been green-lit yet. No matter what happens in No Time to Die, we know that James Bond Will Return. But what about Paul Atreides?  “I would not agree to make this adaptation of the book as one single movie,” Denis Villeneuve said in a recent Vanity Fair feature on the long-gestating creation of Dune. The sentiment dates back to 2018, when the filmmaker chose the project over helming the latest 007 entry, but a lot has gone down since then, including a very public dustup between Villeneuve and Warner Bros. over the studio’s decision to simultaneously release Dune on HBO Max. “Since the dawn of time,” Villeneuve mused in an angry open letter to Variety, “human beings have deeply needed communal storytelling experiences … no matter what any Wall Street dilettante says.” It takes some hubris to actually use the phrase “since the dawn of time” in an op-ed, and also to position oneself as a guardian of cinema’s eternal flame. Like his fellow celluloid warrior Christopher Nolan, Villeneuve could be accused of having delusions of grandeur. But also like Nolan, he has a knack for putting that grandeur on screen (provided he’s well subsidized by Wall Street dilettantes) and has shown a willingness to bring his movies to the masses.  At this point, the healthy box office grosses of titles like Old and Shang-Chi suggest there’s still a multiplex choir to preach to, and Dune has enough stars (from Timothée Chalamet to Dave Bautista to Jason Momoa) and a big enough built-in fan base to at least make a dent in its expensive production cost. The fact that it’s also pretty good as a big-ticket spectacle  also helps. Still, there’s something daring, and maybe even terrifying, about a $165 million potential sci-fi franchise tentpole that’s been shot in stand-alone style with narrative loose ends left so precipitously dangling at the end. Imagine if The Empire Strikes Back had been the first entry in the Star Wars series—and if there was no guarantee we’d get Return of the Jedi. Figuring out how to best streamline and segment Frank Herbert’s multigenerational parable—a Cold War–era allegory about rival superpowers battling for control of valuable resources on a vast and barren desert planet—is an authentic challenge, both in terms of storytelling mechanics and the implicit risk of alienating superfans who know the book’s prose by heart. The two previous attempts to bring Dune to the big screen—one by Chilean mystic Alejandro Jodorowsky that was never completed, the other directed under duress by an unenthused and inexperienced David Lynch—were mostly undone by problems of adaptation. (There’s an entire, fascinating documentary about Jodorowsky’s Dune.) Rather than attempting to shoehorn in all of Herbert’s sprawling mythology, replete with familial lore and complex socioeconomic analysis, Villeneuve’s Dune takes a bit of time to set up the necessary palace intrigue and family dynamics before finding its shape as a relentless, propulsive chase movie. The target is Chalamet’s privileged princeling Paul Atreides, heir to the noble title and industrial empire of his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), who gets hunted across the wastelands of Arrakis by the relentless henchmen of a powerful rival aristocrat. It’s a fine line between cliché and archetype, and a decade before George Lucas began raiding Joseph Campbell’s bibliography for Star Wars, Herbert drew inspiration from long-standing myths about young, upwardly mobile male heroism. Paul’s transformation from callow, coddled daddy’s boy to the “Mahdi”—a messianic savior figure destined to liberate Arrakis’s population from exploitation and tyranny—checks all kinds of familiar coming-of-age boxes. That’s the narrative that Lynch’s Dune, despite being beautifully produced and genuinely eccentric, couldn’t quite bring itself to fulfill.  But Lynch has never been a filmmaker to honor conventions, to put it mildly. When he makes a coming-of-age movie with his heart in it, it looks more like Blue Velvet, which also got a better performance out of Kyle MacLachlan. Villeneuve, who started his career with a series of self-consciously stylish French-Canadian films (including the mildly Lynchian Maelstrom) before graduating to Hollywood, is considerably more flexible. Or maybe the word is dutiful. Choose your metaphor, they all apply: If Villeneuve is a hired gun, he’s a crack shot; if he’s an artist, he’s one who colors inside the lines. If there’s a better-made mainstream thriller in the past 10 years than Sicario, I haven’t seen it, but Villeneuve’s immaculate craftsmanship sometimes happens in an intellectual vacuum. Sicario’s sociopolitical vision is as blinkered (and lazy) as its images of violence and desolation are lucid, while the breathably sleazy atmosphere of Prisoners couldn’t overcome the ludicrous convolutions of its screenplay. Given his skill at conveying scale and elevated perspectives—think of the menacing skyline of the excellent, Toronto-set identity-crisis chiller Enemy, or the hovering UFOs of Arrival—Villeneuve was a good pick for the dystopian milieu of Blade Runner 2049. That film earned Roger Deakins a Best Cinematography Oscar for its richly textured tech-noir aesthetic, and on a level of pure technique, Dune is its predecessor’s equal, extending the spacious, blasted-out grandeur of Blade Runner’s Las Vegas sequences. Villeneuve’s Arrakis is blindingly beige, filling the widescreen with more sand per square inch than any movie since Lawrence of Arabia (a movie that Herbert counted among his influences). In lieu of Blade Runner’s incandescent, tech-heavy aesthetic—all crowded streets, beckoning 3D holograms and junky, branded electronic ephemera—Villeneuve and his cinematographer Greig Fraser produce something weirdly timeless, all long horizon lines and cavernous rooms bisected by massive, sculptural shafts of natural light. While the story is set several thousand years in the future, the architecture is retro-Brutalist, suggesting a civilization that’s transcended the need for flashy gadgets or mass media of any kind. Glimpsed at home in their massive palace compound, the Atreides occupy their own hushed, insular world. The question of whether it’s really ethical for the House Atreides to get rich off the export of the precious, life-extending spice indigenous to their new digs is settled indirectly by the fact that their competitor, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgaard), is a diabolical, genocidal monster.  Meanwhile, the tension between the planet’s new white-skinned stewards and its racialized population of “Fremen”—Bedouin-style fighters who skitter on the margins of the action—is collapsed by the prophecy that wan, pale Paul will eventually become their leader.  The discourse around Herbert’s white-savior story line—and any evidence that Villeneuve is interested in tweaking it in either a more subversive or politically correct dimension—is going to mostly have to wait for Dune Part Deux. The relationship between the Atreides and the Fremen is largely limited to Paul’s swoony, come-hither psychic visions of the blue-eyed warrior Chani (Zendaya), who also serves as the story’s narrator (a switch from the novels, which were related by Princess Irulan). By focusing instead on the Fall of the House Atreides, though, Villeneuve unlocks the material’s action-movie potential. The extended mid-film set piece in which Harkonnen’s hordes launch a multipronged attack on Leto’s stronghold in the dead of night is steeped in the kind of queasy, slow-creeping dread that the director has made his trademark. Cutting in between intimate images of home invasion and apocalyptically scaled images of carnage—explosions shot to look like solar flares, fleets of drones flying in fascistic formation—Villeneuve provides the flip side to his skill set as a world builder. It’s hard to remember the last time CGI carnage felt this nightmarish. It’s also hard to remember the last time a movie’s score felt so overbearing and bombastic. To paraphrase one of Herbert’s most famous lines, Hans Zimmer’s music is Dune’s true mind-killer. (Actually, I do remember the last time—it was Tenet; the Nolan-Villeneuve connection deepens.) Whether Villeneuve let Zimmer crank things up to this eardrum-splitting degree because he thought it was the best way to serve his thrilling images or because he didn’t quite trust them is up for debate. Either way, Dune’s lack of musical subtlety announces its creator’s barnstorming intentions.

"Sep 18, 2021",POSITIVE," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel of interstellar colonization and environmental exploitation connects visually and with even more real-world resonance today than in decades past. It demands the biggest screen possible while rewarding close attention to detail. Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel of interstellar colonization and environmental exploitation connects visually and with even more real-world resonance today than in decades past. It demands the biggest screen possible while rewarding close attention to detail. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides with a cool reserve, Peter Howell writes, while Rebecca Ferguson as the Lady Jessica acts as a central figure in a tale otherwise dominated by male characters. Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” adapts Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel of interstellar colonization and environmental exploitation into a blockbuster for the eye, the mind and the now. This commanding and transfixing film, rich in subtext and ripe for modern engagement via the biggest screen possible, is geared to viewers who are already “Dune” fans. Newcomers may want a second look, but they should consider it a pleasure rather than a necessity. Dialogue and plot are lesser concerns in a scene-setting drama that introduces characters in much the way “The Fellowship of the Ring” began “The Lord of the Rings” film trilogy and “A New Hope” launched the original “Star Wars” odyssey. “Dune” covers just the first half of Herbert’s original novel; its full title is “Dune: Part One.” “Dune” isn’t about rocket ships or space travel per se, despite being set on the distant and water-deprived desert planet Arrakis thousands of years in the future. The mechanical meshes with the organic; the most common conveyance is a helicopter that resembles a dragonfly. First and foremost are the fearsome giant sandworms of Arrakis, which appear from beneath the planet’s broiling dirt like blind demons from hell. These toothy behemoths produce a much-prized substance called “spice,” a cinnamon-scented mélange that expands minds, fuels bodies and spacecraft, and sparks battles to seize control between feuding colonial houses Atreides and Harkonnen and Indigenous dune-dwellers known as Fremen. “Dreams are messages from the deep,” reads an ominous note at the outset. Referring to the harrowing and prophetic visions of central figure Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the messianic son of newly appointed Arrakis leader Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and his consort, warrior priestess Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), this poetic snippet is all the guidance you get going into the film. Such brevity, presuming much prior “Dune” knowledge, is a bold move by Villeneuve and his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, considering the density of the source novel’s prose, which has often been deemed “unfilmable” due to its multitude of characters and motivations. (“Star Wars” famously used lengthy opening scrolls to introduce and explain its many chapters.) Two major figures are mostly shadows in this film: the mysterious Padishah Emperor, ruler of the universe; and Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), who is drawn to Paul despite the natural antagonism of Fremen toward the colonial spice raiders. The Emperor remains invisible, although his authority sets in motion the film’s most violent feud, after he controversially orders House Atreides to assume stewardship of Arrakis and its spice fields from rival House Harkonnen. The latter has handsomely profited from spice mining for decades and is reluctant to give it up. Duke Leto is suspicious of the Emperor’s intentions but he loyally moves his family from their bountiful home planet Caladan to accept his new assignment on arid Arrakis. House Harkonnen is ruled by the loathsome Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), a floating gargoyle modelled after Marlon Brando’s bloated Col. Kurtz in “Apocalypse Now.” This is one of many references to classic films that Villeneuve slips into “Dune.” Chani is heard more than seen, beginning near the start of the film as she angrily recounts via voice-over the history of colonial oppression of Arrakis: “They ravage our lands in front of our eyes … Who will our next oppressors be?” The central “Dune” themes about the evils of stealing the land of others and of destroying the natural world are as resonant today as they were in the 1960s, if not more so. Getting to know any of the characters in “Dune” is a challenge, considering how many players enter and exit the stage in a story that might have been better served by a TV miniseries. The main figure of “Dune: Part One” is Paul Atreides, who Chalamet plays with cool reserve, mainly hinting at the hero’s journey to come. Think Luke Skywalker of “Star Wars,” one of the many film and TV properties to be influenced by “Dune.” Jason Momoa plays Duncan Idaho as a brash and charismatic warrior, Peter Howell writes — a portrayal that gives the film a sense of swashbuckling vigour and positions Momoa as the cast member most likely to land an Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor. Villeneuve has chosen to make Ferguson’s Lady Jessica more central to a tale that is otherwise dominated by male characters. She intrigues as both a loyal member of the mysterious Bene Gesserit sisterhood — yet another “Dune” alliance — and a rebel within its ranks, having given birth to a son in defiance of its daughters-only policy. Another cast standout is Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, the brash and charismatic Atreides loyalist tasked with teaching warrior and survival skills to young Paul. Idaho gives “Dune” a real sense of swashbuckling vigour and, as such, seems the cast member most likely to land an Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor. The film itself will likely draw nominations for Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, plus a slew of technical nods. It’s Idaho who suggests the best way to appreciate the look of “Dune,” with its mesmerizing oceans of sand that resemble not just waves of water, but also the icing on an elaborate cake: “It’s beautiful out there!” he roars.

"Sep 18, 2021",POSITIVE," Ever since ""Star Wars"" revolutionized mainstream science-fiction cinema, filmmakers have flooded the genre with various iterations on Joseph Campbell's hero's journey. This repeatable structure known as the monomyth is practically a default style of storytelling now, so commonplace that perceptive viewers can settle into a comfortable, complacent groove within its auspices. Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" fits the model to a T yet accomplishes a new feat by restoring the sense of wonder and awe the hero's journey is meant to inspire. ""Dune"" is technically IP for Warner Bros. given the wealth of material available to adapt from Frank Herbert's sci-fi novels, but it feels nothing like the boardroom blockbusters littering the landscape today. Villeneuve grants extraordinary breathing room in establishing the quest of Timothée Chalamet's Paul Atreides, the burgeoning leader of his aristocratic house primed for planetary governance of Arrakis, a land of sand and spice. Two and a half hours sail by, never once weighed down by a large cast of characters or vast array of universe-specific details. This patience is either not afforded or not seized by any other director working at this scale. The average shot length of ""Dune"" must be two or three times longer than the average studio release but never feels leaden in the slightest. Villeneuve grants his audience time to take in the majesty of futuristic architecture, the intricacy of the imaginative costuming, or the complexity of a reaction to rapidly shifting situations. 
Of course, ""Dune"" has to plow through some exposition dumps at the outset — that's only natural given that Herbert's novel comes with an appended glossary for all the terms he created. But this is ultimately not a barrier to entry given how minimally Villeneuve dwells on the universe's terms or technology. They would be little more than window dressing if the film did not rest on his strong elemental backbone of monomyth. It's wholly recognizable yet wholly its own unique phenomenon.

The minutiae of ""Dune"" are not an end to themselves, a series of Easter eggs or subtle references meant to tickle the fancy of those already converted. This is not a fan-service film tailored for devotees of this specific journey. Rather, it's one that can pierce the psyche of anyone with the capacity for inspiration from these stories.
Looming large among the reasons ""Dune"" can elicit such grandeur is the fact that Villeneuve, along with his co-screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, do not sand down the obvious messianic elements of Herbert's book. They never take the audience's acceptance of the story's importance for granted, opting to go big with mythology rather than relying on lazy shorthand to have audiences fill in the mental blanks. But they don't overload the allegory, either, so the overtones don't distract from the progression of the story itself as Paul prepares for his unexpected ascent.

Stemming from this mystical throughline, Villeneuve takes an uncommon interest in both the form and function of ceremony and ritual in ""Dune,"" thus establishing the resonance of this fantastical universe with familiar structures in our own. Yet in embracing Paul's emergence as a source of omniscience and salvation, they establish genuinely lofty stakes for the film, ones that match the scale of ambition and action on display. Their consequences also feel larger-than-life, not just limited to a studio's bottom line, and the responsibility of conveying them largely rest on Chalamet's performance.

Chalamet's interpretation of the Paul Atreides character, formally speaking, is miles away from his breakout turn in ""Call Me By Your Name."" Unlike that role, where a world of inner turmoil expressed itself through a jittery physical performance, Chalamet is all studied stillness in ""Dune."" Yet underneath that placid exterior lies the same amount of chaotic conflict with which a maturing character must grapple. He broods without the blankness of Ryan Gosling in Villeneuve's last directing gig, ""Blade Runner 2049."" It speaks to Chalamet's extraordinary versatility and range as an actor that he can command the screen when painting with broad strokes of physicality or subtle pointillist emoting.

There's even evolution within the movie itself as the shifting sands of power move Paul out of the shadows and into the seat of power. ""Dune"" grapples with weighty concepts like the proper exercise of political might, the weight of authority, the power of prophecy, as well as the conflict between being both man and messiah. The quiet turmoil of Chalamet's performance embodies all these tensions as he comes to understand his own position at the center of a vast ensemble. Paul's coming to terms with the reality that he represents a beacon of hope bright enough to merit the sacrifice of loved ones proves as breathtaking as any visual effects in the film.

And that is saying quite a lot, given that the eye-popping visuals invoke the full sublimity of science-fiction cinema. The effects work of ""Dune"" thunder with the full bellow of thematic resonance. Everything from the film's sandworms to spaceships looks and feels unlike anything else put on-screen. Villeneuve cares about their construction long enough to encourage cinematographer Grieg Frasier to linger on them, too, not cutting away quickly to mask mediocre design work. He's not just invoking the imagination that makes the hero's journey so compelling. ""Dune"" manufactures the magic of movies where the dreams can be as big as the screens that display them. ""This is only the beginning,"" remarks Paul with an impish grin as the film closes — part one, as the opening title card states. Bravo to Denis Villeneuve for calling his shot to will a sequel into existence. Part two of ""Dune"" must happen so he can finish the hero's journey he started. Audiences deserve to see the conclusion of an action film so immaculately crafted and patiently paced, one that's more focused on inspiring reverent amazement through the simplicity of durable storytelling structures rather than the complexity of cinematic universe building."
"Sep 18, 2021",POSITIVE,An exciting set up that left me starving for Part 2. Just sit back and let the spectacle and Zimmer score rip through you.
"Sep 18, 2021",POSITIVE," In terms of size and scale, will there be any other film this calendar year that feels as big as Denis Villeneuve‘s Dune? The answer to this rhetorical question is likely a resounding no, as this monster of a cinematic experience is as large and epic as one could hope for. Like many other films that have pushed their release dates back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dune was eager to make its mark when the theatrical experience was once again considered kosher amongst the general population. And although it’s still questionable whether or not the world is at that stage yet, and Warner Brothers’ plan for a concurrent HBO Max digital release is still in place, there’s no question that this is a film that should be experienced on the big screen. But despite such a promising appeal to the cinematic experience, Dune ultimately falls short of meeting some of those expectations given its reliance on building towards a subsequent installment. The film leaves audiences wanting more, which is a signposting for both Villeneuve‘s masterful filmmaking capacities and the lack of contained narrative closure one would expect from such an epic cinematic journey.source: Warner Bros.Based on the popular science fiction novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, Dune was initially produced into a feature film by David Lynch in 1984. Although that film has garnered a cult following over the years, it was a commercial disaster and scored poorly with critics as well. Villeneuve‘s attempt at Dune essentially follows the same story, which sees Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the heir apparent of a noble family that has been entrusted with controlling the desert planet Arrakis. His father, Leo Atreides (Oscar Isaac), relishes in the planet’s richness in ‘melange’, one of the most valuable trade substances in the galaxy. Paul is also the son of Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is a part of the Bene Gesserit, a group that has permeated over the years using their supernatural abilities.As the noble family arrives on Arrakis, they are met with resistance and betrayal from the ruling empire that first afforded them this opportunity. The film features a cast that also includes Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem (among others). There really isn’t a sour note in this strong ensemble cast, who help provide reverence to source material that, as with any science fiction story, can be difficult to digest at times. Chalamet in particular brings a grounded sense of relatability as the film’s protagonist and moral anchor, making it more digestible for audiences to take in this overly imaginative science fiction tale.A masterclass in science fiction world-buildingWhen it comes to the large worlds that are created in coveted science fiction and fantasy novels, the advantage of cinema is its ability to transform those exquisitely detailed words into audiovisual experiences that heighten our sense of imagination. The extended versions (and to be fair, even the theatrical cuts) of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films are prime examples of this, with Peter Jackson creating breathtaking moving portraits of J. R. R. Tolkien’s expansive vision. And although I’ve never read Herbert’s original Dune novels, one can only imagine that Villeneuve has executed a visionary illustration of his planetary narrative. The expansive world-building that takes place in Dune is simply breathtaking. Similar to the picturesque sensibilities he employed in Blade Runner 2049, every frame of Dune is a pleasure to observe. Greig Fraser is excellent in creating a world that feels desolate while maintaining a sense of richness to its quality. The visual effects and large-scale battle scenes are full of details that are certainly indicative of the level of detail and craftsmanship afforded to this monster-sized epic.Dune (2021) – source: Warner Bros.And as expected, the searing score by Hans Zimmer helps captivate audiences from beginning to end, although it certainly isn’t as invasive as some of his usual work. The score actually takes more of a backseat, with hints of recurring motifs and sounds, as opposed to emotionally dense themes that Zimmer is so capable of creating. Instead, Villeneuve enchants audiences through a balanced act that affords equal responsibility to all aspects of the film. Not one single element overtakes any other, and for a film of this size, this helps provide space to take in all the many details. It’s actually a relatively restrained approach to filmmaking, despite the large canvas, and is indicative of both the maturity and ingenuity of Villeneuve.Leaving audiences thirsty for moreThe emotional and overall narrative experience of Dune traverses multiple planes that ultimately culminates in a setup for a follow-up film. This is by no means a spoiler as Villeneuve has been vocal about his plans for a sequel that would focus on Zendaya’s Chani. The problem is, the film itself essentially hints at this follow-up story as part of its current narrative payout. But when Paul finally reaches the mysterious Fremen group of beings towards the film’s third act, the promised story arc isn’t really addressed at all and is left as a setup for a sequel instead. This would be fine if Dune‘s finale packs in a coherent narrative finish, but it, unfortunately, doesn’t. It ends off with a battle sequence that is far less climactic and emotionally satisfying than those that came before it, which feels like a letdown given the scale of the story itself.source: Warner Bros.The technical ascents of Dune never dissipate, but the dramatic narrative that exudes peak science-fiction energy seems to dwindle toward the finish line. While the ending itself is far from a mid- or end-credit teaser scene, its collective packaging does feel like a teaser for a follow-up that promises to be more gripping than what has been shown so far. There are more satisfying ways that Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth could’ve ended off the film with the same degree of sequel-teasing, which would’ve elevated Dune as a true masterpiece in large-scale science fiction filmmaking. But in the end, we’re left feeling a bit empty-handed, with a sense that a sequel isn’t just desirable, but essential to fully experiencing this particular storytelling vision.Final ThoughtsAs a science fiction film, Dune is bewilderingly ambitious in terms of scope and scale, despite still feeling a bit underwhelming by the time credits roll. Villeneuve ultimately set his eyes on more than a single film, and given the promising premise set forth by this first installment, I surely hope that Warner Brothers gives the official green light so that his full vision can be realized. Dune is honestly marvelous to experience and certainly makes a great case for why the theatrical experience can never be truly replaced. The fact that it fails to fully stand on its own points to both its deficiency as a self-contained film, and the urgency to one day experience its completed journey with an anticipated sequel. For the sake of ensuring that such a sequel is made, audiences should make an effort to see this imperfect, yet beautifully crafted science fiction epic.Does Villeneuve’s Dune live up to the hype of the book?

When it comes to the large worlds that are created in coveted science fiction and fantasy novels, the advantage of cinema is its ability to transform those exquisitely detailed words into audiovisual experiences that heighten our sense of imagination. The extended versions (and to be fair, even the theatrical cuts) of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films are prime examples of this, with Peter Jackson creating breathtaking moving portraits of J. R. R. Tolkien’s expansive vision. And although I’ve never read Herbert’s original Dune novels, one can only imagine that Villeneuve has executed a visionary illustration of his planetary narrative. The expansive world-building that takes place in Dune is simply breathtaking. Similar to the picturesque sensibilities he employed in Blade Runner 2049, every frame of Dune is a pleasure to observe.

"Sep 17, 2021",POSITIVE," TIFF – Benediction, Terence Davies’ biography of World War I poet Siegfried Sassoon, played by Jack Lowden as a young man and soldier and Peter Capaldi as the embittered old man weaves the story of his life in classically style, elegantly and philosophically. Beginning with archival war footage, underlining Sassoon’s severe PTSD, his poetry, expressing and defining his awful experiences and lifelong effects, it takes him through radical personal choices he made right up to the end. Gay but married to a woman he barely knows, atheist but converted to Roman Catholicism in old age, he was a man whose later life bore no resemblance to his bright start, a pacifist defeated by memories and participation in the war. Davies tells the tale at his leisure, providing space for thought and Sassoon’s poems, in what is ultimately a dour and tragic portrait of his life.  The TIFF golden ticket, set to open on Oct 22, is Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s “unfilmable” 1965 sci-fi novel  Dune. It is hyper imaginative – s massive galaxies and impassable spice deserts (today oil), unthinkably futuristic innovation and tech against which is set a world of humans at war for territory – and spice. Wars capable of shutting down kingdoms and building new ones, against endless catastrophes and obstacles, that bring a young man to rule in chaos. The esthetics are out of this world so to speak, gorgeous and outlandish. There’s a suggestion that a design for human flight was hammered into reality – 10k years into the future. There’s so much to see, you’ll look hard and long and want more. Oscar Isaac’s Duke Leto Atreides has power over this universe but it runs out, transferring to his young and fragile son Paul. Paul’s widowed mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) pushes him forward, like Lady Macbeth, to claim his legacy, to rule the spice deserts and lead their people to a bright future as jealous rival tribes come in for the kill. Emotional elements are a tad overwhelmed by the spectacle and stoic characters remain at arm’s length, but it’s a beautiful spectacle. Stars Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling. Dune Part 2 is on its way plus a TV series. TIFF – Benedict Cumberbatch goes against his image as Phil, a psychotic rancher in the Wild West circa 1925 in The Power of the Dog. He’s a Yale classics graduate who has chosen to live the cowboy life, unwashed, mean and toxic as a junkyard dog, boss of a bunch of admiring cowhands who like to watch him neuter bulls and humiliate people with his poison tongue. His sensitive and canny brother George (Jesse Plemons) unintentionally turns the screws on him when he brings home a wife and her devoted son (Kirsten Dunst and Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Phil comes for her, verbal guns -blazin’. She’s catatonic with fright so she drinks to get through the days. Her son is frail-looking so Phil to lay into him; he doesn’t know looks are deceiving. Jane Campion’s beautifully shot (in New Zealand) parable goes to extreme places and builds insurmountable tension in lifelike ways, and is deeply haunting. Cumberbatch reaches for the skies and touches them as, as this powerful, violent elegy continues to haunt me. A version of Psalm 22.20 reads “Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog”. TIFF – Scarborough from directors Shasha Nakhai, Rich Williamson and writer Catherine Hernandez is set in a low-income enclave in eastern Toronto. Its diverse population is well represented in three families whose children attend the same breakfast and literacy programme run by a nurturing leader Ms. Hina (Aliya Kanani.) She sees up close that each child has his or her own set of difficulties and gifts. Little Laura is neglected and starving and can’t read, talented Bing is bullied and Johnny’s autism is disrupting the programme. His sister is well adjusted and has a close protective bond with Bing. Each family’s story is told – drug addiction, extreme poverty, rebuilding after escaping a domestic abuse situation and systemic racism, in a remarkably lyrical, cinematic way. Each character contributes to the fabric of the community, for good or ill. There’s the kindly prostitute, the old man who babysits kids when necessary, the gifted street artist. White characters are unsympathetic, the ones who demand Christmas carols in the class, the deeply racist father who can’t keep his daughter fed, the abusive mother, the unyielding boss of the programme who tells Ms. Hina not to care so much. It’s not all doom, but it is an engrossing, mature, well-made and rich tapestry of a community in crisis, told with compassion. Stars Liam Diaz, Essence Fox and Anna Claire Beitel. TIFF – Former actor Justine Bateman, writer and director of Violet brings a surprisingly intimate experience of anxiety and “fear-based decisions”. Olivia Munn as Violet is head of production in a Hollywood film company, working under a sadistic boss. Justin Theroux narrates the toxic, angry inner voices in Violet’s head, competing to be heard and obeyed versus her need to quash them. It’s a devilish voice that taunts her – she’s always wrong, no one cares for her, they think she’s less-than and unattractive. Her staff verbally abuses and mocks her and the script she championed and dropped because of them, and she takes it. For most of her life, she’s agreed with the voices, but despite all, she’s managed to forge a successful career and maintain a loyal male friend who listens and comforts. She runs into an ex who broke with her when she caused a serious fire in his apartment. The voices become louder and unbearable, the “committee” that confuses and angers her makes her act rashly, as the screen turns red. Violet often reflects on carefree childhood moments when she was in charge of her feelings; since then she’s become estranged from her family. It’s an extremely tough journey she’s taken but one day she decides to do the opposite, to do things differently and change her thinking. Bateman’s sensitive piece is a hard-earned triumph. TIFF – Director Tea Lindeburg’s As in Heaven is set in the late 1800s on a remote farm in Denmark. A woman with eight children is expected to deliver a ninth baby any day now. Fourteen-year-old Lise (Flora Ofelia Hofmann Lindahl ) walks in the wheatfields when she has a vision of blood pouring down from a black cloud, thicker than rain. Stunned she returns home where her father tells her she shouldn’t waste her time going away for school at the end of summer. She’s in charge of the children who worry that she won’t come home as she leaves, and she reassures them. Lise can’t get any answers about her mother’s condition but hears her screaming in agony. She prays for her mother, admitting she’s been bad and realising if her mother dies, she must forego a better future to stay home and raise the children. Lise’ adolescent self is in a state of upheaval and her visions continue, forecasting bloody doom. An element of the supernatural brings a strange counterpoint to a desperate situation. TIFF – Snakehead – wow. Since when do we get two female protagonists with iron will, brute force and smarts. It just so happens, Dai Mah (Jade Wu) is the elderly and bulletproof matriarch of a human trafficking cartel based out of New York’s Chinatown. The other Sister Tse (Shuya Chang )is an immigrant just released from eight long years in the slammer, where she picked up a lot of survival tricks and wicked a capacity for violence. Sounds rough, right? It is, but it’s also an outstanding fable about women with muscle doing anything to survive in a male universe. Writer-director Evan Jackson Leong has created a milestone in action films; giving women the power and will to make it. Human smugglers (Snakeheads) slip illegal immigrants from South East Asia into the US at $50K a head, ultra-dangerous and often unsurvivable. Sister Tse endures life-threatening conditions making her way to New York, but she’s there for one reason, to find the daughter she gave up years earlier. She will work off the $50K for Dai Mah cooking and helping with the trafficking business. the two become close, trusted associates and the debt is quickly whittling down; she soon learns Dai Mah runs Chinatown with the help of her psychotic sons. Sister Tse is a threat to the, and the heat builds, just as the FBI looms. if your heart can take it, this is an incredibly raw and full experience. The Eyes of Tammy Faye stars Jessica Chastain in a tour-de-force performance as the wife of disgraced TV evangelical Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield). Together the couple from International Falls, MN, at the border with Canada, built a small TV following that grew through pledges and financial “partnerships” with adoring followers to a 24/7 satellite network with 20M viewers a day, phenomenal numbers now – and then – back in the 80s. The Bakkers were a different kind of TV evangelical, espousing love, acceptance and prosperity when AIDS, conservativism and Republican values were the rule, all the while dripping in diamonds and furs. Tammy didn’t bother herself with how the money kept on coming, and Jim began building a wall to make sure she wouldn’t. He was driving his devoted viewers; he had to create the lifestyle she needed and the Christian theme parks and hotels he envisioned. They were soon laid low due to corruption and sex scandals and the enduring images of Tammy Faye dabbing her tears, careful not to smear that clown’s face of makeup and Jim dishevelled and wailing off to prison for 120 years. What an ugly story! A true story that producer Chastain and director Michael Showalter felt needed telling. TIFF – The Starling in Theaters now and on Netflix Sept 24. Director Theodore Melfi’s piece on loss and fallout stars Melissa McCarthy, Chris O’Dowd, Kevin Kline and Daveed Diggs. McCarthy’s Lilly’s dealing with an empty house, an overgrown garden and an aggressive starling that constantly attacks her. Lilly’s husband Jack (O’Dowd) is in a mental health facility; he attempted suicide when their infant daughter Katie died. Both of them are suffering and stuck, he spits out medications, she’s angry and acts impulsively, giving away all their furniture, making occasional forays into the garden when she has no idea what she’s doing and pondering ways to get rid of the starling. A therapist at the facility gives her the name of a doctor (Kevin Kine) now a local vet after some humiliation at Johns Hopkins and even though he’s a VET, he treats her. The characters’ misery is the meat of the film and it’s a hard hole to escape. Kline, who’s been absent from the screen for a while, is transcendent in the small role of the confused vet/shrink. TIFF – Julia is a true feel-good documentary from Julie Cohen and Betsy West, the story of one of the most beloved TV personalities in history – Julia Child! Child changed the cuisine landscape in North America via a low-budget TV cooking show on the Boston PBS station and a cookbook that took Child and two co-authors twelve years to write. Mastering the Art of French Cooking, a deep dive into the science and technique of making delicious food and inspired by her passion for French culture and cuisine remains one of the best sellers in the cooking genre. Child’s vibrant personality and fearlessness – and a considerable amount of quirk – made her a TV sensation, and celebrity when there were no celebrity foodies. Follow her story from a wealthy Republican background in tony Pasadena to living in a garret in Paris, working in intelligence during WWII, finding the perfect man for her temperament and passions in Paul Child and getting on with the job. She’s a total inspiration to women everywhere, breaking the glass ceiling when most housewives silenced their ambitions and served frozen TV dinners. What a woman! In general release is Lina Roessler’s Best Sellers, a story about a New York publishing house on the decline that made its reputation fifty years earlier with the release of   J.D.Salinger-esque Harris Shaw’s landmark novel. Aubrey Plaza’s Lucy runs the firm, left to her by her father but it’s in bad shape. She has an idea that could save it- find the reclusive Shaw – Michael Caine- and get a book he owes the firm according to the terms of his decades-old contract. Knowing his truculent reputation, she carries through- it’s the only way to save the firm from financial collapse. She and her entertaining assistant (Ellen Wong) are working on an impossible mission. They break into his home and demand the book. He’s drunk and taken aback but agrees to do his old friend’s daughter a good deed and write it, and he agrees to go on a reading tour, which because of his eccentric behaviour, becomes an internet sensation. But he’s holding back, something from the past is haunting him. That’s the gist of Best Sellers but the heart is the growing relationship between Lucy and Harris and the truths that emerge with trust and love. So Caine and Plaza? It worked. In Theaters and TVOD. Are you as excited as we are for Season Two of The Morning Show on AppleTV+? Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who also co-executive produce are back as Alex and Bradley, navigating rough waters stirred up last season when Mitch was fired for sexual harassment and one of his accusers killed herself. He’s run away to Italy where he sits alone in his grand hotel suite, miserable and bitter. Alex has moved to rural Maine and wants nothing to do with TV after her inglorious end, Bradley’s still scheming (and screaming) to get off the morning show on onto the evening news, oblivious to the fact that it’s a new day and she is not entitled. Other young talents are emerging. Dan (Desean Terry ) is on a story no one has time for, about a deadly virus in Wuhan, China. And big shot journalist Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies) who has an edgy rivalry with Alex focuses on Bradley. Everything is about to change but the people with power are dragging their feet and the on-air types are doing what they always do – demanding more and staging internecine wars. Newsroom shock and awe! The writing retains its high level of excellence, the series remains on the best in American TV. An important documentary on efforts to protect an endangered animal species is available now on TVOD and Blu-Ray/DVD on Sept. 21st. The Center: Gibbons and Guardians paints a picture of optimism and can-do spirited staff and carers who shelter nine gibbons in Santa Clarita, California. The animals – lesser apes – are extraordinary; together they greet the dawn with a wailing chorus every day, have complicated relationships with one another and with their humans. They make things and use them, and filmmaker Alex M. Azmi has it all – including one male’s jealous rage when another fella approaches his beloved, and various scraps between the younger ones and the birth of baby Anastasia. And then there are the human interactions. Director Gabriella Skollar and a staffer marry and have a child who becomes the Center’s mascot, the devoted volunteers who work their way into jobs, the death of the Center founder and his legacy. The gibbons are kept in high spacious cages that suit them. Gibbons never touch the ground in their native forests and the cages recreate the experience. You’ll learn much about our wild animal cousins and think about the current sixth extinction and where we are, shoulder to shoulder with these wonderful beings. Jane Goodall, a friend of The Center speaks with authority and wonder about their high intelligence. A must-see doc. Did I mention gibbons mate 5 – 8 times a day? London’s annual Royal Horticultural Society’s Chelsea Flower Show dedicated this year to frontline health workers will air live on BritBox from  September 19 – 24. Witness the glorious sights of the Royal Hospital Chelsea grounds transformed into a breathtaking floral universe with displays that have graced the event there since 1913. World-renowned florists, designers, growers and gardeners will present their visions for the first time in the event’s history – in September – not the spring, so its array of seasonal wonders will look different but reliably wonderful. There’s a competition element – awards such as Best Show Garden, Best Construction Award, and Best Exhibit in the Great Pavilion and emphasis on cutting-edge design and innovation. Members of The Royal Family often drop by."
"Sep 17, 2021",POSITIVE," A magnificent adaptation of half a novel, Dune slakes sci-fi thirst as much as it parches. Frank Herbert’s seminal six-book series launched with 1965’s award-winning first installment that Denis Villeneuve here semi-adapts. And his targeted treatment of only a section of the dense material—a political, ecological, and religious treatise on nothing less than the very future of humanity—is deftly faithful. It’s also filmmaking of the highest order, with a richly talented director at the height of his powers summoning visceral, terrifyingly awesome images of the human condition writ large. Hardcore fans will thrill to the opulent reverence. Casual viewers, though dazzled, should brace for world-building overload. Get ready for the Landsraad, Mentats, crysknives, stillsuits, the weirding way, the gom jabbar, planets like Giedi Prime and Salusa Secondus, Imperial Sardaukar troops, and the Kwisatz Haderach. Intimidated? That’s understandable, and part of Villeneuve’s genius as a storyteller is to throttle the book’s firehose of information into more or less digestible, yet highly dramatic and deeply human, moments. Still confused? Don’t worry: the book has a glossary. In the year 10191, galactic feudal houses vie for resources, chief among them the spice mélange that literally fuels interstellar transportation. The precious substance also doubles as a consciousness-expanding hallucinogen that extends life and increases health. And it comes from a single planet: Arrakis, an inhospitable desert world where teeth-studded sandworms measuring as long as 400 meters threaten every form of life. House Harkonnen rules over Arrakis, but the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV decides to rout them and bring in House Atreides from the ocean planet Caladan. Its tough but judicious leader, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), is a rising political star and potential threat, so the Emperor secretly schemes with Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) to bring him down. The reassignment is a trap. Leto senses it, but can’t pass up the opportunity to oversee the wildly lucrative mining industry that effectively controls the universe. He also feels that his secret weapon is the untapped potential of the Fremen, the native population mostly hidden from view who know how to live with the sandworms and thrive on Arrakis. Ally with them, win their trust, and he might just be able to thwart any of the Emperor’s machinations. “Desert power,” Leto tells his teenage son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Paul is his bright, sober child with Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Leto’s concubine and a member of an ancient all-female religious sect called the Bene Gesserit. These witchy devout have extrasensory powers and keen foresight, which have made them masters of manipulation, quietly pulling political strings as they measure out machinations over centuries. But Lady Jessica put a wrinkle in their plans when she willfully gave Duke Leto a son instead of the daughter that the Bene Gesserit traditionally require. And in doing so, she’s created a man that might also have the powerful abilities of the ancient sorceresses. As such, the Fremen also consider him a possible messiah. Blame the Bene Gesserit for that, too, since they’ve spent thousands of years seeding countless worlds with such prophecies—yet another way of controlling populations. So Paul now finds himself in a pincer hold of destiny: assigned to a planet he doesn’t understand, with powers he shouldn’t have been given, forced to fight for his life in a political maelstrom that threatens his entire family. And now an entire race turns its eyes to him as their possible savior. Dune’s status as science fiction is perfunctory, since Herbert is much more of a mythmaker than he is a speculative engineer of technology’s possibilities. He uses distant starscapes and mammoth civilizations as set dressing for essentially medieval court intrigue. It’s a staggeringly ambitious work of imagination that yet also seems trapped in a very dated 20th-century worldview. The feudal houses are European states, spice represents oil, the Fremen are Arabs, and Paul is a galactic Lawrence of Arabia. As foreign as the worlds might be, the whole project feels very familiar. Still, his saga of warring tribes, realpolitik compromises, and unexpected treachery show a moebius strip of human impulses and religious fervor that, time and again, cause precious blood and treasure to be spilled in the name of scarce commodities. And, most compellingly, Villeneuve doesn’t let that macro aspect capsize the heart of the story: Lady Jessica and her devotion to Paul. She’s a mother whose love for a man yielded him a son, and that decision ends up bringing her, and him, conflicted emotions and profound pain. That said, Villeneuve’s Dune doesn’t lack for levity—a rare quality for the filmmaker of such grippingly dour films as Sicario, Arrival, and Blade Runner 2049. Casting goes a long way, especially with broheim it-men like Josh Brolin as court tutor Gurney Halleck and Jason Momoa as military muscle Duncan Idaho. “Thank you for the gift of your body’s moisture,” says Idaho diplomatically when Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) offers up a sign of respect by spitting in front of a baffled Duke Leto. Isaac lends elegiac heft as the compromised Leto, while Skarsgard’s creepy Baron Harkonnen, with his pallid complexion and overindulged folds of flesh, feels flat, mutterinmg cryptic calculations like a space-age Colonel Kurtz. Zendaya’s in here, too, but more as Paul’s mysterious muse and dreamlike vision whose appearance is brief and significance is unexplained. But the real star of Dune is the production itself: wan colors dappling chiaroscuro palaces of stone; the heavy gears of eleventh-millennium mining machinery; the fluttering dragonfly wings of ornithopters; a soundtrack that interweaves chanting hymns with slithering bass-heavy drones. And, most of all, the thunderous arrival of sandworms as their cavernous mouths collapse the ground underneath. The entire film is a cinematic revelation that commands the senses—and hopefully inspires a sequel that will actually finish the book.

A Rotten Tomatoes certified reviewer, Garrett is also the founder of Jump Cut, a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent, foreign-language, and documentary films. I really, really didn’t want to like this movie. I’m immune to Chalumet’s twinkish charm and a zealousaficionado of Lynch’s grotesque masterwork. But, shit, Villanueve’s patient work, luxuriousness of scene, and utter, impossible control of Herbert’s impossible novel–“wheels within wheels within wheels”– blew me away, and I’m left cursing the fact that we’ll have to wait years for the conclusion. I’m not getting any younger."
"Sep 17, 2021",POSITIVE," Like writer-director Denis Villeneuve's 2016 masterpiece Arrival, I have been thinking about this film – which opens in cinemas here today – for days after seeing it. David Lynch's 1984 version was sold as a new Star Wars, but in reality, it was like being told that through a door was a glorious roller coaster, only to find to oneself stuck in a long, dry lecture about slate tiles held in a cold, stone chamber. The stiff regality of Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson's turmoil of being a mother but also a disciple, the swagger of Jason Momoa and Timothee Chalamet going from callow to commanding. And if you want to feel ill, Stellan Skarsgard eating is a near-nauseating ASMR experience. And there is action. Huge explosions in parts. It is a thrilling telling of the tale that manages to make the stately stunning and give what could be a slow procession some much-needed pace. This is not a play that can be performed anywhere. It is designed as cinema, which is unfortunate given the pandemic's effect on the cinema industry. But to hear that not one part of a sequel - and this needs one ASAP - has been filmed and that they can start shooting only at the end of next year? Reminder: A Denis Villeneuve sequel to Blade Runner starring Ryan Gosling was going to be a licence to print money, right up to the point Blade Runner 2049* was released. (*It is a five-star film but just didn't grab audiences). THE SKINNY: Paul Atreides (Chalamet) is the son of a noble family entrusted with the protection of the universe's most valuable asset, spice, produced on the desert planet of Dune. But his true destiny is more significant than just becoming a duke."
"Sep 16, 2021",POSITIVE," En la línea solipsista del Christopher Nolan de Dunkerque (2017) o del Zack Snyder de Watchmen (2009), pero cada uno, claro, fiel a su estilo único e intransferible. Hay muy pocos directores capaces de hacerse cargo de un proyecto de presupuesto desorbitado y cargado de estrellas de primer nivel -Dune parece un all-stars: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Charlotte Rampling, etc- y tener la valentía de hacer con él una película tan tremendamente personal, ajena a cualquier moda imperante y que, con ello, siga resultando un espectáculo inabarcable de primer nivel. Porque esa era la sensación que me abrasaba mientras veía la película: el del espectáculo totémico que sólo puedes mirar con la boca abierta y los ojos en spinning continuo. Las imágenes que construye Villeneuve, son majestuosas en su ampulosidad, fascinantes en su diseño sci-fi y atronadoras en su sonido (sólo Hans Zimmer podía haber hecho algo así). Es tal el aparataje audiovisual que uno está con el botón de fascinación en modo ON todo el rato. Cada mundo nuevo que aparece, cada castillo, cada nave, cada objeto -que fetichismo le aplica Villeneuve a los objetos sobre los que hace pivotar el relato continuamente, ya sea una cornamenta de toro, ya sea el cuchillo que acaba empuñando Paul Atreides-, están pensados hasta el último detalle, magníficamente diseñados y construidos para que sirvan al mismo tiempo de decorado y de explicación de los propios personajes. Y desde Lawrence de Arabia (1962) nadie había captado tan bien la esencia del desierto. Ejemplo. Cuando aparece por primera vez el planeta de los Harkonnen y vemos al Barón (Stellan Skarsgård) en una amplísima sala sin muebles de ningún tipo, de espaldas, cubierto en vapor, cayendo luz cenital cónica, acariciándose la calva como el Coronel Kurtz de Apocalypse Now (1979)… Villeneuve te está describiendo la locura y la maldad absoluta sin apenas articular un solo diálogo. Puro cine. La espectacularidad de Dune va a la par de la intensidad que Villeneuve la aplica a las imágenes. Este no es un espectáculo ligero, no es una batalla galáctica divertida y entretenida, sino más bien todo lo contrario. Aquí se ha venido a sufrir. A ver traiciones, complots, asesinatos, masacres, sueños oníricos, brujas maléficas y gusanos gigantes. Viéndola no paraba de pensar “esto me está gustando mucho pero ¿le gustará a alguien más?”. El tempo narrativo de Blade Runner 2049 aplicado a la space opera está más cerca de Arthur C. Clarke que de Orson Scott Card. Dune se cuece a fuego muy lento y posee múltiples fugas con las continuas ensoñaciones de Paul Atreides (hay muchas más que en la película de Lynch). La carga dramática va disparada, casi disparatada, y se sostiene estrictamente en su andamiaje estético. Villeneuve quiere meterse dentro del dolor de los personajes y quiere que tú lo acompañes. El camino que impone no es sencillo, sino prácticamente anti-climático. Como si el cineasta se mostrara tan exigente consigo mismo como con el público y en la media hora final se hace realmente palpable esa deriva. Yo he acabado fundido cuando han aparecido los créditos. Hay cosas que no me han acabado de funcionar en la película. Principalmente el uso de los escudos personales, que hacen que las escenas de acción cuerpo a cuerpo sean tremendamente extrañas. Entiendo que es una decisión lógica en la continua fidelidad al texto original, pero no por eso se me deja de hacer raro. ¿Qué pensará la gente cuando la vea? ¿La amarán? ¿La odiarán? Dune va a polarizar, eso está claro. Pero seas de los primeros o de los segundos, no dudes ni por un momento que Villeneuve ha hecho la película que quería pesara a quien pesara y eso es algo que siempre yo respeto. Dune, adaptación de la novela de Frank Herbert que ya llevó al cine David Lynch en 1984, narra la historia de la familia Atreides y su camino hacia Arrakis. El duque Leto tiene que supervisar la extracción de una codiciada droga y eso implica numerosas amenazas. Entre sus enemigos se encontrará el pueblo indígena Fremen, que habita el planeta que quieren explotar, y los malvados Harkonnen. Al mismo tiempo, las condiciones del nuevo territorio no tiene nada que ver con su planeta de origen. Provienen de un sitio montañoso y húmedo y han ido a parar a un desierto. Enfrentarse a Dune es adentrarse en un complejo mundo lleno de mitología, jerarquías, organizaciones políticas y religiosas, tradiciones, profecías... Desde el legado del clan protagonista hasta las Bene Gesserit, un grupo matriarcal muy poderoso. Denis Villeneuve ha trabajado minuciosamente en desgranar el universo que presentó Herbert y lo que ha conseguido es una producción con la que es imposible mirar hacia otro lado."
"Sep 16, 2021",POSITIVE,"Dune is host to some phenomenal action sequences. Not only are we watching stellar stunt work and choreography, but the action is intensified with dazzling landscapes and music - they practically become characters on their own."
"Sep 15, 2021",POSITIVE," If you haven’t read Frank Herbert’s Dune books and you don’t think you’re the target audience for Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, this is the review for you. I don’t like epic stories, I’m not nuts about hard sci-fi/medieval stuff/fantasy, and I’ve been dodging my friends’ constant appeals to read the books for years. But here’s the thing…I really dug this dang movie. I don’t know if it was the IMAX presentation, the sly simplification of Herbert’s complex world, or the half an edible I had before going in but I enjoyed the heck out of this $165 Million sci-fi spectacle. You’ve likely heard by now that Dune is, in fact, Dune: Part One. That was an immediate bummer for me, personally, but it is pretty apparent even in the first ten minutes of the movie that trying to stuff this entire saga into one film would be a nightmare (see: David Lynch’s Dune). On the plus side, Dune is also a perfect candidate for the mini-series/multi-season approach, so we should all thank our lucky stars that we aren’t about to get saddled with yet another overly elongated adaptation. So, what’s Dune about?  It might be easiest to think of it as a cross between Star Wars and Game of Thrones. It’s very political and builds like a game of chess, but it also has giant people-eating sandworms, Stellan Skarsgård (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) levitating in a fat suit, and Jason Momoa (The Bad Batch) as an absolute badass. TLDR; There’s an inhospitable planet where future civilizations harvest an expensive spice used for interstellar space travel. Everyone’s willing to kill for control of this planet, but it’s also inhabited by a group of nomadic desert people that use the spice for its hallucinogenic properties (like peyote or magic mushrooms). These natives also believe in a “chosen one” that will one day free them from their oppressors and (surprise, surprise) the son of their new leader just may be the savior they’ve been waiting for. I’m sure a lot of that sounds familiar. You could even argue that it’s a copy+past “hero’s journey” story like any other multi-million dollar blockbuster. It’s more likely that Frank Herbert’s novels have influenced large-scale storytelling over the last several decades but who cares what came first. This is a story structure that you are already familiar with. Swap out the words “Jedi Council” for “Bene Gesserit” and “House Lannister” for “House Harkennon”, and you’re nearly there. So why should you see Dune? More specifically, why should you see Dune if you’re the kind of person who doesn’t think it’s going to be their cup of tea? Well, for one thing, it’s surprisingly easy to follow. Hearing my friends get lost in the minutia of Dune’s philosophies has always been a challenge for me (and if there’s one thing I hate about hard sci-fi and fantasy it’s having to learn a whole bunch of new words) but I promise you won’t get lost in made-up junk for the sake of made-up junk. Call me dumb all you want, but I don’t think you should be given a glossary to study before seeing a movie. I think you should be able to sit down with no prior knowledge and enjoy it as much as someone who’s steeped themselves in the original books. IMAX is really the format you want to see this movie in if you aren’t a Dune diehard. There are a few aspect ratio changes that are a little jarring but it really, really helps sell the appeal of this world. It’s vast, it’s expansive, and it’s got one hell of a soundscape, not to mention a booming score from Mr. Boom Score himself, Hans Zimmer. You really want the best sound system you can get your ears in front of to really take this all in. It’s like listening to a symphony orchestra. They sound great on bose speakers but they sound unreal live and in-person. Greg Fraiser’s cinematography is gorgeous but, visually, its most impressive quality might be its seamless blend of practical and digital elements. You really can’t tell where the hand-crafted landing gear ends and the manhattan-sized spaceship begins. It’s the kind of movie that is likely to sweep the more technical awards at the Oscars, including costuming because it’s a period piece through and through. The period just happens to be 10, 191 AD. Rest assured that Dune (the film) is not the impenetrable fortress you’ve always assumed Dune (the book) to be. Complex characters with lifetimes of backstory and motivations are reduced down their most essential exchanges from an all-star cast including Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep) Timothée Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name), and Oscar Isacc (Ex Machina) sporting a beard that could stop traffic. As was the case with Game of Thrones, we’re just scratching the surface with this handful of names. There’s a whole host of secondary characters sporting cool tech, mean mugs, and funky blue eyes including Javier Bardem (mother!), Josh Brolin (Grindhouse: Death Proof), Zendaya (Spider-Man: Far From Home), and Dave Bautista (Army of The Dead). My appreciation of Dune flies in the face of every algorithm known to man. On paper, this is not a movie for me. Hard sci-fi with interstellar political sabotage? Pass. Secret societies with superpowers and a teenage christ figure? That’s gonna be a no from me dawg. But I’ll be damned if I didn’t have a blast watching all 2 hours and 40 minutes of it. On the surface, it’s a space opera about destiny, but woven in that familiar framework is a philosophical discussion about the dangers of savior figures. Or at the very least, that’s what it’s selling hard for its second half. Dune was long assumed to be an unfilmable novel but here we are. And having never read a word of that novel, I feel unapologetically confident that these two films are the only adaptation of Frank Herbert’s celebrated classic we’ll ever need. It’s gloomy and it’s doomy, but it’s also hard sci-fi made easily digestible. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune celebrated its North American premiere at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival.

"Sep 15, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune plays like a hybrid of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Lawrence of Arabia -- an epic big-screen experience, but one that needs a sequel.  What justifies a large-format big-screen experience? A possible answer: spaceships and deserts. Between the rise of streaming services and theaters still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been an ongoing debate lately about whether or not movies need a big-screen opening. The two biggest counter-arguments, all-time masterpieces that need the big screen to be fully enjoyed, are 2001: A Space Odyssey and Lawrence of Arabia. When Denis Villeneuve says his new version of Dune needs to be seen in theaters, ideally IMAX ones, it's because his movie is his attempt at making 2001 and Lawrence at the same time.   Aside from their 70mm grandeur, 2001 and Lawrence of Arabia are very different experiences. Lawrence is a personal, emotional story, whereas 2001 is a film driven by big ideas and bold images. The tearjerker ending to Arrival aside, Villeneuve has always been a more Kubrickian director, and 2021's Dune leans more towards theme and spectacle than humanity. However, Dune establishes enough interest in its characters and blends the two epic films' styles to build an interesting story that, at this point, feels not quite finished.   Despite the marketing calling this movie Dune, the actual title shown on-screen is Dune: Part 1. Unlike New Line with The Lord of the Rings films, Warner Bros. did not order Dune:Part 2's production alongside Dune. The film ends right in the middle of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novel. While that choice is logical, it's somewhat anticlimactic and doesn't feel like a complete story at all. Whether Villeneuve will get to finish adapting the book is entirely dependent on Part 1's box office, a challenging proposition with a pandemic still going, and WB putting the film on HBO Max simultaneously and against the director's wishes.   One thing that should help the film commercially is that this Dune actually makes sense. Herbert's novel is an infamously challenging read, dropping readers into its elaborate universe and expecting them to keep up with the barrage of made-up words (or patiently shift through the glossary at the back of the book). David Lynch's 1984 adaptation infamously bombed because it tried to cram the entire book into one film, making things even more confusing. Splitting the book into two parts is a huge boon for the new film's comprehensibility: everything viewers need to understand is either explained or clearly visualized. Any weird things left unexplained are simply background details to add to the universe's mystique.   Put simply, Dune is about three factions fighting over the Arrakis, a planet that's the source of a valuable all-purpose resource called Spice. The planet's native inhabitants are the Fremen, who've been oppressed by the perversely evil Harkonnens. House Atreides has taken over Arrakis from the Harkonnens with the promise to rule peacefully, but the Fremen are understandably distrusting of these new invaders -- and the Harkonnen threat is far from gone. It's Game of Thrones-style political intrigue in a setting that helped inspire Star Wars.   The protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), is the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Fergusson), a concubine from the magical Bene Gesserit sisterhood. Being trained for both his father's political power and his mother's supernatural abilities, Paul is already destined for great things by bloodline. His natural connection with the Fremen implies that he might just be their prophesied chosen one. Most significant among his powers are his visions of the future, which double as a method for Arrival-esque non-linear storytelling and as a way to essentially work teasers for Dune Part 2 into Dune Part 1.   Paul is reluctant about his destiny and has understandably complicated feelings about his parents. However, his journey has really just begun in this movie. The real scene-stealer character in Dune Part 1 is Paul's warrior mentor Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), who almost singlehandedly lends the movie a sense of humor. Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth made a smart choice to emphasize the book's female characters further. The Atreides' mother-son relationship has more impact than the father-son one. Additionally, the likable ecologist Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) from the science-fiction novel has been gender-swapped. Zendaya fans, however, will have to wait to see more of her as Chani, who has an incredible on-screen presence but overall few scenes before the credits roll.   Dune is a transporting cinematic experience, and parts of it are downright awesome. Greg Fraser's IMAX-scale cinematography is more immersive than any 3D, and the interplay of light, shadow, and special effects are as atmospheric as Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049. The battle scenes are few but thrilling, and the sandworms are terrifying. Hans Zimmer provides what might be the most memorable epic musical score since his work on Pirates of the Caribbean. Where it falls short of greatness is how incomplete its story is -- a problem that should be remedied with Part 2.

"Sep 14, 2021",POSITIVE," It’s no secret that I’ve been somewhat skeptical about Dune. For well over a year, I’ve expressed a bit of trepidation that this ambitious undertaking would be doomed to fail. For one thing, Dune has foiled many before. The source material may well be impossible to successfully adapt, at least without an epic length. So, seeing it meant to be a two part story also led to concern that we’d just be getting half a film. Well, we did get half of a film, but it’s a compelling science fiction blockbuster that sets the stage for something big to come. Here at the Toronto International Film Festival, this is a movie that sucks you in. Now, my enthusiasm for the flick will dissipate if we don’t get the back half, but for now, I’m in. Dune is a spectacle, through and through. Bold, serious, and dedicated to launching a whole new franchise, it’s a gamble that’s paid off. While it’s no masterpiece of re-invention of science fiction, it manages to show that the right amount of care can make something unwieldy like this work. So easily could this have crashed and burned, it not being a disaster already was a success. That it’s a very good film, through and through, is almost a miracle. The most ambitious adaptation yet of Frank Herbert‘s legendary science fiction novel, this is the story of the fight for the planet Arrakis, told via the tale of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Containing the sought after “spice” that is constantly being mined, the Emperor has removed the cruel House Harkonnen and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Instead, House Atreides, led by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) will be handling that duty. Leto knows this seems too good to be true, but plans to create an alliance with the Fremans, who live on Arrakis. As he sends Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) ahead to scout out the planet, Paul asks to join. He doesn’t have an interest in ruling, but wants to make a difference. He’ll soon get his chance. With plans in motion from Harkonnen to destroy Atreides, Paul also learns about the special powers his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) has bestowed inside him through her membership in the witch-like  Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Seen as potentially the Chosen One, he will play a big part in the fate of Arrakis. For Paul, he also has been seeing visions of the future, including one that features a Freman (Zendaya) prominently. Settle in, as this world is just starting to be built. A star-studded cast takes this material as seriously as needed for this sort of sci-fi. Timothée Chalamet has the most substantial role, while Jason Momoa is clearly having the most fun. Along with Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac, they have the most to do. That being said, the acting isn’t quite the focus here, solid as they all are. Stellan Skarsgård is effectively monstrous in a role likely to expand next time, while Zendaya is almost a cameo. The rest of the cast includes Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, David Dastmalchian, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, and more. Denis Villeneuve was passionate about this and it shows. Not just directing but co-writing with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve wants to capture your imagination at all turns. Having composer Hans Zimmer working overtime to immerse you in the sounds of Dune doesn’t hurt, nor does the awe-inspiring visuals from cinematographer Greig Fraser. The editing from Joe Walker keeps you focused in all of the right places. The editing is where this easily could have crumbled, so he deserves amble credit. Villeneuve the director is really knocking it out of the park here. However, Villeneuve the filmmaker on the whole is not without fault here. The pacing does drag at times (though Walker’s editing still does a lot of really impressive work), while the screenplay by Roth, Spaihts, and Villeneuve does feel self-serious at times. They don’t shy away from the influences of the genre that originated here, though they also don’t add much new to it. Below the line, Dune is going to be a massive force at the Oscars. Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects nominations are all on the table. Villeneuve has a shot to score a Best Director nod if this is a hint, of course which means a Best Picture nom isn’t out of the question. The latter seems like an uphill battle, but if it proves popular, anything is possible.  Dune works, somewhat to my surprise, as mentioned above. Now, it again bears mentioning that it only works if the second installment does get made. For now, I’ll set that aside and say that those looking for large scale sci-fi are in for a treat. It’s the sort of ambitious genre effort that we see all too rarely these days. While it will be available on HBO Max, I saw it here in TIFF and I can’t stress the immersive nature of that experience enough. Have patience, but give in to Dune."
"Sep 13, 2021",POSITIVE," It was never going to take much rebooting to make an adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved “Dune” better than its 1984 disappointment, helmed by David Lynch. Like “The Lord of the Rings” or comic book adaptions, the technology needed to be invented to match the imagination and world building found in the science fiction epic, long hailed as the greatest of all time.

"Sep 13, 2021",NEGATIVE," Dune ends up feeling like an extended prologue for what one can only hope will be a sequel that will clarify its parables and paradoxes. Frank Herbert’s Dune has long been viewed as unadaptable. Alejandro Jodorowsky’s crack at the epochal tome collapsed under the weight of the filmmaker’s gonzo aspirations, never leaving the preproduction phase. No less notorious is David Lynch’s completed 1984 adaptation, a heavily studio-meddled vision that was ill-received and even disowned by its maker. A couple of well-regarded television miniseries would follow, but the prospect of a definitive, uncompromised big-screen adaptation continued to dim until Denis Villeneuve, one of our chilliest auteurs, revealed that he was approached to helm a new take on Herbert’s book. But sadly, when the dust—or, rather, sand—finally settles on this new Dune, the most unexpected and depressing thing about it is the sheer ordinariness of it all. In the year 10,191 A.G., the hostile desert planet of Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, is put under the care of the House Atreides, led by the compassionate Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). It’s an important appointment, as Arrakis is coveted for its natural production of “spice,” a mystical sand-like substance with life-enhancing qualities. Previously, the planet was ruled by the villainous House Harkonnen, which ravaged the lands for as much spice as they could, all the while waging war against the native Fremen community. By contrast, Duke Leto hopes to work with and learn from the Fremen, who live clandestinely in caverns underneath the sand. The space travel to Arrakis is depicted with the assurance and control, not to mention meticulous eye for detail, for which Villeneuve has become known. Spaceships float through the cosmos in balletic splendor, lending new credence to the term space opera. Dune proceeds with similar grandiosity across scenes set on various house planets, from the large welcoming ceremony for the Herald of the Change (Benjamin Clémentine) and a group of Daft Punk-styled Spacing Guild Representatives on the lush ocean planet of Caladan to a detour into the gothic hellscape of Harkonnen, a world ruled by the wicked Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, suggesting a cross between Jabba the Hut and Marilyn Manson). The film was shot for the IMAX format, and in certain scenes the aspect ratio opens up to 1.90:1. The effect is glorious, but you never shake the impression that even as this Dune breathes new life into Herbert’s material, it still suggests something that’s been left behind—namely by the plethora of sci-fi films that the book inspired. Villeneuve’s Dune does a lot of cagey work on the level of parable, and it all comes at the cost of character. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), Duke Leto’s son and heir and the story’s sullen hero, possesses superhuman mental abilities inherited from his mother, the perpetually torn Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and sufficient training in martial arts and swordplay. From Paul making his way to Arrakis to scenes of him on spice-harvesting duty, we’re constantly being reminded that he may be (and probably is) “the one,” but unlike, say, Neo in The Matrix, we never really get to see the transformation that makes the messiah. When a battle suddenly erupts on Arrakis, as the Harkonnens return to reclaim their spice paradise, Paul is shielded by his parents, shuttled into bunkers and hidden away while foggy and indistinct skirmishes between anonymous soldiers play out in an outpost above ground. Refreshingly, the film shares Lady Jessica’s unease about her son’s fate, and as the eternally brooding Paul, Chalamet certainly gets that his character is being steered away from his promise. Speaking in affectless monotone that feels more than a little wooden, he suggests a figural subject that only exists to be framed standing on cliffs and blankly staring into the horizon as if in search, like Villeneuve’s images, for some kind of meaning. Of course, all that searching is more or less by design. Billing itself as “Part One” in the opening title card, Villeneuve’s Dune ends up feeling like an extended prologue for what one can only hope will be a sequel that will clarify its parables and paradoxes, and really delve into the minds of its characters. And if that film comes to be made, you may also hope that it isn’t practically smothered to death by an ethnographic, drone-like Hans Zimmer score. We don’t even get to take in the full scope of the sweeping desert landscape of Arrakis until the film’s final stretch, when Paul and Lady Jessica are on the run and encounter a tribe of Fremen led by the fierce Stilgar (Javier Bardem). It’s here that the characters finally get up close and personal with the gargantuan sandworms that are the Dune universe’s most recognizable creatures, but it’s only just a glimpse. That sort of teasing is Villeneuve’s m.o., which is engineered into almost every aspect of a story about the possibility of things to come. The meeting with Stilgar, for one, is an opportunity for Paul to prove his manhood and leave us wondering what will come of him winning acceptance into the Fremen society. “This is only the beginning,” declares young Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) as she and her blue-eyed people lead Paul and Lady Jessica deeper into the desert at film’s conclusion, but given the two-plus hours of dull political maneuvering and meaningless effects-laden warfare that precedes this proposition, you may not be inclined to follow them.

"Sep 13, 2021",NEUTRAL," Al final de “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”, la primera de tres partes, queda claro que la aventura de nuestros héroes no ha terminado. Sin embargo, la espera entre una película y otra no fue necesariamente una tortura. Tras un poco más de tres horas, habíamos pasado tiempo suficiente con los personajes. Conocíamos sus objetivos, sus fortalezas y lo que los hacía vulnerables. Cuando rodaron los créditos incluso habíamos tenido un primero, segundo y tercer acto. Cuando algo similar ocurre en la primera de dos partes de esta épica adaptación del libro homónimo inadaptable, la experiencia se siente incompleta. Lo que falta, nos prometen, lo podremos ver en la segunda y última parte… si es que en algún momento sucede. La incertidumbre reinará por un rato, y el precedente no es muy alentador. El director Denis Villeneuve ha creado una producción de gran escala; tan grande que las salas IMAX se quedan pequeñas ante la grandeza de lo que el cineasta presenta en pantalla. Estamos en el planeta Arrakis, la única fuente de la sustancia más valorada en el universo, la especia. El desierto es tan vasto como el océano y las naves tan grandes que cubrirían pequeñas ciudades. Casi igual de grandes, gusanos subterráneos imposibilitan el trabajo en el planeta desierto. El sonido, acompañado de una banda sonora de Hans Zimmer, solo le añade a la enorme escala de esta película. En Arrakis, el Duque Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) acepta el rol que el imperio le ha otorgado: cosechar en el planeta más peligroso de todo el universo. Su hijo, Paul, tiene un rol mucho más grande de lo que puede imaginar. Este es el gran misterio de “Dune”, o de al menos la primera parte. ¿Cuál es el destino del joven Atreides? ¿Qué significan los sueños o visiones que se repiten en su cabeza? Más adelante queda claro que algunos son presagios, elemento que no necesariamente traduce al cine con el mismo efecto que en el libro, pues de nada sirve revelarle al público momentos que como elemento sorpresa habrían provocado una mejor reacción en la audiencia. Pero este es solo uno de los problemas que enfrenta este primer acto de dos horas y media, el cual parece más interesado en comenzar a montar las piezas para la segunda parte que en asegurar que esta primera sea efectiva. De nada vale la promesa de una segunda parte si los elementos que te ayudarán a hacerla posible en medio de una pandemia no están ahí. Fuera de impresionantes visuales y un elenco estelar, “Dune” tiene muy poco de lo que nos podamos aferrar durante la espera, la cual promete en lo mínimo ser muy larga. A diferencia de hace dos décadas con “LOTR”, Villeneuve no filmó todo a la vez, por lo que dependerá de los recaudos en el cine y nuevas suscripciones en HBO Max para recibir luz verde. ¿Serán dos horas de puro espectáculo visual suficientes para convencer al público general de regresar a Arrakis? Si esto no lo hace, la cinta apuesta a un enorme elenco que también incluye a Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård y Javier Bardem en roles reducidos por las limitaciones del medio audiovisual. Por otro lado, el elemento profético alrededor de Paul Atreides pudiese ser lo que finalmente enganche a una audiencia general en espera de una ejecución mucho más tradicional. La primera parte solo deja migajas mediante exposición breve de personajes como Stilgard (Bardem) y el villano, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Skarsgård). Este último debajo de un impresionante maquillaje y diseño que fortalecen el mayor de los aciertos de Villeneuve: su visión de este mundo. La existencia de “Dune” como película e imaginada por el director franco-canadiense es un logro en sí mismo, en especial con un mega estudio como Warner Bros. Fue en el propio Villeneuve que este estudio confió plenamente en el 2017 con “Blade Runner 2049”, otra propuesta visualmente trascendental que eventualmente no pudo conectar con audiencias alrededor del mundo. “Dune” tendrá como meta lograr lo que ni tan siquiera “Mad Max: Fury Road” logró pre pandemia y con $375 millones de dólares en recaudos: una secuela."
"Sep 13, 2021",POSITIVE," This review of Dune is part of our ongoing press coverage of the Toronto International Film Festival. From reviews to interviews to recap lists, follow along for all things TIFF 2021. Set in the far-flung future, Dune begins with a political maneuver. The emperor of the known galaxy has forced a shift of power between two warring houses, granting control of the desert planet Arrakis to the duty-bound Atreides clan. Located at the far edge of the imperium, the near-inhospitable planet is the only known supply of the precious natural resource known as “spice.” This psychoactive drug allows — among more mysterious side-effects — for interstellar travel. Compelled by imperial decree and the noble conviction that they will instill peace where the malicious House Harkonnen visited cruelty, the Atreides arrive on Arrakis keenly aware that something beyond the hostility of the desert means them harm. As the full extent of the trap reveals itself, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), the young Atreides heir, awakes to his great and terrible purpose generations in the making. To those familiar with Frank Herbert’s seminal 1965 novel, and the tumultuous history of its troubled adaptations, the very existence of Denis Villeneuve‘s Dune is nothing short of miraculous. Sure, it’s only half a film (more on that later), but it’s worth taking a moment to appreciate this new chapter in the property’s long and traditionally disastrous legacy on the big screen. The confounding oddity of the movie’s existence begins to come into clearer focus when you take a step back and survey Villeneuve’s career. With an appropriately prophetic thrust, it feels as though he has been building intentionally to this over the last decade. Is it so baffling that a man interested in unadaptable literature (Arrival), sacred sci-fi (Blade Runner 2049), and geo-politically tinged cycles of violence (Incendies, Sicario) would set his sights on Dune? Throughout his career, Villeneuve has, not unlike young Paul Atreides, surrounded himself with a posse of incalculable talent. Dune is perhaps the ultimate testament to its director’s uncanny knack for giving technical masters the elbow room to flex. Greig Fraser’s expansive cinematography does the requisite scale and grandeur of Arakkis justice. Cavernous seats of power and stately halls are endowed with the gravitational depth of black holes, endowing political machinations with an appropriate sense of smallness in the shadow of a Bigger Plan. Patrice Vermette’s production design, Tom Brown’s art direction, and Bob Morgan and Jacqueline West’s costume design are all deserving of praise. However you feel about Villeneuve’s visual penchant for austerity and brutalism, Dune’s world-building boasts a commanding sense of confidence that can’t help but be contagious. The world of Dune feels enormous and engulfing, a fitting visual perspective for a movie with such a wide-angled narrative scope and unapologetic ambition. One of the aspects that makes Herbert’s text so tricky to translate to the big screen is the immensity of its cast, with the added difficulty that many characters communicate in imperceptible flickers of body language and inferred group-think. Jina Jay and Francine Maisler’s casting direction does a laudable degree of heavy lifting, placing well-known performers in archetypal boxes.  Jason Momoa is the swashbuckling, ever-lovable Duncan Idaho, Charlotte Rampling is an imposing, religious figurehead. Oscar Isaac is the effortlessly charming, loyalty-commanding Atreides patriarch. Rebecca Ferguson and Chalamet are unambiguous standouts, endowing potentially cold characters with a depth and vulnerability that squeezes humanism out of a script with little time for such frivolities. As an unavoidable casualty of the movie’s stacked ensemble and narrative density, certain performances diminish into set-dressing. This is especially true of Chen Chang as Dr. Yueh (whose diminished screen time will surprise long-time Dune acolytes) and Stephen McKinley Henderson as Thufir Hawat. Stellan Skarsgård’s invocation of the fleshy Harkonnen figurehead is unique but unavoidably engrossing. The Dionysian pederast of Herbert’s novel has been replaced with a bloated Colonel Kurtz; it works and it’s a shame there isn’t more of it. Unpacking Dune‘s narrative strengths and weaknesses requires addressing the sandworm in the room. Namely, the fact that this is not a complete film. And its stopping point eschews anything resembling narrative satisfaction in an effort to force the second part into existence. Whether Villeneuve’s reckless gamble will ultimately pay off remains to be seen. But it bears repeating: this is not a self-contained film, thematically or narratively. Without both pieces of the puzzle, it is impossible to say if Villeneuve’s decision to bisect Dune in exchange for a longer runtime was worth it. On the one hand, despite its two-and-a-half-hour runtime, this movie flies by. Villeneuve is not languishing by any means, as testified by both the deserved and regrettable fat he has elected to trim. One especially troubling consequence of this abrupt “to be continued” is that it leaves the story’s most contentious and critical thematic through-line dangling uncontested in the wind. The white savior narrative of Dune appears here wrinkle-free. Without giving too much away for the uninitiated, that is dishonest to the primary thematic pulse of Herbert’s series. Leaving such an apparently irksome messianic storyline incomplete feels especially troubling given the narrative alterations Villeneuve makes to re-figure the local population of Arrakis into an explicit metaphor for settler-colonialism. On the whole, it is extremely difficult to assess the success of half of a movie, which is what we have on our hands. Despite occasionally buckling under the weight of its unwieldy source material, Dune is honestly adapted and inarguably the most coherent big-screen adaptation of this story. Villeneuve’s conviction in his source material is plainly evident in every frame and very little appears on-screen that does not exist in Herbert’s text. This isn’t to say that the cutting room floor isn’t absolutely littered with jettisoned weight, nor that all of this weight deserved to be tossed in the first place. Dune is very much a Villeneuve film through and through: economical, distant, and brimming with cooly-presented spectacle. Ultimately, Dune remains, as ever, a story that is going to captivate some and alienate most. This is not a failure on Villeneuve’s part so much as something unshakably coded into this buckwild story’s genetics. And while a film not being for everyone is by no means a bad thing, it does bode ominously for the as of yet un-greenlit second half. Those unfamiliar with the book who possess within them an affinity for this genre-space will invariably be hooked. Whether or not that will be enough to secure the second half of this story is another matter. Until then, I remain grateful that Villeneuve has forced the hand of Warner Bros. to realize one of the few truly unabashedly big-scoped sci-fi epics in recent memory. For all its faults, weaknesses, and missed opportunities, Dune is unapologetically weirder, more interesting, and more ambitious than any of its big-budgeted peers. And for that, I whole-hardheadedly hope that the requisite spice flows to enable part two."
"Sep 12, 2021",POSITIVE," PLOT: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the sole heir to the ducal House Atreides. When his father, Duke Leo (Oscar Isaac), is assigned to oversee spice production on the desert planet Arrakis, he’s plunged into a dangerous war between his father’s loyal subjects and the legions of House Harkonnen.  REVIEW: Like everyone else, I’ve been dying to see Dune ever since it was first announced. Denis Villeneuve (a fellow Quebecois) is one of the rare filmmakers left whose movies are always events, and Dune has been a passion project of his for years. It’s a brave movie to take on, given how David Lynch’s adaptation was a big enough flop that it would have destroyed his career had he not immediately bounced back with Blue Velvet (which is not to say his version of Dune is terrible – it’s not). Dune is based on a dense novel by Frank Herbert, and, in an optimistic move, Villeneuve opted to only film the first half of the book in the hopes that the pricey epic is a big enough hit to merit a second part to wrap up the story.  Our own JimmyO loved it, and I have to agree, Dune is the most lavish, exciting sci-fi epic we’ve gotten on the big screen in years. Villeneuve is a visionary operating at the peak of his talents, and everything about the film is exceptional – from the cast to the visuals to the music. Wisely, Villeneuve takes his time to establish the world of Dune, spending a good forty-five minutes developing all the characters before sending us to Arrakis. As a result, you get a sense of who Paul is and why he’s destined to be a great leader – much more so than in the Lynch film.  Chalamet plays him as a somewhat reluctant hero. His exceptional work in the vastly underseen The King is a good preview for what he does here. While physically slight, he’s got a sense of gravitas that gives the character a lot of weight. He’s ideal casting, in that he commits fully to the part, giving Paul a sense of responsibility and heroism that makes you root for him, but also hints at the more dubious morality of the character that will come into play in sequels (if we’re lucky enough to get them).  Zendaya, whose role has been hyped pretty heavily since the start, has a small part with, Chiani the Fremen woman he dreams of. But, again, if a sequel gets made, she’ll get a huge role in the next film, as will Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the Fremen leader and Josh Brolin as Gurney Hallack, one of Paul’s mentors.  Of the supporting cast, those who get a chance to shine are Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Momoa. Isaac’s Duke Leto feels like he could have been the star of his film to a certain extent, and his chemistry with Chalamet is strong. Ferguson is excellent as Lady Jessica, with her Bene Gesserit voice and intensity frightening at times. But, of everyone, Jason Momoa steals the show as Duncan Idaho. For those who haven’t read the book, he’s House Atreides’ resident badass, a swordmaster devoted to protecting Paul who makes alliances with the Fremen. He has the movie’s best action sequences, which focus on hand-to-hand combat and swordplay. I can see him quickly becoming a fan favourite. If I have any complaints, the bad guys – the Harkonen’s – are underdeveloped. Stellan Skarsgård Baron is hideous, but there are no memorable signature moments of cruelty here, such as the heart plug scene in the Lynch version. Dave Bautista’s Glossu Rabban also has a pretty minor role. Indeed, this is likely going to be the only significant problem people will have with the movie – in a lot of ways, it leaves you wanting more, although I imagine that’s by design.  Of course, I also have to join the “see iron the big screen” chorus. Villeneuve and DP Greig Fraser shot pretty much the entire film (90% or so) in IMAX, which is either 1:90:1 on Digital IMAX screens or 1:44:1 on the real deal ones. Either way, the film is drop-dead gorgeous, with Hans Zimmer contributing one of his best (and most unusual) scores in years, done in a way that’s meant to evoke instruments that would exist in the world of Dune.  If a sequel to Dune doesn’t get made, it’ll be one of the biggest tragedies in modern film, as Villeneuve’s delivered us half of a masterpiece. But, God willing, he’ll get the chance to finish it, as his version of Dune could go down as a classic.  Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel.  It looks like both Abigail and Guy Ritchie’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare aren’t likely to make much of an impact at the box office. We have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 Years Later, a trilogy of sequels to Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later."
"Sep 12, 2021",NEUTRAL," On the surface, Dune is ambitious and thrilling. However, it feels like a good movie that flirts with greatness but never quite gets there. Though it’s stunningly made and designed, the classic story just doesn’t hold the same weight as it did when it was first released and the decision to only release half of it doesn’t help.  Why did Blade Runner 2049 work when it really shouldn’t have? When it was announced that Denis Villeneuve would direct the sequel to Blade Runner it had already toiled in development hell for nearly two decades, usually the kiss of death even if the film eventually does see the light of day. However, Villeneuve delivered a singular meditative vision that didn’t set out to remake the original, but rather expand on the world that was already there and dive even further into its thematic depths. That’s what Villeneuve had to do with Dune, especially after David Lynch’s much-maligned 1984 adaptation. And while he delivered on the world-building and action, underneath feels like a lack of a beating heart. Erring closely to Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, Dune follows the members of House Atreides. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is tasked with stewarding the dangerous desert planet Arrakis, which is used by the Empire for its endless supply of “spice,” a powerful substance that has supernatural effects on humans. He, along with his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), journeys to the planet to begin the difficult work controlling the spice mining operation. However, political intrigue is afoot as Vladimir (an unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgård), Baron of House Harkonnen, is plotting the downfall of House Atreides. The world, captured gloriously by cinematographer Greig Fraser (Lion, Zero Dark Thirty), is built with terrific detail that makes it so fun to explore. The world is littered with fun details in the costumes (Ferguson’s Lady Jessica is a fashion icon), ships (dragonfly spaceships!), and culture. The mythology feels rich and deep. Like there are endless layers to parse through.  There is a gaggle of names and places to keep in order, but Villeneuve’s deliberate pacing makes it easy to keep track of the story — almost too easy. The story is quite simple, for better and worse. Better because heavy exposition tends to bog down sci-fi. On the other hand, he exposes how thinly built the plot of Dune is. Though Dune was heavily acclaimed at the time of its release and still stands as one of the most influential novels ever written, nearly six decades later we’ve seen countless iterations of the “chosen one” storyline that is at its core — Star Wars, The Terminator, The Matrix, even Harry Potter. This undercuts the exceptional world-building that Villeneuve accomplishes by giving us a story that frankly fails to take full advantage of what the world has to offer.  And the main part of that failure is Paul himself. The movie hinges on our desire for his success and the success of his people. And while yes, it’s easy enough to understand that House Atreides and the Fremen are good and House Harkonnen is bad, we’re never shown in earnest why we should root for them. We’re simply told. On the surface, Dune is ambitious and thrilling. The few action set-pieces are tight and suspenseful as are the scenes of pure dramatic heft. In particular, many of the scenes between Ferguson’s Lady Jessica and Chalamet’s Paul start to find the humanistic quality that the rest of the film is missing. In one scene, Jessica and Paul use their shared knowledge of hand signs and telepathic powers to take down a group of soldiers. It’s the kind of plot and character-driven action that made Blade Runner 2049 so successful. However, in Dune it feels like it slips away like sand through your hands as soon as it is over because it’s difficult to muster up a connection to any of the characters.  Dune, or Dune Part 1 as the title card puts it, feels like half of a movie. Unlike all the “chosen one” films I listed above, it can’t stand on its own. Even the introduction of the Fremen people (led by Zendaya and Javier Bardem) feels cut short. There is a lot of story to get through, but the decision to split the film may have stretched the story to its absolute limit. I don’t mean to sound overly negative. Dune is a good movie that flirts with greatness but just never quite gets there — much like the chosen one. But perhaps, as the story goes, it’ll get there in the end.

"Sep 12, 2021",POSITIVE," Sandworms, the signature creation of Frank Herbert’s Dune series, are colossal beings that live in the deserts of the planet Arrakis, which the worms travel through the way a shark might through water. Their dominance over the land has them alternately revered and feared by the different human populations who also live there, carving out lives in the unforgiving environs. The worms are drawn to anything out on the sand, capable of sensing vibrations from far away, and emerge from underneath their targets, the ground giving way to a gaping maw for anyone unfortunate enough to be in the area. When David Lynch directed his ill-omened 1984 adaptation of the original 1965 novel, he gave his sandworms multi-lobed mouths that opened like monstrous flowers, much like they had in John Schoenherr’s dust-jacket illustrations. It’s a dependable method for making anatomy look ominous — just have it look like a toothy vulva — but it’s not an approach Denis Villeneuve replicates in his own sumptuous and strange new take on Herbert’s source material. Villeneuve’s sandworms, like so many details of his new movie, strive to come across as genuinely otherworldly and from a context other than our own. They have a tunnel-like quality that’s organic only in the sense that microscopic organisms that turn out to be nightmare fuel when given their close-up are still organic, ending abruptly in circular jaws that are permanently agape and ringed by a filter made up of rows of needle-like teeth. When Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), Dune’s reluctant messiah figure, has an encounter with one after fleeing into the desert, the worm lifts its massive noggin out of the drifts right in front of him, and he stares into its unseeing countenance in a moment that’s meant to be electric with the terrifying majesty of this utterly alien life-form. But, gazing into that eyeless hole with clenching interiors glimpsed in its shadowy depths, it might also cross your mind that the reimagined worm left its old vagina dentata influences behind only to end up resembling a giant asshole. The human imagination is not as limitless as we like to pretend, and it’s funny how often, in trying to get beyond the boundaries of the known, we just end up circling back to our own privates. That’s the challenge of science fiction, to create a real sense of distance and otherness when so much of storytelling rests on evoking the familiar. It’s a challenge that Dune takes up with an admirable and maybe doomed determination, rendering Herbert’s rival intergalactic aristocrats and space witches on an awe-inspiring, gloriously unfriendly scale. Herbert himself didn’t build his world from scratch: The squabbled-over Arrakis, the only source for a substance called spice that’s essential to interstellar travel, is at the heart of what are basically oil wars writ large. And Dune does have the contours of a space opera, with its sand monsters and ghoulish villains and fine-boned princeling destined to meet the literal woman of this dreams — Chani, a member of the indigenous Fremen population played by Zendaya, who will presumably get more to do if the sequel actually happens — and lead humanity toward a better future. But Villeneuve isn’t interested in making a swashbuckling romantic adventure that happens to have sci-fi trappings. His 2016 film Arrival was about trying to communicate with extraterrestrials who experience existence in an entirely different way from us, and Dune is bent on depicting a far future humanity in which traces of the familiar — bagpipes played at a ceremony, an ancestor’s penchant for bull-fighting — just end up emphasizing how distant the characters’ desires and motivations can be. They aren’t entirely inscrutable: Oscar Isaac plays Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides, as a careworn but kind ruler who’s aware he’s being steered into a trap when asked to take over Arrakis. Leto’s trusted military advisers, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), serve as surrogate fond old brothers and stern uncles to Paul, while as Paul’s mother and Leto’s concubine Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson embodies the fretful tension of a woman torn between protecting her son and preparing him to face unavoidable danger. But Jessica also happens to be a loyal member of the Bene Gesserit, a matriarchal order of psychic women who manipulate politics while masterminding an unfathomable multi-century breeding program to create the Kwisatz Haderach — a messiah who may or may not be Paul. The most daring aspect of Dune is not that it only tells half a narrative, or that it opts to immerse its audience in its richly rendered universe, assuming they can keep up without guide ropes. It’s carried pretty far on the strength of spectacle alone, with its spaceships hanging impossibly still in the air, its thrumming Hans Zimmer score, and its pallid antagonist, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård channeling Marlon Brando’s Colonel Kurtz), floating around on anti-gravity boosters like a menacing balloon. No, the most daring aspect of Dune is how much unease it creates around the idea of a chosen one, from the Leni Riefenstahl–inspired military ceremony in which Leto and Paul receive their commission to take care of Arrakis to the fact that Paul is the product of eugenics. It begins with Chani talking in voiceover about the colonization of the Fremen’s land and the oppression they’ve experienced at the hands of rapacious outsiders, and then turns to a white savior whose greatness is entirely synthetic, engineered via planted prophecies and genetic manipulation. Paul’s reluctance to fall into the role created for him isn’t the usual self-doubt, but the dread of someone who begins to believe he’s meant to initiate a holy war. Being the hero of the story has never looked so poisoned, and that alone is thrilling enough to hope Villeneuve gets to make part two of this impressively batshit venture."
"Sep 12, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune (2021) is a visually stunning and massive piece of art. This movie was filmed for IMAX, which is obvious every step of the way. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is one of the most anticipated movies of 2021 and many are waiting with baited breath to see if it will deliver. Have no fear, this critic has seen it and can confidently say it is a work of art that old and new fans alike will enjoy. It is a massive, large scale project, that was made to watch on the biggest screen possible. Zimmer’s score, the cinematography, the action, the cast, and the heart that went into it all combine to create a nearly perfect film.  Dune is the story of a young man named Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, who is destined for greatness. Both his mother and his father’s family have high hopes for him. He is plagued by visions of a young girl (Zendaya). Eventually he must travel to an alien planet to harvest the most important thing in the universe — Spice — in order to ensure the future of his family. When a war breaks out and only those who can put their fear aside will survive. This movie is, simply put, gorgeous. It was shot for IMAX which is apparent in every single scene. Dune is not just a movie, it is an experience, and it begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. While the sets are magnificent, the costume design is also beautiful. Everything comes together so well in this movie, that viewers will be transported to Arrakis with Paul and his family. There is a lot to take in here, and it is truly magical when you do. Dune is not just visually stunning, the actors have amazing chemistry and does a fantastic job of portraying the popular characters. Just by taking a look at the cast list it is clear the see the star power here — Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Dave Bautista, David Dastmalchian — the list goes on and on. Every one has their moment, which is hard to do with a cast of this size. Sure, some have less lines than others but they all make an impact on the film. The chemistry between Chalamet and Ferguson, who plays his mother Lady Jessica, is the standout here though.  Having not read the books (yet), I cannot compare them to that, however, I can compare to the 1984 film adaptation and say without hesitation that this film is the superior one. Villeneuve’s direction makes this movie what it is, something that new and old fans can come together for. For those who nothing about the story, this is going to be an incredible journey to go on — and it does a great job of explaining the story well and making it intriguing and interesting. For those long time fans, they will be very pleased with the adaptation and the way the story unfolds with these actors. Of course since there is a war in this story, there is quite a bit of action in this film. The battles and fights are done with such incredible choreography that it almost feels like you are watching an intricate dance at times. The dialogue and story development is broken up well with these action scenes.  I would be remise if I didn’t mention just how amazing, and kind of gross, the Baron looks. In the 1984 he felt more silly looking to me, and did not come across as scary as he is supposed to. They really nailed the character in this version, however. The sandworm is incredibly cool looking as well. Dune is such a detailed story that there are a lot of development moments in the film. It is important for viewers to get to know the characters and what they are going through. There are a lot of pieces to the puzzle that have to be explained. Because of this there are some slow moments in the movie. This 2021 version of Dune is approximately 2 hours and 35 minutes — that is long, especially because this is just part 1 of the story. There are moments where the length is felt and it moves a bit slowly. That said, they are important moments and the overall film would not work as well if these details were not explained to the audience. These scenes are heavy with character and plot development but broken up nicely by spaced out action scenes. Villeneuve doesn’t ever let any of them go on too long, always careful to put something in to perk the audience back up before that happens. Dune is a very well done film that is not only visually stunning, but fully delivers on the story front too. The star studded cast all get their time to shine and have amazing chemistry together. There are a few I would have loved to see more of, but that would not be true to the story. The captivating and intriguing plot is sure to have the audience hooked from the start, and the score, visuals, and epic action will keep them entertained throughout. While it gets a bit slow at times, and the runtime is felt, it is all warranted. Hold onto your sandworms guys, this one is a beautiful journey. The best part of this 2021 version of Dune? It is only the beginning… Part 2 will hopefully be on it’s way to grace our eyeballs with yet another stunning take on the popular book, and continue the story of Paul Atreides. A visually stunning work of art, Dune’s captivating story will hook audiences from the start. The star studded cast all gets time to shine — particularly Chalamet & Ferguson.

"Sep 12, 2021",POSITIVE,"A breathtaking film worthy of the visionary Herbert's rich, sophisticated source material."
"Sep 12, 2021",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve’s galvanizing new film, which had its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Saturday night, is 100-percent worthy to stand next to those science fiction and fantasy epics. Believe it or not, at times it visually tops them. I heaved a sigh of relief early on. David Lynch’s infamous 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel was a spectacle in its time, but it was hard to watch then and it is impossible to watch now. Give it a try some night if you’re having trouble sleeping. I worried this new version would fall into the same style-over-substance trap. But the storytelling from the get-go is crisp and assured. Bold. Gargantuan. Herbert’s plot is dense, but once you get a handle on a few key words (Atreides, Harkonnen, Arrakis), the sandstorm lifts and you’re in the clear. Their family controls the desert planet of Arrakis, which is rich in valuable spice (think gold or oil) and infested by awesome giant sand worms. The peaceful House Atreides is determined to keep it out of the clutches of the evil House Harkonnen, who seek to plunder its resources and murder the natives, including a group of fighters called the Fremen (Zendaya is one). The Harkonnens are lorded over by the Baron, played by Stellan Skarsgård doing his finest Jabba the Hutt. “Dune” freaks will tell you that there’s much more to the story than that. Spare me your nasty social media posts, dudes — you’re right! For instance, Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a powerful being who teaches him “the way,” a kind of magic that involves mind control. There’s a ton of stuff like that. However, Villeneuve has focused on clarity and approachability with his movie. You don’t need to absorb every piece of trivia to have a fantastic time. Frankly, you could watch it on mute and your jaw would still drop. The richly imagined world combines ancient Egyptian and Middle Eastern aesthetics and blends them with elegant, futuristic technologies to create an absolutely mind-blowing, immersive environment.  To that effect, the acting, especially from Chalamet and Ferguson, isn’t stiff so much as formal and ceremonial. They are royalty in a millennia-old society rooted in tradition. Not Meghan Markle on Oprah. Chalamet’s gravitas surprised me. Gone is the boy from “Call Me By Your Name,” and in his place is a not-quite-man whose steps on the sand land with the thud of Neil Armstrong’s.  What a surreal premiere Saturday night was. We all sat, aptly, inside a giant spaceship-looking orb on Lake Ontario called the Cinesphere IMAX. Despite the massive scale of the event, it still felt small. Fans didn’t mob the red carpet, and irksome social distancing remains mandatory in Toronto. Nobody flippin’ cared. Five minutes in, our sphere faded away and was swapped with a distant, spectacularly envisioned galaxy. This movie is the first of two planned parts. Please, dear God, make the second one."
"Sep 12, 2021",POSITIVE," People of the world, spice up your life! Denis Villeneuve’s long awaited and highly anticipated Dune delivers on all expectations. Dune is a fully realized adaptation of Frank Herbert’s gargantuan novel. This is a huge and epic sci-fi adventure, and one doesn’t need to be a Dune die-hard to love it. I don’t particularly like the book, and this adaptation deftly synthesizes the world that Herbert created without dumbing it down. Moreover, with the help of contemporary technology and a well-honed hand for speculative filmmaking, Villeneuve’s interpretation succeeds where others fail. This nod to Dune appreciates the author’s magical hand at world building and demonstrates one storyteller’s genuine appreciation for another as Villeneuve and his crew transport audiences to another world. Dune is big screen escapism at its finest: one can hardly imagine a bigger and better cinematic adventure this year. Dune delivers the futuristic odyssey as the first of a proposed two-part epic. At two-and-a-half hours, the action doesn’t sag for a second. The choice to split Herbert’s novel in two is a smart one, though, since it’s such an intricately plotted and dense work. The main failing of David Lynch’s adaptation is its effort to cram everything into a film with the same running time. Lynch’s film is all exposition, and it’s a nonsensical bore. This Dune, however, packs everything in and yet the action never lets up. Dune is the most adrenaline-pumping thrill ride since Mad Max: Fury Road. Villeneuve’s film, with the director writing the screenplay with John Spaihts and Arrival’s Eric Roth, picks up the pace while immersing us in Dune’s world. For one, it benefits from rich visuals that illustrate what Herbert describes in words. For example, readers of Dune need to consult a glossary to know what a “gom jabbar” is, whereas viewers of Dune may simply recognize it as a spiky weapon. Film is also more forgiving as a medium when it comes to explanatory dialogue delivered by the right people, especially since Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) often takes the role of pupil. The adaptation makes Dune more accessible than it’s ever been before. Where the book is dense and alienating, the film is open and immediately engaging while being faithful to the story. Recapping the plot into any Dune review is a fool’s endeavour, but this journey to a galaxy far, far away observes as young Paul grows in stature in the House of Atreides. His father, the Duke (Oscar Isaac), has just received the honour of being steward of the planet Arrakis. The sandy planet, colloquially known as Dune, houses a rare spice that fuels interplanetary travel. The story smartly speaks to the wars that will inevitable wage as oil and gas supplies dwindle in a fossil fuel economy. However, Dune also evokes the generation of youth activists leading the green movement. Like Paul, they rise to the challenge of being leaders. His mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), hails from the matriarchal order of the Bene Gesserit, and instils within Paul her supernatural teachings. Paul’s two equally strong parents lend him a duality that is unique among action heroes. As Paul, Chalamet is perfectly cast in a role that calls upon his introspective brooding and youthful perspective. Chalamet, like Paul, is still summoning his voice and this performance is a forceful step forward. It’s a physically demanding feat, but he imposes a fierce and authoritative presence. Chalamet’s inherent earnestness also lends Paul an air of unshakable optimism. His power in Dune resides in the ability to radiate hope as the family faces one tragedy after another. Where other contemporary Hollywood blockbusters favour darkness, Dune refreshingly favours the light. As Paul’s parents, Isaac is expectedly suave, cool, and commanding as the Duke. Ferguson, meanwhile, fleshes out a character who is underwritten in other versions. The mother’s pride and anguish make the battles urgent as she watches Paul selflessly risk death repeatedly. The ensemble features a committed cast who prove that no role is too small to draw us into Dune’s enigmatic world. Cameo appearances by Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem are especially magnetic. As the House of Atreides assumes control of Arrakis, they immediately become targets of the Harkonnen, the previous keepers of the spice. From the moment they touch down upon the dune, Paul and his family are targets for traitors. Assassination attempts, raids, and tense altercations inevitably ensue. The Atreides become a house united yet divided as they flee amid a Harkonnen invasion. A lot happens in Dune—and I mean a lot—but the pace never lets up and the action never sags. The propulsive pacing keeps one’s interest enrapt as one action-packed sequence leads to the next. Villeneuve, in a way, constructs Dune much like a big screen Hollywood musical. In the best musicals, the songs advance the plot while dazzling us in escapist wonder. Dune follows the rhythm of a musical as each thrilling set piece develops Paul’s character, furthers the narrative, and increases the stakes. This is an emotionally engaged and character-driven story as the family fights to not only survive, but also fulfill their duty to ensure the survival of others. The most thrilling set pieces of Dune are those in which Paul encounters the humongous worms that slither through the sand in search of spice. One scene is a thrilling extravaganza that occurs on the Atreides’ first reconnaissance upon landing on Arrakis. As they survey their land and resources, a worm hones in on a spice harvester. As the Duke, Paul, and their allies rally to save the men working the harvest, the young Atreides has his first taste of the hallucinogenic spice. The intense action pauses sharply—the pacing of Dune is extraordinary—as Paul’s body and mind surrender to the spice, yet become heightened to the possibilities that reside on this new planet. Yet each worm encounter ups the ante. Paul, meanwhile, grows accordingly. As with any good musical, too, Dune constructs a land that is rooted in Earthly traits, but wonderfully escapist. Most impressive in Dune is the exceptional attention to detail that goes into crafting the world of Herbert’s adventure. Dune is cinematic world building of the highest order. The fantastic production design, costumes, and visual effects construct a cohesive empire rooted in Herbert’s imagination. The clothes of Dune are both nods to antiquity and perceptive anticipations of the next fall fashion spread. Fabulous ankle-length coats skirt the sand and accentuate Paul’s androgyny. Dune’s fashion sense injects it with a distinct feminine energy with billowing robes and chic scarves that harness Jessica’s authority and her influence on Paul’s destiny. Visually, a new world has never been so fully and richly realized since Lucas conjured Star Wars. Equally powerful in immersing audiences in Dune’s environment is the intricately layered sound mix that furthers the dual energies that Paul draws from his parents. Moreover, an evocative score by Hans Zimmer inspires a constant sense of awe and wonder. No film has every sounded quite like Dune as Zimmer looks not to the past, but to the future for inspiration. Using an unconventional arsenal of sounds, Zimmer creates a sonic tapestry of tribal warfare that reverberates with the anger of the gods watching the tragedy unfold. However, while the visual effects of Dune astonish, they never overwhelm the tale. Villeneuve keeps character at the forefront of Dune with the visuals playing a secondary role. This choice keeps it smarter and fresher than the average blockbuster. Yet the totally bananas interpretation of Herbert’s world unabashedly bears the fruit of an artist geeking out. Dune paya homage to the power of imagination. It’s genuinely thrilling to recognize Villeneuve’s sense of wonder in creating a vision that’s inspired his work. Beyond the scope, creativity, and technical accomplishment of Dune, Villeneuve delivers a cinematic experience that reminds a viewer why we go to the movies in the first place. It’s an exhilarating adventure from first frame to last. I didn’t realize how much I missed seeing films at the movies until I devoured Dune on the big screen in IMAX with thunderous surround sound. This is the best of Hollywood studio filmmaking: grand entertainment that engages the mind and soothes the soul. I can’t wait for part two.

"Sep 11, 2021",POSITIVE,"I consider it a feat in and of itself that Villeneuve managed to tell this vast, complicated space saga with such clarity and fluency."
"Sep 10, 2021",POSITIVE," One could present a compelling argument that Dune, Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel of interplanetary conquest, messianism, and ecological plunder, was the most cursed property in Hollywood. Since the 1970s, Dune has passed through more hands than a twenty-dollar bill. After David Lean, whose Lawrence of Arabia served as inspiration for Herbert’s desert-set sci-fi saga, passed, the project fell into the hands of Chilean mystic Alejandro Jodorowsky, who envisioned it as his Remembrance of Things Past—a 10-hour epic featuring Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, and Salvador Dali, with music by Pink Floyd. When the financing dried up, Dan O’Bannon, the film’s special effects supervisor, was so distraught (and flat broke) that he had a nervous breakdown, checked into a psychiatric facility, and penned the screenplay to Alien. That film’s director, Ridley Scott, then took a stab at Dune, assembling three drafts of the script over seven months only to abandon it in favor of Blade Runner. Next came David Lynch, who turned down Return of the Jedi to try his hand at the Herbert classic, believing it to be a sort of Star Wars for adults. But meddling by producer Dino De Laurentiis doomed the 1984 picture, which Lynch considers the only “total failure” of his celebrated career. Denis Villeneuve, the French-Canadian filmmaker that Scott handpicked to direct the sequel to Blade Runner, has finally realized a vision of Dune worthy of its source material. The film, which premiered at the 2021 Venice Film Festival—and hits theaters and HBO Max on Oct. 22—is a transportive journey through space and time that immediately takes its place among the science-fiction cinema greats, and that begs to be seen on as big a screen as possible. The year is 10,191, and the honorable House Atreides (think: House Stark), led by revered military tactician Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), has been granted the power of rule over Arrakis (aka “Dune”), a perilous desert planet rich in “spice”—a glistening natural resource resting in the sand and air that can both power ships for intergalactic travel and extend life (a stand-in for oil and opium). Arrakis had for 80 years been under the draconian rule of House Harkonnen, who made billions mining spice whilst persecuting the Fremen, its native people known for their piercing blue eyes (eat your heart out, Bradley Cooper) and fierce fighting ability. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the son of Duke Leto and heir of House Atreides, is haunted by visions of a battlefield riddled with the bloodied bodies of his people, and an enchanting Freman woman (Zendaya) with whom he forges a new path. Oh, and many people are saying that Paul may be the Mahdi, or messiah, owing in part to his divination and swordplay abilities. Casting Chalamet as the pampered progeny turned reluctant savior (basically Hamlet) is an interesting choice. While the FernGully-haired youngster photographs beautifully and broods with the best of ‘em, his gangly, sylph-like frame doesn’t make him a very convincing warrior, as previously evidenced in The King. Isaac, meanwhile, is pitch-perfect as Duke Leto, a hardened general with a soft spot for his scion, and Jason Momoa brings some much-needed levity to the proceedings as Duncan Idaho, Paul’s mentor and the resident badass of House Atreides. Other actors pop up too, among them Josh Brolin’s (square-jawed, yelling) Atreides tough, Javier Bardem as a mysterious Freman leader, a colder-than-ever Charlotte Rampling playing the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, and Stellan Skarsgard as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the gigantic, ruthless, and terribly pasty head of House Harkonnen who can levitate in the air. In films like this, however, the acting runs secondary to the spectacle, and the sheer scale of Villeneuve’s piece—augmented by Hans Zimmer’s booming score—is a wonder to behold. Continuing the brutalist/neo-fascist aesthetic he employed in Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve has built an elaborate world that is easy to get lost in; one where planes’ wings flap like insects, spacecraft resemble oval-shaped monoliths (as in his previous Arrival), and gargantuan sandworms police the desert. You do, occasionally, wish for a splash of color, though its muted yellow-gray palette is in keeping with a dystopian sandscape. One area of concern lies in Dune’s softening of Herbert’s book’s Islamism. While the cast is far more diverse than Lynch’s Aryan lovefest, there is nary a Middle Eastern actor in sight, and its Islamic influences are relegated to terminology, e.g. “Shai-Hulud,” “Mahdi” and “Lisan al Gaib.” The Fremen too, symbolizing Arab peoples, have been mostly pushed to the background, though will likely factor in more in future installments. It is not spoiling things to say that House Atreides’ stewardship of Arrakis is short-lived, and, after a stunningly staged siege, Paul and his mother are forced into the desert. Some may take issue with the fact that Dune ends on a cliffhanger—its onscreen title reads Dune: Part One, with two sequels and a Bene Gesserit TV spin-off set to follow (depending, of course, on how well it recoups its $165 million budget). But by the time it arrives, you’ve witnessed such staggering sights and sounds that a pause feels earned."
"Sep 9, 2021",NEUTRAL," Walking out of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One, I found myself trying to get into the mindset of someone who has never actually read Dune. Part One closes, narratively, at the equivalent of Lord of the Rings ending right after The Council of Elrond. Would someone who hadn’t read the source material be intrigued and drawn into the world Frank Herbert created? And would that be a failure of Villeneuve’s vision or just the evolving nature of what film looks like now? In-universe, House Atreides has been gifted the planet of Arrakis, known as Dune, the producer of the powerful and important spice melange necessary for space travel and can extend life. Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) travel to the desert planet apprehensive of the “gift,” knowing it is part of the Emperor’s plan to weaken House Atreides by putting them in direct conflict with their longtime rivals, the Harkonnen. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) plans to regain his profitable planet even if that means wiping out House Atreides. All the while, young Paul has started having visions of the future that lead him on a journey to becoming much more than he could ever imagine. A self-proclaimed fan of the books, Villeneuve tackled this project out of love and said during an interview with The Mary Sue that he did the film largely for himself. That sort of fanboy love is clear in how he had thoughtfully constructed the world—taking from the book, but also switching things up to make it seem better. His interpretation of the Voice, which could easily be jarring, made it seem imposing, and the shields look like something out of a video game—futuristic enough to be cool, but still feudal in construction. Dune‘s political story of imperialism, religion, and ecology is at the forefront, with Chani’s opening monologue highlighting the role that the Fremen have taken up in this society, their planet existing only to be harvested for its resources and its people subjugated. Of the main cast, Jason Momoa is the one who clearly understood the assignment. Momoa is fantastic and magnetic onscreen as Duncan Idaho, the swordmaster of House Atreides, to the point where I truly wanted more of him. Chalamet and Ferguson are the weakest of the bunch, with the latter playing a very weepy Lady Jessica that feels very tedious, especially because we don’t really get to see all the layers of her character. Those are mostly in Part Two. Chalamet’s Paul is doing his best, but it’s hard to play a sixteen-year-old who suddenly becomes a “god” in two and a half hours, especially when the scope of what that means is just words thrown out to the audience, like Kwisatz Haderach. Oscar Isaac is as hot as the movie’s teasers highlighted, but again, Leto I is a character, much like Chani, that exists only to give Paul ties to humanity. If you were looking for there to be a lot from him, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem, then you will be disappointed. In 1984, the first Dune adaptation was released under the direction of David Lynch. The film was a bomb and lambasted for the lack of faithfulness to the source material, to the point where even Lynch himself has denounced the film for not being his true vision. His “failure” and the failures of previous directors to bring the book to the big screen labeled the novel, as written by Frank Herbert, as un-filmable. Much has been made about the experience of seeing this movie on the big screen, and personally, I had a horrible experience watching Dune at my screening. It was the day of the east coast flooding from hurricane Ida, so I went to the screening in the pouring rain and left as the flooding began to pick up. During a key moment in the movie, the fire alarm went off, making it difficult to hear or watch the film, but the former was already difficult with Hans Zimmer’s score booming majestically as people whisper-talk. Ultimately, the biggest issue with Dune: Part One is that it is narratively incomplete. It is all exposition and worldbuilding with some cool fight scenes, but it is all leading to something we don’t see in this film and might not get to see if the sequel doesn’t get made. All I could think of was early Game of Thrones and how a product like Dune would thrive with Villeneuve’s vision on a weekly program like HBO. To me, Dune is not un-filmable; it is just not meant to be a movie. It has all the makings of a fantastic television series, but forcing Dune to fit into the big screen limits how much we are able to explore, every time. Dune premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Sept. 3 and plays at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 11. It opens in theaters and on HBO Max on Oct. 22."
"Sep 9, 2021",POSITIVE," For the record, Jodorowsky's #Dune would've been a sandy, sordid mess that would have made LOGAN'S RUN look like STAR WARS, and applauded with likes of LISZTOMANIA by very small group of fiends (myself included).

"Sep 8, 2021",POSITIVE," A diferencia de otros directores de prestigio que llegaron a la ciencia-ficción más o menos de rebote, Denis Villeneuve ama profundamente el género. Algo que se nota, y mucho, en Dune, una película que el cineasta canadiense lleva acariciando desde su adolescencia. La cuestión, pues, es plantearse si ese amor es correspondido, y si el resto de los mortales podemos participar en él al sentarnos frente a la pantalla.  Lo primero que puede decirse del filme es que este es, ante todo, ambicioso. Esta película no conoce otra escala que la ciclópea, con los diseños de Patrick Vermette esforzándose para que los protagonistas parezcan hormiguitas a su lado mientras Hans Zimmer se empeña más que nunca en su santa cruzada contra los tímpanos del espectador.  En general, Villeneuve no quiere fascinarnos, sino impactarnos, y, en último extremo, apabullarnos. Un empeño que no llevaría a nada de no ser porque el director conoce bien su materia prima y aplica unas cuantas normas elementales al presentarla. A saber: que sumergirnos en el mundo de la historia, mostrando las dinámicas sociales que moldean este futuro feudal y atan entre sí a los personajes, vale más que un millón de diálogos explicativos.  Cuesta recordar, la verdad, un blockbuster que haya mostrado tanto respeto por su público en los últimos años, aunque ese respeto implique dejar a dicho público en medio de un entorno hostil con unas pocas indicaciones sobre cómo orientarse en él. Gracias a esta decisión, la cinta se las apaña para resultar tan reseca y polvorienta como los paisajes que nos muestra. Y no hablamos solo de los desiertos del planeta Arrakis, convertidos por la cámara en una trama casi abstracta donde las dunas ondulan y se entrelazan entre sí como en una filigrana de sed. Nos referimos también a esa sociedad aristocrática de conspiradores donde la paranoia equivale a la cordura, y donde el contacto humano parece haberse extinguido.  De hecho, Villeneuve está tan empeñado en viviseccionar este mundo imaginario y sus relaciones de poder que, a golpes de escalpelo, reduce los vínculos entre sus habitantes a la mínima expresión, fiándolos a su reparto de estrellas para que estas se apañen con lo que el guion les deja.  Algunos intérpretes salen bien librados de esta prueba: Timothée Chalamet y Rebecca Ferguson, por ejemplo, muestran todo el horror y la ternura de la relación entre un hijo y la madre que quiso engendrar con él al arma definitiva. Otros, como Zendaya y Javier Bardem, no tienen siquiera materiales con los que trabajar. Y un tercer grupo, con Chang Chen a la cabeza, queda reducido a un esqueleto de motivaciones sin más peso que sus efectos en la trama. Un error que la denostadísima versión de David Lynch, con todos sus defectos, supo ahorrarse.  Donde más se nota esta pérdida es en los Harkonnen, esa familia de hienas que, en la novela original, funcionan tanto como villanos eficazmente repulsivos y como alivio cómico. Aquí, en cambio, su presencia queda reducida a unas cuantas escenas muy oscuras y muy ominosas, a la grotesquerie de ese Stellan Skarsgård flotante como el viejo barón Vladimir y a las presencias casi testimoniales de David Dastmalchian y Dave Bautista.  Por lo demás, eso sí, la película compensa estas carencias a base de adrenalina. Siempre moviéndose entre extremos, Dune juega a hacernos oscilar entre la hipnosis de sus visiones y la taquicardia de sus escenas de acción. Algo que funciona, y que le permite mantenernos pegados a sus imágenes… hasta que estas se acaban. Porque este filme es solo la mitad de una adaptación, y su abrupto final nos obliga a tenerlo muy presente.  Según un proverbio del pueblo Fremen, el desierto enseña la regla del cuchillo: cortar algo incompleto y afirmar ""ahora ya está completo, porque acaba aquí"". Pero Denis Villeneuve no puede permitirse ese lujo. Su película deja demasiadas cuestiones abiertas, y es obligación del director cerrarlas para así darnos opción a juzgarlas como corresponde. Esperemos que la taquilla, y los caprichos de los ejecutivos, le permitan hacerlo.  En un lejano futuro, el imperio de la humanidad depende de la especia Melange, una sustancia que solo se encuentra en el planeta Arrakis. La vida de Paul Atreides, el heredero de una familia noble, cambiará para siempre cuando llegue a ese mundo: su destino podría convertirle en el ser más poderoso de la historia, si es que sobrevive a una tupida red de traiciones e intrigas.  Queda prohibida toda reproducción sin permiso escrito de la empresa a los efectos del artículo 32.1, párrafo segundo, de la Ley de Propiedad Intelectual.

"Sep 7, 2021",NEUTRAL," The journey of Dune to the big screen has been an arduous one, to say the least. Frank Herbert’s landmark 1965 classic science fiction saga, which was followed by five sequels, was initially intended as an epic film to be directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky (a failed undertaking examined in the 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky’s Dune). Out of the ashes of the project, George Lucas borrowed heavily from Herbert to craft his Star Wars films, the success of which invariably cemented any future iteration of Herbert to seem derivative. Enter David Lynch’s 1984 studio production, a box office and critical failure, only recently recuperated for its attempt to mount a worthwhile adaptation despite considerable odds. A brief history is imperative for the context of Denis Villeneuve’s massive big budget spectacle for a planned trilogy of films. Requiring a certain modicum of success to justify completion, Herbert’s classic may as yet be doomed for another generation’s dismissal. In his two-and-a-half hour spectacle titled Dune: Part One, Villeneuve roughly gets through a little over half of the source novel, and despite navigating the dense world building and setting a properly serious tone, there’s something unfortunately a bit dead behind the eyes in a film feeling like an extensive prologue. While the novel provides an excellent roadmap to better assist in jumping into Villeneuve’s world, this latest version stands as an intensely well-produced visual spectacle perhaps a bit bogged down by the extreme pressure of requiring its success.
 For the purposes of understanding the narrative, the year is 10191 and the supreme ruler is Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV. Beneath him are several Great Houses, each with their own ruling family. In this version, a brief snippet of omniscient narration from Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen, assists in setting the stage. The desert planet of Arrakis has been controlled by the notoriously brutal Harkkonens, currently lorded over by Baron Vladimir Harkkonen (Stellan Skarsgard). The planet was originally intended to be a flourishing paradise, but it’s the only place in the solar system which produces something called the Melange Spice, a life-preserving substance which also has hallucinogenic powers and happens to be the only way interstellar travel remains possible (i.e., oil and gasoline to our current Luddite standards). The Harkkonens are corrupt, but must contend with the indigenous populace they’ve tried to eliminate, known as the Fremens, who live deep within the desert realm. There’s also the problem of the extremely hot weather, but mainly dangerous sandworms, attracted by any sort of vibration imperil spice production. The worms tend to consume necessary equipment and manpower, resulting in a complex system of spice harvesting. However, the emperor of the Imperium has decided the House of Atreides, ruled by Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and currently charged with the ocean planet Caladan, will take over as fief ruler of Arrakis. The Duke and his people are suspicious, as this upset will likely cause civil war between the Houses—in short, it’s a move potentially meant to cause the House of Atreides to fall. However, an intricate prophecy is also at play. The Duke’s royal concubine (they remain unmarried in case he has to marry someone to unite one of the Houses), Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a long-standing group of women who are basically witches, guiding the power of their entire world from the shadows. The Bene Gesserit have sworn only to bear females, but Jessica broke the rules by giving the Duke a son, Paul (Timothee Chalamet), who she believes is destined to be the Kwisatz Haderach, the prophesied male who will basically have Bene Gesserit abilities and inspire a religious war across their universe. As Atreides suspected, the emperor is duplicitous, dispatching his own Truthsayer, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), the head of the Bene Gesserits, to broker a secret deal whereby the Emperor will secretly supply three of his own battalions, the Sardaukar, to assist the Harkkonens in wiping out House Atreides. As they attack, Paul and Jessica are thrown into the desert to seek refuge with the Fremens, where they attempt to regroup. For those familiar with Herbert’s novel or Lynch’s previous film, there may be some measure of disappointment considering where Villeneuve decides to break off. In essence, it becomes a film existing in a sort of nebulous exposition, whereby we have precious little time to dig into any sort of characterization, with names and terminology whizzing around in the first hour, descending into an extensive cat-and-mouse rhythm for the second half. Where Villeneuve most impresses is his enhancement of the villainous Harkkonens. Herbert himself seemed disinterested in his baddies, while Lynch makes them look like denizens of Oz after a nuclear explosion. The scope of this Dune also feels massive, requiring a continuation for this standalone prologue to make any real sense of generating any kind of impact. Like David Lean making a sci-fi soap opera, the technical feats are exemplary. A score from Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Greig Fraser are insistently dark, sometimes almost too muted, and if there are any visual complaints, there’s a lack of grandeur (the worms, for instance, though impressive, aren’t yet presented as equals to Carlo Rambaldi’s creations from 1984). While Villeneuve and his co-writers do their best to dance around a whole slew of characters, there’s little characterization for its main protagonist, Paul, and Chalamet, though more appropriately cast than Kyle MachLachan was, is backed into a monotonous corner. Stellan Skarsgard and David Dastmalchian (Harkkonen’s Mentat, characters who are, more or less, human computers) are both effectively creepy, with Rampling doing what she does best as a withering, imperious forcefield all her own. Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac are appropriately anxious, but a myriad of other characters require more screen time to make any sort of sense, like Stephen McKinley Henderson, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, and Jason Momoa. However, kudos to Villeneuve for exciting cast choices all around, including Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Liet Kynes and Chen Chang as Dr. Yueh (who were played by Max Von Sydow and Dean Stockell, respectively). If there’s any rubric for which to approach Villeneuve’s Dune, it’s to recognize this is an extremely ambitious approach to bringing Frank Herbert’s novel to life, requiring a continuation to a major film event which ends with its own justification of being ‘just.a beginning.’ Los Angeles based Nicholas Bell is IONCINEMA.com's Chief Film Critic and covers film festivals such as Sundance, Berlin, Cannes and TIFF.

"Sep 7, 2021",POSITIVE," Much has been made of Denis Villeneuve’s crusade for the physical institution of cinema but one thing is for certain: his much-delayed Dune is a phenomenon fit for the largest of screens. This is sheer science-fiction spectacle the likes of which hasn’t been seen in a long time, marrying the stark cinematography and eerie scoring of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 with complex worldbuilding mythology based on Frank Herbert’s notoriously prickly space epic. Villeneuve has always had flair, and Dune might be the biggest arena he has played yet. As with most visual auteurs, Villeneuve works best when there is meat on the bone, substance to his style. Colonialism unsurprisingly threads through this tale of a sinister empire controlling a desert planet’s rare resources, and Villeneuve is not shy in his indictment: “They ravage our lands in front of our eyes,” Zendaya’s Chani, a member of the planet Arrakis’ indigenous Fremen tribe, echoes in the opening voiceover. As the warring households fight over “desert power”, Villeneuve audaciously resists the relentless grind of plot for dramatic tableaux that articulate the overwhelming force of imperial control, characters silhouetted against military crafts and halls of soulless wealth. Most awe-inspiring, however, are the two thrilling set-pieces featuring Arrakis’ famed sand worms, monstrous creatures whose nonhuman enormity dwarfs the humans and their petty power struggles. At times Dune feels like it is holding back; perhaps because it only covers the first half of Herbert’s novel, perhaps because this investigation of power lacks the weighty interrogation of the human condition that made Arrival in particular so enrapturing. Yet balanced by a largely stellar cast (inexplicably none of whom are Middle Eastern despite the source material’s clear geopolitical parable) and sumptuous visual storytelling, Dune breathes life into Herbert’s plentiful world. SYNOPSIS: When the noble house of Atreides, led by Duke Leto and his son Paul, are ordered to take over command of the desert planet Arakis and its rich supply of life-giving spice, alliances within the empire begin to fracture."

Yes, the sandworms are awesome. Gigantic voracious tubes with thousands of scimitar teeth that curve inward to form a kind of giant eyeball, they’re a bit like what would happen if the Channel Tunnel had a baby with a Sarlacc.These subterranean nightmares that lurk beneath the surface of the vast desert planet of Arakkis are just one element of this big, thinky blockbuster to seriously exceed expectations. An epic sci-fi full of premonitions, Dune director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) must have had a few of his own when he set about bringing Frank Herbert’s thematically dense book series to the screen: mostly involving sobbing into his on-set coffee at the sheer enormity of cramming it all into a film.But the Canadian filmmaker has nailed it where, in different ways David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowksy and Ridley Scott all floundered. His Dune is sprawling, spectacular and politically resonant in its critique of colonialism and exploitation. Okay, technically it doesn’t have an ending – it’s ‘Part 1’ of a series that may not get a Part 2 – and not everyone will get along with the levels of patience Villeneuve demands of his audience, but those who do will be rewarded with precise storytelling, visual fireworks and some god-level world-building. The bulk of Dune unfolds on Arrakis. It’s a severe and inhospitable place from which the cruel overlords of the House Harkonnen extracts spice – a prized commodity used to power space travel – and fight the indigenous Freman people, who use it for spiritual enlightenment. The insurgency comes to an abrupt halt when the Emperor swaps the Harkonnen for the more enlightened House Atreides. Of course, as any Dune stan will tell you, this is just a trap to eradicate the fancy-dan Atreides altogether. At the heart of these Shakespearean machinations is Timothée Chalamet’s gifted, introspective Paul Atreides. He’s a Prince Hal-like figure who may just be the messiah-like chosen one the universe has been waiting for. He has inherited political power from his dad (Oscar Isaac) and magic from his mum (Rebecca Ferguson). He can use his voice as a mind-control device and has surprising fighting skills for one so tousled. The wrinkle is he’s young and gauche – the voice thing is still a bit hit-and-miss – and the clock is ticking. The evil Harkonnen is on the verge of a galactic double-cross that will leave Paul on a hero’s journey across the remote, lethal badlands of Arrakis. There are portents involving knives, battles and a mysterious Freman (Zendaya). Oh, and a Jedi-like religious cadre called the Bene Gesserit, who get shortish shrift from a screenplay by Villeneuve, Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts that mostly makes sage decisions about what to include and what to omit from Herbert’s  source material.If you’ve read the books, you’ll know what all these premonitions signify; if you haven’t, no biggie. Hang in there for the giant worms. And hang in there, too, for some expertly handled action sequences. Unlike a lot of skittishly cut modern-day blockbusters, Villeneuve allows his to breathe with measured editing and VFX that blends into the massive sets and desert locations (Dune was partly filmed in Jordan’s famous Wadi Rum). Also cool is the insect-like tech – spaceships flutter like dragonflies and drones hover like bees – and a Hans Zimmer score that sits halfway between Maurice Jarre’s work on Lawrence of Arabia and the György Ligeti used on 2001: A Space Odyssey. Chalamet is rock solid as this Luke Spicewalker figure, but everyone is watchable here – there’s no Sting to stink the place up. Pick of the supporting cast is Stellan Skarsgård, who channels Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now as the Harkonnen’s bloated head honcho, the Baron. He’s a power-hungry schemer whose litany of monstrous traits includes floating through the air like an evil children’s balloon. Like a lot in Dune, he’s shrouded in gloom and hardly a laugh riot, but he’s not short of substance. He’s just one reason to hope for Part 2. Dune premiered at the Venice International Film Festival.

"Sep 6, 2021",NEUTRAL," Dune has been adapted for the screen before with mixed results, but Denis Villeneuve's attempt is the most ambitious of them all – and the one with most riding on it. As a fan of Frank Herbert's seminal sci-fi novel, Villeneuve refused to squish the novel into one movie like David Lynch did in 1984. Warner Bros agreed to a two-part adaptation, like it did with Stephen King's It, but it's up to the first part to ensure that Villeneuve gets to return to complete his vision. The director is confident that the studio is happy with his first movie and wants the sequel, yet he's admitted that it's still a numbers game. Villeneuve has been stung at the box office before with Blade Runner 2049, so could Dune – or Dune: Part One as it's called on screen – prove to be second time lucky? While we've had to wait for it to arrive, Dune has now arrived in cinemas and there's plenty to savour in this version. Ultimately though, it's a bit of a frustrating watch as it's very much a story half-told. Working with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, Villeneuve has adapted roughly half of Herbert's best-selling novel for Dune: Part One. It's a considerable task as even though it's only half of the story, there's a dense and complex world to establish. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is about to have his life changed when his father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) accepts control of desert planet Arrakis. It's the source of ""spice"", the most valuable substance in the universe for its life-enhancing properties, but Leto knows the new assignment is a trap set by his enemies. The planet of Arrakis alone would be a daunting task to adapt as there's conflict with the Fremen natives to establish alongside the spice mining and some giant deadly sandworms. However, the movie also has to set up the enemies of the Atreides family, including the horrific Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), and the Bene Gesserit religious sect who have a key role in Paul's ultimate destiny. It's a lot to be juggled as it's all important background to Dune's main 'chosen one' arc of Paul. Aware that he's only telling half of the story, Villeneuve also uses Paul's prophetic dreams to tease what's to come if he gets to tell the rest of the story. For fans and newcomers alike, they're exciting glimpses of events to come and work in much the same way as the MCU teases future events. To the writers' credit, Dune: Part One is rarely confusing for newcomers in spite of the sheer wealth of information. There might be smaller details only captured by fans or on a second viewing, yet in utilising the two-part approach, Herbert's world is brilliantly realised on screen. However, while it's commendable that Villeneuve has given the world time to breathe on screen, it does affect the pacing. Dune: Part One clocks in at a weighty 155 minutes and for large parts, there feels to be minimal forward momentum as time is spent on exposition and world-building.  It's something that works better on the page than it does on screen and it's exacerbated by the fact that we're only seeing half of the story. Fans who know where it's going might feel more lenient towards the measured pacing, but for others, it will feel like just as the movie starts getting going towards something, it ends.  This won't be an issue if we do see a Part Two as it's no different to how the likes of Lord of the Rings and It told one complete story over multiple movies. The problem is that even in a 'normal' world, Dune would be a difficult sell at the box office, so you can't help worrying that this is all we're going to see. As to be expected with Villeneuve, it's a classy and beautifully executed sci-fi with a terrific score by Hans Zimmer. As a big-screen outing, the movie is gorgeous to behold, and you can understand why the director would be worried that some of that awe will be lost on a smaller screen. While it might not be an action-heavy offering, the set pieces don't disappoint when Villeneuve unleashes them, such as a dramatic sandworm attack and an explosive nighttime assault. There's political intrigue and an emotional weight to proceedings that mean they're not just empty thrills. With Part Two set to up the ante, it's an exciting prospect. The set pieces provide a welcome diversion from the exposition and the sometimes overly serious tone of the movie. At times, it feels as though everyone is a bit miserable in Arrakis and weighed down by either destiny or an ominous future. It doesn't mean we want Star Wars quips, but when everybody is sombre and not much is going on, Dune: Part One isn't the most enticing of watches. It's fortunate that Villeneuve has an exceptional cast to fall back on who live up to their billing as one of the best ensembles of the year. Most are playing roles we know they're capable of – David Dastmalchian as a slightly creepy villain, for instance – but they fit perfectly into this world. There's not a single person we'd back to seriously say ""desert power"" without any irony than Oscar Isaac. Chalamet slightly suffers from a familiar 'chosen one' role, but has the natural charisma to keep you on side as he broods endlessly. His standout moment comes with the exceptional Gom Jabbar Test of Humanity sequence, Chalamet selling an outlandish concept and holding his own against the always-wonderful Charlotte Rampling. Anyone going to see Dune: Part One for Zendaya will be disappointed though because, as she's been saying, Chani barely features in the movie. She gets the opening narration, but is otherwise a peripheral figure. As with prophetic glimpses that Paul sees throughout, Chani will be a major player in the second movie – assuming we get there, of course. And that's the overriding feeling you'll be left with when the movie ends just as all the pieces have slotted into place. It feels frustrating as it's a story half-told, but if Villeneuve gets to complete his vision, then the heavy expositional lifting will feel a worthwhile endeavour. There's a lot to admire in Dune: Part One, especially in terms of the impressive world-building and the excellent cast. However, you're left thinking about how good the second part will be, rather than being totally fulfilled with this movie.

"Sep 4, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune is not a film for the faint-hearted. And I mean that literally, not figuratively. This booming, mega, intergalactic saga will shake your seat and make your heart pound. It’s full-on from start to finish (though of course there is no real finish, this being touted as ‘Part One’) and is huge in scale, length and depth. Director Denis Villeneuve has grappled with Frank Herbert’s tricky cult ’60s novel and has managed to conjure a coherent and manageable tale. Essentially, as with so many sci-fi plots, the story is as old as the hills. A young man, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is worried about the onerous duties required of him as the son of a duke (Oscar Isaac). The duke has just been awarded custody of the planet Arrakis, a provider of a ‘spice’ harvested from its vast deserts that is used to enable space travel. The island has been run by the cruel and viscid baron (Stellan Skarsgard), who wants his lucrative planet back. Meanwhile the planet’s indigenous inhabitants (the Fremen – their name both ironic and portentous) are seeking to survive while other planets come and exploit them. Added to this is a subplot that involves Paul’s mother (Rebecca Ferguson) as a concubine with extraordinary powers. She has passed on and taught her gifts to her son, despite the admonishments of her head reverend mother (an imperious and scary Charlotte Rampling). Is this gifted boy the future liberator and leader of Arrakis? What are the visions Paul has of the strange and beautiful Fremen girl (Zendaya)? The great ensemble cast features such classic blockbuster characters as the loyal tough-guy with a heart of gold (Josh Brolin), the maverick fighter pilot and friend to the young dukeling (Jason Momoa – who makes a good joke about Paul’s lack of muscles), the mysterious doctor (Chang Chen) and a host of other stars illuminating this galaxy far, far away. It’s no spoiler to assume that some of them won’t make it to the end of the film. There are also dangerous creatures – the giant sand-burrowing worms that inhabit the planet, but none as dangerous as the humans fighting for control of the precious spice. The film is a strange mix of your usual crazy big spaceships, zapping gizmos and high-tech body shields combined with basic sword fighting that wouldn’t look amiss in a sword-and-sandal blockbuster depicting ancient Rome. There are bagpipers and royal seals imprinted with wax, soothsayers and sorcery. Similarly, the excellent costumes are also a melange of the ancient and futuristic – we could be in medieval Scotland or twenty-first century sub-Saharan desert. As the very near future foresees famines, wars and displaced people due to water shortage on planet Earth, the correlations between the planet Arrakis and our own are spelled out by Villeneuve."
"Sep 4, 2021",POSITIVE," For eager fans the wait for the big-screen release of the remake of David Lynch’s 1984 cult classic has felt like centuries. So it feels apt that in one of the first scenes of this thrilling sci-fi, the year is declared as 10,191. The world is a very different looking place, with planets being run by noble houses. The story, adapted from Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, concentrates on the gifted young Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), who is born into a destiny beyond his understanding. His father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) decide to ensure the future of the family and their people by relocating to the dangerous desert planet, Arrakis, which is the source of the ‘spice’ – the most valuable substance in the universe. There are greedy enemies wanting to take the family down everywhere, with the grotesque and most repugnant being in the form of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). There’s no doubt this film has a stellar cast including award winners Zendaya, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Jason Momoa and a scene from Brit actress Charlotte Rampling that is so terrifying it’ll have you sitting on your hands. Director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) clearly knows how to handle a sci-fi, but he also brings a gentle rawness to the film, that isn’t all visual stunts and CGI. Some scenes are stripped back to the bare basics, and the solid cast are able to keep you enthralled. At some points the whispery dialogue is lost due to the booming music score being so loud and there’s a few too many dream sequences (the laziest trick in film) for my liking. That aside, Dune isn’t just one for the sci-fi super fans – it’s a big budget blockbuster that is not exclusively for those with a well-thumbed copy of the novel. Villeneuve has made this version easier to digest, which will – no doubt – help it at the box office."
"Sep 4, 2021",POSITIVE," David Lynch’s 1984 Dune is a great movie and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Its garish opulence, and a self-destructive insistence on favouring eccentric micro-textures over basic coherence, means that the door has always been left ajar for someone else to sneak in and take another crack at Frank Herbert’s mind-expanding 1964 opus. As a result of a since-childhood crush on the book, Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve has decided to up sticks and decamp to the desert hellscape of Arrakis in search of the spice melange. From the reams of backroom intrigue, unscrupulous politicking and densely-wrought pan-global mysticism he has produced a film which does justice to a hallowed text while retaining the slick formal shape of a pop movie. And that, in itself, is no small achievement. Where Villeneuve’s previous film, Blade Runner 2049, too often embraced soporific longueurs as a shortcut to profundity, here the sheer meatiness of this ripping yarn is always visible through the porous skin of the film’s immaculate form. The director’s now patented landscape tableau style – in which small figures are engulfed in epic, painterly vistas – helps to create one of the most visually breathtaking and boldly idiosyncratic blockbusters to drop down the chute in a long while. Indeed, this is a hard sci-fi movie rather than a traditional blockbuster, and heeding this in advance may help to enhance enjoyment. Condensing a book that is stuffed with detail was always going to be a question of what stays and what goes. As an adaptation, Villeneuve has managed to retain a lot, and doesn’t have to sprint through it all like Lynch had to with his truncated theatrical cut. Thankfully, Dune isn’t just a rush of information and vacuum-packed story filler. The important scenes are allowed to play out in a way that allows for a slower, more satisfying reveal of character motivation, as well as adding necessary ballast to the emotional foundations for later in the saga. While there’s a huge cast of characters, Villeneuve has been fairly ruthless in slicing things back to essentials. Fan favourites such as Dr Yueh (Chen Chang), Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and Piter De Vries (David Dastmalchian) are given short shrift, and Duneheads may feel a little crestfallen by these omissions. (Momoa, admittedly, does a lot with little.) The focus, instead, is trained on Timothée Chalamet as Paul, heir to the dukedom of the noble House Atreides, and Rebecca Ferguson as his mother, a telepathic Bene Gesserit sister named Lady Jessica. Chalamet excels in the lead, bridging the gap between effete royal roughneck-in-waiting to elbow-fighting war machine with convincing certitude. In many ways, Paul traverses a similar arc to Elio from 2017’s Call Me by Your Name, making the hero’s journey from juvenile confusion to tempestuous adulthood with a sudden jolt from invading destiny. Ferguson, too, is no slouch, bringing the fully rounded anxieties of motherhood to a role that is key to the book. The film is quickly boiled down to this essential mother-son relationship, which is ceded on from Paul’s apprehensively adoring relationship to his father, Duke Leo (Oscar Issac, again doing a lot with a little). As this grand tale of warring families and intergalactic trade feuds plays out, Villeneuve takes time to emphasise Dune’s malleability when it comes to its allegorical potential. For every viewer who reads it as a film about the futility of war and the damage it wreaks on all sides, others will see a careful dismantling of capitalism and a critique of the ways in which it can be exploited. It also offers a refreshingly ambivalent attitude towards colonial rule, as even the good guys can’t help but fall into a position of unchecked cultural plunder. Another nice touch: this version of Dune does away with computer effects as a form of empty spectacle, eschewing touchscreens and tired holographic imagery in order to embrace a refreshingly analogue design schema. This ranges from the expansive handmade artworks which adorn the ducal palace on Arrakis, to the sight of a very old school control set-up in the ’thopters (bug-like helicopters) which includes an altimeter that appears like it was snagged from a car boot sale in the ’80s. Be warned: this is only part one of Dune, and it takes us to the roughly middle of the book. Some may find its set-up a little too ominous, even though there are a couple of exciting late game action set-pieces designed to get the heart pounding. But in the main it’s a stately film, exacting and elliptical, more in the slow-release tradition of David Lean than the candy-coated insta-high of the MCU.

"Sep 4, 2021",POSITIVE," To call Denis Villeneuve’s science-fiction extravaganza Dune a good example of its type of thing is probably damning it with fainter praise than it deserves. As someone who has zero interest in most books beloved by proselytizing, glassy-eyed dudes of the 1970s and 1980s, I always figured I could never be a Dune person. But I sort of enjoyed Villeneuve’s Dune—premiering out of competition at the Venice Film Festival and opening in the United States later this fall—and though it’s hard to say if serious Dune dudes will approve, what Villeneuve has put onscreen proves, at the very least, that he respects the source material to just the right degree. He neither genuflects to it nor tries to tart it up as a flashy, self-satisfied blockbuster flimflam. As movie spectacles go, it’s admirably understated: What can you say about a movie that makes the absolute most of sand? Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel has long been considered unfilmable: Chilean-French filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky tried, unsuccessfully, to tackle it in the 1970s, and David Lynch’s 1984 version was widely viewed as a disappointment. Admittedly, Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) has a bunch of modern filmmaking tools available to him that those filmmakers didn’t, but at least he makes good use of them. The story is set in the year 10191, on a dry desert planet, Arrakis, that’s rich in “spice,” a substance needed for interplanetary travel. The planet’s longtime inhabitants are the Fremen, desert people who have found ways to survive in a harsh environment—one of their mysterious and dignified denizens, Chani (Zendaya), shimmers into view in a series of dream sequences, before materializing in real life. For the Fremen, spice is a consciousness-enhancing substance, and they value it dearly. But other inhabitants of their interplanetary network think nothing of harvesting all the spice they want, giving the Fremen people nothing in return. (Dune, in case you haven’t guessed, is heavy with geopolitical and religious symbolism of all sorts.) The emperor of all the planets puts the head of a noble family, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, in a woolly gray beard), in charge of Arrakis. Atreides intends to be fair and benevolent. But when he moves to this unwelcoming, parched planet with his concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and his teenage son, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), it becomes clear the emperor has drawn him into a web of deceit. Lots of stuff happens in Dune, and this is only part one. (Villeneuve has expressed confidence that he’ll be able to finish the story in a second installment.) There are many scenes of flying vehicles buzzing about like iron dragonflies. Warriors go to battle with shimmery swords, their skin sizzling when they’re struck or wounded. Little mechanical bugs can shoot right into your skin and immobilize you before killing you, slowly. Jessica, one of the movie’s most compelling and enigmatic characters, is a member of an all-woman secret society with mystical powers. At one point, that group’s mother superior, played by Charlotte Rampling in a black beaded nun’s veil, tests young Paul’s fortitude by forcing him to stick his hand into a nasty box of pain, a gizmo the size of a box of tissues. His suffering is intense, and the anguish shows on his little acorn face—but then he gets used to it, and suddenly it’s no biggie. Previously skeptical mother superior has to admit to Jessica, the anxious mom, that this lackadaisical teenager just might have special powers of his own—but the jury is still out. Because, of course, Dune is largely a story about a young man proving himself. Villeneuve presents this tale as an unapologetically poker-faced futuristic parable. There are characters with names like Duncan Idaho (who happens to be played, charmingly, by Jason Momoa), and everyone is waiting for someone known as the Kwisatz Haderach to show up. Villeneuve lays it out before us without smirking or winking; his go-for-broke earnestness feels honest and clean. And the effects, while lavish, also have a tasteful, polished quality. Particularly impressive is the massive Arrakis predator known as the sandworm, a fearsome creature that first makes its presence known as a giant ripple of action beneath the sand, before poking its lamprey-like head aboveground to sweep its prey—machinery, people, whatever—into its toothy gob. The sandworm is the stuff of nightmares, but Villeneuve’s vision of it has a shivery elegance. Dune is sluggish in places—my eyes glazed over during one or two or maybe three of the battle scenes—but Villeneuve’s conviction counts for a lot. I would probably sit through Dune Part Deux willingly—though Herbert’s book, I’m afraid, will remain forever unread."
"Sep 4, 2021",NEUTRAL," It is hard to be fully immersed in Dune when its title card boldly states “Part 1” and its final scene sees a wistful Chani (Zendaya) soulfully declare “This is only the beginning”, while longingly staring into the horizon – perhaps looking for the magnanimous pot of gold required to fund a sequel. Yet, there is still much to chew on in director Denis Villeneuve’s monumental epic sci-fi, adapted from the eponymous Frank Herbert book. Dune lacks the spellbinding visuals of Villeneuve’s last foray into sci-fi, 2017’s neo-noir Blade Runner 2049, a sensory feast that commanded colours with the grace of a snake charmer. In this Roger Deakins-less venture – Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty, Rogue One) is on cinematography duty here – colour is as rarely seen as the mighty worms that plague Arrakis, the desert world on which Herbert's story takes place. When both grace the screen, however, the crisp yellows of the sand crumbling to the power of the crawling creatures, it is as if Dune comes to life, leaning fully into what it could have been. Out of the stellar ensemble cast led by the always charming Timothée Chalamet as Oedipean prophet Paul, the greatest surprise is Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho, a salt of the earth swordmaster. With enough charisma to flood the arid lands of Arrakis, Momoa swiftly steals the coveted spotlight, split by a parade of big names that are granted very little time on screen. Unfortunately, nothing in Dune quite reaches the same level of pizzaz as Momoa, but – fear not – it is still a highly entertaining voyage."
"Sep 4, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve recently compared watching his new film Dune on a television to driving a speedboat in your bathtub. He couldn’t be more right. Unveiled out of competition at the Venice Film Festival, this adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel belongs on the biggest of screens. Wisely, Villeneuve has only taken on the first half of Herbert’s enormous novel, leaving room for a second or even third movie. The poorly received David Lynch version from 1984 will now surely be consigned to oblivion, for this must be seen as definitive. Timothée Chalamet, in his most adult role yet, plays Paul. Heir to House Atreides, he accompanies his father (Oscar Isaac) and his father’s concubine (Rebecca Ferguson) to the desert planet of Arrakis for a life-changing mission. It is here where the drug Melange is mined. “Spice”, as it is nicknamed, has medicinal and metaphysical properties, making it “by far the most valuable substance in the universe”. Also on this inhospitable scorched earth are the native Freman people, including Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and the warrior-like Chani (Zendaya), and giant sandworms that travel under the arid surface, occasionally rising like demented black holes to swallow anything they find. Political tensions arise, meanwhile, with the rival House Harkonnen, led by Stellan Skarsgard’s foul, corpulent villain Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose bidding is carried out by Dave Bautista’s menacing Glossu “Beast” Rabban. Truly, Dune is a film to sit back and admire, from the slate-grey/black colour scheme of the vast monolithic sets created by production designer Patrice Vermette, the futuristic hardware, such as the helicopters with rotor blades buzzing like mosquito wings, and the bone-rattling Hans Zimmer score to the exemplary ensemble cast that includes Josh Brolin, Charlotte Rampling and Jason Momoa. Paying homage to the philosophical sci-fi of Herbert as well as Isaac Asimov and Stanislaw Lem, Villeneuve has conjured an epic on a gargantuan scale that dwarfs even his own earlier work. The only concern is whether Warner Bros, the studio behind Dune, will greenlight a sequel. For, as Chani says near the film’s conclusion: “This is only the beginning.”"
"Sep 3, 2021",NEGATIVE," David Cronenberg, who certainly knows a thing about difficult literary adaptations, may have said it best: “In order to be faithful to the book, you need to betray it.” Why has this sage piece of advice eluded all who’ve been tempted to make a film of Frank Herbert’s Dune, commonly described as the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and a masterpiece of the genre’s post-60s New Wave? Film industry economics go thus, especially in Hollywood: widely selling books get screen adaptations—a mantra that will never bend. Even now, with the dominance of intellectual property and prediction algorithms that take into account “pre-awareness,” a good or great book will always find itself scrutinized for cinematic potential. Even the publishing world adds to the economic tilt, optioning and rights deals cementing this relationship of convenience.  Dune is perhaps the principal victim of this awkward interface between these two industries. There’s a risk that its virtues, its vision have become overshadowed in the popular imagination with the strife it has caused filmmakers: Alejandro Jodorowsky took a crack, summarily joining the sizeable list of greatest unmade films; David Lynch’s experience on the 1984 Dino de Laurentiis mega-production scarred him to the extent that the normally gregarious fellow will never speak publicly on the subject.  Denis Villeneuve has surmounted this slew of bad omens by arguably––in filmmaking terms––producing the most impersonal adaptation possible. For all his skill and talent, his deftness and subtlety, he acts as just a translator for Herbert’s largely uncompromised original vision, let alone an interpreter or proselytizer. Dune 2021, to register with necessary impact, needs a mind and careening imaginative spirit as reckless as that of its originator. There are technocratic considerations: mounting this work with the most convincing realism, the Star Wars-like tactility where you never second-guess or squint at the illusionism or artificiality, needs the 2020s’ best computer render farm and enough post-production credits that the closing titles suggest a 2.35:1 ratio Rosetta Stone. Blade Runner 2049’s offbeat use of up-and-coming actors in vital rules appears a market liability, and the all-star cast could be plucked from a search engine’s popularity chart table. That’s not to say Timothée Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, and the like aren’t committed, and they look happy to be in something with pretensions to be The Godfather for this kind of genre. Gurney Halleck––the novel’s most rousing, personality-infused character––is distilled into just a scowling military commander as played by Josh Brolin. In the novel he sings whimsical songs whilst strumming a nine-string “baliset”—such a beacon of levity. This Dune has the atmosphere that all pleasurable music-listening was abolished alongside “thinking machines” when its story picks up in the 10th millennium A.D.  We know the plot; a coherent and exhaustive summary would be a fine novella in itself. This is the monomyth, the classic hero’s journey of Paul Atreides, heir to one of the Imperial Great Houses, whose ducal father is granted as a fief the most consequential resource in the universe: the desert planet Arrakis, used for harvesting the vital “spice” that is analogous to oil in these primitive 21st-century times. But plentiful on these mythic lands are the Fremen, who live in defiance of imperial rule and may hold the key to enormous political upheaval in the universe.  That prior paragraph covers a millimeter of Dune’s breadth, much as Villeneuve’s adaptation of the book’s first half does. What he has in his arsenal is the capital of Warner Bros. and contributing independent production outfits who want to make a piece of popular art in relatively good faith. There’s no denying what he produces is a technical marvel: as mentioned, you seldom squint and go “ah, that’s fake,” the way many modern green-screen blockbusters often encourage.  A director comparison I hoped wouldn’t hover in my mind was Zack Snyder. This is relevant in two important senses. It’s kindred spirits with his 2009 Watchmen in its utter fealty to the text, an impressive piece of mimicry unbothered by its source’s troubling ideas, the sense of subversion bubbling below. (The Dune novel is profoundly politically incorrect by today’s necessary standards––but it makes us nostalgic for risks.) It also undoes some fine initial storytelling work and artfully gnarled production design by collapsing into a relentless barrage of explosions and violent carnage as the clock ticks towards the end of its runtime. It felt uncanny, watching the film in a packed cinema full of adults, seeing how wastefully it destroys the gleaming Arrakeen city––and how little pathos it stirs.  David Katz has been a freelance film journalist for over a decade.

"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," In Frank Herbert’s Dune, we’re introduced to the fictional planet of Arrakis – an arid place, its winds so choked with sand that it seems impossible for any creature or person to dwell within it. And yet, from somewhere deep below, a rumble can be heard. Sandworms, both fierce and mountainous, move unseen but still felt. It’s an oddly accurate way to describe the fate of Herbert’s own book, widely recognised as one of the greatest pieces of science fiction, but absent from the popular consciousness to such a degree that George Lucas could pilfer its story of ancient religions and desert messiahs without much notice. Meanwhile, Hollywood has come to consider the book as something of a poisoned chalice. Dune has already felled two great visionaries: Alejandro Jodorowsky’s psychedelic vision collapsed in on itself, while David Lynch’s typically absurdist take was reviled by critics. So there was an undeniable audacity to the decision by Warner Bros to revisit Herbert’s 1965 novel, placing it now in the hands of French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and dividing it into two parts. But that risk has been richly rewarded. Villeneuve’s Dune is the sandworm exploding out from the darkness below. It is a film of such literal and emotional largeness that it overwhelms the senses. If all goes well, it should reinvigorate the book’s legacy in the same way Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy did for JRR Tolkien’s work. Indeed, much like Jackson, Villeneuve has a certain pliancy to his vision that, in this case, has been his saving grace. Arrival and Prisoners, two of his previous films, may have possessed their own distinctive look but, when it came to Blade Runner 2049, his belated sequel to Ridley Scott’s masterpiece, it spoke fluently in the language of what came before. Dune, then, is firmly grounded in Herbert’s book. The author’s story of feudal nobles waging war over Arrakis, the only source of a powerful drug known as spice, is thick with conflicting ideas that academics are still unpacking today. For Villeneuve, his interests seem to lie mostly in where colonialism and religion collide, specifically in the weaponisation of belief in order to control a population. The film opens with a piece of narration from Chani (Zendaya), one of Arrakis’s indigenous Fremen, as she ponders over who will be the next to oppress her people. The cruel and ruthless Harkonnens have left their planet and given up control of the spice trade. In their place arrives House Atreides: Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and their son Paul (Timothée Chalamet). Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a spiritual order of witch-like women who have served as the guiding hand of history. Through the careful intermixing of bloodlines, they hope to produce the “Kwisatz Haderach” – a mind so powerful that it could bridge space and time, past and future. It’s becoming increasingly clear that Paul himself may be the fated being in question. Centuries before the events described in Herbert’s novel, there was a revolt that destroyed all computers. Patrice Vermette’s production work and Jacqueline West’s costumes have thus eschewed many of the conventions of futuristic design in favour of something far more archaeological and symbolic. Painted Japanese panels sit beside Byzantine robes, with just a touch of the mechanical eerieness of artist HR Giger, once hired for Jodorowsky’s film. Hans Zimmer’s score, so dread-filled that it’s frightening, includes both throat singing and Scottish bagpipes. Villeneuve allows the terrible, suffocating weight of Paul’s destiny to infect every frame of Dune – from the sterile, muted palette of his homeworld Caladan to the gold-flecked haze of Arrakis. Figures traverse across vast landscapes, while miniature swarms of spaceships gather like invading insects. That smallness allows, too, for some humanity. There is a fragility to these characters, upheld by a cast of actors all too smart to be swallowed up by portentousness. Chalamet will always have his sheepishness, Zendaya a cutting clarity to her voice. But Dune is a complicated book. It’s also a complicated film. There’s a real question as to why the Fremen – whose language, dress, and culture are so directly inspired by the nomadic, Arabic Bedouin tribes – don’t feature any Middle Eastern and North African (Mena) actors in speaking roles, their leader instead played by Javier Bardem in a shemagh-inspired headscarf. The casting choice is poor, and will only cause further problems if Villeneuve is able to make the second part of this story. It’s a small, but noticeable chip in the paint when it comes to Dune – a work that’s otherwise of such intimidating grandeur that it’s hard to believe it even exists in the first place."

Ah, “Dune.” It seems like yesterday that David Lynch gave us the hoary epic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s landmark sci-fi novel.  Kyle MacLachlan headed up a very eclectic and weird cast, even for 1984, that featured a legend (Jose Ferrer), a rock star (Sting), and a sitcom actor from “Rhoda” (Kenneth McMillan). Here’s the thing about the old “Dune” from 1984. When you watch it now, you see it had a lot of heart but looks really dated. It’s like watching a rerun of “Lost in Space.” Made eight years after “Star Wars,” the OG “Dune” looks like it came from the 60s now, before special effects were perfected. So let’s remake it, someone said. With a new cast, lots of Big Deal actors, starring teen sensation Timothee Chalamet, famous for his love of peaches in “Call Me By Your Name.” His Paul is much younger looking that MacLachlan’s and degrees more androgynous. But he captures the screen like James Dean or a young Leo DiCaprio with his tousled hair and aquiline nose. He is the Conflicted Young Man of the 2020s. As for Sting, his one of a kind 1984 “Dune” character, Feyd, was not recast for the update (I’m actually surprised they didn’t go for Adam Levine). And a main male character, Dr. Kynes, played by Max von Sydow the first time around, is now a Black woman in the the form of the excellent Sharon Duncan Brewster. The rest of the cast is formidable: Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin. I clapped when Stephen McKinley Henderson came on screen, and we get really nice work from Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling, and especially Stellan Skarsgard. Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista are there as signposts for fans of certain kinds of blockbusters. Denis Villeneuve is our director this time. He made “Arrival” and tends to create cold atmospheres. His “Dune” is the opposite of Lynch’s, methodical and cerebral, set against pastels and smoke and long stretches of moodiness. It’s a two and  a half hour movie so for an hour or so, that’s all fine and beautiful and you’re really invested in the idea that this time, something might happen while the main cast, living in space way in the future, can find “spice” — a rare commodity — on the desert planet. But you know, there was a book, and we’re still following it. (Although in today’s press conference Josh Brolin admitted he never read it, and I doubt much of the cast did, either.) So whatever the “spice” is, it doesn’t actually add spice to an often bland meal. Chalamet’s Paul is trained by his father to take over the quest to colonize the dreary sandworm plagued planet of Arrakis, get past the shifting sands of its deserts, and spice things up. Like Hamlet and Luke Skywalker before him, Paul wrestles with this idea, but once his dad — Oscar Isaac is indelible as Leto, the movie hinges on his performance — is out of the picture, Paul sticks close to his mom (Ferguson) and remains ambivalent to say the least. Now wait: the first “Dune” movie was two hours long, and didn’t require a sequel. This one is labeled”Part One” up front, and comes in at 2:35. Plus, MacLachlan had a romantic thing going with Sean Young as Chani. (She was hot stuff in 1984.) Chani now is played by Zendaya, who doesn’t speak much until the end of the movie. (At today’s press conference she conceded not having met most of the cast after doing just a couple of days’ work.) What jumps out in Villeneuve’s saga is the production. Every bit of it is Oscar worthy, from set design to costumes to lighting, make up, etc. Cinematographer Grieg Fraser has outdone himself from frame to frame, set piece to set piece, creating jaw dropping pieces of art that are impressionistic, sensational, and other worldly. Villeneuve’s “Blade Runner 2049” brought an Oscar to Roger Deakins, and this may be the case here as well. This year has been big on production excellence– look at “Cruella,” for example. We’ve got crafts people at the top of their respective games. Fraser isn’t alone on “Dune.” Hans Zimmer’s music just pounds away, creating lots of tension with melody. My only grievance is that hardly anyone in this film ever smiles. While the first half feels like “Star Wars” in sand, you remember all the fun of the George Lucas movie, the minor characters, the interplay. Everyone in “Dune” is grimly serious. You kind of wish someone would shake Paul’s hand with a joy buzzer, pull a snake out of a can, sit down on a whoopie cushion. I mean, they are looking for spice, aren’t they? They need a hot chili pepper in their recipe. Still, new “Dune” should be a smash hit. It’s a big old epic, the kind we need right now, to sweep us away from viruses, hurricanes, and wars in real life. Put on a mask, get a tub of popcorn, and kick back. We need a break. This is it."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," PLOT: Denis Villeneuve’s highly anticipated adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 novel, Dune tells the tale of Paul Atreides, a young nobleman who some begin to believe is a God when he is sent with his family to protect and procure a powerful element called melange, or “the spice.” It is so powerful, that there are others who would willingly do harm to anyone that stands in their way of taking control of the precious substance. REVIEW: It’s not been an easy road for a successful cinematic translation of Dune, the classic 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. In 1974, Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky had planned to film this epic adventure. Yet without funding and other issues, his take never saw the light of day. And then there was David Lynch’s 1984 misfire of an attempt to bring this cerebral sci-fi feature to life. Which was mostly unmemorable aside from Sting’s bizarro wardrobe. And finally, after several decades, the critically acclaimed Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival, Sicario) has given this hard-to-film novel the moviegoing experience fans were waiting to see. Bold, profound, and breathtakingly gorgeous, the first part in a planned two-part feature honors the source material in the most satisfying way possible. Dune 2021 is a modern-day work of art. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) is the son of a noble family, who is in line to take over after his father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Issac). After his powerful father accepts the stewardship of the dangerous and desolate planet Arrakis, they make the journey to help secure their family’s place. The planet, also known as Dune, is the only location where you can find melange, or “the spice,” a life-altering drug that has many others are desperate for its power. There is much more that is unknown and unexpected for Paul. Even before his adventure, he continually dreams of a strange girl named Chani (Zendaya), a member of the Fremen tribe living in the deep desert. Once he and his family arrive on the deadly planet, a series of unfortunate events leads them to an evil and powerful man named Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) with a few other dangerous characters. Villeneuve is a masterful storyteller. With a script co-written by Jon Spaihts, Eric Roth, and Denis himself, this first chapter explores a very complex and detailed story with clarity and style. More importantly, it does so without sacrificing the impressive detail of Frank Herbert’s original vision. Much like the haunting Blade Runner 2049, the director has taken the time to explore numerous characters without sacrificing the main story and themes. Without the overuse of narration (something which Lynch’s film suffered deeply from), this new adaptation takes the time to build this insanely beautiful world without sacrificing the soul for a typical blockbuster. And much like the semi-recent classic, Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Rings in the LOTR trilogy, this is only the beginning of the story. As impressive as the script is, you cannot deny the sheer beauty on display. Along with cinematographer Greig Fraser, Denis Villeneuve crafts a stunning world, with nearly every frame creating a striking image. There’s not a moment in this where the special effects stand out as fake or uninspired. Whether it’s the magnificence of gigantic Starships, the sprawling sand-covered dunes, or the Ornithopters (a sort of bug-like helicopter), it’s all a feast for the eyes. The visuals are mind-blowing. It’s not shocking that the man behind both Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival could pull this off. Yet how effortlessly this world feels so shockingly real is another reminder of why Villeneuve has such a gift for this kind of exploration. One of the best examples of this is the effectively creepy Sandworms. What could have easily been a silly creature becomes a frighteningly real danger for Paul and his allies. Timothee Chalamet once again gives another exceptional performance. The young actor continues to bring impressive vulnerability to his work, and this is especially true with Paul. He also has great chemistry with a few of his co-stars, especially Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin (Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck), who both play trusted aides to Leto. Yet it’s the undeniably deep relation he shares with his birth mother, Leto’s concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). The three help Paul prepare for an uncertain future. One sequence, in particular, finds the two must seek shelter after a daring escape. It is so sublimely moving that it only makes you care more for the mother and her son and understand their place in this fantastical tale. You’ll also find impressive work from Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgard, and much more. Without overshadowing a good story and spectacular imagery, the score by Hans Zimmer is yet another perfect element. The music is perhaps just as impressive as the visuals. All of this creates such a brilliant and visually complex work. It is one that perfectly manages to mix all elements into one. Even though it may be a slow burn, the action set pieces do not disappoint, neither does the filmmaker sacrifice the subtle themes and ideas explored throughout. After decades of not quite being able to bring this legendary story to the big screen, the filmmaker has gifted fans of the book – as well as those who haven’t read it – a truly spectacular piece. Dune is science fiction at its best. Denis Villeneuve has created one of the best fantasy features since Peter Jackson’s journey into Middle Earth. The performances are inspired, with Chalamet, Ferguson, Bautista, Skarsgard, Isaac, and especially Jason Momoa all as standouts. The marriage between a fantastic script and visually sumptuous imagery help give this first of two-part feature a richness that you rarely see in a major summer release. When the effects are this detailed and stunning, it’s easy to lose sight of everything else. However, Dune is a modern masterclass in filmmaking. While I’d easily recommend giving this a rewatch on HBO Max, I’d highly recommend for the first viewing that you seek this out in IMAX, as you’re unlikely to see anything this jaw-droppingly stunning and brilliantly creative in theatres again anytime soon. It looks like both Abigail and Guy Ritchie’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare aren’t likely to make much of an impact at the box office. We have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 Years Later, a trilogy of sequels to Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," First, when Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) tells princeling son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) he needn’t desire the power he will soon hold – nor the hero arc he’s set for. Essentially reading straight from Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Leto says to the wavering adolescent: “A great man doesn’t seek to lead. He is called, and he answers.” But – thankfully – it’s not a film that requires any familiarity with the source material, nor David Lynch’s unsuccessful but well-liked 1984 adaptation. I purposefully avoided any knowledge of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic before seeing Villeneuve’s adaptation. Many others brushed up on it. Most won’t. Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (we’ll come back to him) seem to know this. Stretches in the early parts of Dune are a layman’s terms guide to Herbert’s incredibly intricate and uniquely realized universe. Experts in the original story shouldn’t be bored, though, as the mountains of exposition are nicely dished out to Paul as well as us. And the stellar performances of Stephen McKinley Henderson, Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson and Josh Brolin among Duke Leto’s Atreides inner council keep Dune entertaining. Eric Roth does, too. The legendary Hollywood screenwriter, now 76, has the likes of Forrest Gump, Munich and A Star Is Born under his belt and another dozen or more box-office hits on top. His hiring by Villeneuve and Warner Bros. is an act of caution and an attempt to restrain Dune from the weirder routes Lynch took all those years ago. The decision pays off. Unlike Blade Runner 2049 which, although impressive, left many alienated, Dune is consistently gripping and plot driven. That it’s shorter despite carrying a huge amount more plot (even in its first half) says a lot about Villeneuve’s own lessons from that previous adaptation, commercial and otherwise. Dave Bautista is still around, though not with the tiny glasses which made his Blade Runner performance so memorable. As far as creepy accessories go, however, Dune has an abundance. They mostly go to Stellan Skarsgård, who seems to spend most of the movie in an alien bath or an alien steam room. The gadgets throughout the movie are excellent, with production designer Patrice Vermette doing excellent work on all of Dune’s array of titbits and the audacious set design Herbert seems to have obligated from adapters. What he didn’t obligate from adapters, though, was the care and attention Villeneuve and his co-writers gave to the story’s complicated – but unambiguously earthly – politics. Watching a film in 2021 about a hallucinogen-rich contested region fought over between rural tribes and a series of distant empires has a particular weight. Paul’s hero arc fits in all that, but in all it doesn’t particularly need to for Dune to still be provocative and interesting and timely. Yet it’s that hero journey which fuels Dune. Chalamet is strong as the stony-faced hero with plenty to learn. Watching him have a series of profound conversations with role models and bad influences alike from weapons master Gurney (Josh Brolin) to spiritual kook Gaius (Charlotte Rampling) to warrior-legend Duncan (Jason Momoa, in a strikingly good performance) never, ever gets boring. But that final line rings true, too. It’s not a spoiler to reveal one character says: “This is just the beginning.” With Dune so clearly intended to set up a sequel where, in the immortal words of Bad Boys 2, shit gets real, we can only hope Villeneuve and co. are given the chance to make it happen."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," The spice melange is a psychotropic substance that floats across the surface of planet Arrakis like puffs of dandelions. This seems right since Denis Villeneuve’s interpretation of that world in Dune is similarly all-enveloping for any who lay eyes on it. It’s an experience intended to overwhelm and intoxicate. More than a few years have come and gone since a picture this vast in scope and immersive in intent has found the ambition (and financial support) to conquer multiplexes. But make no mistake, Dune is very much a film with conquest on its mind, both as a narrative and as a cinematic trip for the eyes and ears. Pulling from Frank Herbert’s landmark science fiction novel—or about half of it, anyway—Villeneuve reaches for an epic on the scale of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings while also not so subtly evoking imagery from the ultimate desert odyssey, Lawrence of Arabia. While it’s too early to gauge whether he’s made a true classic for the ages like those touchstones, there’s little doubt the filmmaker has engineered the most impressive spectacle you can see in a theater this year (and you really should see this in a theater). A gargantuan narrative about mythical chosen ones and boy heroes, great clashes of intergalactic houses, and sandworms the size of mountains, Villeneuve’s Dune is a visual feast. More satisfying though is it’s also a transportive journey for the mind. Novelist Herbert famously influenced George Lucas when Dune was published as a book in 1965, but the first good adaptation of his psychedelic (and frequently opaque) musings now comes to cinemas at a moment where visual grandeur is in desperate need of something weird and thoughtful. Well, Dune is very weird. Blissfully so. Primarily focused on two warring dynasties in a future among the stars, Dune is a tale of feudal conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen (think the Starks and Lannisters). The Atreides are a noble if stoic people who already rule one idyllic planet. However, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) has been offered by the galaxy’s unseen emperor a gift too good to be true: the chance to take control of the desert planet Arrakis where the most valuable substance in the known universe is mined, spice melange. Leto senses a trap in the offer since it comes at the expense of the galaxy’s richest family, his bitter rivals the Harkonnens and their grotesque patriarch, the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård). Yet the opportunity to exploit the universe’s most barren prize is irresistibly enticing. If the Duke can bring peace to the desert people of Arrakis, then that land will become the birthright of his son Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Meanwhile Paul has his own trepidations. Inheriting the supernatural gifts of his genuinely witchy mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul is plagued by visions of suffering and death on Arrakis… and also a seeming destiny drenched in power and holy war. As a novel previously considered unfilmable—particularly after David Lynch and Dino De Laurentiis’ disastrous attempt to adapt it in 1984—Dune has clearly benefited from the evolution of special effects, with CG wizardry faithfully recreating Herbert’s most bizarre ideas. What makes Villeneuve’s film so majestic, however, is its determination to do as much of it as possible in-camera, and to provide Arrakis with a gritty, tactile quality. Arrakis, as well as the Atreides homeworld of Caladan, feel lived in and entrenched in ancient histories that will occur thousands of years in our future. Bizarre hieroglyphic sandworms adorn desert castles while the Atreides’ native palace appears both starkly European and vaguely international, pulling from Asian and African influences. It’s a cinematic prophecy where governments have regressed and opulent vassal states rule all, which Villeneuve and production designer Patrice Vermette highlight by focusing as much on the dignity of wood and stone as they do space alloys and force fields. This trenchant world-building could only be an asset for the film’s dizzyingly big ensemble. In fact, significant A-list talent even fills the margins in roles clearly earmarked for expansion down the road, including barely utilized actors like Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Zendaya, with the latter having a fairly glorified, ethereal cameo. And yet, even these smallest parts contribute in imbuing the production with a total, almost fanatical conviction. As the center of it all, Chalamet confirms on a grand scale what arthouse audiences have long known about his charisma. Despite playing an archetype that’s been well-worn out by the genre fare influenced by Dune, Chalamet comfortably holds the nearly three-hour movie on his shoulders by emphasizing Paul’s discomfort. Here is a young Chosen One who is weighed down by the burden of the tragic and possibly damned. He’s also complemented by Ferguson’s intriguing Lady Jessica, an aloof presence who deserves more floor space should Villeneuve ever finish adapting the novel. But if I had to guess, the biggest scene-stealer for audiences will be Jason Momoa as an Atreides knight. Essentially the closest thing this movie has to a Han Solo, Momoa has not been this winning or devilish since his days on Game of Thrones, and he may be the lone tonic in a film that will drown certain audiences beneath its brooding tone. The film is, indeed, very heavy on atmosphere and self-importance. And with its ponderous amount of characters and plot threads, it will undoubtedly overwhelm more than a few viewers. Much like the source material, this desert is dripping in high-minded pretensions. Villeneuve attempts to offset that with a lot more expository handholding than his previous sci-fi epics, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, which bordered on tone poems. But that mostly makes the first act particularly top-heavy and perhaps clear to a fault. There’s a lot more prose here, yet I wonder if Villeneuve and his studio should’ve simply fully embraced the director’s abstract poetry. Nevertheless, these are admittedly minor quibbles which hang in the margins for an experience that’s made one of the most foreboding science fiction sagas ever conceived fairly accessible to any audience willing to be transported. Dune is an astonishing swing of ambition and passion from filmmakers at the top of their craft, and it more often than not connects like a thunderbolt. As a project that is only meant to start a new cinematic cycle, it left me eager to follow this Paul and Villeneuve toward the next strange corner of Arrakis, and determined to return to the theater so I can see their introduction again, only next time in IMAX. Dune  premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Sept. 3 and plays at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 11. It opens in theaters and on HBO Max on Oct. 22."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE,"Such pseudo-spiritual sci-fi adventures often teeter on the edge of the ridiculous, but Dune mostly stays on the right side of risible..."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," At once serious and very, very silly, David Lynch’s 1984 version of Dune was one of the biggest flops in cinematic history. Stuffed with all the things fans of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel would expect – spice, special effects, sandworms – it also featured Sting as a campy, orange-haired aristocrat who wears a codpiece. Denis Villeneuve’s new reboot thankfully ditches the silly, but it does take itself extremely seriously. Based on Herbert’s seminal 1965 work – and not Lynch’s box office bust – Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of a noble family who’ve recently been entrusted with the most precious planet in the universe. On Arrakis, huge deserts are harvested for spice, the vital ingredient used for interstellar travel. Later, when his father (Oscar Isaac) is murdered in an imperial plot to unseat the Atreides family, Paul and his psychically powerful mother (Rebecca Ferguson) are dumped in the desert and left for dead. To survive, Paul must track down mysterious tribe The Fremen, who have a prophecy that calls him ‘The Chosen One’ destined to bring peace to the galaxy. If that all sounds a bit like Star Wars, then that’s because it’s a lot like Star Wars. Preternaturally gifted boy takes on evil empire with the help of a secretive band of resistance fighters is hardly a new story. But where Villeneuve’s Dune differs is in its execution. Much like its sandy setting, his film is so vast that it’s difficult to comprehend at first. Shot through an arthouse lens, great, red drifts blend together in the haze while monstrous space ships shoot through the sky above. During battle scenes, the camera swoops in low over fierce warriors fighting with razor-sharp blades before suddenly zooming out as rockets slam into skyscraper-sized vehicles. Villeneuve has made it very clear he’d rather his movie be viewed on the big screen. And he’s right. The scale is jaw-dropping. The only thing as impressive is Dune‘s cast, which must have cost more than Arrakis’ yearly spice revenue. Chalamet plays the conflicted lead well, but he’s outclassed by Ferguson, whose Lady Jessica has years of maternal worry etched into her every expression. Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin add muscle and gravitas, each playing varying forms of the same gruff military man. While Jason Momoa (who nails the script’s single joke) pops up as an archetypal handsome pilot with a roguish grin. Only Zendaya struggles to make an impact, but that’s less related to her performance and more to do with the film’s plot. Dune, some will only realise as the credits roll, is but one part of a duology. As such, Zendaya’s character, Fremen youngster Chani, appears only in Paul’s dreams until the first chapter’s end. Chalamet has been quick to promise interviewers they’ll see more of her in the next movie (yet to be green-lit). After two hours and 35 minutes, Dune‘s lack of closure feels irksome to say the least. The average cinemagoer might not have realised they need to come back for another round – and there’s little about Dune‘s marketing to help them twig. That said, the sheer ambition on display here means you get plenty of bang for your buck. Cast member David Dastmalchian described the film to NME last week as “like nothing you’ve ever seen before,” which is certainly correct. You could probably apply that statement to Lynch’s Dune as well, but in this case it’s actually a good thing. Here’s to part two."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve has succeeded in wrestling Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi classic “Dune” to the big screen, and that’s an impressive feat all by itself. So when his film premiered last month at the Venice Film Festival, it’s no surprise that it showed what a movie version of “Dune” can be, but also why it’s been so difficult to get one onto the screen. The adventurous Chilean-French director Alejandro Jodorowsky could never quite pull it off: He spent years and millions in the 1970s planning an elaborate 10-hour version that would have included Salvador Dali, Orson Welles and Mick Jagger in the cast, failing to actually make the movie but leaving enough notes and sketches behind to spur a fascinating 2013 documentary, “Jodorowsky’s Dune.” Another visionary director, David Lynch, was brought in by producer Dino De Laurentiis to make a version in 1984 – but almost nobody, including Lynch, was happy with the confusing and cheesy result. Villeneuve, though, might be better suited to the material than wide-eyed auteurs like Jodorowsky and Lynch. Since his early, French-language films like “Polytechnique” and the Oscar-nominated “Incendies,” the Canadian director has gradually moved toward large-scale, muscular filmmaking, from the tense thriller “Prisoners” to the brutal “Sicario” to the sci-fi visions of “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049.” The scale of his films has been increasing with each new project, and “Dune” is as big as he’s ever gotten. Of course, Herbert’s original novel was itself enormous, a 700-plus page saga of a young man, Paul Atreides, rising from exile to glory on the forbidding desert planet of Arrakis. Set 8,000 years in the future and in no recognizable portion of the universe, “Dune” made points about humanity’s rape of the environment and its exploitation of indigenous peoples – points that may be even more timely today than in 1965 – but it was mostly a huge family epic of the noble Atreides clan trying to survive on an arid desert planet and in a universe of brutal, power-hungry despots. (Think of it as “Game of Thrones” in space or “Star Wars” if it never got off Tatooine, with the Atreides family as the Starks, the vicious Harkonnens as the Lannisters, the evil emperor as, well, the evil emperor and the desert-dwelling Fremen as really big, tough and not hairy Ewoks – except that those comparisons do Herbert a disservice, since his saga came before and probably influenced those later sagas.) In other words, it’s a terrible place for Paul and his family to go – but the Emperor, for conniving reasons of his own, has sent the Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their son to the planet to oversee the place, which has recently been vacated by the evil Harkonnens, who have grown rich taking a hefty cut of the mining of spice. All of this exposition unfolds slowly, though the scale and the detail are staggering. Villeneuve recently suggested that watching “Dune” on a TV screen (where it’s not available, at least not yet) would be like driving a speedboat in a bathtub, and that’s because the world of “Dune” is huge: Caladan, the Atreides’ home planet, is wild and magnificent, while Arrakis is even wilder and more forbidding. Each room is bigger than the last, each landscape more jaw-dropping than the one before it, and Greig Fraser’s cameras find rich beauty and menace everywhere they turn. Eventually there will be intimate moments, but the bedrock on which “Dune” is based is all grandeur and peril. Conversations are riddled with pregnant pauses and portentous glances; you can occasionally find playful moments if you look hard enough, but this is a dark meditation on power and greed, and it rarely lightens up. It’s mostly a male world, but the women hold more power than they let on: Lady Jessica is part of the ancient Bene Gesserit order, which has been carefully crossing bloodlines for centuries to eventually produce the Kwisatz Haderach, a messiah-type figure with control over space and time. Is Paul that figure? For the answer, you’ll have to read the book or wait for the sequel; unlike Lynch’s version, Villeneuve’s “Dune” only covers the first two-thirds of the book, ending on a note that’s more “to be continued” than “the end.” Once the exposition gives way to action, the journey to that “to be continued” can be off-putting in its relentless brutality, but it can also be thrilling, with a series of dazzling set-pieces on the sands of Arrakis. It’s not a movie for subtle acting or casual conversation – everything is big, bold and shot through with portent and doom – but Chalamet and Ferguson make the most of what they’re given to do, and Villeneuve finds some dark poetry in the way he plays up the story’s mystical elements. The storyline, meanwhile, mostly follows the book, with changes to turn one character from male to female and to give more of a voice to the desert-dwelling Fremen, particularly their leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and the tough but beguiling Chani (Zendaya). And because the film ends well before the book does, screenwriters Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth throw in a moment when Paul hints at his endgame far earlier than he does in the novel."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Back in the day, the two big counterculture sci-fi novels were the libertarian-division Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein, which made the word “grok” a thing for many years (not so much anymore; hardly even pops up in crossword puzzles today) and Frank Herbert’s 1965 Dune, a futuristic geopolitical allegory that was anti-corporate, pro-eco-radicalism, and Islamophilic. Why mega-producers and mega-corporations have been pursuing the ideal film adaptation of this piece of intellectual property for so many decades is a question beyond the purview of this review, but it’s an interesting one. Opens in theaters on October 22nd, available on HBO Max the same day. This review was filed on September 3rd in conjunction with the world premiere at the Venice Film Festival.

"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune feels like a product from another time in Hollywood history. A movie with the scope and vision of modern blockbusters that tells a complex, mature story usually reserved for independent dramas. It’s hugely ambitious, not always straightforward, but accessible and lived-in in a way that makes watching it completely engrossing, even when the thrills and chills aren’t quite as abundant as recent hits have made us accustomed to. It’s an old-school blockbuster told with visuals that’ll delight a new-school crowd. Based on the legendary novel by Frank Herbert, Dune was directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) with a screenplay by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth. It tells the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the son of the powerful Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and mysterious Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Paul’s parentage makes him not just the heir to the formidable Atreides army thanks to his father, but a man with a magical, mythical side too, thanks to his mother. When the Atreides are given control of the planet Arrakis, which contains the most valuable substance in the galaxy—spice—Paul and his family find themselves at odds with the villainous Harkonnens, who previously controlled the planet. Through that conflict, Paul struggles with the burden of his dual destiny as a leader of men as well as a potential prophet. Villeneuve’s biggest challenge with Dune is dropping us in  a brand new world. Sure, some people will have seen the previous adaptations or read Herbert’s books, but the director never relies on that. Instead, he delicately balances plot and character development with establishing the rules of this fictional universe, all through attention to detail. Nothing in Dune is an afterthought. Every single frame, every single sound, every single choice, feels like it’s been deliberated for months and the filmmaking proudly relishes each detail. Establishing shots linger a few extra seconds. Costumes are introduced fluttering in the wind for maximum beauty. Characters who aren’t on screen for more than a second feel like they deserve their own spin-off movie. Even the sci-fi props are presented with a certain reverence for their design, hitting a bullseye between looking cool and innovative as well as old and worn out. This is a new world for us, but not for the characters. Thankfully, none of that filmmaking opulence distracts from the story. All of the mise-en-scène works together to establish a grandiose, awe-inspiring canvas for the story and characters to play on, but it’s never the point. Your eyes will dart around the frame exploring all the gorgeous vistas and technology, your ears will perk up with the complex sound design and distinct Hans Zimmer score, but after that, everything comes back to Paul, a young man beginning to explore the ways of the galaxy while also figuring out his part in it. And this Paul is a perfect vessel for the audience’s journey. His story is at the center of the more layered political intrigue happening around him and yet, thanks to Chalamet’s performance, none of that is ever overwhelming. His Paul is confident and grounded, but playful, too. As he discovers more about the ways of the world, we enjoy his reactions and relate to his trepidation. When he learns, we learn. When he evolves, the story evolves. With so much character development and world-building, though, Dune does, at times, feel almost too ambitious. A tad too slow. Even a bit incomplete. It helps immensely that the film begins with the card “Dune: Part One,” because then you realize this two-and-a-half-hour movie, much like the first and second Lord of the Rings, was made on the hope and prayer we’d get to see another. That seed helps cover the fact that the first hour of the movie favors character and planet introductions over action—the biggest set piece of the film comes with about an hour left—and that the film’s climax is between two characters, and not two million (as one might expect in a film this size). Villeneuve’s Dune is clearly about the growth of Paul first, and showcasing this world in a way that will delight and mystify second; in those aims he succeeds. Soaking in this endlessly wondrous world for two-plus hours absolutely carries a bit of the narrative detriments. Another thing that helps Dune overcome a few of its flaws is the casting. Beyond just the Atreides family, Villeneuve has filled Dune with very famous, talented actors who are a pleasure to watch. Some—like Jason Momoa as Atreides soldier Duncan Idaho and Stellan Skarsgård as the evil Baron Harkonnen—have excellent roles in this movie. Momoa, in particular, bringing a swagger and excitement beyond anything we’ve seen from him before. Others, like Dave Bautista as a Harkonnen leader, and Zendaya and Javier Bardem as crucial members of the Fremen people, have smaller roles in this installment. We see them, they’re compelling, but we’re left waiting to see just how exactly that could play out in the future. What could happen in the future isn’t something you can think about when critiquing a movie though. There’s this movie, this story, and if it doesn’t work on its own, that would problem. It’s not a problem here. This Dune, by itself, even if we never get another movie, sets a new standard for modern sci-fi epics. Villeneuve’s attention to detail in design, combined with his expansive vision of multiple worlds, conveys a reverence and respect for the material that makes the film feel even more majestic than it already is (and it’s pretty damn majestic).  It would be a travesty if we never got to see the second part of this story, but Part One has satisfying narrative threads with a logical endgame that leaves you wanting more. The set pieces, while sporadic, are exciting and the movie presents such a fantastic, robust sci-fi world, you could watch it a million times and find something new with each viewing. And yet, that dense, complex world exists solely to enhance a personal, relatable, emotional story. A story of a world where a boy grows to be a man with all sorts of unfathomable expectations—expectations this movie probably has on it too. But don’t worry, Dune is awesome in every sense of the word, and it’ll be a movie fans cherish for years to come."

Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials. The story in “Dune” is set in motion by an ambitious, unwieldy and ill-advised transfer of power — an undertaking that extracts a terrible cost and seems doomed to end in frustration and defeat. Something similar might be said of the previous major attempts to wrest Frank Herbert’s 1965 literary colossus to the big screen, even if recent history has sometimes looked back on those failures with a forgiving smile. Alejandro Jodorowsky’s assuredly trippy, never-completed version has become a much-mythologized cinematic ruin. David Lynch’s 1984 flop, reviled by many (including Lynch himself), can still inspire spasms of admiration for its mix of narrative intransigence and visionary strangeness. Still, to the extent that “Dune” endures, it does so on the strengths of Herbert’s extraordinarily prescient work — its echoes of a real world ravaged by oil wars, climate change and other consequences of human greed — rather than anything to do with its dubious cinematic legacy. Not least among the book’s mysteries is that it has shaped the iconography of so many classic science-fiction and fantasy films — most obviously, though not exclusively, “Star Wars” — without yielding a classic of its own. Conventional wisdom has long held that “Dune” is unfilmable, that its interlocking parables of colonial oppression, ecological disaster and messianic deliverance are too vast to be contained within the flattening parameters of the cinema screen. The magisterially brooding new “Dune,” just unveiled at the Venice International Film Festival and slated to reach U.S. theaters and HBO Max subscribers Oct. 22, boldly seeks to reverse that prophecy. With methodical poise and seat-rattling spectacle, the French Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (who wrote the script with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth) draws you into an astonishingly vivid, sometimes plausibly unnerving vision of the future. If those cursed earlier stabs at “Dune” were examples of what the French call a “film maudit,” this imposing new vision aspires to be the opposite: perhaps a “film Mahdi,” to reference the Arabic word often hurled at the young savior-to-be, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), as he embraces his destiny. The new film “Dune” ends on a cliffhanger. With the second half of Frank Herbert’s classic story still to tell — not to mention all its sequels and prequels — where will the “Dune” universe go from here? The fulfillment of that destiny will have to wait; “Dune: Part One,” as it’s billed onscreen, is the first in a projected two-part adaptation, which means that any assessment of Villeneuve’s achievement must be provisional at best. For now, it’s hard to deny the excitement of feeling swept up in this movie’s great squalls of sand, spice and interplanetary intrigue, realized with a level of craft so overpowering in its dust-choked aridity that you may want to pull your mask up a little tighter in the theater. You may also feel a more qualified sense of admiration for Villeneuve’s efforts to preserve yet streamline the novel’s imaginative essence, to translate Herbert’s heady conceits and arcane nomenclature into a prestige blockbuster idiom. Whether he succeeds — and for an impressive stretch, I think he does — his own meteoric Hollywood ascent has clearly prepared him for the assignment. This isn’t the first time Villeneuve has evinced a superb eye for the textural and chromatic nuances of sand, as the Mideast deserts of “Incendies,” the U.S.-Mexico border zones of “Sicario” and the Las Vegas ruins of “Blade Runner 2049” will attest. And like “Blade Runner 2049” and especially “Arrival,” “Dune” is an unusually philosophical speculative fiction that ponders the difficulties of language and coexistence. As the movie opens, a superficial detente has been orchestrated between the warring royal strongholds of Atreides and Harkonnen, led respectively by the noble Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) and the grotesque Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a prosthetically transfigured Stellan Skarsgard). “Dune” heads will know the rest: By imperial decree, House Harkonnen must relinquish stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune, which is at once inhospitable to life and a much-coveted source of it. House Atreides will assume control of the planet as well as its rich concentrations of spice, a drug-like substance whose life-extending properties have made it the most prized commodity in the universe. Notably, these narrative preliminaries are laid out by Chani (Zendaya), one of the Fremen, the thick-skinned, blue-eyed Indigenous people of Arrakis. Long acclimated to the planet’s sweltering heat and deadly giant sandworms, they’ve suffered bitterly under their cruel Harkonnen overlords and have no reason to suspect the Atreides will be any different. Villeneuve’s sympathetic focus on the Fremen feels like an early declaration of principle, a promise that this “Dune” might radically reframe the story from their perspective. For much of the movie, though, Chani and her people remain fleeting presences, glimpsed only in the gauzy visions of Duke Leto’s son, Paul. Chalamet, always good at suggesting both youthful callowness and limitless potential, proves an inspired choice for the role of a young man who is both a coddled heir and an intriguingly unknown quantity. On the Atreides’ home planet of Caladan, he is trained with avuncular affection by his father’s retainers, including the brilliant security expert Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), the brawny swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) and the skilled weapons teacher Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, not exactly the “ugly lump of a man” described in the book). Paul is also a source of pride and anxiety for the Duke, movingly played by Isaac as a leader who longs to do right by his family, his people and the Fremen, even as he suspects that House Atreides might be stepping into a carefully laid trap. But Paul’s most important mentor is his mother, Lady Jessica (a superb Rebecca Ferguson), a member of a shadowy, oracular sisterhood known as the Bene Gesserit for whom Paul poses both a problem and a source of fascination. Led by an imperious Reverend Mother (a heavily veiled but unmistakable Charlotte Rampling), the Bene Gesserit are versed in many skills including “the Voice,” a form of mind control rendered here via menacing aural distortions that — along with the soundtrack’s low, ominous rumbles and Hans Zimmer’s pulsating score — make “Dune” a symphony for the ears as well as a feast for the eyes. It is, admittedly, a rather monochromal feast, dryer than it is rich, notwithstanding a luscious early shot of the Arrakis dunes that brings to mind the crisped swirls of an overbaked meringue. Much of the palace intrigue plays out in muted tones and symmetrical compositions (the cinematography is by the great Greig Fraser), part of a rigorously color-controlled aesthetic that extends to Patrice Vermette’s futuro-brutalist production design and Jacqueline West’s slickly utilitarian costumes. A cold, fascist sheen seems to cling to the Atreides’ regal formations and their state-of-the-art ornithopters (like helicopters, but with blades that flutter like insect wings), all flawless design elements in a pageant of technological might and militaristic order. Villeneuve means to subvert and disrupt that pageant, something he accomplishes in part by consciously elevating the women in this male-dominated story. Ferguson’s forceful presence in the expanded role of Lady Jessica is one example; another is the gender recasting of Liet Kynes (a striking Sharon Duncan-Brewster), Arrakis’ deeply knowledgeable planetologist. It’s Kynes who helps the Atreides adjust to their desert environs, at one point accompanying them to a spice-harvesting site where they get their terrifying first glimpse of a giant sandworm in action, its great maw swirling open like a raging quicksand vortex. This action sequence and others are handled with masterly assurance, including several scenes of intimate combat performed with form-fitting, blood-concealing energy shields. But as ever, Villeneuve’s true talent is less in the staging of violence than in the queasy anticipation of it; he loves to linger in the looming threat of mayhem, in the tense moments before the (sand)worm turns. That gift serves him well enough in “Dune,” whose plot hinges on encroaching threats, assassination attempts and a series of devastating betrayals that send Paul and Lady Jessica fleeing into the desert where there await still more perils, possibilities and encounters with the Fremen (led by a sly Javier Bardem). Until the movie slams to an abrupt, unsatisfying halt halfway through the events of Herbert’s novel, there’s pleasure in watching this particular game of thrones play out, though perhaps more pleasure than depth or meaning. To call this “Dune” a remarkably lucid work is to praise it with very faint damnation. Perhaps reluctant to alienate the novices in the audience, Villeneuve has ironed out many of the novel’s convolutions, to the likely benefit of comprehension but at the expense of some rich, imaginative excess. Herbert’s more memorable flights of linguistic fancy, like “gom jabbar” and “Kwisatz Haderach,” are spoken once, with a faint air of embarrassed obligation, and seldom mentioned again. A more significant casualty is the book’s layered interiority, its skill at turning unspoken perceptions and motives into drama; the writers have managed this material without mastering it. Lynch’s compromised version was similarly stymied and more clotted with exposition. But it also had the courage of its demented convictions, as well as a fearless commitment to feverish, pustular imagery that makes Villeneuve’s pristine filmmaking seem almost timid by comparison. Not for the first time, his craft seems to exist mainly for its own sake; it’s the hallmark of a filmmaker who’s more logistician than thinker, more technician than artist. As a visual and visceral experience, “Dune” is undeniably transporting. As a spectacle for the mind and heart, it never quite leaves Earth behind. And perhaps that’s as it should be, at least at this early stage. With any luck, there will be more to see and much more to think about in “Dune: Part Two,” the completion of which will depend to some degree on this first movie’s fortunes. Will “Dune” conjure enough coin — the spice of the Hollywood realm — to see itself through to completion? I suspect it might, in part because I doubt Villeneuve, a filmmaker more dependable than he is interesting, has it in him to add to “Dune’s” string of memorably catastrophic failures. Dust has long been his truest cinematic habitat, and to dust may he return. Justin Chang was a film critic for the Los Angeles Times from 2016 to 2024.

"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Dune reminds us what a Hollywood blockbuster can be. Implicitly, its message written again and again in the sand, Denis Villeneuve’s fantasy epic tells us that big-budget spectaculars don’t have to be dumb or hyperactive, that it’s possible to allow the odd quiet passage amid the explosions. Adapted from Frank Herbert’s 60s opus, Dune is dense, moody and quite often sublime – the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse. Encountering it here was like stumbling across some fabulous lost tribe, or a breakaway branch of America’s founding fathers who laid out the template for a different and better New World. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, your archetypal hero, unsure of his powers and questioning the merits of the mountainous task before him. His father, the Duke (Oscar Isaac), has been handed stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis, source of a magical substance called “spice”, which extends life and fuels space travel – all the good stuff. But Arrakis, though sandy, is not entirely deserted. It is home to vast worms that can rise up with little warning, and an oppressed people – the Fremen – who see the spice harvesters as exploiters. If the tale’s real-world relevance was not clear enough, Villeneuve has taken the decision to put the local women in hijabs and make the bulk of his interiors look like north Africa. On their arrival, Paul and the Duke tramp down the gangplank wearing golden livery, serenaded by bagpipers. They could be a pair of old-style colonials, come to impose civilisation on the natives and fill their coffers with plunder. But the desert world of Dune has a knack for destroying those who come to tame it, just as the novel itself has claimed some high-profile casualties. Alejandro Jodorowsky tried and failed to bring it to the screen. David Lynch’s 1984 version was widely dismissed as a dud, while a TV miniseries that aired in 2000 appears to have since turned to dust. Even Villeneuve finds himself unable to celebrate a victory just yet. The Dune we have here covers only the first half of the book. Should this crash and burn at the box office, his story looks likely to remain incomplete. “I’ve been set up to fail,” says the Duke when spice production has stalled and he realises how malign the forces behind him really are. Josh Brolin’s weapons master can’t save him, while Stellan Skarsgard’s bloated, floating baron is plotting a bloody revenge. Paul’s only chance is to embrace his disenchantment and carve out a new path, one that leads into the hills. The sand blows and drifts like a living thing. The worms will swallow you whole if given half a chance, and poor Paul’s in a hole, wondering what he will do next. “This is only the beginning,” he is assured – and one dearly hopes this is true. In the meantime: good heavens, what a film. The drama is played out with relish by an ensemble cast (Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa) and Villeneuve is confident enough to let the temperature slowly build before the big operatic set-pieces eventually break cover. He has constructed an entire world for us here, thick with myth and mystery, stripped of narrative signposts or even much in the way of handy exposition. He has handed us a movie to map out at our leisure and figure out on the run: apparently spitting on someone is an gesture of respect, while walking sideways like a crab is the safest way to proceed. After that we’re on our own, wandering in the desert, wonderfully immersed. It’s a film of discovery; an invitation to get lost.  Dune screens at the Venice film festival and is released in Australia and the UK on 21 October, and in the US on 22 October."

Editor’s note: This review was originally published at the 2021 Venice Film Festival. Warner Bros. will release the film in theaters and streaming on HBO Max on Friday, October 22. In the end, Denis Villeneuve was all too right: Your television isn’t big enough for the scope of his “Dune,” but that’s only because this lifeless spice opera is told on such a comically massive scale that a screen of any size would struggle to contain it. Likewise, no story — let alone the misshapen first half of one — could ever hope to support the enormity of what Villeneuve tries to build over the course of these interminable 155 minutes (someone mentions that time is measured differently on Arrakis), or the sheer weight of the self-serious portent that he pounds into every shot. For all of Villeneuve’s awe-inducing vision, he loses sight of why Frank Herbert’s foundational sci-fi opus is worthy of this epic spectacle in the first place. Such are the pitfalls of making a movie so large that not even its director can see around the sets. How big is “Dune”? We’re talkin’ slabs upon slabs of angular concrete as far as the eye can see, spaceships that seem to displace entire oceans when they emerge from the seabeds of Caladan, and sandworms so large they could eat the Graboids from “Tremors” like bar nuts. Even yoked kings Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista look like tabletop miniatures when placed against its backdrops, as if cinematographer Greig Fraser discovered a way to shoot deep focus and tilt-shift at the same time. So why, for all of its unparalleled immensity, does watching “Dune” amount to the cinematic equivalent of being handed a novelty-sized check made out for six dollars? Why is the scope of Villeneuve’s dream betrayed by the dull shallowness of its reality to the point that his film’s most astounding effects — which are every bit as tactile and transportive as those in “Blade Runner 2049” — feel more like optical illusions? Why does this “Dune” feel so small? The first and most fundamental problem is a screenplay (credited to the heavyweight trio of Eric Roth, Jon Spaihts, and Villeneuve himself) that drills into Herbert’s novel with all the thunder and calamity of a spice harvester, but mines precious little substance from underneath the surface. And while it’s not much of a shock that Denis Villeneuve hasn’t succeeded where the likes of David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky have already failed, his “Dune” is at least uniquely dispiriting, as the director of “Prisoners,” “Incendies,” and “Arrival” comes to this project with such a deep affinity for stories about transcending cyclical violence. Alas, that’s really all this adaptation is allowed to be, as the source material is bisected in a way that punts all of Herbert’s most resonant (and psychedelically unstable) ideas about the braided relationship between colonialism and chosen one narratives into a sequel that may never be made. It’s hard to overstate how little actually happens in this “Dune,” which flows like an overture that’s stretched for the duration of an entire opera. In stark contrast to the Lynch version — which immediately unpacks the Emperor’s twisted scheme to weaken house Atreides by giving it control of the spice planet Arrakis — Villeneuve’s film sees this story through the eyes of the great family’s young heir, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and embraces the boy’s awestruck confusion at moving to a desert world and learning that he was bred to be the white savior of its native people. “Who will our next oppressor be?” Zendaya asks in the introductory voiceover that Villeneuve gives her in lieu of a character to play, but the rest of the movie completely betrays that sting of suspicion. This much-debated aspect of “Dune” is complicated in later installments of Herbert’s series, but here it remains unchallenged; Paul is Jesus Christ as a eugenics experiment designed by space witch Charlotte Rampling, who paired Duke Atreides (a bearded and winsome Oscar Isaac, who gets to yell “Desert power!” several times) with a very special concubine (the ever-capable Rebecca Ferguson), and the Bedouin-coded Fremen of Arrakis are happy to accept this foreign twerp as their prophet. It helps that Chalamet is a natural fit in the role. The actor is something of a chosen one himself — a gawky New York kid who leveraged his internet boyfriend status into legitimate stardom — and Villeneuve helps steer him toward the dislocation of a bird-boned model descended from a line of sex mystics and Hemingways. Paul Atreides invented the blankness that Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter would later inherit, but Chalamet spices things up by making the character palpably out of his depth. As you would expect from a movie that features approximately 50 percent of the world’s famous actors, casting isn’t a problem here. “Dune” only falters when it comes to giving its cast something to do. Josh Brolin is all pugnacious charm as the beefy mentor with a heart of gold, but he’s reduced to grist for the mill as soon as the action relocates to Arrakis, leaving only the shield technology he uses in his sparring matches with Paul as a legacy; the red and blue Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots effect is a big upgrade from how Lynch rendered the shields back in 1984, but Villeneuve’s disastrous choice to double down on it throughout the rest of the movie robs every subsequent action sequence of any beauty or believable sense of danger. Momoa is similarly likable as swordmaster Duncan Idaho, but spends most of “Dune” trapped in Paul’s insufferable dreams of the future, which are scattered throughout the story like ransom notes from a more exciting cut of the film. The characters with less screen time make more of an impact, especially the gluttonous robber-baron Harkonnens who cede control of Arrakis only to grow stronger in the shadows. Bautista serves up some very large adult son energy as the second-in-command, David Dastmalchian is all sniveling creepiness as the grand vizier, and Stellan Skargård is the undisputed MVP as Baron Harkonnen himself, whose performance finally answers the question: “What if ‘The Island of Dr. Moreau’-era Marlon Brando could fly?” But “Dune,” at heart, is a film that eagerly flattens great actors like Chang Chen and Stephen McKinley Henderson into the wallpaper because it knows the scenery will have to do most of the heavy lifting. Patrice Vermette’s astonishing and cavernous production design complements (or enables) the stagnant ultra-formalism that Villeneuve has pursued since “Incendies,” and anyone who felt that “Blade Runner 2049” could use 100 percent more aerial shots of ships flying above some unlivable future-scape will feel like they’ve died and gone to heaven. But Villeneuve’s seismic world-building is all tone and no melody. He spends precious minutes detailing the topography of Arrakis and the suits that allow people to survive its deserts, but devotes nary a moment to Duke Atreides’ private concerns about the intergalactic feudalism that shapes his fate, or Paul’s nebulous inner conflict over leaving his old world behind. That “Star Wars” and its blockbuster ilk have burned Herbert’s sci-fi tropes into the collective unconscious should be an opportunity for a 21st century film like this, not an excuse. And yet Villeneuve’s only move is to crank up the volume until the distortion makes it sound like you’re experiencing something new, a tactic that has its upsides (e.g. the Bene Gesserit’s voice seems like it’s coming from inside your soul), but also leads Hans Zimmer to fall back on the ethnographic wailing of his “Gladiator”-era scores. Few composers would have been able to match the Lynch version’s one-two punch of Brian Eno and Toto, but Zimmer just thumps around in the sand as if he wants the worms to eat us all. Fear not: The sandworms do come. They are big and bristly and they’re responsible for the only scene in which the film’s biblical drone is enlivened by even the tiniest dollop of dramatic tension. Villeneuve is in love with the scale of these subterranean beasties, each of which is half as long as the R.M.S. Titanic, and he frames them with such palpable awe that you almost expect the “Jurassic Park” theme to play every time they rear their butthole heads. But one look at the sandworms is enough to rob them of their mystery. They’re soon reduced to sound and earthquakes, signifying nothing but your growing desire to be watching “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” instead. And that literalness, or at least that abject lack of associative thought, is what damns this “Dune” beyond salvation. Here is a film consumed by dreams from even before the moment it starts (you’ll see what I mean), but also one so arch and full of empty spectacle that it keeps your imagination on a tight leash, which grows all the more enervating as Paul and his mother find themselves being chased through the desert by sandworms in the final act. Eventually, “Dune” only resembles a dream in that it cuts out on a note so flat and unresolved that you can’t believe anyone would have chosen it on purpose. “This is only the beginning,” the last line threatens, and yet it unmistakably feels like the end of something too. Not the end of watching movies on the big screen, but perhaps the end of making movies that are too big to fit on it.

"Sep 3, 2021",NEGATIVE," Unless you’re sufficiently up on Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi classic to know your Sardaukars from your Bene Gesserit, your crysknife from your hunter-seeker, chances are you’ll be glazing over not too far into Dune. Or wishing that House Atreides and House Harkonnen would kick off a vogue ball. What the film doesn’t do is shape Herbert’s intricate world-building into satisfyingly digestible form. The history and complex societal structure that are integral to the author’s vision are condensed into a blur, cramping the mythology. The layers of political, religious, ecological and technological allegory that give the novel such exalted status get mulched in the screenplay by Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve and Eric Roth into an uninvolving trade war, with the blobby Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) ordering a genocide to secure a monopoly of the addictive Spice found only in the desert wastelands of the planet Arrakis. That drug looks like a glitter bomb set off in the sand in the dreamlike visions of Paul Atreides (Chalamet) that punctuate the action with numbing regularity. The mind-expanding substance’s benefits to health, longevity and knowledge place it in high demand, as we learn during an exposition dump disguised as Paul’s study time. Those visions also feature Chani (Zendaya), a member of the Fremen civilization that lives on Arrakis; she haunts Paul throughout in a spiritual connection, but doesn’t show up physically until the final scenes, just in time to say, “This is only the beginning.” Never a good sign at the end of a two-and-a-half-hour movie that has long since been sagging under its dense thicket of plot. It’s the year 10191, and House Harkonnen has been in charge of harvesting Spice for some time, ravaging the land and inflicting cruelty on the Fremen. But the emperor abruptly pulls them out and puts Paul’s father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), in control, giving House Atreides exclusive stewardship over Arrakis. Leto and his concubine Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul’s mother, both see the vulnerability in their elevation, even if the Duke hopes to forge an alliance with the Fremen and bring peace. For reasons that the film hurries through with too much haste to clarify, the stage is set for war nonetheless, and Leto calls the reluctant Paul to power as the future of House Atreides. Part hero’s journey and part survival story, the film keeps throwing arcane details at you, which might thrill the Herbert geeks but will have most everyone else zoning out. Villeneuve is a smart director who honed his chops on brainy sci-fi with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. For sheer monolithic scale, visual imagination and visceral soundscape alone, a number of the set pieces are arresting, and the film has the benefit of putting the focus on physical production, with far less CG saturation than most of its recent genre brethren. There’s much to admire in Patrice Vermette’s production design, particularly the Zen elegance of the aristocratic Atreides household on their beautiful oceanic home planet of Caladan and the Arrakis stronghold Arrakeen, a sprawling structure that combines ancient Egyptian and Aztec influences. The costumes by Jacqueline West and Robert Morgan also are full of eye-catching touches, from the gauzy gowns of Jessica and other women billowing in the desert wind to the utilitarian body-cooling “stillsuit” developed by the Fremen for survival in the desert, equipped with a fluid-recycling system. On a scene-by-scene basis, Dune is occasionally exciting, notably whenever Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) is in action, backed by Hans Zimmer’s thundering orchestral score. (Duncan also benefits from being the only guy in this dull old universe with a sense of humor.) But the storytelling lacks the clean lines to make it consistently propulsive. Paradoxically, given its lofty position in the sci-fi canon, much of the narrative’s novelty has also been diluted, rendered stale by decades of imitation. Looking at you, George Lucas. I found myself less interested in the human ordeals than the tech business — the giant Harkonnen harvesters raking the sands like desert beetles as monstrous sandworms tunnel up to the surface to suck everything into their huge fibrous maws; the wasp-winged choppers known as ornithopters, buzzing through the skies; the stillsuits and the recycling tubes of an emergency tent, turning sweat and tears into drinkable water. Perhaps the biggest issue with Dune, however, is that this is only the first part, with the second film in preproduction. That means an awful lot of what we’re watching feels like laborious setup for a hopefully more gripping film to come — the boring homework before the juicy stuff starts happening. Zendaya’s role, in particular, is basically a prelude to a larger arc that Paul has partly foreseen, where he lives among the Fremen as their “Lisan al Gaib,” or off-world prophet, as they plot to take back Arrakis. A quick glimpse of him rodeo-riding a sandworm signals the future extent of his powers. Other actors, like Javier Bardem as proud Fremen chieftain Stilgar, will presumably have more to do, as will good guys like Josh Brolin’s Atreides warmaster Gurney Halleck if part two sticks to Herbert’s plot. On the villainous side, Skarsgard’s levitating lard-ass Baron Harkonnen and his thuggish nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) seem sure to be back to wreak more destruction."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE,"  Earlier this summer, director Denis Villeneuve made news for insisting that watching Dune on television would be like ""driv[ing] a speedboat in your bathtub."" To some people, it sounded like the petty grievances of an out-of-touch auteur — or worse, a fundamental misunderstanding of the way post-pandemic Hollywood operates: any which way it can.
  All that might be true, but it doesn't mean he's wrong. In fact Villeneuve's new adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic 1965 novel is exactly the kind of lush, lofty filmmaking wide screens were made for; a sensory experience so opulent and overwhelming it begs to be seen big, or not at all. That the movie (which premiered Friday at the Venice Film Festival, ahead of a theatrical and HBO Max release Oct. 22) seems to have room for only half the story — and that its emotional palate is considerably more limited than its artistic one — feels relative in many ways to the fandom. If you're already knee-deep in Herbert mythology, you'll thrill to every whispered word; if you come in not knowing the difference between a Holtzman shield and a hole in the floor, it's a longer walk.
  The introduction, in any case, wastes little time on exposition: The year is 10191 and Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) has come with his longtime concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their grown son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), to oversee the colonized planet of Arrakis — a harsh, arid place whose lone prized export is a shimmery dust called Spice. The natives who manage to scrape out a subsistence living farming it there are known as Fremens, their Listerine-blue eyes and Mad Max-style compounds necessary adaptations to the unforgiving climate.
  Paul is soon visited by dreams of one Fre-woman in particular, Chani (Zendaya), disturbing visions that come to him unreliably and often without context but seem to portend real future events. To Lady Jessica, a member of an ancient all-female order known as the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, it's further proof that her child may in fact be the one chosen to save them all — centuries of selective eugenics finally come to bear in the body of a boy whose gender just happens to be wrong, or at least not what the Sisterhood planned for.
  She's not the only one to take note of his particular gifts: The leader of Atreides' born enemy, the slug-bodied Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) feels the ripple of his presence and the Fremens do too — even if loyal foot soldiers of his father's, including Josh Brolin's taciturn weapons master Gurney Halleck and Jason Momoa's cheerful warrior Duncan Idaho, continue to treat him like an essential if ordinary heir, to be trained and mentored and kept safe in the line of succession.
  There are, you may have already sensed, no small actors in Dune, even in small parts: a veiled, imperious Charlotte Rampling as the Mother Superior who puts Paul to a memorable test; Javier Bardem as a terse Fremen chieftan; Dave Bautista as the Baron's brooding bull-necked nephew. Zendaya's Chani, who appears far more verbal in the trailer than she does in the actual film, moves through most of it as a sort of teasing apparition, less fully fleshed character than elusive spirit guide­-slash-dream-key to Paul's destiny.
  To be fair, it's hard to imagine a mortal movie star who wouldn't be dwarfed by the exquisite, elaborate world-building happening on screen. As he proved on projects like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve's gift for visual storytelling can be genuinely breathtaking — vast desertscapes unscrolling like oceans and helicopters with dragonfly-wing blades where the rotors should be; the kidney-piercing resonance of Hans Zimmer's soundtrack poured over sets of towering, planet-scaled enormity. (Speculation that Dune's M.O. would be ""Star Wars, but make it fashion"" is not completely off-base.) If anything falls short of Herbert's particular vision it's the movie's sandworms, who for all their faceless foreboding mostly register as super-size CG tubes; colossal, unwieldy vacuum-cleaner attachments gone rogue.
  Dune is so aesthetically rich and monolithic that a few brief, misguided stabs at Marvel-style humor early on feel almost like blasphemy. The script seems to know it and soon settles into a kind of grim grandeur, each turn a building block to nothing less than the interstellar fate of the free world. Chalamet aptly channels the ethereal beauty and conflicted psyche of a reluctant savior, his troubled, tender Paul a sort of sci-fi Hamlet forced by fate and circumstance to bear the full weight of history, and Isaacs' Duke is both a noble warrior and a father so lovingly supportive he belongs in the Call Me By Your Name dad hall of fame. At some point, it is virtually guaranteed that they and nearly everyone else on screen will appear in a visual tableau worth gasping over.
"
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," An adult human body is 60 per cent water. But the audience leaving Friday morning's Venice Film Festival screening of Dune were, by this critic’s reckoning, around 90 per cent goosebump. This new adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert novel from Denis Villeneuve, the director of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, is science-fiction at its most majestic, unsettling and enveloping. Watching it feels like wandering through some enormous, otherworldly structure built in honour of higher powers you’ve never heard of – and, from the look of the place, rather hope don’t actually exist.  The first panel of a proposed epic diptych, it concludes almost exactly halfway through the plot of Herbert’s novel – though by its end, seeing the story completed feels less urgent than the prospect of just spending even more time in the extraordinary world created by Villeneuve and his collaborators. Every detail feels threateningly alien, but also enticing, even addictive. The costumes by Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan are like occult-fascist regalia. The sets ring with the desolate grandeur of ancient ruins. The giant sandworms, the novel’s signature monster, look like two Freudian nightmares combined: gargantuan phallic symbols with a touch of vagina dentata thrown in to cover all bases. (The shockwaves that ripple over the desert’s surface as the worms approach are one of the few details to be carried over more or less intact from David Lynch’s valiant dog’s dinner of an adaptation from 1984.) As for Hans Zimmer’s planetary earthquake of a score – reader, when he struck up the electro-bagpipes, I gasped. Timothée Chalamet is ideally cast as Paul, sullen heir of the noble House Atreides, which is charged by the Emperor with overseeing the mining operation on the hostile desert planet of Arrakis. The job is of supreme strategic importance, since the substance being mined is spice, a rare and valuable compound necessary for interstellar travel. Until recently, this task was entrusted to House Harkonnen, Atreides’ bitter rivals, and their leader Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), a pallid, tumorous horror who doesn’t walk but glides unnaturally above the ground. Herbert’s novel explains that this is possible due to an anti-gravity device known as a suspensor – though Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve and Eric Roth’s lean, efficient script explains away nothing, and prioritises amazement over the kind of deadening exposition designed to appease pedantic YouTubers. Much Jacobean scheming ensues, as House Atreides arrives on Arrakis and attempts to execute the Emperor’s orders while the Harkonnens lurk in the shadows, waiting for their moment to strike. But the Atreides have their own secret weapon in the form of Paul himself, who has been groomed since birth by his mother Jessica (a tremendous, melodramatically on-target Rebecca Ferguson) for her religious order’s own mysterious cause. Ferguson’s chemistry with Chalamet – devotional, bordering on incestuous – is at the heart of Villeneuve’s Dune, as is the strictly formal yet deeply felt dynamic between Chalamet and Oscar Isaac, who is suitably magisterial as Paul’s father, Duke Leto. The ensemble cast is sublimely well picked, from Zendaya as an Arrakis Fremen native mostly glimpsed in Paul’s dreams, to Charlotte Rampling as the blood-chilling leader of Ferguson’s cult. “Our plans are measured in centuries,” Rampling croaks from behind a beaded veil; a terrific original line that feels acutely Herbert-esque.  Ordinary, simplistic blockbuster moral dynamics, meanwhile, are hairily conspicuous by their absence. The Harkonnens are unquestionably evil, but there’s no sense that the fiercely regimented, autocratic House Atreides are the good guys: rather, they’re just the side we happen to be on, for better or worse. As such, when the Harkonnen-sponsored strike on the Atreides’ ziggurat-like stronghold comes, it isn’t tense so much as simply awe-striking. On a first encounter, this 12-minute sequence feels like it could be one of the great sustained action set-pieces of 21st-century cinema, masterfully expanding then contracting in focus to overwhelming effect. A shot of Jason Momoa’s buccaneering Duncan Idaho fleeing in a light aircraft while an orbital laser beam as thick as the Burj Khalifa carves a trench in the buildings behind him is the kind of spectacle that doesn’t merely scratch an itch but leave a mark. Much speculation has already ensued over Dune’s commercial prospects: with an estimated budget of $165 million, a new adaptation of this unfashionable, director-thwarting novel is a potentially costly creative risk. But in the age of Game of Thrones, the audience is out there – and if they find it, obsession surely awaits."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," It is not much of a spoiler to note that it is Zendaya who has the last word in director Denis Villeneuve’s sweeping and spectacular new film version of Dune, which just had its world premiere Friday at the Venice Film Festival. “This is only the beginning,” says her dreamlike fierce fighter Chani. And for Villeneuve’s vision of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, with its legions of devoted fans in wait, this 2-hour, 35-minute epic apparently is only the beginning as the opening credits state this is just Part One. Reportedly the director is already hard at work on a screenplay for a proposed Part Two, the plan being to bring the book fully to life in more than one film — but not as a television limited series. This is meant for the biggest screens imaginable, which is probably why Villeneuve became so vocal upon hearing the pandemic plans of distributor Warner Bros, which is opening all its 2021 films day-and-date in theaters accompanied by a one-month run on its nascent streamer HBO Max, Dune included. All of this led to a clash among Legendary, the production entity behind the film; Villeneuve; and Warner Bros. Although it is clearly headed for HBO Max as part of this deal, Dune must be experienced, as I did at Warner Bros’ Steven J. Ross theater, on a large screen with immersive sight and sound. No matter what your opinion is of the source material, this vision for bringing it alive as a movie deserves only premium exhibition. Of course, Dune has been tried before. David Lynch’s 1984 attempt was poorly received. Lynch himself feels it is the one failure of his film career, a nut he just couldn’t crack. In fact when it came to television the network split it into two parts by adding about 45 minutes of outtakes to pad the presentation. Lynch was so upset he took his name off the TV version and used the DGA-approved pseudonym of Alan Smithee. For more on Lynch’s production, see our new interview with that film’s leading lady, Francesca Annis. Villeneuve was clearly born to bring this one home. A devotee of the novel since first reading it at age 14, the director always had Frank Herbert’s novel on his bucket list of films he would love to make. Villeneuve has gone faithfully, with co-writers Jon Spaiths and Eric Roth, to the heart and soul of Herbert’s vision, focusing on the human element of the futuristic story, set some 8,000 years or so from now when a crisis of ecology and the environment sparks a massive turf war between two families — the Great Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen — as the battle for survival moves to an imposing planet named Arrakis, aka Dune as its native Fremen tribes call it.  Extreme heat, blinding sandstorms, killer sandworms and, well, lots and lots of sand make it a challenging place for anyone to conquer, but it is also home to Spice, the substance needed in order to exist, to power flight, and to energize the population in numerous ways. In a close-up, Spice looks kind of like paprika; next time I am in Whole Foods I will have a whole new appreciation as I walk past the spice racks. In the lore of Dune, whole worlds can vanish without Spice. The filmmakers here — including cinematographer Greig Fraser, production designer Patrice Vermette, costume designers Jacqueline West and Robert Morgan among others — have fashioned worlds ready for epic battles, but Villeneuve, married to the more urgent themes in Herbert’s prescient novel, alssees all this is played out on a more intimate level as a family story, a father-son tale as well as a mother-son story. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is a young man given an extraordinary opportunity and dangerous assignment as the reins to his powerful family’s fortune are increasingly placed in his hands by his father Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) and equally important mother Lady Jessica, a warrior priestess played winningly by Rebecca Ferguson.  Paul is green, but eager to take on the fight on Arrakis where alliances will make all the difference in battling the Harkonnen dynasty led by the ruthless and evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a virtually unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgård, buried under pounds of prosthetics) who will stop at nothing to continue control of this barren land and its ever-valuable resource. His No. 1 henchman, Glossu “Beast” Rabban (Dave Bautista), is even more vicious. The stage is set for a battle, but equal weight is given to defining not just Paul, but also mom and dad. Those situations may be set far in the future, but they will have a ring of familiarity for anyone today. The issues we deal with now — particularly taking care of our planet and its resources through conquering climate change — are not that far off from the singular vision of Herbert’s novel. Devotees like Villeneuve and his crew have elevated his story to a large scale onscreen, but not allowed it to be overwhelmed by special effects.  Regarding the latter, Villeneuve and his team has captured much of this in-camera, though his VFX team — led by Paul Lambert and Gerd Nefzer — has contributed some astonishing set pieces in all that sand. A big shout-out is necessary to the massive musical contribution from Hans Zimmer, as well. Chalamet, playing it earnestly and effectively, is perfectly cast here, and both Ferguson and Isaac are excellent, as is Skarsgård, who seems to be relishing his over-the-top character. Among the women, Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet Kynes — a character written as a man in the novel — is very good in her brief screen time, as is the iconic Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who offers sage advice to Paul early on in assessing his readiness to take on the mantle. Josh Brolin is solid as Gurney Halleck, essentially a father figure as well to Paul in the House of Atreides, as is Jason Momoa as the daring Duncan Idaho and Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the inspirational voice of experience on Arrakis. The list goes on. Producers are Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Joe Carraciolo Jr and Villeneuve, who can safely now add Dune (Part One) to his list of impressive deep dives into very distinct sci-fi worlds, a list that also includes the Oscar-nominated and -winning Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Warner Bros will release Dune in theaters on October 22 and HBO Max the same day.

"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," The sci-fi epic “Dune” boasts a few films’ worth of giant sandworms, amazing spaceships, cosmic armies and galactic political drama, though it essentially is only half a movie. Director Denis Villeneuve’s visually arresting big-budget adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic – well, a good bit of the novel anyway – is an odd bird and a mixed bag. “Dune” (★★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters and on HBO Max) is impressively ambitious in scale, like Villeneuve mashing up the worlds of “Star Wars” and “Game of Thrones,” but with that unmistakable signature style he showcased with “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049.” While the film (currently playing the film-festival circuit, hopping from Venice to Toronto to New York) has a lot going for it, including a pretty stellar cast, real-world metaphors and an intriguing twist on a war-movie aesthetic, it's lacking in character development, and aspects of the book's substantial mythology are tossed in to keep your head swimming over 2½ hours. In the year 10191, the noble House of Atreides – led by Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac) – is tapped to relocate from the rather pleasant planet of Caladan to dangerous, desert-filled Arrakis to oversee the mining of Spice, a precious resource that does wonders for human existence and makes interstellar travel possible, and to tame the indigenous Fremen. Leto’s teenage son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), has had vivid dreams of this new place – specifically a young Fremen girl with shining blue eyes named Chani (Zendaya) – and this phenomenon has brought extra attention from the Bene Gesserit, an all-female order with superpowers including Paul’s warrior priestess mom, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Paul is seen in some circles as a messiah, so he’s caught between an ancient prophecy and being an heir to a renowned house. Their rivals in villainous House Harkonnen – including Baron Harkonnen (a near-unrecognizable Stellan Skarsgard), a slovenly mix of Jabba the Hutt, Colonel Kurtz and the Emperor from “Star Wars” – were Spice stewards for 80 years, and they’re out to sabotage their successors. And the Fremen, led by the enigmatic Stilgar (Javier Bardem), are the most unpredictable wild cards of them all, though they loom large in Paul’s story. Alongside themes of ecology and colonialism, the movie boasts plenty of factions and personalities, though good luck actually investing in any of them. Chalamet’s a talented actor, but Paul’s a tortured, broody sort, while Isaac and Ferguson do what they can with fairly dry parental figures. Everything’s overly serious in “Dune,” though the guy who's most enjoyable (and has the best name) is Jason Momoa as Atreides sword master Duncan Idaho, a fearless warrior loyal to his crew yet absolutely joyful whenever his old student Paul is around. Also noteworthy is Dr. Liet Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), a gender-swapped Fremen figure from the Herbert book who works for the emperor (yes, “Dune” has one of those, too) transitioning Arrakis to Atreides’ control. The other issue for Paul and Co. is that there’s much more to their tale not in this movie. Unlike, say, the horror film “It,” where the first film stood as a singular story and you didn’t have to see its sequel, “Dune” doesn’t: It gets to a point and just ends, not to mention being extremely anticlimactic. Imagine watching the original “Star Wars” if they blew up the Death Star midway through and then Luke Skywalker tussled with a few Tusken Raiders in the finale. (George Lucas was influenced by ""Dune,"" and audiences will find the use of “the Voice,” a psychic ability wielded by Paul and his mother, to be very Force-like, though there is some striking sonic originality here.) Even with its imperfections, “Dune” as an experience is awesome, with astounding special effects, great production design and a propulsive Hans Zimmer score. Insect/helicopter hybrid vehicles buzz around, Paul’s frequent future visions add a mysteriously neat vibe, and it’s hard to beat scarily mawed sandworms that could stretch across quite a few football fields. You’ll just need to hope for a ""Dune"" sequel – or head to the books – for it all to make sense. Sure, it's got Spice, but better storytelling would be nice."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," The phrase ""a lot is resting on…"" has, over the past year and a bit, appeared too often in reviews of big films charged with restarting the industry: Tenet, Wonder Woman 1984, Black Widow. Premiering out of competition at Venice Film Festival, Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune is under more pressure than most. The title on the screen is Dune: Part One. Despite stretching out over 155 leisurely minutes, the austere, complex, beautifully shot fantasy epic barely gets the plot of Frank Herbert's source novel into third gear. When Villeneuve conceived the film – long before Covid, as his Blade Runner sequel was poised for world domination – it scarcely seemed possible that a concluding episode would be in jeopardy. Then Blade Runner 2049 underperformed. The exhibition business is still spluttering after lockdown. Dune will, in the United States, debut simultaneously in cinemas and on the HBO Max streaming service. Might Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mum, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), be left stranded forever midsentence? We will get to that later. What cannot be denied is that Villeneuve has, for good or ill, approached the task with great earnestness. The flinty aesthetic he brought to Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 has, appropriately for the setting, here been baked to bone dryness. Remaining true to his sulky-teenager persona, Chalamet allows Atreides barely a smirk as he moves from the grim sea-battered cliffs of Caladan (it's actually Norway, but it could be Donegal) to the scarcely cheerier deserts of the inhospitable planet Arrakis. The architecture has the blocky brutalist look that set designers favoured for productions of Hamlet in the 1980s. The spaceships resemble giant grey suitcases. Few will have expected – or desired – the surreal camp that David Lynch brought to his still-divisive 1984 adaptation, but the unforgiving starkness will unsettle even some of Villeneuve's greatest fans. Still, the forbidding approach – a sort of billion-dollar Spartanism – does allow the complex diplomatic manoeuvres to play out relatively cleanly. Working with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve has devised a script that fillets out much of the meandering and leaves in a firm narrative skeleton. Atreides, heir to his family’s ancient House, is dispatched to Arrakis, where, like so many colonists, he is concerned with the extraction of a valuable commodity. In our planet’s history it has been rubber, coffee and oil. Here it is a substance called melange (or “spice”) that makes everything possible that science fiction requires to be possible. The politics are a bit screwy for a story devised in the politically charged 1960s. It almost seems to be argued (at this early stage, anyway) that House Atreides, unlike the awful House Harkonnen, counts among that elusive class of “benign colonists”. One imagines a British imperial voice telling the desert-dwelling Fremen that they should be grateful they hadn’t been taken over by the Germans or the Belgians. Anyway, those arguments may be clarified in that promised second episode. For now, Villeneuve has to manoeuvre Atreides and his loyal mother from his home planet to the desert domain and deep into a mess of betrayal. He does so with all the murky elegance we have come to expect from that director. Destruction is elegantly operatic. Smaller set pieces work in more invidious fashion: Charlotte Rampling, hidden behind a gauze veil, but still unmistakably herself, has the standout cameo as a sinister elder with improbable psychic gifts. Hans Zimmer outdoes himself with a blaring score that makes diverting use of massed bagpipes. All other Zimmer scores feel like rehearsals for the current intergalactic HONK! What’s really missing here is character. The most charismatic actors in the piece – Josh Brolin, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem – are stuck with roles that are either too brief or too sketchily drawn. Ferguson and Chalamet, on whom the action ultimately hangs, worry hard but generate not a single spark between them. Fans of Zendaya should be aware that she is barely in the thing. Dune: Part One feels like a beautifully designed machine that, for all its elegant clockwork, fails to deliver much that connects with the soul. Will it generate enough income to allow completion? Warner Bros, the worldwide distributor, financed Stanley Kubrick even after the financial catastrophe that was Barry Lyndon. But that great director wasn’t trying to make Barry Lyndon Pt II."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," The best-selling books in the Dune series are as intriguing and ambiguous as a desert's shifting sands. So it makes sense a star-studded new movie adaptation from director Denis Villeneuve manages to be both hugely satisfying and incredibly frustrating. The 2021 Dune film is a tour de force of cinematic sci-fi, a star-studded yet deeply weird fantasy epic, and a thoughtful and thrilling movie experience. Villeneuve's version of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel opens with a title reading ""Dune: Part One."" That's your first warning that the film isn't going to give you a lot of closure. It's certainly packed with ideas and stunning visuals and information by the spaceship-load, but it's also the setup for a story that's just getting going when out of nowhere the credits roll. Having premiered to (mostly) critical acclaim at the Venice and New York Film Festivals, Dune hit theaters Thursday, Oct. 21, and debuted the same day on US streaming service HBO Max. It's now available to rent and buy online, or you can own it on DVD and Blu-ray. Dune is already the biggest hit for Warner Bros. in the pandemic era, so Warner has confirmed Part Two will open in 2023 -- which is good, because Part One would've been an unsatisfying cinematic experience if the sequel never came.  The powerful Atreides and Harkonnen families are space aristos squabbling over the planet Arrakis, a desert world where the only thing more treacherous than the shifting sands is the backstabbing politics. Arrakis is the only source of spice, a substance that acts as the fuel for space travel in the Dune universe. On Arrakis, spice glitters in the very air, riches so intoxicating you can taste them. Spice has a mysterious allure for Timothée Chalamet's young princeling Paul Atreides. He's got a lot going on: His dad (Oscar Isaac) is an upright duke teaching him to play the game of cosmic realpolitik; his mom (Rebecca Ferguson) is a superpowered space witch; he's plagued by horny teen dreams of a blue-eyed desert warrior (Zendaya); and he just might be an intergalactic messiah. Paul is at the heart of this thumping space epic, which combines Shakespearian castle intrigue with wide-screen desert vistas, incendiary battle scenes and a cast of billions. In Villeneuve's hands, this version of Dune is a richly detailed and hugely evocative imagining filled with striking imagery. It's supremely and winningly odd.  The film juxtaposes fever-dream science-fantasy with medieval imagery: Sinister space nuns in billowing robes descend from looming spaceships; Interplanetary treaties are endorsed with wax seals beneath fluttering banners; Berserker armies make blood sacrifices before donning silent jetpacks. It's all faceless helmets and deep shadows as the action moves from rain-slicked granite to iridescent sand, set to a hypnotic and throbbing Hans Zimmer score of wailing choirs, electric drones, nerve-jangling percussion and great honking bwaarrrrps. And bagpipes.  The rain-lashed home world of the upright House Atreides is perfect for moody pacing on wave-battered cliffs. The vaguely Catholic decor of that world includes a bullfighting motif, which suggests two separate but intertwined themes: a foolhardy fight against an unpredictable opponent, and a link to Spain that recalls Spanish conquistadors of old. That link to ancient invaders highlights the timelessness of the urge to conquer and enslave, drawing a line from the past to the present. Dune's theme of ransacking desert resources has always resonated with western manipulation and exploitation of the rest of the world, from bygone days of colonialism to the Gulf War and the War on Terror. The conflict is explicitly grounded by Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser in the visual style of a modern war movie. Dragonfly-like aircraft thrum past the camera like Vietnam-era helicopter gunships as the air fills with distinctly 20th century radio chatter. All that's missing is Ride of the Valkyries on the soundtrack as Dune channels combat flicks from Apocalypse Now to Lawrence of Arabia to Black Hawk Down. The film opens with an army suddenly withdrawing from Arrakis, and it's a chilling image in light of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in recent weeks. The conflict is explicitly driven by wealth, and it's fascinating to see a sci-fi movie grapple with the economic aspect of politics as well as the familiar interplanetary power struggles of Star Wars and Star Trek. House Atreides may be noble and the Harkonnens venal, but their nature is irrelevant in this galactic economy: No matter how they feel about it, they must fill their quotas. Space capitalism! It's hardly a polemic, however. There are so many ideas flying about in this film that many are mentioned only once, and you're invited to develop your own thoughts on inequality, scarcity of resources, climate crisis, war, feudalism, space travel, dreams, parenthood, oneness with nature, and so much more. As if that wasn't enough to mull over, it's all wrapped up in a dense lore of multiple languages and strange terminology, which means multiple voice-overs explaining it all. The weirdness of the sci-fi is also grounded by a limited range of color on screen. Beyond the blackness of space, the only colors in this universe are gray and beige. Don't get me wrong, Dune looks great, but outside of the fantastical design, the muted palette borders on drab. The acting is also similarly muted: everybody is impassive and solemn and mutters the often incomprehensible dialogue in hushed tones. Like Villeneuve's previous films, it's dramatic and intense. But it's also rather one-note, allowing Jason Momoa to stand out, for example, just by showing that he's enjoying himself. The most dynamic range comes from Ferguson as the conflicted Atreides matriarch, embodying the emotional turmoil of a character who's both impassioned mother and scheming zealot. As for the actor in the leading role, Chalamet's cheekbones and soulful eyes do most of the storytelling. Like Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049, he doesn't have a great deal to say, which makes his character either beguilingly ambiguous or vaguely defined. Is he dutiful or distracted? Is he a reluctant leader or ambitious plotter? The young prince is troubled by visions of the future, and they're troubling for the viewer too. Some of those visions flash forward to a sequel, and frankly look more exciting than some of Part One's drawn-out sequences. With such an abrupt ending begging for a sequel, you might wonder if they shot the two films together. Nope: The sequel may go into production in late 2022, which was far from guaranteed in the face of a pandemic and a streaming release potentially cannibalizing box office takings. If you loved Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, then Dune is perhaps Denis Villeneuve at his Villeneuviest. If you love sweeping military sci-fi with a dash of weirdness thrown in, Dune will be your jam. The muted palette and performances won't be to everyone's taste, but I could spend a lot more time in this world -- when the sequel finally arrives in 2023, anyway."
"Sep 3, 2021",NEGATIVE," 
	Denis Villeneuve's adaptation has a majestic vastness, and most of it actually makes sense, but it's an act of world-building that runs out of storytelling steam. In “Dune,” Denis Villeneuve’s droolingly anticipated, eye-bogglingly vast adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 cult sci-fi novel, the characters fly around in airplanes that have three sets of wings, all of which flap very fast. The planes look like insects, and the film suggests that’s one way that a flying machine, in another planetary sphere, might have evolved. On Earth, we styled our airplanes after birds. In “Dune,” they’re modeled on bugs, which gives them a fluttery malevolence. “Dune,” a majestically somber and grand-scale sci-fi trance-out, is full of lavish hugger-mugger — clan wars, brute armies, a grotesque autocrat villain, a hero who may be the Messiah — that links it, in spirit and design, to the “Star Wars” and “Lord of the Rings” films, though with a predatory ominousness all its own. The desert-planet architecture, which is bigger than huge, is sandstone Mayan. The spaceships are like floating rocks the size of cities. And the cinematic style is “Lawrence of Arabia” meets “Triumph of the Will” meets the most visionary cologne commercial that Ridley Scott never made. (The movie is more than a little enthralled with the clockwork imagery of fascism.) “Dune” is out to wow us, and sometimes succeeds, but it also wants to get under your skin like a hypnotically toxic mosquito. It does…until it doesn’t. Here’s one useful definition of a great sci-fi fantasy film. It’s one in which the world-building is awesome but not more essential than the storytelling. In the first two “Star Wars” films, those dynamics were in perfect sync; they were, as well, in “The Dark Knight” and the “Mad Max” films. “Blade Runner,” in its way, is an amazing movie, but its world-building packs more punch than its transcendental neo-noir noodlings. Viewed in that light, “Dune” is a movie that earns five stars for world-building and about two-and-a-half for storytelling. If you stack it up next to David Lynch’s disastrously confounding 1984 adaptation of “Dune,” it can look like a masterpiece. (Most of the story now makes sense.) And for an hour or so, the movie is rather mesmerizing, throwing off seductive glints of treachery as it presents the tale of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the gifted scion of the House Atreides, whose father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), is leading what looks to be an opportunity, though one that’s fraught with peril. For 80 years, the forbidding desert planet of Arrakis has been presided over by the Harkonnen, who ruled with an iron fist as they controlled production of the valuable spice that’s embedded in the sand and the air. (In the book, the spice, called mélange, is a metaphor for oil and also for drugs. Here it’s a glittery abstraction.) Now, the emperor has ordered the Harkonnen to leave Arrakis and has placed the House Atreides in charge. They arrive like a newly occupying army. But they’re being set up as patsies. Villeneuve works hard to to stay true to the conspiratorial sprawl of Herbert’s sand-planet dream, even as he streamlines the book down to its most playable scenes. Chalamet, tall and skinny, with a quizzical innocence under his cloud of curls, resembles a willowy version of Edward Scissorhands, and he plays Paul as an untested hero with abilities he scarcely understands. They’re inherited from his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), an acolyte of the mystic matriarchal sect the Bene Gesserit, who wants to put him in touch with his inner cosmic savior. There are good scenes like one in which Paul learns to speak to his mother telepathically; or receives a lesson from Isaac’s warmly protective but all-too-vulnerable Leto, who speaks to him about the human choices encoded within destiny; or gets put through a primal test by his aunt, Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) — those names! Yes, they’re as annoying as the ones in the George Lucas prequels — who asks him to place his hand in a box of pain and withstand it. (He’d better; if he fails, she’ll stab his neck with a lethal needle.) Stellan Skarsgård, nearly unrecognizable as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who’s like a floating homicidal Jabba the Hutt crossed with Henry VIII crossed with Fat Bastard, sets the plot in motion, reclaiming Arrakis by trying to kill off just about everyone in the movie who most holds our attention. His success rate is a bit disarming. The hand-to-hand combat scenes in “Dune” have a flash of originality. Instead of lightsabers, the characters hit each with other weapons that reduce their bodies to electromagnetic freeze frames. It’s exciting to see Duncan Idaho, played by Jason Momoa as the film’s sexy-loyal-bruiser Han Solo figure, take on a small army of enemies. Yet where is all of this going? “Dune” keeps foreshadowing the moment when Paul will embed himself with the Fremen, the indigenous desert people of Arrakis who have a more organic relationship to the perilous landscape, and to the spice, than any of their rulers, but live in a state of ragged guerrilla oppression. They’re waiting for someone to liberate them, and Paul would seem to be that figure, since it’s prophesied by half a dozen interchangeable flash-forwards to his interface with Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen warrior-protector who is shot like some sort of desert princess. “Dune” opens with a title that reads “Dune Part I,” and there’s a standard but rather presumptuous promise embedded in those words: that after 2 hours and 35 minutes, we’ll be so hooked by this saga that we’ll be hungry for Part II. That, in a way, is the promise of every franchise. But the trouble with “Dune” is that it feels, at different points, like just about every other franchise. Over the decades, more than a few movies have been sprung from the DNA of Herbert’s universe, like (for instance) the opening act of “Star Wars.” And there’s a reason it’s that film’s first part; the desert is an awfully barren setting for sci-fi. (“Star Wars” starts slow and arid on purpose, all to set up the revelation of its kinetic second half.) “Dune” is rich with “themes” and visual motifs, but it turns into a movie about Chalamet’s Paul piloting through sandstorms and hooking up with the rebels of the desert, who in this movie are a lot more noble than interesting. It’s not just that the story loses its pulse. It loses any sense that we’re emotionally invested in it. The giant sandworms, who are protectors of the spice and burrow through the desert like a sinister underground tornado until they reveal themselves (they’re like monster nostrils that suck in everything in front of them), are good for a moment or two of old-fashioned creature-feature awe, but what, really, do they have to do with anything? “Dune” makes the worms, the dunes, the paramilitary spectacle, and the kid-savior-tests-his-mettle plot immersive — for a while. But then, as the movie begins to run out of tricks, it turns woozy and amorphous. Will Part II really be coming? It will if Part I is successful enough, and that isn’t foregone. It’s hard to build a cliffhanger on shifting sands."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," When Denis Villeneuve signed on to direct a 21st century version of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel Dune, he was no doubt aware of the book’s long and often tortured history in Hollywood. Once thought unfilmable – just ask Jodorowsky – it was finally adapted by David Lynch into a famously off-kilter film in 1984, and then a Sci-Fi Channel miniseries version also got some traction in 2000. But those takes didn’t quite manage to translate the more epic and spiritual qualities of Herbert’s work. Could Villeneuve, who had pulled off the seemingly impossible with his fantastic sequel to Blade Runner, finally do justice to the tale of Paul Atreides? Unfortunately, the answer is… not quite. For all its amazing imagery and A-list stars and very cool interpretations of the nerdier aspects of Herbert’s book, this version of Dune doesn’t fully coalesce. The director, his co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth, and producer Legendary Pictures made the seemingly sound decision to divide the sprawling novel into two separate films, so in fact the onscreen title to this installment is actually Dune, Part One. The result of this split is not just a license to let many of the book’s smaller moments or supporting characters breathe more, but also to perhaps be too devoted to Herbert’s work. Heresy, yells the Frank Herbert fan! But we all know that what works in a novel might not work in movie form, and vice versa, and Villeneuve’s biggest misstep with Dune, Part One is how misshapen and plodding it feels in its second half, as if the movie doesn’t quite know how or where to end… before it just suddenly does. Timothée Chalamet stars as Paul Atreides, scion of the powerful House Atreides in a far-off future where a substance known as the Spice is the most valuable commodity in the known universe. Paul’s father, Duke Leto Atreides (a heavy-with-responsibility Oscar Isaac), is sent by the Emperor to the desert planet Arrakis to take over production of the Spice. And so the whole family packs up and moves house, including the Duke’s military advisors (and Paul’s tutors) Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and what appears to be every soldier and house servant who works for the Atreides. What awaits them on the planet also known as Dune? An uncertain future to be sure, but the Duke has a plan: Harness “desert power.” Meanwhile, Chalamet’s Paul – as dreamy, misunderstood, and tortured as you could want the heartthrob to be here, and I mean that as a compliment – is having prophetic dreams of a mysterious girl, one of Arrakis’s native people known as the Fremen. This is Zendaya’s character Chani, who some viewers may be distressed to learn is barely in this movie beyond said dreams. Again, it says Part One in the title, so be patient. The film opens with Zendaya’s voiceover explaining how beautiful her home planet is, and succinctly summing up the violent history of Arrakis, caught as it is in the middle of bigger galactic concerns due to its natural abundance of the Spice. This sequence is a triumph over the exposition that continuously threatens to bring any adaptation of Dune down, but unfortunately, the filmmakers don’t always succeed on this same front moving forward. Perhaps the tutorial that comes later about stillsuits – the life-saving, water-conserving garb of the Fremen – will be fascinating to the uninitiated, but those who are familiar with the source material may find that these moments gum up the works of Dune, like the sand of Arrakis that plays havoc with the Spice machinery. And yet, Villeneuve frequently impresses with his ability to take tried and true sci-fi concepts and put some new spin on them. Take the Bene Gesserit – sort of space witches with extra-human mental powers, if you will. Paul’s mother, Rebecca Ferguson’s Lady Jessica, is a member of this order, and early on we see her tutoring Paul in the strange ability to mentally coerce others via a modulation of one’s voice. Here, Villeneuve relies on sound design to highlight the weird and offsetting manipulation of Chalamet’s words, but he also shoots the moment as a series of flashing images where time seems to be displaced. It’s off-putting and effective, placing us in the same mindset as the person who the vocal attack is being used upon. The script also benefits from injecting occasional bits of humor into the universe-shaping events of the film, and the casting of charismatic actors like Momoa and Brolin help to drive those humanizing elements home. Both actors’ characters essentially serve as big brother/uncle figures to Paul, teaching him to fight and helping him ease into the notion that he is the heir apparent to this great family. Ferguson’s Jessica, meanwhile, knows that perhaps something even more heady awaits her son on Arrakis. Indeed, this eventually leads to a painful moment of accusation that Paul directs at his mother, and the look on Ferguson’s face tells us… he may not be wrong? In fact, the cast is solid across the board, and full of familiar faces, from Javier Bardem as the leader of the Fremen to Charlotte Rampling as the scary Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother to David Dastmalchian, Stephen McKinley Henderson, and more. And then there are the villains. Stellan Skarsgård is effectively grotesque and sinister as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the bane of House Atreides, while his nephew, Dave Bautista’s “Beast” Rabban, is vicious enough that any memory of Drax will be long gone while watching this film. Director Denis Villeneuve recently told Collider that he could envision his take on Dune being a trilogy -- but not more than that. ""There is Dune's second book, 'The Messiah of Dune,' which could make an extraordinary film,"" he teased. ""I always saw that there could be a trilogy; after that, we'll see. It's years of work; I can't think of going further than that."" And Dune is certainly capable of transporting us to its alien landscapes via its many technical achievements in production design, costumes, photography, sound, visual effects, and more. From the breathtaking vistas and strange space- and aircraft, to the enormous, frightening sandworms that will devour a ship as easily as they will a clutch of bad guys (and sometimes good guys), and right on down to the sparkly glimmer of the very Spice itself as it glitters across the surface of Arrakis, there is no detail spared in immersing us in this fantastical world. Which is to say, there’s so much to love in Dune, but I didn’t come away in love with the movie itself. Villeneuve has proven himself to be a master of the kind of smart and stylish sci-fi that a modern Dune adaptation demands, and the film is a triumph when it comes to its visuals and sound. But there’s a shapelessness to the latter part of the movie that drags it down and distracts from its beauty; it’s a story that ends at Act 2, and it shows. Just as Duke Leto himself would find out, harnessing the power of Dune is no easy task. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is beautiful to behold, a faithful adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel. Or of its first half, that is. And therein lies the problem that the film faces, for in cutting this story into two parts, Villeneuve has front-loaded Dune with a lot of set-up and no obvious way to end things… and so it lingers, and eventually overstays its welcome. This is a technically brilliant, visually amazing movie with a top-notch cast and deep sci-fi concepts. A shame, then, that it feels like a drag in its back half."
"Sep 3, 2021",NEGATIVE," The trouble begins in Dune—which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Friday—just about immediately. In the opening credits of Denis Villeuneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal 1965 sci-fi fantasy novel, which is now a 2022 Oscar winner, we see the title of the film and then an ominous “Part One.” So what we’re seeing is not a complete story—it’s the kick-off to a new franchise of two (or more) movies. Not a second of the sequel has been shot yet, so we will just have to hope that the box office gods (and the streaming ones, as the film will also premiere on HBO Max) are kind enough to this first foray that subsequent installments will be deemed worth it. If not, Dune will live on as a turgid preamble with little payoff. As he often does, Villeneuve has crafted a mighty aesthetic symphony, images looming epically as a Hans Zimmer score keens and brass-braaams around them. Herbert’s novel—which has been adapted by Villeneuve, Jon Spaiths, and Eric Roth—offers plenty of occasion for such maximalist finery. The story journeys to several exotic planets and introduces us to the dynastic pageantry of humanity’s ruling class some 10,000 years from now. Villeneuve is no stranger to this kind of high imagining, or perhaps re-imagining. He applied his signature gloss onto the Blade Runner universe with 2017’s Blade Runner 2049, a gorgeous but frustratingly thin continuation of a narrative well established before him. With Dune, Villeneuve has the chance to right the wrongs of David Lynch’s 1984 misfire (a misfire according to some, anyway) and truly honor Herbert’s text. But Villenueve can’t help but lacquer it all up into something hyper polished and hard to the touch. Even Arrival, his most successful big-budget film, groans under the tremendous onus of his construction. He’s an overloader, and only the keenest and most urgent of scripts can survive beneath that weight. Dune, unfortunately, is not one of those. Maybe the source material, with its unending glossary of terms describing places, peoples, religious traditions, and political systems, is just too dense to hone into something cinematically agile. Villeneuve’s film is somehow plodding and hurried at once, flurries of exposition and table-setting ringing around set-piece monoliths. The general idea is stated plainly enough: a noble family, House Atreides, is enlisted by the galactic emperor to become the new stewards of the fearsome desert planet Arrakis, home to a sort of silt deposit called spice that’s valued across the universe for its use in medicine and starship navigation. This angers the despotic House Harkonnen, who long ruled over Arrakis and its precious resource. There is also, of course, a prophecy about a messiah who will deliver the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen—and perhaps the entirety of humanity—to freedom. Is that special boy the young prince of House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet)? All this palace intrigue and generational history is interesting, playing as a kind of spacebound Game of Thrones. (I know Dune long predates that book and TV series, as well as Star Wars, but I’m sure there is some studio marketing department wish that those parallels will be drawn by contemporary audiences.) What is less compelling is the Chosen One mythology, laid out confusingly to mask the simplicity at its core. Visions and murmured warnings and oracular epiphanies abound, all working to convince us that the hero of the film is, in fact, the hero. Perhaps a surprise is coming in a subsequent Dune film, but at present it all feels like a fait accompli that the handsome, noble prince standing before us is destined to be the thing everyone is so worked up about. That the film is ultimately a long and overwrought prologue—a prelude to action rather than its own autonomous story—renders Villeneuve’s robust theatrics flimsier than they should be. What’s all this ado about something we know is coming but just won’t be shown yet? Chalamet strains to assume the mantle, but he’s swallowed up by the halo hanging around him. Rebecca Ferguson, as Paul’s mother Jessica, who studied under an order of shifty priestess called the Bene Gesserit, fares better, holding firm against the movie’s stylistic onslaught and making an impression. Other talented actors drift in and out of the picture: Oscar Isaac as Paul’s dad, Leto; Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa as military men who help train Paul in combat; Stellan Skarsgård as the monstrous Baron Harkonnen; and Zendaya as a Fremen who appears to Paul in dreams, luring him toward ruin or glory or both. No one has much time to distinguish themselves, all functioning as mere fleshy cogs in Villeneuve’s churning machine. We don’t really learn much about individual characters in the film, making it hard to grasp or care about the stakes of the story. That’s not for lack of trying on Villeneuve’s part, who aims to fill just about every moment of the film with a towering import. At times, his aggressive approach works. There are scenes when the film’s relentless rumble reaches heart and mind, and truly connects. The immensity of the film can probably only be experienced properly in a theatrical setting—making Warner Bros.’ decision to drop the movie on streaming that much more dismaying. But even in the dark, sans phone, a gigantic screen and sound system blaring away at you, Dune slips through your fingers like so much sand. And then it just ends, as a character has the gall to tell Paul (and us) that this is just the beginning. As a general rule, we should embrace grave and complicated blockbuster films like this, as they’re in such short supply in our age of comestible whizbang and synergistic packaging. But Dune lumbers with such aloof, uninviting self-seriousness that it’s hard to love, hard to even celebrate as an assured piece of tentpole authorship. In all its marvel, Dune forgets to do basic things like give us someone or something to root for, or feel for, or think about for longer than the stretch of the film. Some vexing, inscrutable mystery and preening opacity can be fun. But there ought to at least be a big, central Why animating a film. Otherwise, it’s all just a bunch of pretty shots of sand and fire and lavish costumery with no guiding spirit. By the end of Dune (Part One), I was ready to leave the whole thing to the enormous worms who move through Arrakis devouring all the little things that matter to us petty humans. Watching as Villeneuve’s film eats itself up, those beasts started to seem pretty familiar. — Unhappy Little Trees: The Dark Legacy of Bob Ross— The True Story of a Hollywood Partnership Built and Destroyed by Money, Sex, and Celebrity— Ted Lasso’s Roy Kent on Why the Show Isn’t “Warm and Fuzzy”— Caftans, Goyard, and Elvis: Inside The White Lotus’s Costumes— The Chair Is Like an Academic Game of Thrones— The Best Movies and Shows Streaming on Netflix This Month— Rachael Leigh Cook on Reclaiming She’s All That— Watch Kristen Stewart Channel Princess Di in Spencer’s Official Trailer— From the Archive: Jeffrey Epstein and Hollywood’s Omnipresent Publicist— Sign up for the “HWD Daily” newsletter for must-read industry and awards coverage—plus a special weekly edition of “Awards Insider.”"
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," “A great man doesn’t seek to lead; he is called to it,” Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) says somberly to his son Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), in Denis Villeneuve’s dynastic epic space odyssey “Dune.” The Duke speaks to duty, purpose, and destiny, but the words are laced with burden and uncertainty for Paul, seemingly undecided about his future. When Villeneuve (“Sicario,” “Prisoners”) once spoke about making “Dune” as a “’Star Wars’ for adults,” he wasn’t kidding. His solemn, grandly ambitious, and epic film about chosen ones and messiahs is awe-inspiring in scale but not at all entertaining in the traditional sense. It’s an arthouse blockbuster in the vein of his “Blade Runner 2049,” but even less concerned with commercial appeal, which is admirably bold. Brooding and hypnotic, though packed with tension, kinetic danger, and action too, it may not be the fully accessible franchise Warner Bros. might be hoping for, but it’s artistic and deeply captivating nonetheless. Thankfully, “Dune” isn’t particularly hard to follow, but it is very involved, with many characters, sprawling in shape, and difficult to explain (you’ll see). Essentially, it’s an imposing space opera about feudal interstellar empires battling for control of the mélange, aka “the Spice”—a magical and addictive resource that allows people to see the future, travel through space, and is the single most powerful and treasured element in the universe. It’s sci-fi on the surface, but it’s also mystical, a mix of the spiritual, the political, historical, and the cultural. Arguably all things that “Star Wars” features too, but just much more dense, sophisticated, and less child-like. Two houses, noble and ignoble, wrestle for power, the great Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen, one being honorable, one being rather ignominious and malevolent, to put it politely. The spice is harvested on the planet Arrakis, and of course, caught in the middle of it all, is the indigenous human civilization called the Fremen, who have been so oppressed and invaded, they’ve evolved over the years, having learned to survive and thrive on the inhospitable and austere deserts of Arrakis, teeming with perilous and massive sandworms. The spice should be rightly theirs, but they have watched interlopers take over their lands over the centuries, which should echo with anyone who’s ever read anything about MENA and Palestinian history. “Dune” begins in earnest when House Atreides accepts the stewardship of Arrakis, otherwise known as Dune, at the behest of the Emperor. After serving as caretaker of the planet Caladan for 20 years, Leto is politically savvy, fair, compassionate, and feels like the perfect honorable leader, but he tends always to see the best in people, and this leaves him vulnerable to deception (though much of this texture from the books is subtle and lost, the movie only having a few minutes to establish each character). And there’s plenty of duplicity lurking in the shadows of the various religions, cults, and political backchanneling intrigue going on in the Dune cosmos. In short, House Atreides is set up to fail in an intricate trap, adopting a derelict and decrepit system from the former rulers of Arrakis, House Harkonnen (represented by nasty, fat sack pustule played by Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his right hand many played by David Dastmalchian). The scheme, conspired by the Emperor, Harkonnen, and the savage Sardaukar military force, is essentially to force a vote of no confidence when Atreides fails to harvest the spice properly, which the entire universe is dependent on. But really, it’s more just an assault and occupation, as Atreides barely has a moment to start production (much of this predicament, the failure, and political transition to control Arrakis is deeply compressed for time). Before the invasion starts—a brutal, entrancing, and monumental spectacle to experience—that takes House Atreides by surprise, leaving them crippled and helplessly overwhelmed, “Dune” sets up two major subplots. One is the story of the Fremen (represented by Javier Bardem, and later Zendaya), who wants nothing to do with the Atreides clan, even as they try and broker peace. The second is the Bene Gesserit, a critical social, religious, and political force, but essentially witches with telekinetic powers. The latter element involves the concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Duke Leto’s courtesan, and the mother of Paul Atreides (Chalamet). Cutting to the chase, Paul Atreides is half Bene Gesserit, half-human, and possesses some of the powers bestowed to him by his mother, but he has yet to master them, as shown in the merciless, vicious annexation of Arrakis by the axis of space, evil (Harroken, etc.) More importantly, he is rumored to be a potential messiah and keeps seeing inexplicable, prophetic visions of a young Fremen woman who later turns out to be Chani (Zendaya), who he meets in the unmerciful desert once he has escaped the invasion by the skin of his teeth. In watching Villeneuve’s moody, brooding, simmering, and hypnotic“Dune,” it’s easy to see where David Lynch’s 1984 version failed (aside from the filmmaker having the absolutely wrong sensibilities for this kind of thing). Part of the success of this version—also a drawback too—is the early apt decision by Villeneuve and writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth to cleave the book into two movies. This gives the “Dune” time to breathe, meditate in its creepy, expressive, ostentatious worlds, set up its machinations and characters, and, most importantly, build this universe via culture, religion, belief, and political systems. However, it makes for an incomplete story yet unfulfilled. “Dune” definitely ends with an ellipsis, the full story saved for another chapter that will hopefully arrive one day. Meant to be Homeric, a mythic hero’s journey, “Dune” is that too, but has to juggle so much more. It’s essentially a three-pronged film: one of world-building and set-up, one of betrayal, and one hinting at the future destiny that lays before young Atreides. The real meal doesn’t really begin until Part Two, and that’s probably one of the minor disappointments of its inconclusive finale. Aesthetically, “Dune” is pretty damn monumental and enveloping, and for audiences that potentially may find the plot confusing, the film still works on a deeply experiential, visceral level. Composer Hans Zimmer inspires great awe with a booming but atypically Zimmer score, and not one BRAAAM in earshot, thankfully. Greig Fraser’s cinematography is always spectacular, but one has to wonder if the desaturated look the movie features always has to look so drab. To that end, and to bring it back to “Star Wars,” Fraser also shot “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” and much of the visual appearance of “Dune,” for shorthand anyhow, could be described as a less colorful, more sinister, less inviting version of Gareth Edwards’ Jedha city milieu (also modeled after Middle Eastern culture). Accordingly, all the appropriation of MENA culture and very few, if any, MENA representation will be sure to upset some (not even to mention the white savior aspect of Paul’s story). Then again, the Fremen story barely begins in “Dune,” only hinted at and only getting play in the third act."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," In Dune, much is made of dreams. It’s the first word of Denis Villeneuve’s film, spoken in a booming, bone-rattling voiceover before a single production logo has even appeared. It’s prophetic dreams of a blue-eyed girl on the planet Arrakis that drive protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) towards his mysterious future. Villeneuve himself has often named Dune as his dream project. And for science-fiction devotees, especially those who have long-worshipped Frank Herbert’s dense tome and waited decades for it to be brought to the screen in a more successful incarnation than previous filmmakers have managed, make no mistake: Villeneuve’s Dune is the adaptation you always dreamed of. A lot has been written of the complexity of Dune — a 1965 book whose near-impenetrability on the page is legendary, with a story so expansive and mythology so sprawling that even talented filmmakers like Alejandro Jodorowsky (whose version never came to fruition) and David Lynch (who disowned his own 1984 take) stumbled in their attempts to capture it. Notably, many of its images and ideas have instead disseminated into everything from Star Wars to Studio Ghibli’s Nausicaä Of The Valley Of The Wind. Villeneuve’s approach is to split the story in half — Dune is actually, by its own title card’s admission, Dune: Part One. It’s a bold gambit — especially since the implied ‘Part Two’ is yet to shoot, and its existence is seemingly predicated on the financial success of this first instalment — but going by everything achieved here, it’s a narratively vital decision. Across a two-and-a-half-hour runtime, Villeneuve luxuriates in establishing Herbert’s vision of a stark galactic empire in which simmering political tensions threaten to boil over, mystical theologies intersect with powerful institutions and industrial interests, and humanity is humbled by the vast power of nature. Though there’s plenty to establish, Villeneuve — who also co-writes along with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth — makes surprisingly light work of it all. Chiefly, the story concerns House Atreides — one of several dynastic factions co-existing under a grand empire known as the Imperium. Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is tasked by the Emperor to take over the rule of desert planet Arrakis (aka Dune), home of the most valuable substance in the galaxy, Spice. But since the brutal House Harkonnen has successfully overseen the Arrakis operation for 80 years, Duke Leto senses his house’s appointment there is likely a trap. Meanwhile his son Paul is having visions of Fremen girl Chani (Zendaya) — and there are signs he could be a prophesised Chosen One as foretold by the Bene Gesserit, an order of mystic women (of which Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is one). If the Part One approach means Dune tells essentially half of a story, it allows that half all the breathing room it requires. After a dreamy opening reel in which Chani establishes the story’s anti-colonialist themes in voiceover (“Who will our next oppressors be?” she wonders as the Harkonnen armies depart Arrakis), we spend a comfortable amount of time on Caladan, establishing Duke Leto’s sense of duty and suspicions of imminent betrayal; Paul’s anxiety over his doom-laden dreams, his skill as a fighter under the tutelage of the grizzled Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and his camaraderie with sword-swinging warrior Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa); and Lady Jessica’s potentially conflicting responsibilities as Paul’s mother and a member of the Bene Gesserit order. The pacing is perfect — Villeneuve makes you wait just long enough, so when the action moves to Arrakis you’re just as eager to venture into the desert as Paul. When you finally get there, the overriding emotion Dune evokes really kicks in: a near-constant jaw-on-the-floor awe. The sense of scale conjured up is, from moment to moment, frequently astonishing. Cinematographer Greig Fraser — who previously delivered the mind-blowing planet-explosion shots in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story — keeps the camerawork largely static and stately, with lingering wide shots that let you drink in all the detail of the gorgeous sets, and bask in the vistas of Villeneuve’s galactic visions. In one shot, the transport ships bound for Arrakis are of ant-like insignificance against the deep expanse of space. At ground-level, they’re colossal. The visual vastness is matched by a Hans Zimmer score that is, to use a technical term, full-Zimmer —with howling human voices, clattering drums sure to make any cinema seat rattle like a 4DX chair, and inexplicable space-bagpipes. This is blockbuster filmmaking in the Christopher Nolan mould — smart, propulsive, and really big. But more than any one Nolan film in particular, Dune feels most reminiscent of The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. Like Fellowship, it’s merely the opening part of a story, but manages to feel like a masterwork in its own right. Like Fellowship, it establishes a sprawling and complex world that feels both familiar and utterly new with the lightest of touches. And like Fellowship, its biggest set-piece comes just after the midway point — after 90 minutes of setting up dominos, Villeneuve finally lets them clatter into one another in spectacular style, scattering the characters to the winds as the final hour becomes an all-out survival movie. Among the uniformly excellent performances, Timothée Chalamet holds his own in his first blockbuster leading role. In a film this size, there’s every chance he’d get swallowed up by the sandworm-like enormity of everything around him — but even against the colossal spectacle, the magnetic charisma he displayed in smaller indie fare shines through. With Villeneuve’s focus primarily on the turning tides of revolution, the emotional strings don’t tug as strongly on a human level. But the film does spend plenty of time bedding in with the Atreides and their inner circle – Ferguson gives a wrenching performance as Paul faces a bone-crunching test in an early reel, and Momoa and Brolin in particular bring moments of life and lightness to the most typically adventure-story roles of the ensemble. While Dune already feels like an astonishing achievement, there’s no getting around the fact that it’s only half the story – and unlike Fellowship, there’s no guarantee of a Two Towers next year. For now, we have more proof that Denis Villeneuve is a masterful filmmaker, particularly in science-fiction — once again conjuring the hypnotic, glacial heft of Blade Runner 2049 and the truly alien visual qualities of Arrival. But to quote Cloud Atlas (another huge, ambitious sci-fi novel adaptation — one which failed to set the box office alight nearly a decade ago), “a half-finished book is, after all, a half-finished love affair”. To be left dangling without ‘Dune: Part Two’ would be a particular heartbreak. Here’s hoping we won’t only be seeing it in our dreams."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Something I’ve read multiple times is that superhero films — or fantasy films more broadly — are the descendants of the likes of Greek myths or Anglo-Saxon laments about the hero and his quest for victory over a villainous would-be overlord type. Hell, I’ve probably written this myself. It’s true. But it’s an incomplete truth.  Art isn’t what happens in a story — it’s how it happens. Game Of Thrones felt bracing because although it had its moments of high pomp and heroism, it took place in a world where people laughed, and breathed, and shat themselves, and died unfairly, without any tragic redemption.  I have, of course, enjoyed many films and TV shows with quips in, but their absence here is pure tonic, a relief I hadn’t realised I needed. The world-building in Dune has to be taken seriously or the whole thing would fall apart like a house of cards — on the face of it, it’s all a bit daft — and so we need to believe the characters believe. And the actors here all give good, serious performances, but in a sense it isn’t an actor’s film, because they are playing archetypes: chosen one, tragic king, arch villain, handsome rogue and so forth.  On my way back from the screening to write this review, I read a news piece about Dune headlined “Timothee Chalamet Hopes for Sequel”. I was brought up short, almost shocked: this is a such a monumental film, I had completely failed to even contemplate the possibility that it could be an incomplete monument, that it could flop; it feels so completely sure of itself and so legitimately stunning, that it’s a huge shame that the next chapter is in fact subject to the whims of the marketplace. I’m right there with you, Timmy — surely, there has to be more."
"Sep 3, 2021",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is simultaneously the movie that I was hoping it would be, and the movie I was dreading. Frank Herbert’s book is beloved because of its impressive attention to detail, and this incarnation, unlike any before it, has the patience and resources to bring the source material into spectacular, jaw-dropping reality. The cast is tremendous, the themes are phenomenally captured, and every shot is transportive to such a level that you become hypnotized. It’s everything that an adaptation of the first half of Dune should be – but therein lies the problem: being based on only a fraction of the book, it does wind up feeling incomplete, and the desire to immediately watch Part 2 is arguably too powerful. It’s an exceptional and special big screen experience, and does an incredible job laying the foundation for what is an expansive, unique universe, but it also can’t help but feel like the serving of a decadent and delicious appetizer that comes out while the epic entrée to come is still braising in the kitchen. Made by an array of filmmakers who clearly have a deep passion for the original novel, Dune takes audiences across the stars in the year 10191 to Caladan – the lush home planet of House Atreides. Led by the bold and righteous Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), the eponymous family and those who follow them swear fealty to the galactic emperor, but at the same time there is a recognition that the influence and strength of the clan is growing to rival that of those they serve. Fearing what could result from this power shift, the emperor orchestrates political machinations to prevent it – secretly collaborating with the brutal, fascistic House Harkonnen, led by the physically massive and sadistic Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), and the religious order called the Bene Geserit, led by the stoic and ruthless Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). A trap is set that begins with House Atreides being given control of Arrakis, a desert planet that is the only source of the universe’s most valuable commodity: melange, also known as spice. As seen through the eyes of Duke Leto’s son, Paul (Timothee Chalamet), and Leto’s concubine/Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), House Atreides moves to the new world aware of the conspiracy-driven setup, and with intentions to turn the tables. While the Harkonnens spent years subjugating and annihilating the indigenous population of Arrakis, known as the Fremen, it is the intention of the Atreides clan to form an alliance with them and together create a union that nobody in the universe can challenge. The complexity of the plot and the expansiveness of the world are the reasons Dune has been seen for decades as a book impossible to properly adapt, but Denis Villeneuve and his collaborators have cracked the code with their approach and have sculpted an epic that is stunningly faithful in its depiction of events that transpire in the book and in its greater spirit. It’s not a facsimile – as there are scenes shifted around, minor details changed, and there are a few key characters seemingly put aside in anticipation of Part 2 – but the movie is otherwise extraordinary in its ability to directly translate the source material across mediums without compromise. One of the great challenges in the adaptation process surely had to be the war between scope and pace, as showcasing the scale of the universe and its intricacies can be deadly to the movement of the story, but Denis Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth keep it constantly flowing without any sacrifices. The layering of characters and plot unfurl in harmony as you are simultaneously drawn in by the political intrigue and become invested in the heroes. As far as the latter goes, it also certainly helps that Dune’s ensemble is both loaded with extreme talent, and is perfectly put together, with everyone flawlessly gets at the core of who they are playing. Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac are the triumvirate that lead the cast, and they are all phenomenal – with Chalamet’s Paul chastened by the weight of his greater destiny; Ferguson’s Lady Jessica emotionally torn in her loyalties; and Isaac’s Duke Leto impressive in his nobility. Truly there is no weak link among the performers, however, as Jason Momoa is impressively subtle and powerful as the warrior Duncan Idaho; Stellan Skarsgard’s Baron Harkonnen is appropriately grotesque and horrifying; and both Javier Bardem and Zendaya deliver great turns as the hardened and determined Stilgar and Chani, two of the key Fremen characters. Intricate as the plot of Dune is, and as many characters as there are, it’s made easy to fall into the world simply because of its magnificence. This is in no way surprising given what we’ve previously seen from Denis Villeneuve’s directorial vision, but that doesn't undermine its awesome success. It’s not an overly complicated futuristic universe, as the sci-fi aesthetic is made to be grounded and familiar (it’s a society that has moved past computers), but all the same you feel like you’re looking into a window across space and time, and it’s unendingly thrilling. The cinematography, the production design, and the genius visual effects blend in such a way that the line between fiction and reality fades from your mind, and it’s breathtaking. It’s pure cinema, as every department on the film has delivered work that sweeps the audience away. Visually, no special element of the source material is left unexplored, from the beautifully designed stillsuits (clothing made to recycle the body’s excretion of water on Arrakis), to the dragonfly-like helicopters known as ornithopters, to the god-like sandworms that live below the surface of the desert planet. Dune is also an auditory journey, not only featuring enveloping sound editing, but one of the best scores Hans Zimmer has ever composed. Remarkable as the adaptation is, Dune is on a track to be at the center of a debate that has been happening about Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back for decades: while many rightfully hail the 1980 film as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time, it also receives valid criticism for not independently featuring its own complete narrative. Thrilling, stunning and ambitious as Denis Villeneuve’s film is, it’s also defined by being a Part 1, and just by its nature it doesn’t provide conclusions for its biggest character arcs and themes. It’s certainly an experience unto itself, and one that must not be missed, but it’s also undeniable that it will require reassessment when the rest of the director’s vision is revealed – and if there is a movie god, we’ll see that happen sooner rather than later. Until that time comes, Dune exists independently as a cinematic accomplishment all the same, and one to be marveled at. Denis Villeneuve’s movie is the film interpretation that fans have been waiting to see for decades, and one that should be experienced on the biggest screens possible the most times possible – both to properly experience it the way it is meant to be experienced, and to ensure that the epic story gets to continue.
