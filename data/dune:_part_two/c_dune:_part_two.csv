"Apr 20, 2024",POSITIVE," Anyone with hankering for BIG WORM ACTION will get tons of it in Dune: Part Two (now streaming on VOD services like Amazon Prime Video), which delivers plenty of thrills where 2021’s Dune mostly gave us a bit too much of Timothee Chalamet looking sleepy. My beef with the first film is that it’s all setup and not much else, a chilly space opera set on a very hot desert planet. But director Denis Villeneuve’s eye for impressively sweeping, artful visuals is very much in motion the second time around, as the battle for all the spice on Arrakis heats up, and the temperature matches the tone for a rousing epic. The Gist: KETCHUP TIME: As you may recall at the end of the first Dune, the evil Harkonnen obliterated the Atreides’ spice-mining stronghold on Arrakis. They didn’t declare war or anything – just a craven sneak attack that sent our protag Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his pregnant mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) fleeing to the Fremen after everyone else was killed. If all these names and places seem like an impenetrable wall o’ sci-fi narrative, well, you should’ve paid closer attention to the onslaught of goofy proper nouns in the first movie. I’ll help a little: Everyone wants spice, because it’s the key to power and riches in the galaxy; you need big machines to sift it from the sand on Arrakis, but you have to be quick lest the gigantic sandworms rumble along and swallow you whole.  The Fremen are desert folk who live in underground strongholds on Arrakis. The Harkonnen are Hairless Nazis led by Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), a putrid blubberlump that looks half-human, half-Jabba the Hutt. Lady Jessica is a member of the religious order Bene Gesserit, who believe that Paul, who has visions of the future – or maybe they’re just dreams – is thee Chosen One. The Fremen take in Paul and Lady Jessica, and they’re divided between believing he’s their savior and being suspicious of his motives. Stilgar (Javier Bardem), one of the Fremen leaders, really glugs down the fundamentalist Kool-Aid, and interprets Paul’s every twitch and scratch to be a sign that he’s the religious It Boy around here. Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) is skeptical, but she ignores the red flags because, one look into Paul’s sad doe eyes, and she can’t help but melt down to a hormone puddle.  OK, I think we’re mostly caught up now. Lady Jessica is compelled via death threat to become the new Reverend Mother of the Fremen Bene Gesserit sect, which leaves the lovely Becky Fergs sullied with face tattoos. Paul convinces the Fremen that he’s not here to take over – he just wants to fight the Harkonnen alongside them. He learns their customs and, alongside Chani – with whom he’s now sharing a tent, hubba hubba – leads ambushes that cripple the Harkonnens’ spice mining operation, much to the frustration of the Baron’s idiot nephew, Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista). Note to fascist dictators: if you chilled on the nepotism for once, you might actually accomplish your vile plans.  I haven’t even gotten to the new characters yet. Because Rabban is licking the shit out of the moron Blarney Stone, the Baron replaces him with his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), an ultrapsycho who’s killed more people than you’ve eaten slices of pizza. We also meet Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken exclamation point!), who we learn ordered the Harkonnen to slaughter the Atreides; his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), isn’t much more than a third-act plot cog at this point, but she dons some pretty wild headwear. We also see the return of Paul’s old mentor, the warrior Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), notable because he Knows Where The Nukes Are. And Bene Gesserit leader Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) remains an amoral influencer and power broker, hissing from behind her ridiculous towering veil. So, is your money on Paul being the savior, or just a fraud? NO SPICY SPOILERS. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Modern mega-blockbusters don’t get ambitious like Villeneuve’s Dune very often – the easy comparison is Mad Max: Fury Road, and now you’ll be compelled to ponder whether you’re a car person or a worm person. (That’s not a tough choice in this instance; car person it is!) Performance Worth Watching: Between Dune, Mission: Impossible and her highly memorable villain role in Doctor Sleep, Becky Fergs may be the new Queen of the Elevated Genre Flick. You have to appreciate her intensity. Same for Butler, who bears down and brings some evil-ass charisma to the deliciously despicable Feyd-Rautha. Sex and Skin: Nothing beyond a brief postcoital snuggle for Paul and Chani – unless you interpret all the worm-riding and put-your-hand-in-the-box scenes as visual innuendo.  Our Take: Villeneuve gives us much more to appreciate in his second Dune missive: Rousing action sequences ranging from worm-riding (which is part water-skiing, part rodeo) to tense knife fights and large-scale battles, and a thorough seat-soaker of a finale which combines all of the above. The screenplay is a sturdy distillation of Frank Herbert’s writing down to something comprehensible – no small task – that doesn’t make us feel like we’re lugging around a load of momentum-crushing exposition. The political power struggles are complex without being stultifying, and the story of Paul, a man who just might believe his own bullshit, is compelling in its ethical ambiguity. And yet, Dune: Part Two doesn’t push itself to the greatness we might expect from Villeneuve. The film lands somewhere between the razor-sharp Blade Runner 2049 – thus far the director’s masterpiece – and the resonant emotion he cultivated in Arrival. He draws stronger, more memorable performances from Chalamet and Zendaya this time around, but their love story falls well behind the machinations of the plot and its relatively potent assertions about the evils of colonialism and religious fundamentalism. Villeneuve compels us to invest our intellect in the subtext and rouses us to pump our fists in response to violent conflict, but the emotional heart of the story beats only in the distance, drowned out by spectacle. Of course, we’re absolutely here and ready for that spectacle, and the film delivers, its sonorous thematic depth heightening the stakes of the conflict. And considering the fraught history of Dune’s path from book to screen, very goodness is an altogether realistic expectation that Villeneuve meets.  Our Call: Villeneuve can take a somewhat improbable W for a difficult adaptation. Dune: Part Two makes the first film better in retrospect, and the eventual third one, Dune: Messiah, absolutely welcome. STREAM IT."
"Apr 19, 2024",POSITIVE,From self-parody to epic&#44; &quot;Dune&#44; part two&quot;&#44; by Denis Villeneuve&#44; contains several possible versions of itself&#44; but none truly great&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93; 
"Apr 16, 2024",POSITIVE," There are a lot of movies and television out right now in the ether that you can choose from, but sometimes, it’s just so hard to pick which ones are worth your time. Luckily, we’ve watched a lot of movies (and exactly one television show) lately and have picked out five films (and that show) that you can check out right now that are absolutely worth spending time with as allergy season establishes iand being indoors might be a nice way to avoid the pollen.  Let’s check out five of these films (and one show), which range from the biggest film of the year so far to a television adaptation of a huge video game.  Denis Villeneuve knew he had to go as big and bold as possible to widen the spectacle and stakes of his adaptation for the second part, but he someone managed to both outdo himself and deliver one of the definitive tentpole experiences of the decade so far with Dune: Part Two. It’s a vital experience in a theater and a rigorous moral maze for the mind, one that interrogates power and freedom in the vacuum of the messiah complex. As exhausting as the overall superhero cinematic landscape has gotten lately, there isn’t enough hyperbole in Gotham City to support how refreshing and exciting it is to get a film like The People’s Joker in the world. First-time filmmaker Vera Drew crafts an audacious, empathetic lightning bolt of  trans empowerment, of freeing yourself from your internal traumas and societal expectations to find peace in self-actualization and provoke gleeful disruption to the status quo. Her film equal parts Joel Schumacher, John Waters and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Drew’s debut establishes her as a genuine force in independent cinema with a film that manages to outdo most of the superhero tentpole projects of the 2020s (and, let’s be honest, well before).  It’s directly playing on the Todd Phillips’ 2019 mega-blockbuster Joker, scanning through decades of Batman mythology and cleverly utilizing fair use and parody to deliver some inspired twists and revisionist takes on various characters in the Caped Crusader universe. As much as Schumacher’s 1990s Batman films remain polarizing, the most endearing parts of them will always be the love and care, the willingness to bring forth singular vision that embraced the moody and the absurd. If anything, Drew honors that absolutely essential approach to big-stage filmmaking by fully embracing the Super Deluxe aesthetic as a proper vehicle of reverence for Schumacher’s gothic grandeur. Even though we don’t get a Seal needle drop, Nick Lutsko more than makes up for it.  In the end, this is just one of the better movies we’ve gotten in a while, one that’s just so wholly original with well-trodden intellectual property to the point where there has to be some sort of award for casting Tim and Eric legend David Liebe Hart in his first major movie role as Ra’s al Ghul (which he crushes). The People’s Joker is a jolt to the senses and a balm in the genre. Seek it out ASAP.  This latest bout of Panda-monium feels directly akin to the third film in the franchise, a perfectly enjoyable (if probably inessential) romp with Jack Black voicing a kung fu-fighting panda. It might lack the full emotional sophistication of the first two films, but it’s still rowdy and brisk enough to keep everyone entertained. Sometimes, that’s all you need in a fourth installment about animals who partake in martial arts. Bonus points for that Tenacious D cover of “…Baby One More Time,” which makes the film worth its salt just for bringing Black singing Britney Spears into the world.  An engrossing look at how the BBC landed and executed that disastrous 2019 Prince Andrew interview about his sordid connections to Jeffrey Epstein, Scoop reminds you of those HBO dramatic adaptations of major moments in global history. They never reach past being stately reenactments, but they do paint fascinating portraits of the movers and shakers that shape the headlines from both sides. It’s the standard that made-for-television movies should strive for.  Scoop follows in that very respectable tradition, a rare example of a movie perfectly suited for your living room in its ambition and reach. The whole cast is very understanding of their roles, but Rufus Sewell is particularly impressive as Andrew, an uncomfortable man caught between the arrested development of his royal status, the autocratic, slight charisma of his upbringing and the real danger lurking behind his unassuming gaze.  Ricky Stanicky plays exactly like you’d expect a comedy premise ripped from 2002 and planted in 2024 would go. Genre staple Peter Farrelly’s fast ball isn’t quite as sharp for straight-up comedy directing as it was during the days of There’s Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber, but he still understands how to make things funny. Pitting a bunch of man-children against a disaster of their own making feels routine for a Farrelly movie, but this faked friend fiasco gets a real shot of adrenaline by the unstoppable force that is John Cena being totally committed to the silly and ridiculous. Cena is a heat-seeking missile in a movie like this, elevating the material like LeBron James joining a D-II basketball team. Without Cena, this film probably runs too long and comes up too short. With him, you almost wanted a nearly two-hour comedy to be longer.  Joining The Last of Us as one of the first really good major video game adaptation in either film or television, Fallout cashes in one of the best bets in modern entertainment. If you cast Walton Goggins in anything even remotely close to having Western vibes, it’s going to hit. Goggins thrives in what may be the biggest role of his career so far, one that thrusts him to the front of an apocalyptic wasteland that plays like Sergio Leone tried to make a Troma Western with nuclear waste and art deco vibes.  Somehow giving the video game its due time in the sun and still telling a compelling story about maintaining your morals in a massive mess fueled by apathetic capitalism and human folly. It’s fascinating counterprogramming to Alex Garland’s Civil War, a much funnier, more delightfully gory romp through the fallout that might get occasionally bogged down by its rampant plotting but still strikes with the same unique thrills and pure enjoyment that typically accompanies any project where Goggins sports a Southern accent and a cowboy hat. He’s one of the best actors working, and his gunslinging Ghoul is one of the most magnetic television characters in a good bit. "
"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE," Making a big studio film is always a risk, and intentionally splitting the central narrative across two or more movies amplifies that risk in every possible way. Sometimes it pays off as with the Star Wars franchise’s nearly half-century run, and sometimes it shits the bed — studios spent $400 million making three Divergent films only to cancel the fourth one leaving the whole series without an ending. Dune hit theaters and HBO Max in 2021 with the sequel’s production dependent on its success, and happily, that success came both on the big screen and small. Nearly three years later, that sequel has arrived, and Dune: Part Two is a magnificent follow-up that blows open the action, themes, and relationships of the first in fantastically thrilling ways. Dune ends with the annihilation of the House Atreides empire leaving only Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), alive. The pair are taken in by cautious members of the Fremen as Paul proclaims his intentions to help the people secure freedom from oppression, and the new film picks up mere hours later. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes Paul to be the much prophesied messiah come to save the Fremen people, others suspect he may be a spy, and desert warrior (and frequent guest in Paul’s dreams) Chani (Zendaya) finds her own convictions about the whole thing conflicting with intense romantic feelings. Meanwhile [space wipe!], elsewhere in the universe, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is growing tired of losing very profitable spice harvests to Fremen raids on Arrakis. He dispatches his sadistic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to squash the rebellion and kill the mysterious Muad’Dib (it’s Paul!) leading the charge. Seems like a simple enough clash between good and evil, but what if Paul’s own visions of a Holy War — with him at the helm — takes priority? There’s a lot going on in Dune: Part Two, far more than a review’s plot synopsis can handle, and all of it sings with drama, tension, thrills, and incredibly rich character beats. Director Denis Villeneuve shows once again that science fiction is his home as he builds on the first film’s setup to deliver a true epic. Enormous set-pieces, visually stunning effects, costume design as eclectic as it is mad, and exciting action share the screen with charisma, torrents of emotion (courtesy of a terrific Zendaya), and a shifting darkness worthy of an Empire Strikes Back comparison. Zendaya’s Chani was present in the first film, but she appeared mostly as a silent vision before finally arriving late in the third act, but she’s every bit the heart and soul of Dune: Part Two. You immediately buy into the fierceness with which she fights and stands for her people, and while there’s the tease of YA romance early on she quickly finds her footing as an independent voice leery of Paul’s status as savior to the Fremen. Her love is tangible, but it’s at odds with legitimate concern leading to an emotionally torn performance. Chalamet shines too and hasn’t felt this all-in and tangible since Call Me By Your Name (2017), and Ferguson doubles down as a human monster prone to twisted, heinous, and devious moves in the shadows. Other returning performers including Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, and Bardem all do good work, but newcomers quickly make their mark. Christopher Walken plays the emperor of the known universe, Florence Pugh is his daughter, and Léa Seydoux joins Lady Jessica as another member of the secretive and powerful Bene Gesserit. It’s Butler who steals his every scene, though, as a brutally intense Harkonnen with his own cruel plans for the future. While the bulk of the film’s hefty (but never really felt) running time unfolds on the golden, red sands of Arrakis, Villeneuve wisely shifts our attention elsewhere at times. The script, co-written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, uses that time to introduce new characters and story threads while cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette take the opportunity to cut loose on the visual front. Scenes on the Harkonnen home planet feel almost monochrome in the starkness and their milky, alien-like skin, and it works to maximize the oppressive nature of their rule. It’s tempting to read some connection to today’s very specific, real world conflicts into the film’s depiction of the Fremen and their oppressors, but that would be a mistake. The tragedy and oppression have very real counterparts, but the same could be said of the 80s when David Lynch’s adaptation was released, of the 60s when Herbert’s novels first hit shelves, and nearly any other time in human history. It’s just what we do as a species, every time, all the time, and Herbert’s fiction just added sand worms. All fictions borrow liberally from reality, and to get hung up on correlation is to derail the experience that is Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two. The film can be enjoyed merely as a big, surface-level thrill ride delivering memorable sequences like Paul’s first attempts at riding a giant sand worm and characters worth rooting for or despising. The textures and themes are there, though, for viewers who like their blockbuster entertainment woven through dense world-building, critical commentaries on theocracies, colonization, and the ease with which people succumb to religious delusion. Come for the spectacle, stay for the heart and heroism, the delicious villainy, and the emotionally epic finale. No matter your tastes, Dune: Part Two has you covered."
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE," Full disclosure: I am a Dune neophyte. However, I resolved before diving into Denis Villeneuve’s newest release, Dune: Part Two, to finally remedy that. This week, I’ve been basking in Dune through all its cinematic forms. 1984, 2021… there’s so much to see and even more to try and understand. Dune: Part Two hits theaters this week, facing massive expectations. Critics are calling it one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. Does the film live up to the cosmic hype? Or are there “spicy” takes in its future?  Dune: Part Two jumps back into the continuing story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he lands on Arrakis. He resolves to settle in with the local population, rain vengeance down on those who wronged his family… and then there’s that whole thing about being the “Chosen One.” The film features a super-sized, all-star cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Dave Bautista. Denis Villeneuve directs Dune: Part Two from a script he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts. The film comes from Frank Herbert‘s novel.  After what can only be described as a spicy Dune week, kids, yours truly was prepared to come in with some skepticism. How can anything live up to the personality and Lynchian wackiness of Dune 1984? Well, it turns out…. Denis Villeneuve can.  Sometimes, we have to admit when we’re wrong. The proverbial hat must be eaten. The hype is, in fact, real, and at this point, Denis Villeneuve is just showing off. This film is a giant, Hans Zimmer-scored cinematic work of art. The creative team does not put a foot wrong in telling this super-sized and ambitious story. And even more impressive, they not only push but also shove the creative standard forward. Few franchises show the flawless visual mastery on display here. Villeneuve depicts a world that feels real. The graphics and the effects never falter. The characters move freely through the climate, never limited by technology. This world is vivid, beautiful and fully realized in a way we don’t often see.  Meanwhile, the movie pulls together a packed cast of not only seasoned veterans but also some of the industry’s best young talent. There isn’t a bad performance in the bunch. Of course, we’d be shirking our responsibilities if we didn’t give special mention to Timothée Chalamet as Paul. The young actor has been lighting up the screen since his mainstream debut in 2017’s Call Me By Your Name. This time out, however, he’s broken fully from the juvenile roles that have previously been his bread and butter. Chalamet is fully immersed in Paul’s dynamic and complicated intricacies. There’s a heartbreaking emotion here and a power and authority he hasn’t often worked with in previous roles. At the same time, actor and director are fully united in the exploration of Paul’s ambiguity. This is seen most strikingly in the third act. One particular wordless scene shows this in terrifying clarity as Chalamet not only dominates the frame but shows everything he can do with a single look. So much is said without leaning on a single line of dialogue. This silent power is, in truth, a commonality in Dune: Part Two. As a filmmaker, Villeneuve is very much a practitioner of “show, don’t tell.” This script is scant and leans heavily into these vivid worlds or equally striking performances to convey its message. In the wrong hands, this dense, quiet beast of a movie could prove an insurmountable hurdle. The film is pushing two hours and 40 minutes, after all. Yet, while this movie can’t be called “a breeze,” it never feels long, and it never drags. Dune: Part Two is all-consuming.  This is one of those works where seeing this on as big a screen as possible is necessary. Dune: Part Two loudly proclaims this in its marketing. Unfortunately, they’re right. This is a movie made for an IMAX screen. It’s a big, brash IMAX film. When you factor in the Hans Zimmer score? Kids, I could feel my bones vibrating. That’s power.  When all is said and done, this can only be described as an unapologetic rave. This Dune neophyte came into Dune: Part Two and was thrown for a loop in the best possible way. Director Denis Villeneuve jumps into what could easily be a by-the-books franchise sequel and creates a cinematic feast for the senses. Dune fans, sci-fi fans and cinephiles alike should certainly have this one on their lists.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History. I spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms, as well as covering film and television."

Beyond its breathtaking battles and galactic machinations, all soundtracked by a Hans Zimmer score in which the German composer seems to have set all the nobs turned to ‘loudest possible’, what’s most impressive about this seriously-impressive blockbuster sequel takes place beneath the surface. And it’s not the colossal sandworms. No, it’s the subtle character shifts that make Dune: Part Two cerebral as well as cacophonous. The plates are always moving in Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novels: today’s heroes are tomorrow’s pile of corpses. Denis Villeneuve, a writer-director who’s been keen to get his teeth into the tough stuff since his early work like Polytechnique (2009) and Incendies (2010), gets all this. And his screenplay, again co-written with Prometheus’s Jon Spaihts, gives us a hero’s journey with real devil in it. As a sequel, it works for the same reasons that make The Empire Strikes Back so many people’s favourite Star Wars film: there’s a darkness, a bleakness, that makes the fist-pumping moments feel all-the-more earned. There’s a sense, too, that the good guys may not win out. If they’re even good.  It opens with just that stark vision of piled corpses. The vanquished Atreides clan lies smoldering on the inhospitable landscape of Arrakis, while the treacherous Harkonnen, spearheaded by Dave Bautista’s thuggish ‘Beast’, set about harvesting the place for its spice reserves. Only Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides and his mystical Bene Gesserit mum, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, a standout), have escaped the carnage and begun the dangerous business of assimilating with the desert Freman people. On the checklist: guerilla warfare, sandworm wrangling, and something worryingly referred to as ‘holy poison’. Villeneuve’s films can be self-serious, but Javier Bardem punctures the solemnity as Freman leader Stilgar, increasingly Dune’s twinkly answer to Anthony Quinn in Lawrence of Arabia (a key text for the Canadian’s vision – right down to their shared Wadi Rum locations).  The burgeoning romance between Paul and Zendaya’s Freman warrior Chani goes a bit Nicholas Sparks in a mid-movie lull – ‘he was a boy from the other world, she was a girl from the wrong side of the dune’, etc – but those doe-eyed scenes pay off in a final act that upends expectations and gives Zendaya a chance to cut loose.  The Harkonnen foes they engage in thrilling spice harvester ambushes are an even more vicious, visceral presence than in the first film. Stellan Skarsgård’s bloated Baron Harkokken oversees the attempted extermination of the Freman with a ruthlessness that makes his first name, Vladimir, all the more apt. They speak in the language of ethnic cleansing – the Freman are referred to as ‘rats’ – and unleash a new superbad in the Baron’s psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha. Played by Elvis star Austin Butler with the blackened palate of a mamba and sharpened teeth, he’s an unearthly and bloodthirsty creation – a memorable sci-fi baddie. With cinematographer Greig Fraser, Villeneuve captures his violent initiation in desatured monochrome, a stark black and white aesthetic in a movie full of grey areas. Crucially, for all their parallels, Paul and Feyd-Rautha aren’t just two sides of the same coin. Paul’s quest for the soul of the Freman takes Dune: Part Two into some areas that may feel uncomfortably resonant in 2024 – even with all the trippy evangelical mysticism and peyote-like wig-outs. Messianic complexes, populism, violent jihad and ethnic cleansing aren’t the building blocks of your average Hollywood blockbuster. Then again, Villeneuve doesn’t make those.In cinemas worldwide Mar 1.

"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The sci-fi epic Dune: Part Two is rich in multilayered world-building. While its dense story might leave some cold, this is a movie meant for big-screen grandeur, from the detailed costumes to the cinematography, special effects, and score. Set on a desert planet where a hallucinogenic spice sets warring factions against each other, Dune: Part Two is a sight to behold, especially in IMAX. Spice sparkles in the air above waves of sand dunes. Warriors face off in a black-and-white arena while inkblot “fireworks” dot the sky. A domed spaceship lays waste to a sacred tomb in a thunderous volley. Flames spill across a mirrored palace, and a desert people thump a rhythm into the ground, summoning giant sandworms for transportation and battle. Yet for all the filmmaking craft onscreen, your mileage with the story may vary. Fans of Frank Herbert’s Dune novels, first published in 1965, no doubt will enjoy it. Others might have trouble keeping track of who’s against whom or connecting emotionally with the narrative. Those who haven’t seen 2021’s Dune or read the books will find Dune: Part Two much like jumping into the middle seasons of Game of Thrones. That said, what returning director Denis Villeneuve and his team bring to the table is impressive. The 2021 film picked up six Oscars: sound, visual effects, production design, film editing, cinematography, and original score. Here, that artistry again is striking, with Hans Zimmer’s percussive score, Patrice Vermette’s production design, and Jacqueline West’s intricate costumes particular standouts. The script by Villeneuve and returning co-writer Jon Spaihts picks up largely where the 2021 film left off—and ends on an ambivalent note, even after two hours and 46 minutes. Thankfully, while the earlier film handled a lot of table setting, this one dives right into the action, unfurling at a brisk pace. After the slaughter of his father and most of their supporters in the previous film, Paul (Timothée Chalamet, Wonka) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Silo), have become embedded with the Fremen, the desert people of the planet Arrakis. Arrakis is the source of Spice, which the Harkonnen family (led on the ground by Dave Bautista, The Boy and the Heron) now mines, having usurped Paul’s late father as governor. “Power over Spice is power over all,” a voice intones before the film even begins, which is about as much backstory as Dune: Part Two allows. The Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem, The Little Mermaid), distrust outsiders and want the Harkonnens gone. They’ve taken in Paul and Jessica because Paul exhibits signs of being the prophesied leader for whom they’ve waited centuries—a position that Paul initially finds uncomfortable. Much of the dramatic tension comes from Paul wanting to avenge his father’s death but being reluctant to take on the “chosen one” mantle. Chalamet plays Paul with a believable sincerity, happy to fight alongside the Fremen and telling Jessica, “They deserve to be led by one of their own. … It’s not a prophecy. It’s a story you keep telling.” As Jessica, Ferguson is formidable, her clipped tone and intense bearing more intimidating than the tattoos that adorn her face once she becomes the Fremen’s Reverend Mother, or religious leader. As other women in her religious order, the Bene Gesserit, plot to create another heir, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh, Oppenheimer) discuss how to quash the Fremen uprising. Meanwhile, the pregnant Jessica speaks with her developing fetus who, in an otherworldly touch, responds in voiceover. Paul’s initial earnestness and scrappiness as a guerilla fighter against the Harkonnens wins him the admiration of the Fremen and the love of Chani (Zendaya, Euphoria). The two create a playful spark in early scenes, such as when Chani coaches Paul how to walk across the sand without causing tremors that summon sandworms. He contradicts her based on what he’s read, then realizes he’s mansplaining to a native and apologizes. The tug-of-war over whether he’ll embrace his fate and just what that might be gives Dune: Part Two substance, even if Paul’s decision ultimately feels abrupt. Among the other players in the all-star cast, Austin Butler (Elvis) is all forehead and no eyebrows as the sociopathic Feyd-Rautha, a Harkonnen set up as a foil for Paul. Bardem earns several laughs with his sly delivery, such as when Stilgar notes that Paul’s humility is exactly what the foretold prophet would have. The Fremen, though coded as Middle Eastern and North African, still have few MENA actors in prominent roles, although Souheila Yacoub (Making Of) is a welcome and feisty addition as Chani’s friend Shishakli. Valerie Kalfrin is an award-winning crime journalist turned freelance film writer whose work appears at RogerEbert.com, In Their Own League, Script, The Hollywood Reporter, and other outlets. Also a screenwriter and script consultant, she’s passionate about challenging stereotypes about gender and disability. Let’s tell better stories and tell stories better."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Fritz Lang, George Lucas, Ridley Scott; the lineage of great sci-fi directors is extensive, but Dune: Part Two serves as an incredibly strong case to make the claim that Villeneuve is the greatest of all time. Maximalist in every conceivable way, the Canadian’s latest offering is an absolute masterclass not only in space operas, but also science fiction filmmaking itself. 2021’s Dune: Part One set a rather high bar for itself, but Part Two sent it into the stratosphere, far above Arrakis. Immediately picking up from the events of its predecessor, Part Two has Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the ranks of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), members of the Fremen, desert-dwelling Arrakis natives. Survivors of the devastating attack upon House Atreides by the brutish Harkonnens, Paul and Jessica are now exiles, largely believed to be dead. Having overcome a Harkonnen attack en route to the Fremen settlement of Sietch Tabr, mother and son are met with a mixture of suspicion and welcoming; some believe them to be spies, and others believe they are the fulfilment of a prophecy to free Arrakis and to start a holy war. Their individual paths become clear: Paul is to embrace the Fremen ways and lead them, and Jessica is to succeed the Fremen’s dying Reverend Mother. It’s here that the (particularly Islamic) influence of prophetic religion upon Herbert’s writing begins to take centre stage, though is still partially diluted from its source material. Stilgar, a native of the fundamentalist South, rapidly becomes staunch in his belief that Paul is the Lisan al Gaib, the messianic figure as prophesied to his people. Representing the more sceptical Fremen is Chani, a native of the North, who joins others in not believing the prophecy. With Jessica having consumed the Water of Life, she has inherited not only the mantle of Reverend Mother, but also the memories of all her predecessors – as she points out to Paul, this traumatic ascension includes inheriting all of their tears, pain, and suffering. Undoubtedly anticipating the discourse that has since grown concerning cultural appropriation, Villeneuve delicately but directly tackles this through Paul and Jessica’s self-insertion into Fremen culture. Jessica’s manipulation of the fundamentalists through the implanted prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib is as skilful as it is sinister, as is Paul’s militant ascent. The Bene Gesserit’s presentation as a more outwardly nefarious entity –“we don’t hope, we plan”– provides genuine chills, particularly helped along by Charlotte Rampling’s marvellous performance as the stony-faced Reverend Mother Mohiam. The display of religious fanaticism is critiqued in such a way that it isn’t parodied for the sake of belittlement, but rather approached as a product of external exploitation. Totally unforgettable are the performances of Austin Butler and Stellan Skarsgård, their chemistry creating an utterly repulsive combination that is as sickening as it is menacing. Though he has relatively little screenplay, Butler elevates the movie to a new level, his presence as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha shockingly enchanting, dominating every scene in which he appears. It seems uncontroversial to say that Butler’s Feyd-Rautha is one of the greatest villains in recent memory. With recent critical failures from the MCU having cost upwards of $250 million whilst feeling like they cost a fraction of that (a result not of untalented VFX artists, but of unsustainable and punishing working conditions and turnarounds), it makes Dune: Part Two’s budget of $190 million all the more remarkable. In every sense of the phrase, Dune: Part Two is a visual marvel and a testament to it being a true labour of love by all who worked on it. Shot entirely in IMAX, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. The seemingly endless Jordanian desert truly brings Arrakis to life, the sweeping sands looking positively vibrant and magically never appearing monochromatic. With Oscar-winning cinematographer powerhouse Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty, The Batman, The Creator) by his side, Villeneuve –a deeply visual filmmaker in all respects– has managed to create one of the most gorgeous films of the science fiction canon itself. With few novels having gained such a devoted fanbase or having sold nearly as many copies as Herbert’s 1965 original, nitpicky comparisons to the source material have always been inevitable, as was the case with Part One. And as testament to the sheer quality of Part Two, few complaints have been voiced from even the most protective of fans. It’s quite fair to say that the Dune universe is one of the most difficult to adapt into any medium, as has been demonstrated with previous entertaining but ultimately unsuccessful attempts – and yet it’s been adapted, and adapted well – complexities, nuances, and all. Though some minor changes were made, with the absence of Thufir Hawat being the most notable, they don’t detract from the quality as an adaptation or as a sequel in itself; at risk of incurring the wrath of my fellow book fans, I’d like to suggest that many of the minor changes improve upon the source material itself. Zendaya, for example, is refreshingly animated as Chani, a pleasant development from her stoic appearance at the climax of Part One, and of her literary counterpart. As was the case with Part One, the pacing of Part Two is noticeably uneven, making it feel slightly top-heavy, though not to its overall detriment. For much of its 167-minute runtime, the action builds itself up slowly but surely, teasingly incremental in its climb – but in its final act, Paul’s story hurtles its way towards a thunderous, earth-shattering climax. And then, at its crescendo, we finish. A coital rhythm, as its original visionary intended, deliberately uneven, but always growing. And the payoff is worth it. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,A must watch&#33; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE," If you strolled into Haslam’s Book Store on Central Avenue in St. Petersburg in 1965, among the new arrivals you might find on the shelves were Kurt Vonnegut’s “God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,” Rex Stout’s “The Doorbell Rang,” Irving Stone’s “Those Who Love,” John le Carré’s “The Looking-Glass War,” and Ian Fleming’s “The Man with the Golden Gun,” the 12th and final novel in the author’s James Bond series. If you directed your attention to the science fiction section of the store, you might also find some new offerings, such as John Brunner’s “The Martian Sphinx,” Kenneth Bulmer’s “Land Beyond the Map,” Philip K. Dick’s “The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,” Avram Davidson’s “Masters of the Maze,” Andre Norton’s “Quest Crosstime,” and, of course, Frank Herbert’s epic science fiction novel “Dune.” The true first edition of “Dune,” published by Chilton Books, can fetch a pretty penny these days. A first edition, first printing copy signed and inscribed by the author sold for more than $22,000 in a recent auction. With the arrival of “Dune: Part Two” in theaters, I would expect to see some collectors with deep pockets drive that figure even higher in the coming months. Even before the Chilton Books edition, the tale had appeared in Analog magazine, divided into two separate serials. The serials — presented as “Dune World” and “Prophet of Dune” — were published in the magazine beginning in 1963. The author would go on to pen five sequels, including “Dune Messiah,” “Children of Dune,” “God Emperor of Dune,” “Heretics of Dune,” and “Chapterhouse: Dune.” Sounds like an expansive body of work for someone seeking to forge a new cinematic universe, doesn’t it? But wait — there’s more. After Frank Herbert’s death, his son Brian Herbert partnered with science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to continue the series. Since 1999, they have written more than a dozen additional novels, including both prequels and sequels to the original books. In “Dune: Part Two,” director Denis Villeneuve continues his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s work. The film is exquisitely beautiful and immersive, breathtaking in scope, and fearless in delivering stunning action sequences that are so vivid they practically erupt from the screen. Unlike the first installment, this time Villeneuve isn’t saddled by the need to provide history lessons explaining the Corrino Imperium and the Landsraad, or focus energy on world-building and chunky exposition. The director is free to plunge headlong into the meat of the story, boldly tackling themes of corrupt power, ambiguous morality, and the use of religion to control the course of society and manipulate the masses. “Dune: Part Two” follows the mythic journey of Paul “Muad'Dib” Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he finds sanctuary with the Fremen who inhabit the desert planet Arrakis. Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have secretly survived the fall of House Atreides. Once they have been embraced by the Fremen, Paul seeks revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. In doing so, he will help liberate the Fremen — some of whom consider him to be the Lisan al Gaib, a Fremen term for off-world messiah. Initially, Paul rejects the idea of being a savior and insists that he does not seek power. Paul sees the occupying Harkonnen forces — led by Rabban (Dave Bautista) — as their shared enemy, and wishes only to fight alongside the Fremen. Because he plays down any ideas of being the messiah, he gains the trust of Chani (Zendaya), young and independent Fremen warrior who gradually falls in love with Paul. Eventually, Paul must choose between his relationship with Chani and redirecting the fate of the known universe, haunted by an apocalyptic future only he can foresee. “Dune: Part Two” also features Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Christopher Walken as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, and Charlotte Rampling as Gaius Helen Mohiam. For “Dune: Part Two,” the director wisely makes a few important changes to the original novel, eliminating some characters, downplaying others, and significantly condensing the timeline. The modifications are necessary: Cinematic adaptations of literary works require perceptive abridgement that does not compromise fidelity to the source material. The film successfully captures — and in some regards enhances — all the principal themes found in Herbert’s original work. Villeneuve imbues the film with anti-imperialist imagery, showing how colonizers plunder Arrakis for their own benefit while treating the indigenous population with contempt and brutality.  Villeneuve also attempts to rectify one aspect of Herbert’s novel by eliminating — or at least minimizing — the “white savior” trope many critics claim is integral in the source material. The focus on Paul’s reluctance to claim the power his followers desperately want to bestow upon him is a crucial element of how the audience perceives the character. Chalamet effectively displays the character’s gravitas and deep inner turmoil to the screen. Paul exhibits his disgust at Lady Jessica’s hidden agenda, and at the way the Bene Gesserit have directed and controlled bloodlines to maintain power.  In a sense, Chani is on her own mythic journey. Villeneuve’s adaptation gives Chani agency, setting her up as a clear juxtaposition to the fundamentalists’ fanatical belief in Paul as a messianic figure. Equally important is the fact that in “Dune: Part Two,” Paul could not have emerged as a leader without the support of both Chani and Stilgar. “At the beginning, Chani is suspicious but also curious about this boy coming from another world,” Villeneuve explains in the film’s production notes. “Something that deeply touches Chani is that Paul is sincere; she feels that Paul wants to learn about the Fremen ways.” Chani, like other young Fremen, doesn’t believe in the Bene Gesserit religious propaganda. She believes that the Fremen should be freed by Fremen, not wait for the arrival of some prophesied messiah.  “She thinks that those old beliefs are a way to control her people,” Villeneuve adds. “But she sees that Paul doesn’t want to act as a colonizer, he doesn’t want to impose his ways, he doesn’t want to be seen as a savior.” Whether or not Villeneuve’s revisions to the source material go far enough to expunge any controversial motifs should be left to the individual viewer to decide. The intent is certainly evident.  “Dune: Part Two” exceeds expectations. With repeated viewings, it may prove to be the cinematic masterpiece many have already claimed it is. Boasting remarkably rich and nuanced storytelling, captivating political and religious conspiracies, a brilliant score by composer Hans Zimmer, and passionate performances from a superlative cast, the film is a sweeping operatic science fiction spectacle.

"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune Part Two is bigger in almost every way&#46; The visual effects&#44; sound design&#44; and production as a whole is immaculate&#46; Narratively&#44; it does feel a bit too unresolved by the end for my taste but hopefully Dune&#58; Messiah comes sooner rather than later&#46;
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL," Denis Villenueve’s  mythic sci-fi sequel “Dune: Part Two” has already grossed $500 million globally, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024 – domestic and worldwide – surpassing the first film, released back in 2021. Based on Frank Herbert’s anti-imperial, ecologically dystopian “Dune” saga, it revolves around Paul (Timothee Chalamet), heir to the House of Atreides, wiped out in Part One under the fascist aegis of grotesque, genocidal Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). As with any franchise, seeing the first installment is vital to understanding the second. In the year 10191, Paul is hiding out on the vast desert planet Arrakis, where he joins forces with the rebellious, indigenous Fremen, earning the respect of their wry religious elder Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and forming an attachment to feisty Chani (Zendaya) as they defiantly wage guerilla warfare against House Harkonnen. Meanwhile, his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) with her “pre-born fetus,” gulps down the Water of Life, a clear blue liquid that looks like mouthwash that elevates her to exalted status of Reverend Mother within the Fremen’s secretive matriarchal religious group Bene Gesserit. At the center of the conflict is a rare commodity called “spice mélange,” an addictive drug known for its powerful psychotropic powers and prescience (an ability to see into the past, present & future). In smell and taste, it’s like cinnamon. (Because of their constant spice exposure, all Fremen have radiant blue eyes.) New characters include the evil Emperor (Christopher Walken), his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), pugnacious Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) and Lady Margot (Lea Seydoux), pregnant with Feyd-Rautha’s child. Among the most memorable sequences are when Chani teaches Paul how to sandwalk, adroitly avoiding rhythmic patterns in the arid, terra-cotta colored desert that would alert sandworms, when Paul is reunited with Atreides weapon master Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), and when Paul and the Fremen mount those giant sandworms for a climactic battle…concluding with “The war has just begun.” Written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts with an emphasis on action – as opposed to exposition and character-development – this shallow, self-important sequel runs 2 hours, 46 minutes, dominated by Grieg Fraser’s spectacular cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s propulsive score. On the Granger Gauge of 1 to 10, “Dune: Part Two” is a visually stunning yet sterile 6 – teasing an inevitable Part Three in years to come."
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE," “Dune: Part Two” (2024) or “Girl, he be lying” is the second of Denis Villeneuve’s yet to be determined number of adaptations of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel series. The Fremen give refuge to Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), after the Emperor (Christopher Walken, squee!) permitted the house of Harkonnen to massacre the House of Atreides and retake the Fremen’s planet, Arrakis. Lady Jessica secures her survival by agreeing to accept the tribe’s offer to become the Fremen’s Reverend Mother, which makes her even more single-minded in validating the prophecy of Paul becoming the Kwisatz Haderach regardless of the cost to the Fremen or Paul’s humanity. Chani (Zendaya), the Fremen woman and freedom fighter of Paul’s dreams in “Dune: Part One” (2021), teaches the Fremen’s ways to Paul and other surviving Outworlders so they can survive and fight. While Chani and Paul have a relationship, she is skeptical whether he will permit himself to be risen above others and encourage the Fremen to enslave themselves to religious superstitions. When Paul and Chani’s attack on the House of Harkonnen becomes successful, and Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) turns into a drooling, flop sweating mess, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) decides to get a new overseer, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), whom the Bene Gesserit view favorably as more controllable than Paul. Feyd-Rautha proves to be a formidable foe, but Paul has not unleashed all his secret weapons. While “Dune: Part One” (2021) was a cinematic meditation garden, “Dune: Part Two” establishes the formula of what to expect from Villeneuve’s “Dune” franchise: establish Paul in his most hospitable setting and getting acclimated to the next phase of his life, destroy it and then show Paul figuring out how to overcome it by leveling up, which usually means that his prophetic visions come true. In addition, both films open with the voiceover of his future love interest before they even meet, which happens during the denouement (it is not a spoiler if it appears in the trailers): Chani in Part One and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) in Part Two. Remember that Paul mentions the Princess in Part One as a strategy to reascend to power, while others scoff at his ambition so she is less a dream come true as a goal on his vision board. “Dune: Part Two” is less of an ensemble film than the first film and more Timothee Chamalet’s film. The man boy is convincing as a guerrilla warrior though I kept wanting Paul and Chani to sing “For a Moment” while riding a sandworm because surely, I’m not the only one thinking about a Wonka-Dune crossover, but instead of magic and chocolate, it is psychic abilities and explosives. Paul’s time with the Fremen is so comparatively light-hearted that even sandworms feel less like a threat than cheering supporting characters in Paul’s inevitable ascent to the throne. (Are the sandworms ok? Hooks in flesh seem mean.) As Chamalet auditions for the remake of “Dances with Wolves” (1990), “The Last of the Mohicans” (1992), “The Last Samurai” (2003) in a film whose intent is to rebuke that narrative while executing it perfectly, only Chani’s gossip with her friends and constant calling Paul out on his bullshit saves the movie. In addition, Chani and her girlfriends deliver a speech about the difference between the Fremen of the North and the South: religious fundamentalism. In contrast, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who is from the South, is an unwavering Paul as messiah devotee. Paul could take a shit, and Stilgar would say it is part of the prophecy. If you are watching “Dune: Part Two” with the right mindset, i.e. from Chani’s point of view, you should be watching the film with growing dread and concerned about Paul, not cheering how everything is coming together. Jessica takes a back seat in this round except as a sinister, somewhat mad, backdrop. She is just as much of a victim of religious fundamentalism as Paul and a foreboding cautionary tale of what Paul could become if Paul does not resist the siren call of his visions. In many ways, it is the religious fundamentalism of the Fremen and the Bene Geserits, not the House of Harkonnen, that destroys the House of Atreides, including all its descendants. Paul is in “Hereditary” (2018) territory or more like Dani ruling Mereen in Season 4 of “Game of Thrones,” which was the series’ first and last chance to make her a convincing madwoman, but I digress (and am still peeved). Paul is not an innocent pawn. While he was messing with Chani, his eye has always been on revenge and getting power otherwise he would not be so focused on the Princess, a seemingly formidable character with an agenda independent from her father’s, but also finding herself in over her head once she sees the whole situation clearly. Once a character seems destined to be unstoppable as the one, regardless of whether it is a good thing, the story becomes boring and broad. Does a movie really have to be two hours forty-six minutes long to understand that colonialism is bad, fundamentalism is bad, dehumanizing people into rats or gods is bad, etc.? Is it because Villeneuve’s visuals are so gorgeous that he is immune to accusations of the flattening of cinema in a way that the MCU isn’t? The narrative is so broad and predictable that without the visuals, a nap would be necessary, but the visuals are perfect, no notes. It is just hard to feel anything about the characters, who are more like archetypes. Also the visuals can be perfect and trite. For example, the Harkonnen home planet, Giedi Prime, is a homage to Leni Riefenstahl and references the black and white archival news footage of Nazi Germany meets Taika Waititi’s Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) portions of “Thor: Love and Thunder” (2022) with a dash of Roman colosseum gladiator contest aesthetics by way of “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015). Gorgeous, but once seen, is Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) an unexpected or predictable factor? Yawn. Also the casting director is brilliant because Butler is the exact person to cast against Chamalet so we can root for the latter against the guy that decided to retain the Elvis Presley accent long after the job was over. There is only one Elvis, and it is Jacob Elordi! Even though the plot points may be intentional, sardonic takes on such tropes as the noble savage and the white savior, they simultaneously validate such tropes in the overt storyline. It is kind of like the think pieces on “Saturday Night Live” where a problematic political figure goes on the show and makes fun of themselves. Showing that you know something is problematic is not the same as not being a problem. Even though “Dune: Part Two” does better than its predecessor in critiquing these narrative tropes, Villeneuve is not doing the same work as Bong Joon-Ho’s “Snowpiercer” (2013) or “Parasite” (2019) where the audience expects one well-trod turn of events then subverts it by obliterating all expectations because the narrative is inherently flawed and needs to be flipped. Narratives like “Dune: Part Two” understand what is wrong but cannot imagine how to obliterate it or what being right would look like. Having Zendaya side-eye and scowl at everyone is a start, but not enough, especially if the audience does not get it. While it is obvious to those uninvested in Paul, many others are as invested in Paul’s ascendence unironically like Luke Sykwalker and relate to him. It would have been cooler for “Dune: Part Two” to expand on the Jinn reference as demons possessing people who listen to them then make those parallels with the Water of Life or the Holy Poison."
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"As different from the first film as [Ridley Scott's] Alien is to [James Cameron's] Aliens. Same stuff, totally different genre! "
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,&quot;Dune is a stunning&#44; sweeping epic with a cast in command of their roles &#91;&#46;&#46;&#46;&#93; Part Two really cements Dune as one of our greatest modern examples of epic genre worldbuilding&#46;&quot;
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE," otta know what happens this very second” finish, allowing time to take it all in and practice patience before Dune 3 comes along. So, as I wrote before, I personally expect to continue demonstrating that required patience.  After all, I qualify as a fan since I once named a blue-eyed calico cat Alia after a Dune character who I hope to meet more thoroughly in the next installment."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE," Once in a while, a sweeping saga masterpiece comes along, such as 1977’s “Star Wars,” retroactively retitled “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” by George Lucas or Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings trilogy” 2001-2003 or James Cameron’s (2009) “Avatar”— “Dune: Part Two” is most definitely in the same league. It not only continues the brilliance of the first film it sets a new bar for just how good sci-fi films should be. With an engaging story and a cast at their very best, along with stunning visuals, this is a masterpiece. As with the Oscar-winning first installment, Villeneuve shows visual mastery of scale and scope, along with impressive cinematography. Viewing the film in an IMAX theater with Dolby sound brought back memories of the prior films listed above. As a result, I recommend seeing it on the most giant screen possible. Based on Frank Herbert’s idolized sci-fi novel, some have said the movie could never be made due to the book’s complexities and the visual science fiction effects. I’m here to tell you it’s been done as director Dennis Villeneuve has succeeded in a colossal way. Part two follows the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) very closely after the first one ends, as he unites with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, who are not free men. He’s also on a path of revenge against those who destroyed his family, with the help of a Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who is convinced that Paul is the chosen one. Stilgar believes the mythology points to Paul as the savior, the Emo King. Paul tries to blend with the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani. He passes several tests given by the Fremen. He takes the tribal name of Muad’Dib, vowing vengeance against the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis and revenge for his father’s death. During the combat scenes, watching bodies fall from the sky as colossal ships burst into flames appears virtually like an opera when looking at a film’s style. As Rabban Harkonnen, Dave Bautista is a wartime leader whose situation has exceeded his abilities, while Stellan Skarsgard has shades of Jabba the Hutt. I also enjoyed Bautista’s performance as he dug deep into the role, and it is eerily believable. You’ll feel immersion into vast worlds of endless sand that are only traveled with precise movements. Also, in a parallel scene, on another planet, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, a Princess, Irulan (Florence Pugh), speak with Bene Gesserit’s Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) about the state of affairs. Irluan provides voice-over or narration to keep audiences up to speed on what is happening. You may be wondering about Austin Butler’s psycho-path role as Feyd-Rautha, the evil villain and the star of the movie’s most haunting set, the Harkonnen’s home planet of Giedi Prime, shown in nearly all black and white with infrared imagery. There’s a Gladiator-style stadium that serves as an arena for maintaining his champion status as a butcherer of drugged-up prisoners. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the ultra-evil humongous blob, tests his worth by sending former Atreides soldiers to fight. Again, all of Butler’s scenes are filmed in black and white, delivering the feeling of everlasting doom and horror. He’s the sociopathic nephew of the Baron, who gives a realistic, organic performance. I enjoyed seeing all of the famous stars in the film; Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, and Florence Pugh are all fantastic in their roles. Ultimately, Chalamet is the most transformed, taking on his new role of a leader with some surprises along the way. He rises to the occasion, speaking with astute confidence and determination; his transformation and stellar acting are exciting to view as Paul chooses between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe as he attempts to prevent a horrific future that only he can foresee. On a side note, I was invited to a Zoom Press conference with director Denis Villeneuve, and found it very insightful. Especially when he was asked about the epic scope of the film yet keeping the emotional heartbeat. He replied: It’s everything epic and the action, and that is not something that is that difficult to do. The thing that is difficult to do is to make sure that we don’t lose focus on the intimate relationship more precisely, the story between Paul and Chani. That’s the heartbeat, it’s like their relationship will unfold all drama of the film. Through the eyes of Chani and Paul, we feel the political pressure, the cultural pressure, the oppression. I really constructed the movie focused on the tension between them. I knew that and I kept saying to my crew, “If we don’t believe in their relationship, we don’t have a movie.” And that was my main focus during the whole shoot, to take care and to be as close to them as possible. If you haven’t seen “Dune: Part One”, I’d suggest watching that first, as most of the characters are set up, especially Paul and his family’s transition. You will be blown away by “Dune: Part 2”, as it reminds you that a broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair. You may also have flashbacks to other masterpiece-epic films of the past."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE," Director-writer Denis Villeneuve, along with his cast and crew, had a lot to live up to with Dune: Part Two. The first installment of Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel was a rousing critical and financial success, massive in every sense of the word: an IMAX-sized spectacle about destiny and faith charting political machinations across galaxies. And even with a riveting coming-of-age arc and thrilling set pieces, Dune: Part One merely set up this pivotal sequel.  Surprising nobody, this is a technical masterpiece. When viewed in IMAX’s taller aspect ratio, the visuals are simply gorgeous, showing off the beauty and enormity of this severe yet beautiful universe. With monochromatic sequences set on the Harkonnen’s home planet especially standing out, cinema hasn’t felt this epic since the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Expertly staged set-pieces and battles offer genuine thrills and rich, fascinating worldbuilding. Yet Dune: Part Two drops the ball in other areas, its lack of introspection leaving many viewers cold. Picking up immediately after its predecessor, House Atreides is no more, after the Harkonnen’s massacre on Arrakis, and Paul (Timothée Chalamet) heads deeper into the desert with the Fremen to learn their ways. Staying faithful to Herbert’s book, this isn’t your typical good versus evil story but a stark warning on how faith can be weaponised by colonists. It’s fairly obvious from the start how the narrative will play out but that seems to be by design. Paul’s dark ascension to becoming a prophesied leader unfolds like a car crash in slow motion, impossible to take your eyes away from.  Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) once again plays a key role in Paul’s development, and her arc is fascinating to watch. She too heads down a dark path, as Jessica becomes an influential religious figure and convinces the fundamentalists among the nomadic group of Fremen that her son is the Lisan-al-Gaib—a messiah who will lead the people to freedom and paradise. Although her goal is to aid Paul in his journey, Jessica’s cunning plans to change the Fremens’ perceptions and force a prophecy into existence make for compelling storylines, particularly with Ferguson’s delightfully unnerving performance. It’s a shame then, that most of Jessica’s work takes place off screen.  The most memorable character in the film, however, is Chani (Zendaya). Unlike in Part One, she finds substantial screen time that drives the narrative. Even when she solely acts as Paul’s love interest at the start, Chani undergoes a satisfying arc, serving as a counterpoint to the film’s examination of messianic worship. She regularly questions the idea of fate as well as Paul’s motives, all while proving herself to be a capable fighter and survivor. New women introduced to the cast include Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Lady Margot (Léa Seydoux). The intelligent Princess Irulan plays political games as the Emperor’s daughter, but she doesn’t have much screen time and only discusses matters involving Paul. Similarly, Lady Margot is a devious sister of the Bene Gesserit, a women-only group who control the direction of humanity from the shadows. But Lady Margot’s limited scenes are spent tricking a man into impregnating her for the sisterhood’s breeding programme.  The Bene Gesserit are such an intriguing part of Dune’s lore, and in Dune: Part Two the different members do share scenes that highlight how their own creations and plans have backfired, with disastrous results. Ultimately, though, this is Paul’s story, and the film sidelines the powerful—and far more interesting—sisterhood. Whilst it’s nice to finally have a bigger focus on the Fremen after only supporting parts in the first film, it still doesn’t change the questionable choices made with casting. Zendaya and Javier Bardem, a multiracial American and a Spanish actor, respectively, still occupy the roles of people that are clearly coded as Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), or West Asia and North African (WANA). For example, the Fremen’s language employs Arabic phrases such as “Lisan-al-Gaib” and “Maud’Dib,” making it clear where inspiration lies. Yet MENA actors are simply used to fill the background. We finally see more of the Fremen’s culture—their community spaces and rites of passage—but not enough to truly get an understanding of their people outside of aspects that are tied to the immediate story. This surface-level exploration, along with the fact the director and writers are all white men, lead to an Orientalist interpretation, handwaved as “science fiction” while clearly telegraphing MENA cultures and people.  In fact, Dune: Part Two’s exploration of the “White Savior” had its detractors, with some saying Villeneuve glorifies the concept. Yes, Paul, a white man, is taking on the mantle of the Fremen’s messiah and yes, his mother Jessica appropriates their clothing and culture. But this is all part of the original book’s critique of white saviorism. Where Villeneuve and his writers fail isn’t in their portrayals of this key concept—it’s by underwriting the Fremen. Here they are desert-dwellers with capable fighters, ululating women, and strong believers in destined leaders—and nothing more.  Also worth noting is how all of the key new characters are white. Dune: Part One had a somewhat diverse cast, particularly within House Atreides. But with Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho and Chang Chen’s Dr. Yueh being killed off, this sequel feels white-washed. From Bene Gesserit sisters to Harkonnens, to the Emperor's family, the expanded roster of characters could have been more inclusive. Instead, the film squanders this easy opportunity.  Dune: Part Two improves upon its predecessor, thanks to a bigger focus on the Fremen, but the representation is still watered down. Furthermore, shallow writing and choppy editing issues prevent this from being a modern classic. If Villeneuve and company finally give MENA actors, and the Fremen culture, the spotlight in the inevitable third film, then it’ll surely stand as the masterful adaptation they’re striving for."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE," The critically-acclaimed science fiction epic returned with Dune: Part Two on March 1. Director Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune was met with critical acclaim in 2021, taking home six of its 10 Oscar nominations. Dune: Part Two is already speculated to shake up the Academy Awards again, after nearly doubling the first film’s box office numbers. Part Two collected $81.5 million during its opening weekend, while Part One opened to $41 million, the Associated Press reported March 4, becoming the first major-earner of 2024 and a personal record breaker for its director. Villeneuve’s Dune is the third screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel of the same name, following David Lynch’s 1984 film and John Harrison’s 2000 miniseries. Timothée Chalamet reprises his role as the messianic Paul Atreides, who reunites with Chani and the Fremen people of desert planet Arrakis to wage war against the opposing House Harkonnen. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem all return as their characters in Part One. They’re joined by Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, plus a nearly-unrecognizable Austin Butler and a surprise cameo from Anya Taylor-Joy. The film was greenlit by Warner Bros. and Legendary in October 2021 after Part One’s success, with filming taking place between July and December 2022. Originally scheduled for release on Nov. 3, 2023, it was pushed back to March 15, 2024 due to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and later moved up two weeks to March 1. “We worked very hard to be ready for that (original) date but we very much felt that, especially with this incredible cast, that it was worth waiting for,” Mary Parent — a producer on both films and chairman of worldwide production at Legendary — told AP.  Vocalo resident film critic Reggie “The Reel Critic” Ponder called the film “a heroic tale worthy of the big-screen experience,” pointing out that, while Chalamet commands the screen, the actors surrounding him truly make the film stand out. “Dune: Part Two will engross you in its beauty and complexity, yet it might confuse you at the same time,” Ponder said. “If you didn’t quite like Part One, you will like this — and if you liked Part One, you will love Part Two.”"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s return to Arrakis promises much, but in some ways, it must. As spectacular as 2021’s DUNE was, it essentially stopped mid-story in the hope of the filmmaker’s paymasters extending the canvas. DUNE: PART TWO improves on its predecessor in some crucial ways, but the reliance on spectacle leaves gaps in the storytelling and a frustratingly ephemeral interest in the most interesting ideas the film brings forward. The film picks up shortly after the conclusion of the previous instalment, with the family and great house of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) slaughtered on our last visit to the desert planet Arrakis. He finds himself ascending to messianic status amongst the native Fremen people (a seed planted by his mother’s religious cult, the Bene Gesserit) and seeking revenge for his family’s massacre at the behest of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), backed by the Emperor (Christopher Walken). Paul’s developing relationship with Chani (Zendaya) – sceptical of the prophecy of a saviour, Lisan Al-Gaib, which Paul seemingly embodies – provides a counterweight to the meddling of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). As Paul battles with whether to seize the power he could as a religious figurehead, a new foe comes to the fore in Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), a ruthless and psychotic replacement as the coordinator of the Harkonnen campaign on Arrakis. The scope of DUNE: PART TWO is sweeping in both visual and thematic terms, and if the above summary seems abrupt to those familiar with Frank Herbert’s books, it is because it would be easy to get lost in the mythology of even this condensed version of his work. On the visual front, whatever viewers and critics wrote about the spectacle of DUNE applies to its sequel: Villeneuve’s vision remains writ large. It’s possible to argue Greig Fraser’s cinematography here is less impactful and blander than DUNE or THE BATMAN. Still, imaginative visuals such as the otherworldly desaturation of the Harkonnen home world or the use of blue to penetrate past the browns and tans of Arrakis show the film still has a few tricks up its sleeve. “Zendaya’s performance, balancing vulnerability as Paul’s romantic partner, fearlessness as a fighter, and scepticism as a Lisan Al-Gaib doubter, give the film an emotional core that was achingly absent before.” Additionally, Chalamet gives one of his more impressive performances to date. As Paul slowly starts to give in to the leadership expectations and hopes of others, there is a wide-eyedness to his performance that Chalamet’s harsher critics (with this critic guilty as charged) likely did not expect. Ferguson is engaging as Lady Jessica, but the abundant screen time for those with truncated roles in DUNE represents the film’s most significant improvement from part one. Zendaya’s Chani is given time to be sketched out in a way not many other characters are – including protagonist Paul. Zendaya’s performance, balancing vulnerability as Paul’s romantic partner, fearlessness as a fighter, and scepticism as a Lisan Al-Gaib doubter, give the film an emotional core that was achingly absent before. Javier Bardem’s Stilgar also puts forward an earnestness with his religious fervour and hope for a saviour, which puts a bitter sting in the darker aspects of Paul’s role as messiah. With all this said, despite some visual cues and explicit script signalling points that signal the more dystopian aspects of Paul’s rise to power, it’s hard to escape the feeling that reading this in DUNE: PART TWO as a film is extratextual, and instead based on the direction of the Dune novels which followed the ones adapted here. There are a lot of ideas introduced and skirted over – as in part one – around colonial exploitation, white saviour tropes, demagoguery, religion’s role in authoritarian systems, and more. However, few are given time to develop. Within the confines of a sub-three-hour film and sub-six-hour pair, perhaps this isn’t surprising but probably illustrates the core problem with both instalments and DUNE: PART TWO in particular: the sheer scope defies conceptual neatness. “…it’s remarkable a blockbuster film can even seek to introduce some of the themes it does, but that ambition makes it more frustrating that it paints a broad and spectacular canvas with no interest in going deeper (or perhaps no ability to).” In contrast, Denis Villeneuve’s previous sci-fi forays did possess the conceptual neatness required to communicate underlying ideas effectively. ARRIVAL’s wedding of unique alien language and imagery to reimagine the human understanding of our lives is a simple emotional hook on an engaging set of mechanics. BLADE RUNNER 2049 provides a visually stunning and emotionally resonant extension of a simple human aspect of the 1982 original. The direct inspirations for DUNE (or things inspired by the novel, depending on your viewpoint) and things almost explicitly evoked, such as STAR WARS and GLADIATOR, have greater fleetness of foot and simplicity of plot. DUNE: PART TWO obviously aims for a different tone than those, and it’s remarkable a blockbuster film can even seek to introduce some of the themes it does, but that ambition makes it more frustrating that it paints a broad and spectacular canvas with no interest in going deeper (or perhaps no ability to). This entry leans more heavily on the religious and autocratic readings of Paul’s rise amongst the Fremen. However, without much weight behind it, said leaning doesn’t leave a deep impression. It’s heartening that a film of this scope – in all senses – can exist in the modern cinematic canon. However, as engaging and awe-inducing as it can be, the rush of sensory input distracts from the fact it has only a passing interest in engaging the audience’s critical faculties with its characters. DUNE: PART TWO resolves one of the major flaws with DUNE – its emotional dryness – but neglects to use that renewed zeal to meaningfully deepen any of the main ideas introduced across either part. One thing the two modern DUNE films show, if sparingly, is that one person’s Lisan al-Gaib is another’s oppressor in waiting. The film itself can also have dual identities, and how you resolve the balance between breathtaking extravaganza and frustratingly limited melange marks out whether you end up a true believer or a cinematic agnostic."
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE," Clocking in at a substantial two hours and 46 minutes, the highly anticipated sequel to Dune proves to be a captivating and daring work that surpasses its predecessor. It stands as a pure marvel, leaving audiences speechless with cinematic qualities bound to linger long after the credits roll.  Directed with ferocity by Denis Villeneuve, the film pushes the envelope with its gripping dark atmosphere, suspenseful hunts and ambushes, intricate rituals and prophecies, psychedelic imagery, and exhilarating fights set against magnificent backdrops.  In this grandiose adaptation of Frank Herbert’s adventurous saga, Paul Atreides, portrayed with compelling depth by Timothée Chalamet, joins forces with the Fremen tribe, confirming his role as the prophesied leader they have been awaiting. His journey includes daunting challenges such as riding a giant sandworm - a scene described by the director as the most complex he has ever filmed - and facing off against the sadistic Baron Vladimir Hakkonen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his ambitious and ruthless nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Amidst these trials, Paul also finds love with the rebellious Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), but their relationship is threatened by the uncertain fate of the universe. While the film boasts elaborate storytelling, it never veers into indulgence. The incorporation of abstraction amidst its dense layers adds depth, while still delivering all the impact one would expect from a breathtaking sci-fi adventure. Hans Zimmer’s ominous gothic score further heightens the intensity of each scene, contributing to the film’s overall strength. Dune: Part 2 stands as the apotheosis of Villeneuve's directorial signature within the sci-fi genre - a tremendous display of full-throttle filmmaking that mesmerizes with its clever stylization, unwavering attention to detail, and grandiose visuals. Sit back, relax, and immerse yourself in this unmissable epic space opera."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE," Dune: Part Two is not a sequel but a continuation of Dune, so picks up exactly at the point you’d started to wonder if it would ever end. All I can remember from the first film is sand, sand, so much sand, and it must get everywhere, and into your sandwiches. But it is set in a massive desert so it goes without saying there would be a lot of sand. I don’t blame the sand especially. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and based on the series of books by Frank Herbert, this second outing has already been hailed as ‘thrilling’, ‘breathtaking’ and ‘a masterpiece’ by those who are too easily carried away and said the same of the Marvel films – although I’m glad to say they are coming round to my way of thinking. To summarise where we were when we were praying for the last film to end: we were on the inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis which is famed for its rare and extremely valuable resource, ‘spice’. When the emperor shifted control of Arrakis from House Harkonnen to House Atreides it set off a conflict between the two families. After Duke Leto Atreides was murdered his heir, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Paul’s mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), fled into the desert where they found sanctuary with the planet’s indigenous people, the Fremen. Here, we now discover, Paul does not plan to become an aromatherapist and develop his own brand of oils, even if I’d like to see that. Instead, he plans to retake Arrakis and avenge the death of his father. It is a hero’s personal quest story even if we know from the get-go (there are prophecies) that Paul will survive and also that, even if he doesn’t comprehend his destiny yet, he is the ‘Kwisatz Haderach’: the saviour. (There are all sorts of allegories at play; I’m not paid enough to think about them.) The set pieces – the battle scenes, the stadium scenes, the ‘sandworms’ thrashing their way to the surface like the shark in Jaws – are swaggeringly spectacular but hardly suspenseful, as the victors are a foregone conclusion. The noise of it, meanwhile, is so ear-splitting that the sound travels up your legs and vibrates your coccyx. I am still throbbing. Overall, the good characters are insanely good while the bad characters are monstrously bad – and also bald, like Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). The cast is stacked with celebs. Aside from those already mentioned, we have Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, Anya Taylor-Joy, Zendaya and Javier Bardem. I find that I resent how excellent actors who could be doing interesting work get swallowed up by these films. (Chalamet was an interesting actor once.) There is little character development and it’s not for the literal-minded – or anyone who has, despite their best efforts, paid some attention. Weren’t we told that no non-Arrakan would survive without wearing a ‘still suit’ to recycle moisture? So why are they now doing without? Where have the Fremen’s bright blue eyes gone? Why, five hours into the franchise, have we never seen anyone take ‘spice’ so we may properly understand its psychotropic properties? How do you even imbibe it? Also, as Jessica is a member of the ‘Bene Gesserit’, a mysterious sisterhood, and has trained Paul in ‘The Voice’ (which, when used, will command others to do his bidding), why doesn’t he just command the Harkonnen to put down their arms? ‘Because,’ as my son, who is a fan, told me, ‘there would be no story then.’ It is purely about what it’s about, which is power. Who has it, who doesn’t, who wants it. I kept thinking things like: what do people eat around here? I can’t say. I can only say that if my family had ended up on Arrakis, my dad would be saying: ‘I want all that sand off you before you step foot in this car."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Denis Villeneuve is the director of this massive undertaking... Also, on board here is composer Hans Zimmer with his unforgettable background music and Greig Fraser as the cinematographer who gets those gigantic sand worms into action."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is a towering achievement in almost every way that is quantifiable, joining the growing list of sci-fi epics where the sequel outpaces an already heralded original. The majority of this review will be the ways it accomplishes this with a few, but noteworthy amounts of criticisms that keep it from being perfect. But I didn’t want to bury the lead in stating how great the film itself is because I couldn’t really write this review without acknowledging the film’s release, thematic framing in our real world, and the behavior of its performers in recent months. I am a big Dune fan and I say that as a fan of the books that once believed them to be impossible to adapt faithfully. I enjoyed Denis Villeneuve’s initial entry (and all of his films, honestly) and really, really looked forward to how he would adapt the second half of the first book in the sequel. But I can’t, won’t pretend to ignore the world of Dune and the climate of the real world the movie’s sequel crystalized in. The largest controversy being Timothee Chalamet’s skit on SNL and which Hamas was used as a punchline in what was essentially the early days of this specific violent eruption that had already killed thousands and thousands of innocent Palestinians.  I have my skepticisms about the impact of celebrities role in global narratives in general and often feel that propaganda has more power to entrench people in their already established beliefs more often then it sways someone from one side to another. I know internet outrage machines usually depend on every action someone takes in the public eye as some huge factor in what happens all over the world, but I typically have a hard time getting on board with that. So in a vacuum, I think Chalamet’s joke (and the SNL writers) were in extremely bad taste and does demonstrate their lack of care and empathy they had for the Palestinian people (and let’s keep this a buck, probably for Brown and Black people all over), but I’m not mad at people for still wanting to watch a movie that said person stars in. Though, I don’t fault folks that will protest it either. What is, enduring to me, is the plot of Dune and how we often learn so little from the art we create. The elevator pitch for Dune is that in the far future, a once privileged son of noble birth has his family and house obliterated but finds refuge with the indigenous people of a planet foreign to him. Believing him to be their messiah, he manipulates that population to fighting their oppressors, not for their benefit, but for his. And knowing his actions will lead to the literal deaths of billions across the galaxy, he still follows through because of his primary short term and personal goal. There are much better analogies in film to the Gaza conflict, (The Last of Us 2, comes to mind, though I don’t love the portrayals in that one either) but the oppression of a population living on a desired land, often referred to rats in the film is a bit hard to ignore. Unless, you’re in film, and it’s a job, and you can treat art with themes based on real life like you don’t live in that real world too. Its dispiriting and numbing honestly to see separating the art from the artist not only as a mantra for people that want to ignore the politics of art, but for it to basically become the gospel. Maybe I am the parental figure of the movies I watch now. I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed. Anyways, Dune: Part Two, as a film, is a technical achievement on the levels of cinema that I’m not sure I’ve seen in live action. Every scene is jaw dropping to witness. Typically, big budget films have a signature action scene that will live in the zeitgeist for years to come. Dune: Part Two has about 4 that I can think of immediately. Emotionally impactful moments linger in close-up on characters that amplifies the weight of their decisions, their actions, their connections to one another. The scale is appropriate as well. The desert is a character in itself, stretching on forever in each shot, the camera often pulled well behind the characters to demonstrate the endlessness of the landscape. And anyone that sees the film will obviously point to the use of black and white when the movie arrives on the Geidi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld, and it not only makes the violence even more daunting and disturbing, but it gives a sense of that nuance here is lost and the agendas and goals of these people are straightforward. Often to the most ruthless ends. As for the plot, the movie takes place right after the events of the first film, with Paul Atreides and his Lady Jessica seeking refuge among the Fremen of Arrakis, but still being hunted Harkonnen who want to eradicate the Atreides House. As the film progresses, Paul (played by Chalamet) slowly embraces the false prophecies his mother and the Benet Jesuit have planted among the Fremen people, even if he was reluctant at first because of the death and destruction he knows it will bring. The pacing is well done (obviously easier to do in a film of this length) as there are plenty of victories, losses, tragedies, and revelations that guide Paul down this irreversible path. Because the first Dune book was written 60 years ago and because Paul’s story itself takes about 3 books to fully tell, I’ll make what may be an unpopular opinion in 2024: Paul Atreides is one of the most fascinating protagonists written in fiction. Period. He is no hero. Not by a long shot.  After the first film released, I know several people were just out on it because it looked like yet again another white savior leading the Brown folks to the promised land. And because the film only adapts the first half (if that) of the book, I don’t think that was a completely wrong assumption to make. But Paul is not a white savior. He’s actually the opposite, he’s a harbinger of doom. Evil is perhaps to flat a term to assign to him, but I think you can make a great case that for the early parts of the fiction, Paul is a villain opposing greater villains. Dune is about many things, but one was about the cautioning towards the grips of fanatic religious fervor and the danger of charismatic leaders. Paul being an outsider to these people and using their yearning of hope against them to help accomplish his goal of revenge are not supposed to make you root for Paul. And for those that checked out of the first film, I really hope you see the sequel because that specific vision becomes much more clear and on display. Admittedly, while the performances are all good, defaulting as great, the progression of the supporting characters is a bit more up and down for me. Zendaya as Chani is good, mostly, though the expansion of her character for the movie seems to be driven more by it being Zendaya in the role needing a foil to Paul as the fanaticism grows. I think many of the character missteps in the film are often to fill the void of an important character not being there (compared to the books), but asking Chani to be the love interest, the guide companion to Paul, the heart of the Fremen people and ultimately the foil and victim to Paul’s endgame machinations are just a bit too much to pack into one character. Especially for a character that didn’t do 20% of that in the book.  In a different way, Lady Jessica takes on a more nefarious role as the lead propagandist for Paul’s accension to Fremen Messiah. Jessica is already a polarizing figure, by design, so to see her only role in the film to be the carnival barker for Paul, even when he tells her how tragic this path will be, was a little disappointing. Plus, they got her using the voice on AYEBODY, like once per her 2 minutes of screen time, and it got to be a bit much. The other incredible, scene stealing performance belonged to Austin Butler as the absolutely psychotic Feyd-Rautha. He is essentially the mirror of Paul if he were raised in a brutal and homicidal environment that had no love or empathy in the social charter. Your boy really exorcised them Elvis demons. He is impossible not to gawk at on screen, and I often found myself thinking, ‘the most terrible thing possible that a character can do, he will absolutely do it before this scene is over.’ The very big omission from the film that was present in the book is Paul’s little sister Alia. In the book, she is already born and little more than a toddler by the book’s end. BUT because of Lady Jessica drinking the water of life while pregnant, that toddler Alia contains all the knowledge of her ancestors and is basically Reverend Mother in a three year-old’s body. For the film however, Alia is still in utero. While she is still a character, technically, talking to Lady Jessica and being involved in the plotting, she still doesn’t have the impact she had in the books. That puts pressure on characters like Jessica and even Chani in some respects to be either opposing forces to Paul or help set Paul higher on the overall morality scale of the Dune characters. Alia, via the books is just as cunning, but even more brutal and pragmatic than her brother, which is hinted at in the movie, but will most likely be explored fully in Dune: Messiah.  As a whole, the performances and plotting of the characters never relents and almost everything has a good logic system behind it. Only with Chani did I not always have a clear vision of what they wanted or have that feeling in movies where people do things because they haven’t had some basic conversations that would help them make better decisions. Dune: Part Two is a movie that feels like the culmination of everything that can make a big epic story like this great on the big screen. It is one of the most gorgeous films I’ve ever seen whether during the iconic action sequences or the unnerving rituals of the varying groups on the planet. The performances range from amazing to adequate, the latter never truly taking away from the spectacle we are witnessing. I have to imagine that Dune: Messiah will be the last film and if its done as well as Part Two was, gives it a chance at being one of the best sci-fi trilogies every made. “You don’t want the fourth book, Children of Dune, y’all. I’m trying to warn you. I love Dune…but you don’t want that shit, b.” Is the most factual thing you will read on the internet today. Horrendous. "
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE," It was nice being a Denis Villeneuve fan again for a few years, but with Dune: Part Two the inconsistent filmmaker is back to his misguided ways. The brief respite of Blade Runner 2049 and Dune: Part One suggested that he was meant for high-concept sci-fi after the pretentiousness of Arrival, Sicario, and Prisoners — solid genre entries undermined by empty quests for “importance” — sidelined him from the weird heights of Enemy and the gut-punch brilliance of Incendies. In the elevated surroundings of futuristic Los Angeles and the planets of Caladan, Giedi Prime, and Arrakis, Villeneuve’s lofty concepts thrillingly found a home. And while one might think the spectacle of Dune: Part One would increase on the way to a big climax in the continuation of his Frank Herbert adaptation, with the exception of a few slick sci-fi images, Part Two may as well take place in near-future Albuquerque. Tonally inconsistent, this second chapter rarely feels like a Villeneuve film — even the aforementioned visually sharp narrative misfires. Minimal distinguishable style is evident in the film’s excruciatingly long opening stretch with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) entrenched with the indigenous Fremen on the desert planet Arrakis. And the random point at which the narrative resumes makes the already awkward end of Part One feel doubly arbitrary. Though doubts remain among the native people regarding his and Jessica’s presence, Paul has suddenly been “accepted” by most of the Fremen, resulting in a cringey, folksy familiarity with them. And the way he and love interest Chani (Zendaya) wear each other down with their mutually long flirty looks grows old fast, especially with little evidence to support her attraction to him. The two actors have been stellar in plenty of other films, but it’s doubtful that any pair of performers could convincingly pull off this weak romantic material. The distinct change in narrative quality may or may not be due to Part One co-scribe Eric Roth being dropped from the screenwriting team as, in his absence, Villeneuve and collaborator Jon Spaihts spin their wheels with the Fremen and take forever — besides a brief introduction of Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) — to work in anyone else. When they do, it’s merely a minute of the pathetic Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) ‘roiding out over the Harkonnens’ inability to stifle the desert “rat” insurgents. Rather than continue Part One’s invigorating blend of stunning imagery and engaging, informative world- and myth-building, Part Two quickly devolves into Long Dramatic Stares: The Movie. With the filmmakers lacking faith in their storytelling after such a promising opening gambit, the continuation becomes almost Zack Snyder-like in its iconography — lazy solutions that Villeneuve has only occasionally flirted with in his worst films. Such cheap (well, not in a financial sense) tricks are perhaps to be expected when the storytellers wholly succumb to the saga’s fanatical religious elements, which quickly become one-note — particularly the laughable insistence of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) that Paul is fulfilling ancient prophecies and proving himself the messianic Kwisatz Haderach. Paul’s embrace of this role plays out somewhat clumsily as Chalamet proves ill-suited for the big emotional outbursts that accompany Paul’s rise to power. But again, the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis and Denzel Washington would probably struggle to be taken seriously in this role with filmmakers who seem in a rush to reach the end and continually brush past what feels like important information. Likewise running counter to the measured storytelling of Part One, this strangely zippy plotting appears primarily to set up a climactic showdown between Paul and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler, Elvis), a character not even mentioned in the previous film and whose introduction proves predictably forced.  Playing yet another famous performer with a weird voice, Butler is serviceable in the role memorably inhabited by Sting in David Lynch’s Dune, and elicits decent excitement in his birthday gladiator arena sequence as his insane uncle Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) looks on. But the decision to film this stretch primarily in B&W is a strange one and draws too much attention to itself with minimal underlying intent. Tossed around like an off-worlder attempting to ride a sand worm, one grows tired of practically everyone except Walken and Pugh, in part because they haven’t been given enough time to grow dull. However, such opportunities await as, like its predecessor, Part Two is mere prelude to further adventures with Paul & Co. It didn’t seem to be the case after the immense potential of Part One, but in all its awkwardness, the 40-year-old Lynch version remains the definitive big-screen adaptation of Dune."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE," One of the most enduring critiques of 2021’s Dune is of its perceived sparseness, labeling the once “unfilmable” adaptation as a gorgeously engineered juggling act of Frank Herbert’s lugubrious mythmaking that’s all setup and no payoff: a true “part one” if there ever was one. Nearly three years later, however, Denis Villeneuve’s staggering Dune: Part Two proves to land every spectacular, brutalist tableau thrown in the air in 2021. The first film’s meticulous - and at times exhausting - assembly of dynastic lore and tangled history kept its characters in the shadows of its sprawling grandeur, but Part Two completes a vision by colliding dense sci-fi imagemaking with Herbert’s heady and prescient themes: the gravity of manufactured destiny, the untamable tendrils of belief, and a harrowing subversion of the hero’s journey. Discarding the first film’s mysterious, undulating prelude for a new caption, Part Two lets us know it’s getting straight to business: “Power over spice is power over all.” Taking place precisely where 2021’s Dune left off, Part Two finds Paul Atreides (Timotheé Chalamet in top form) and his mother Lady Jessica (a sinister Rebecca Ferguson) on the run with the planet’s native Fremen. With his father dead and House Atreides’ grip on Arakeen shattered by sadistic House Harkonnen rivals, Paul acclimates to his freedom fighter hosts while growing his romance with fellow rebel Chani (Zendaya). Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is eager to accept the prodigal Atreides as the prophesied “Lisan al gaib” to deliver his people from Harkonnen oppression, but unbeknownst to the indigenous faithful, Jessica - as a Bene Gesserit priestess - has carefully massaged eugenics and thousands of years of local myth to suit her son and her sect.  “The world has made choices for us.” Late in Dune: Part Two, Chani unearths its central tension as the two lovers try and resist the pull of destiny. Where Dune ends on an almost comically truncated cliffhanger, Villeneuve is now ready to detonate all the foundations conscientiously crafted three years ago. Catalyzing Herbert’s stark palace intrigue with the tragedy of inevitability, Part Two examines colonial conquest, messianic dangers, and the gravity of mass belief systems. The role of faith - and its meaning to different factions - is woven straight into the tapestry of the narrative: For the Fremen, “Lisan al gaib” is the savior foretold; for the Bene Gesserit, it’s a system of control and a tool of subjugation. And what of Paul himself? Hopped up on Arrakis’ otherworldly “spice” and the psychic powers it endows him, the young duke - channeled through Chalamet’s career-best performance - precariously wavers between his own horror at the tyrannical future he’s locked into and the intoxicating allure of empyrean power. Dune has had a long, pained history on the screen. Alejandro Jodorowsky’s version remains an abandoned production and a Hollywood relic, David Lynch’s ambitiously incomprehensible 1984 film resulted in a notorious flop, and the 2000 miniseries - the bloated and faithful-to-a-fault Frank Herbert’s Dune - has the dubious honor from TOR.com as the “most okay adaptation.” Dune - by sheer number of failed iterations - has been called “unfilmable,” but its reputation as an impenetrable, esoteric art object has been greatly exaggerated. Leafing through Herbert’s prose, it’s quite clear that there’s plenty of Dune that is inherently cinematic, and Villeneuve - whose staunchest critics find him cold and clinical - is the perfect choice to bring Arrakis and its galactic oppressors to life. Not to throw around the word lightly, but Part Two is rife with sure-to-be iconic sci-fi imagery borne from DP Greig Fraser’s stunning compositions: Harkonnen troopers in an anti-gravity assault through the sands of the spice planet, the black sun and inverted fireworks of Giedi Prime, the demented-yet-honorable Feyd-Rautha’s (a slithering, committed Austin Butler) gladiatorial showdowns. Part Two also has Villeneuve shoring up his kinetic bonafides; a mid-film guerilla takedown of an ornithopter had the audience in my theater hollering, and for those who spent three years patiently waiting for some real sandworm action, I’m happy to report that Dune’s most infamous cryptids make multiple jaw-dropping appearances.  Villeneuve, as a long time Dune-head, has called his adaptation the “project of his life.” Conveying an exuberant passion for the source material, his deep understanding of Herbert’s ideas shine through the surgical changes - some major, some subtle - required to bring the book to life. One such inspired choice is the translation of Alia - Paul’s sister - from insidious toddler to a sentient, psychic fetus; the change is made specifically for the screen, sidestepping the need for an awkward toddler actor while still preserving Herbert’s trademark peculiarities. However, not every reconfiguration of text is a good one: For a film so deft at upending white savior tropes and colonizer narratives, Dune’s lone, sore spot remains how eager it is to de-Islamize its Fremen people. Going so far as to hiring Game of Thrones conlanger David J. Peterson to create a fictional language to replace Herbert’s widespread use of Arabic, Part Two’s expected - but no less disappointing - brand of Hollywood cowardice aims to hobble its own themes.  Despite its missteps, Dune: Part Two remains a bracing achievement in science fiction imagemaking and the coalescence of a singular vision that started over three years ago. Transforming Herbert’s prose into a visual cauldron of weird mysticism, resistance warfare, and the tangle of resigned fates, Part Two dares to be an IP blockbuster that is knotty and bleak. As the final notes of Paul’s violent ascendency curdle from triumph to ominous portent, it all becomes crystal clear: Denis Villeneuve gets it. Bring on Messiah."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE," A warrior princess, a terrifying teddy bear, and giant sand worms… here’s the best and worst of the films the Pop Culture Planet writers have watched this week. In Damsel, Millie Bobby Brown plays Elodie who gets sworn into a life of royalty to help her people. This is no fairytale as the prince she’s marrying comes from an ancient kingdom that owes a centuries long debt. In order for the kingdom to live on, a sacrifice must be made. Brown is astounding as the sacrificial princess. Her performance keeps you engaged as she displays trepidation and determination to get out of her predicament. Brown does an excellent service to Elodie’s character as an endearing and witty young woman that felt authentic on screen.  Though there are CGI flaws, such as the glowing worms, the film does a very great job with the dragon voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Aghdashloo brings not only a haunting sense, but also a depth in vulnerability to her role. Taking what could’ve been a simple revenge story and adding a more sentimental aspect to her makes it enjoyable to unpack. The bond Elodie and the dragon create is an unexpected twist that adds to the tension towards the kingdom that lied to both of them. Compassion for the misunderstood is at the forefront of this film and makes for a compelling narrative.  In Dune: Part 2, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) unites with the Fremen while seeking revenge against those who destroyed his family. When he’s faced with a terrible future only he can foresee, he has a choice between love and the fate of the universe. Based on the sci-fi epic book series by Frank Herbert, Dune: Part Two wasn’t for me — and that’s okay. I found the film to be long and dragged out, while the cultural and religious aspects felt whitewashed. The film is star-studded with actors like Christopher Walken that felt more like glorified cameos that don’t add much to the story. There is also a Blonde-level moment of cringe around Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) that comes off as ridiculous. The highlights were the epic action with the sand worms and Florence Pugh’s gorgeous wardrobe as Princess Irulan. It’s been a great time for original horror in theaters, but Blumhouse hasn’t been getting it right. From lackluster entries like The Exorcist: Believer and Night Swim, Imaginary is another L on the list. The film follows Jessica (DeWanda Wise) who moves back into her childhood home with her family. The behavior of her youngest stepdaughter Alice (Pyper Braun) becomes concerning when she finds a stuffed teddy bear named Chauncey that is much more that he seems. While Imaginary has surprising twists and turns, it’s ultimately cheesy and unserious. It is full of weak performances and even worse dialogue, including an awkward line from a therapist asking if Alice has taken on new hobbies like ventriloquism to explain Chauncey’s voice. Chauncey is more silly than scary — although under the right direction, he could’ve come across as more campy to win over audiences. My theater was laughing a lot but more from weak dialogue, which I don’t think was the intent. The stand outs in the film were the positive relationship that builds between Jessica and her stepdaughters, breaking the mold from typical stereotypes, and the unique practical set of the imaginary world of the Never Ever, which gave off Labyrinth energy.  A young woman, eager to earn some cash, arrives in a new town and secures a night shift at a sketchy motel managed by Teddy Miles (Lamorne Morris), who is friendly but slightly on edge and eager to leave. Miles assures Gwen (Phoebe Tonkin) that the place is harmless, despite all evidence to the contrary. When Miles leaves, Gwen is sure she is being watched by someone from her past, but as the night progresses… she becomes convinced the motel is haunted. Night Shift is a movie that offers a few jump scares, but takes too long to pick up. The plot falls very flat and, while the actors are good, the characters introduced along the way are underdeveloped and underutilized. While I thought the choice of committing to one location was just right for the film, it could have been stronger if the story had more moments of spontaneity. The story was pretty lackluster and predictable. Though the major plot twist was intriguing, it created a rushed ending that failed to add to the story.

"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE," On every technical level- this is a work of cinematic genius. The craft is expertly made, and it shows in every shot, every note of the music, and every scene that transports the audience to Arrakis. Timothée Chalamet continues his ascent from space prince to cult messiah, and he digs deep for his mesmerizing and powerful performance as Paul Atreides. Everyone in this stacked cast commits all they can to the film and helps it transcend from an ordinary movie to a sci-fi epic. If you loved the first movie, you'll love this one. And if you were bored by the long space opera, you'll still be bored here. It's nearly three hours long. So if you don't want to take the ride, don't. But if you do, you're in for a treat."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,This was the best adaptation of a book that I've ever seen. 
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE," A desert landscape, magical spices, an occupying force, a native warrior community, and a handsome young hero, bred to liberate them—Dune: Part Two seems to have it all. But does it? While Frank Herbert’s original series was about the dangers of messianism, Denis Villeneuve’s rendition wields ambivalence like a secret weapon in its effort to avoid the tough questions. Dune: Part Two, the latest installment of Denis Villaneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s enduring (and supposedly unadaptable) science fiction series, carries a great weight on its shoulders. It must succeed as a continuation of the first movie without losing new viewers and while bearing the box office’s dreams for an industry that has flagged in comparison to last year. It must give the thrill of a big science fiction blockbuster, while seeming to undermine the transparent teenage fantasies that flourish throughout those stories. A desert landscape, spices with magical properties, an occupying force, a community of native warriors, and a handsome young hero, bred and trained to liberate them all—Dune: Part Two has all the right elements of success, including a star-studded cast. Timothée Chalamet transforms from waif to despot; Zendaya guides the audience’s perspective with her pensive eyes; Rebecca Ferguson giving us “Reverend Mother”; Javier Bardem is both affable mentor and zealot; and Austin Butler sheds the Elvis accent and all of his hair. Villeneuve streamlines the vast scope of Herbert’s story into a series of sweeping set pieces, more plentiful in this installment and meticulously executed. The film charts Paul Atreides’s swift rise while characterizing that rise as a cautionary tale too. For just as Paul needs to save his family and his adopted planet, Arrakis, from the occupying Harkonnens, Villeneuve must salvage knowing self-critique from the jaws of teenage fantasy clichés. When we first meet Paul and his family in Dune: Part One, the Atreides are part of the intergalactic aristocracy and are bequeathed Arrakis by imperial decree. Arrakis is a stark, unforgiving planet. But its deserts and deadly worms also produce “spice,” the most valuable substance in the galaxy. The Atreides hope to turn around the family’s fortunes with the power of the spice production in Arrakis. They exchange the comforts and oceans of their home world for it. Yet, little do they know they have walked into a trap set by a rival family with whom they have been feuding for centuries. In Dune: Part One, we follow Paul and the Atreides as they are stripped of all their advantages. Paul and his mother, Jessica, are left in the vast desert of Arrakis seeking safe haven with a group of Fremen, the people indigenous to the planet. Now, in Dune: Part Two, we return to Paul, who hopes to gather his strength against House Harkonnen—the villainous family that secured a planetary takeover with the emperor’s clandestine support. Paul’s prospects are as limited as the water supply in Arrakis, and his only potential allies are the Fremen, who are understandably suspicious of outsiders. But Paul proves his worth as a warrior and earns their hospitality. Meanwhile, Stilgar, a Fremen leader, takes Paul and his mother into the Fremen’s Sietch, the cave warren where they live out of view of Harkonnen eyes. There, Paul is greeted by rumblings among some Fremen that he might be their messiah. Paul says he doesn’t want to lead; he just wants to fight alongside them. The Harkonnens have the guns and technology, but at nearly every turn they are outmaneuvered by Paul and the Fremen. The Fremen are fierce fighters who have been hardened by desert life, and they know how to resist the Harkonnen occupation by interrupting spice extraction in every way possible. Led by the Baron (played by a grotesque Stellan Skarsgård), the Harkonnens are cartoonish villains, and, barring Skarsgård’s game performance, their depiction feels like a shortcut in Villaneuve’s imagination. The Harkonnens are bad guys who dress in black, kill their underlings on a whim, and assemble their armies in rigid formations reminiscent of Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda films. It’s not just that they are a cliché; it’s that caricatures are not that menacing. The real threat to the galaxy, then, is not in a war between good guys and bad guys but in how belief can turn into violence, and self-defense into a despotic bid for power. The Fremen’s religion preaches the hope of a savior, the “Lisan al Gaib,” and as the film goes on Paul seems to perfectly fit their prophecy. Paul knows too much to be fully taken in by the religious fervor, but even his mother has a messianic prophecy that she works to bring about: She is a sister of the Bene Gesserit, a mystic cabal of political operators who advise those in power but who are also engineering the rise of their own messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach. For most of the film, Paul resists these projected messianic narratives—until he succumbs to the temptation to wield the faith of thousands as his last resort. One of the reasons the Dune novels have been difficult to adapt is that Paul’s story is at the center of a vast scale of conspiracies and machinations. There are the Imperial House Corrino’s ambitions and their manipulation of the Atreides and Harkonnen for their own gains, and there is the Spacing Guild (left out of Villaneuve’s version altogether) that controls all interplanetary travel and depends entirely on spice. Computers have been replaced by highly trained humans, called Mentats. The Bene Gesserit have their own centuries-long eugenicist project, of which Paul is one of the most recent products. And in the novel, Paul’s story unfolds over a longer period of time. He becomes immersed in the ways of the Fremen. He spends years waging guerilla campaigns against the Harkonnen. He has a son with Chani. Villaneuve compacts the storyline for clarity, keeping the most essential portions, if losing some of its intricacies. Yet some important elements get lost in the cuts. The awe we might feel of a man both empowered and reduced in the face of galaxy-sized projects is replaced by the awe of vast landscapes. For a film invested in grand spectacle, the desert embodies the ambivalence of a world where nothing is ever just one thing: It is a source of wealth, but also a place of death, a hostile home, a visual splendor, and an impassive vastness. Villaneuve and cinematographer Greg Frasier capture the desert in its varieties, but their palette also limits the world to shades of bleakness. It can be striking to see a figure framed as an iconographic silhouette against a near-monochromatic backdrop, but too much of the same image weaken its profundity. There are only so many ways to look at the undulating waves of the sand against a broad beige sky, especially when the Fremen sartorial style is just as beige. Camouflage makes sense, of course, but even when we see inside the Fremen living quarters, the only pops of color are their watchful blue eyes. Blue eyes are a symptom of spice intake. For the Fremen, the spice is a part of life. It’s in the food they eat and the air they breathe. But for Paul there are some serious side effects, including prophetic visions out of his control. In Herbert’s novel, the effects of these visions are a more central and dramatic concern. They are fragmented and unclear, but they show Paul a religious war with an unfathomable cost and blood on his hands. Paul tries to find a way to avoid that future. But the prophecies don’t just elude his control; they fracture his sense of self. He struggles to keep his grasp on a reality that passes through his hands like a fistful of sand. In Villaneuve’s rendition, these visions are more discrete and less fragmentary. Rather than disorient viewers, the visions hardly compete with the excitement and set pieces that surround them. We lose the sense of the mystical that percolates throughout Herbert’s novels and the ability to see possible futures other than the one Paul sees. For the most part, we are stuck within Paul’s perspective, learning the world of Dune as he does. We like Paul. His heart is in a good place, and we want to see him win. We also know how this kind of story works. Our hero starts with nothing; he resists his calling, before inevitably gaining the power he deserves. The film’s very form is structured around Paul’s ascendance, and his harrowing visions are mere speed bumps on his path to victory. As Part Two unfolds, the film tries to distance us from our hero’s choices by foregrounding Chani’s point of view. Through Chani’s eyes, we see the costs of Paul’s rise and how Paul walks right into the choices in his visions. It is Chani’s face, her reactions, her pleading that offer a moral conscience to a world that, like its landscapes, gets bleaker and bleaker. She counsels him against the actions that lead to the end of the movie and make Paul’s nightmares a reality for everyone else. While the original series was all about the corrosive power of adulation and the wayward paths on which messianism can lead us, Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two is like so much film and television today: It wields its ambivalence like a secret weapon. It offers up set pieces and violent victories for viewers to revel in and draws Paul toward an apocalyptic end that becomes increasingly unavoidable. But the film doesn’t complicate our feelings as much as it performs ambivalence for us. The film warns us against the very thing it gives us. We watch from reclining chairs as Paul starts a holy war—our hands are clean. We get the heroic battles and the guilt on the side. Our hero is tortured so we don’t have to be. All we need to do is just sit back and put up our feet. We hope you enjoyed the story you just read.

"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters this weekend is Dune: Part Two, the incredible sci-fi epic that well surpasses the first part and achieves on every level. This might be the best sci-fi film we’ve had in many years and will likely be one of the best films of the year. Director Denis Villenueve masterfully guides this second part with exquisite cinematography, a striking score by Hans Zimmer, incredible costumes, groundbreaking effects, and a stellar cast in Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Christopher Walken, Stellan Skarsgard, and so many others. The action ramps up, the story goes deeper, the characters become more fleshed out, and the stakes are raised. Despite a running time of two hours and 45 minutes, it flies by and there isn’t really a unnecessary slab of time in there. It makes you want for the third and final chapter and surprisingly has you thinking you’ll want to see it again right away to see what you might have missed. That’s an achievement in this short attention span world. See it on the biggest screen possible. That’s it for this week. Join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK, AMFM Magazine, and RECRD."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE," No one cries in the desert. In a place where water is precious, nothing can be wasted. Dune feels without tears. Dune speaks without words.  Director Denis Villeneuve may be the greatest filmmaker of his generation. Author Frank Herbert may be the greatest science fiction writer of all time. By combining the two of them, they’ve created a fully realized universe of revenge and power in a way that’s utterly unique. It’s like nothing else you’ve seen or will see again. For those who haven’t read the books, much of Frank Herbert’s story takes place in the minds and inner thoughts of his characters. Because of that, Hollywood has shied away from turning this science fiction touchstone into a movie event for years. The last time someone tried, in the eighties, the result was a disaster. How do you film a movie where all your characters think and don’t emote or speak? You can’t. I can’t. Maybe no one else in the world can except Denis Villeneuve.  In the eyes of Villeneuve, dialogue is lazy. A true visual storyteller can communicate without speaking. And he does it. He does it over and over and over again and translates what was once thought to be an unfilmable narrative into one of the greatest movie masterpieces ever created. He does it by using images and sound and the nuanced faces of some of Hollywood’s most talented young actors. Mute the dialogue in Dune: Part Two, and you wouldn’t notice. Villeneuve tells a story beyond words. By the time Dune: Part Two is over, we know this world and these characters on a deeply intimate level. We understand what drives them and we feel the lesson they’ve learned. That lesson is this: When war is upon you, fight. "
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE," The sand trembles and appears to harden, like goose bumps on the forearms of impressionable sci-fi geeks. We come to space operas to be transported, and few sights are as entrancing as the moment a giant sandworm, its circular mouth baring a fearsome set of sharp, needle-shaped chompers, rises to the surface.  “Dune: Part Two,” director Denis Villeneuve's return to the worlds created by author Frank Herbert, delivers the imposing spectacle with visual splendor and a deafening sound mix. We want to witness our brave and determined protagonist's first surfing expedition atop the cylindrical critters. The scene comes fairly early in this hefty continuation of the cinematic retelling of Herbert's dense, highly influential 1965 novel (don't you dare call it a sequel), and it does not disappoint. Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and Zendaya as Chani in a scene from ""Dune: Part Two."" (Photo by Niko Tavernise. © 2023 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) What does come as a letdown is how this knotty exploration of lust for power, faith-based fervor and that snake-charmer's dance between fate and chance proceeds to get lost in the desert. Villeneuve, who struck such an adroit balance between storytelling and worldbuilding in 2021's square-jawed but satisfying “Dune: Part One,” is so intent in lending biblical weight to this star war that he drains the film of much of its pulp, and what starts out as engaging genre yarn turns into a bloated endurance test. He's made an otherworldly voyage that forgets to be a popcorn movie. Getting through all 166 minutes of it feels like homework. “Part Two” picks up minutes after “Part One” left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), heading off into the sands of Arrakis, the desert planet they initially landed on to oversee alongside Paul's dad, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, sorely missed), before the very ruler who appointed them there conspired to wipe out the Atreides kingdom, or, as Herbert coined it, House Atreides. Mother and son survived the extermination that claimed Leto's life and have joined the Fremen, Arrakis' native residents, and their chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem in the Anthony Quinn role), with whom Leto wanted to establish an alliance before it all went belly up. The problem that Paul and Jessica face is that the Fremen are split between those who remain wary of outsiders and want to banish the new arrivals into the desert, and those who revere the pair and regard Paul as a messianic figure and the fulfillment of a prophecy. Stilgar, a fierce believer in that prophecy, is on Paul and Jessica's corner, but they will have to prove their usefulness. More skeptical but curious about Paul is Chani (Zendaya), who proves to be a valuable ally to the young aristocrat. In turn, Paul insists he has no appetite for power and just wants to help the Fremen. Meanwhile, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) is weighing the consequences of his betrayal aimed at eliminating House Atreides, while his daughter, Princess Irulan Corrino (Florence Pugh) learns that Paul may be alive. They do not appear to stop their co-conspirator, the dastardly and freakishly blubbery Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew, Count Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), from searching for Paul. But scenes set outside Arrakis are few and far between in “Dune: Part Two.” By contrast, a considerable portion of “Part One” took place in the Atreides' home planet of Caladan, giving viewers a welcome change of scenery. But for the majority of its runtime, this latest chapter leaves us stuck in that big dust bowl, where Jessica uses her ties to the powerful and mysterious Bene Gesserit Order to help sway public opinion about her son. But the aesthetic sameness that engulfs the character makes her quest feel oppressive, and that extends to the way Villeneuve, working from a screenplay credited to him and Jon Spaihts, depicts religious devotion in stark, monochromatic terms. There are skeptics, believers, and the torn, brooding Paul stuck in the middle, haunted by disturbing visions. Noticeably missing are the shades of gray that would make his predicament more intriguing. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and Léa Seydoux as Lady Margot Fenring in a scene from ""Dune: Part Two."" (Photo by Niko Tavernise. © 2024 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) As for his friendship with Chani, it evolves into something more, at least on paper. Villeneuve may possess multiple strengths as a filmmaker, but conveying romance is not one of them. Chalamet and Zendaya fight a gallant but losing battle to make us believe their characters are an item, which may not seem like a big issue, but it becomes one when the movie hinges its dramatic payoff on their bond. More effective is the emergence of Feyd-Rautha, Baron Harkonnen's psychotic, bloodthirsty younger nephew. Austin Butler commands the role played by Sting in David Lynch's 1984 “Dune” adaptation. Before he joins the efforts to root out Paul, Feyd crosses paths with the enigmatic Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux, looking as if she stepped out of a perfume ad), who has her own motives for approaching the bald, obsidian-eyed sociopath. Butler and Seydoux share limited screen time together, but they set off considerably more sparks than Chalamet and Zendaya. By the time Villeneuve and Spaihts tie their narrative strands together, this ostensible middle chapter has become too much of a chore. Pugh, dressed like she's heading to a Renaissance fair, gives a rare stiff performance. She and the formidable Walken are given nothing to do beyond Greek chorus duties. Butler dives into the villainous Feyd-Rautha with rock-star abandon, but there's not enough of him to turn things around. And the film's strained attempts to portray the change in Paul's worldview feel imposed and mechanical rather than earned. It reduces the conflicted would-be leader to a barking politician with a God complex. The more confident the character appears, the less interesting he becomes. “Dune: Part Two” desperately wants you to take it seriously, which is kind of hard when it features spaceships that look like testicles and is awash in phallic imagery. Villeneuve pummels you with portent, diluting the movie's entertainment value in the process. He gets to indulge in his most heavy-handed instincts behind the camera, to the extent that what's in front of it resembles a fire-and-brimstone sermon. He's preaching the Gospel of Paul but neglected to accommodate the non-believers he won over the first time around. The spice doesn't flow here. The bloom is off this desert rose. It did leave me with a gift, but not one I wanted: a big, pounding headache. My temples throbbed, but my imagination stayed firmly planted on the shifting sands.

"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,Epic visually&#44; but the story is still hard to follow if you have not read the book&#46;
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE," A combination of a journalism assignment at the Oregon Dunes and the recreational usage of psilocybin mushrooms led Frank Herbert to write “Dune,” a sprawling, five book saga. Beloved by many, they featured intergalactic warfare, giant worm-related destruction, and trenchant criticism of politics and religion. On the one hand, you’d expect that as a lifelong genre dweeb and sci-fi nerd, I would have been into these books. On the other hand, those are some seriously long-ass books. I put off reading them, and if you know anything about me, I have some god tier procrastination skills. Years passed. I did not give the spice-filled planet of Arrakis a second thought. Then, in conversation with my friend, Kristin, that changed. You see, she’s both an English major and a fellow geek. Kindly but firmly, she insisted I read just the first of Herbert’s books. “It’s good, trust me,” she said, or words to that effect. As it turns out, Kristin was right! I didn’t fall in love with the novel, but there was some weapons-grade strangeness at play amidst the political maneuverings and talk of jihad. It’s a classic, and I understand why that is. The book led me to Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 film adaptation Dune. That led me to Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve’s hotly anticipated sequel. Does it live up to the hype? You bet your Fedaykin ass it does. We pick up where Dune left off, and in a power move rivaling the MCU, there’s zero attempt to bring new viewers up to speed. So, at the risk of sounding like a stroke victim, let’s dive in! Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the daughter of Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), dictates in her journal that Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) may yet survive.  That’s surprising, since the Atreides clan has largely been slaughtered by House Harkonnen. You see, the Harkonnen clan is led by the sluglike Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgard) and his (for the moment) right hand Rabban (Dave Bautista). They are, not to put too fine a point on it, not nice people, and the Harkonnens are now concerning themselves with bringing the desert planet Arrakis to heel and controlling the flow of spice. The good news for Paul is that he’s actually alive. He’s hanging out with the Fremen, what the Arrakis locals call themselves. Half of the Fremen think that Paul and his space witch mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are more trouble than they’re worth. That includes Chani (Zendaya), a warrior who’s fifty percent sweet on Paul and fifty percent sure he’ll bring the Fremen to ruin. That’s because Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of this tribe of Fremen, is positive that Paul is an honest-to-God messiah. Maybe he is. Paul has dreams. He sees signs and portents, possible futures, disasters, and a narrow path to something he thinks of as victory. Can he achieve victory over Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), a Harkonnen psychopath and knife enthusiast? Again, it depends on how you define the concept of victory. First, let’s clear something up. These days, there’s a nasty habit amongst filmgoers that a movie is either an offensive assault or the greatest work of cinematic art ever. The fact is, most movies fall somewhere within the Pretty Good classification. You watch them, you have a nice time, then you live your life.  Bearing that in mind, Dune: Part Two is genuinely an epic in every sense of the word, one on the same tier as The Empire Strikes Back and Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lots of studio films feel as if they’ve been designed by committee and focus-grouped to within an inch of their lives. Not here. The sweep of the arid vistas, blood and thunder, and armies clashing are fully within service of Denis Villeneuve’s vision. The canvas he paints on is enormous. It spans between planets and takes us from the back of a massive sandworm to the cozy confines of a tent. All the technical aspects, from the effects work to the costuming and set design,* work in harmony to deliver specific people during a specific time. Part Two has a two hour, forty-six minute run time. Add that to the first film and you’ve got essentially a five hour adaptation of the first book. I think that’s necessary since Villeneuve needs to set up the world, the players, and their motivations. He does so efficiently, and there were only a few moments where I was aware of the passage of time. Is the script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts as sparkling as the direction? Not quite. Everyone in House Harkonnen is essentially Team Evil, and their character motivations range from, “I love conquering people” to “I love stabbing people.” The nuance is saved for our protagonists. Without getting too deep into spoiler territory,** Paul walks a path that’s the polar opposite of the hero’s journey. The script does excellent work showing his hesitation, his struggle, and the decisions he makes. It also focuses on how others react to his potential Chosen Oneness. We see Jessica spreading tales about Paul’s godhood and slowly coming to believe it herself. Along with that are interesting questions raised about politics, fanaticism, and cultural appropriation. Instead of becoming annoyingly preachy, the characters wrestle with these complex issues, and that makes them fascinating. This is a prestige picture by Warner Brothers. Since no effort has been spared, the cast here is double-plus stacked. Everyone does strong work, but I have a life to live, so I’m not going to go into the eighteen dozen massive stars that appear in this film. Instead, let’s focus on three of them. As Stilgar, Javier Bardem plays a leader happy to cede his authority to Paul. He’ll be the rock upon which Paul builds his church, and he conducts himself with the serenity of a believer – or a fanatic. His opposite is Chani. Zendaya plays her as sensible, hard headed, exactly the wrong person to get involved in a burgeoning holy war. Their focus is Timothee Chalamet’s Paul, who has the charisma to be a leader of a movement and the intelligence to not screw it all up. We see him shift from a callow noble to a determined resistance fighter to a religious figure, and Chalamet allows us to see Paul’s struggle every step of the way. I wouldn’t count myself as a Dune superfan. I can’t recite the lore of the Bene Gesserit, tell you the average length of a sandworm, or explain why everyone in House Harkonnen is hairless. But as I said before, I get it now. Dune: Part Two is a singular vision painted on an enormous cinematic canvas. See it on the biggest screen you can."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE," Con la perspectiva que me da haber reposado 'Dune: Parte Dos' desde que la vi hace ya un par de semanas hasta el momento en el que estoy tecleando estas líneas, puedo afirmar sin caer en el exabrupto provocado por el calor del momento —que cantaban los Asia— que no sólo es el gran blockbuster que llegará a nuestras salas de cine este curso cinematográfico 2024; también se alza como el mayor espectáculo audiovisual en clave sci-fi que hayamos visto en mucho tiempo. Con su segunda aproximación al universo de Frank Herbert, Denis Villeneuve ha vuelto a moldear una apisonadora fílmica creada para ser vista en la pantalla más grande y escuchada a través del sistema de sonido más potente posible. Y es que el francocanadiense, aliado de nuevo con el genio de Greig Fraser —probablemente, uno de los 5 mejores directores de fotografía en activo, ha elevado la apuesta de 2021 a un nuevo nivel. Siguiendo las bases de su predecesora en términos de producción, y enriqueciendo con CGI de primerísimo nivel maquetas, efectos prácticos y unas localizaciones reales poco menos que sobrecogedoras, esta 'Parte Dos' cautiva a través de las retinas por igual en sus dosificados pasajes volcados en la acción y en sus fragmentos más tranquilos y contemplativos. Pero estamos frente a algo más que un envoltorio perfecto que, eso sí, adolece de un sorprendente mal. Del mismo modo que en lo que respecta a su factura y tratamiento técnicos, 'Dune 2' regresa a las claves narrativas de la original en cuanto a construcción de mundo y personajes se refiere para brindar un relato de ciencia ficción modélico, canónico e intensísimo. El particular juego de tronos galáctico entre Harkonnens, Atreides y demás piezas del tablero cumple su cometido de mantener al respetable pegado a la pantalla, alimentándolo con un acertado contraste entre épica desmedida y un tempo reposado. No obstante, si algo hace que lo último de Villeneuve no alcance la perfección es la duración de su metraje. Puede que esto suene disparatado tratándose de un largometraje que se extiende durante casi tres horas, pero la historia de Paul Atreides y su ascenso al poder pide a gritos, como mínimo, otros sesenta minutos que permitan a sus protagonistas y antagonistas apuntalar sus desarrollos, y a su fascinante mitología respirar en medio de un viaje vertiginoso hacia un clímax que se resuelve mucho más rápido de lo que debería. En cómputo global, y esto difiere mucho del desastroso montaje de 'Rebel Moon' y su nula capacidad de generar empatía, la cinta no tiene fallas que la impidan funcionar a nivel dramático; los personajes y sus conflictos quedan totalmente claros y evolucionan con coherencia, su progresión es evidente y lógica, y deja momentos y villanos nuevos para el recuerdo —mención especial para el Feyd Rautha de Austin Butler—. El problema es que la cadencia sosegada de la narrativa choca frontalmente con su celeridad argumental, dejándonos con la miel en los labios no sólo a la hora de conocer tanto al mencionado Rautha como al Emperador Shaddam IV o a su hija, la Princesa Irulan —por poner un par de ejemplos—, cuya presencia, determinante para la historia, termina reducida a lo simplemente anecdótico. También condensa su espectacular fin de fiesta en lo que vuelve a ser un coitus interruptus que poco tiene que ver con la necesidad de ver 'El mesías de Dune' trasladada a la gran pantalla."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE," Building on his excellent cinematic grammar of prophecy, Denis Villeneuve uses Dune: Part Two (2024), cowritten with Jon Spaihts, to examine the experience of being set before the prophecy, knowing you’re its intended subject. Not to take the whole messiah thing literally, but this narrative structure is famously hinted at in the Gospels. Jesus, good student that he was, knew the biblical prophets were most likely referring to someone of his genealogy and position. Jesus the Son of God was perfectly willing to fulfill the prophecy, but Jesus the son of Mary and Joseph ineluctably didn’t want to die. We see this in two brief episodes near his death: In the Garden of Gethsemane, he prays to God to shift the burden to someone else; and on the cross just before the moment of his death, he cries out to God, Job-like, asking why He has forsaken him. For obvious reasons, we don’t know much about that side of Jesus. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), good student that he is, knows the Bene Gesserit Kwisatz Haderach most likely refers to someone of his genealogy and position. Jessica the Bene Gesserit sister is perfectly willing, even a tad overeager, to fulfill the prophecy, but Jessica the mother of Paul ineluctably doesn’t want him to die, which he will if he fails to fulfill any single prophetic prediction. We saw this in Dune: Part One (2021) with the Gom Jabbar, and we see it here when he drinks the Water of Life, and when he fights Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). But unlike for Jesus, we know exactly what’s going on in Paul’s head. Just like Jesus, Paul has some supernatural abilities: the Voice by training (sound designed by Richard King and David Whitehead), clairvoyance by birth and spice. But he also knows that the prophecy was created not by God, but by Bene Gesserit manipulation, and that following it will lead to untold suffering—the suffering of others. He stands at a crossroads. At one point, Chani (Zendaya) says, “Decisions have been made for you,” but Paul can still choose differently, as many have noted, by simply foregoing revenge. The scene where he asks Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) what to do, and all three answers are to take the plunge, is thus unintentionally hilarious in how overdetermined it is. It’s also honest: Evil actualizes when he goes with the flow, and its momentum is unstoppable."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,The genius of the author&#44; Herbert&#44; and now the director&#44; Villeneuve&#44; is to weave all this complexity into an easily understood&#44; and compelling story&#46; It&apos;s been tried before&#44; but this is the first time it has really worked&#46;
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE," Sure, we’re eight thousand years in the future, on planets far far away; Earth seems to have been all but forgotten. But our protagonist, Paul Atreides, is a young man with white skin, scion of a feudalistic, colonialistic lord, played by a white American actor of European extraction; the character is from a world that is distinctly Scottish-flavored. He inspires the Fremen — the oppressed indigenous, brown-skinned, Muslim-esque peoples of the desert *cough* Middle Eastern *cough* planet Arakis, and, as depicted here, more a collective mass than individual people — to rise up against their oppressors, the Harkonnens, who are other (literally) white-skinned feudalistic colonials. (Arakis is home to the “spice” that is required for interstellar navigation. The spice is this civilization’s oil. And unlike in our 20th/21st-century reality, the people sitting on the incredibly valuable, incredibly essential natural resource are not the ones who benefit from it. Dune is Lawrence of Arabia if good ol’ T.E. headed out there after WWII, when car culture started booming, instead of during WWI.) 
Whether the Prophecy [that helps install Paul in his white-savior role] is “real” or not is beside the point. White Western men, whether Herbert and Villeneuve, think it’s plausible that indigenous people would accept an outsider — who just happens to look more like a white Western man than he does like those indigenous people — as their salvation. Even if you want to take Dune as a critique of the idea of the white savior — and, again, there’s no hint of that in this movie — we can still question that critique being structured as it is.
 A far more potent critique of the white-savior narrative might center the Fremen, perhaps put someone like Zendaya’s Fremen warrior Chani in the protagonist role — why can’t she have a hero’s journey, rather than Paul? But that’s not the book that Herbert wrote, and if Villeneuve wants to adhere closely to the novel, Paul-as-savior is the story we are stuck with. (Dune is one of the biggest selling novels of all time — not just in the science-fiction genre, but of any stripe — with a devoted fanbase that would surely be cheesed off by too much divergence from the text. *sigh* Perhaps there will come a day when fanboys don’t rule. But it is not this day.) So now we have the back half of Villeneuve’s (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) adaptation of the first Dune novel. Does it offer any critique of the white-savior trope? I don’t see it. Paul is unquestionably a white savior. Most of the Fremen accept him as their savior. And while there is critique of cultural appropriation (more on that in a bit), it’s also arguably a problem that the primary Fremen characters here — Chani and Javier Bardem’s Stilgar — are not played by actors of MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) background. It’s not that Zendaya (Spider-Man: Homecoming) and Bardem (Everybody Knows, mother!) aren’t terrific; of course they are. And they look more the part than could have been the case. (There are white Westerners in these roles in David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation of the book, for instance.) But it’s a problem that a movie that purports to critique colonialism kinda looks like a good example of colonialism, even in the woke 2020s. That said, Paul is, appropriately, not a good guy in the eyes of anyone except, maybe, the Fremen. (This is in keeping with the books.) There are no genuine good guys here. (Maybe Chani could be considered such. She is at least clear-eyed about what is going on with Paul and the Fremen.) Dune: Part Two is a warning about demagoguery. About the use of religion as a tool to control the masses. This warning, as Villeneuve deploys it, is blatant, ridiculously over-the-top. But given the times we are living in, with populist fascism and fundamentalist religious bullshit springing up everywhere (and no, I’m not talking about anything Muslim), over-the-top feels like it might be necessary to get some thick-headed numbskulls to see it. Dune 2 is a genuinely terrifying movie, though it sneaks up on you, even if you are an openminded, politically aware soul already attuned to the horrific shit going down in our real 2020s world. Partly it’s terrifying because obviously so many people — including the artists making blockbuster movies — can see what’s happening to us all, and yet we seem to be collectively incapable of stopping it. Young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet: Don’t Look Up, Little Women), having survived the massacre of his House by House Harkonnen in the first movie, is now living among the Fremen in remote wastes of Arakis, trying to prove to them that he is more than a spoiled princeling and genuinely wants to promote their independence from galactic occupiers. (Why does he want this? Is it just revenge, justice for his father, Duke Leto? These questions are part of the thorniness that is Paul Atreides.) This means he has to contend with a prophecy that suggests that he may be the liberator long foretold who will release the Fremen from the shackles of those stealing the sweet spice from under their literal feet. Some of the Fremen, such as the older Stilgar, have fallen under Paul’s inadvertent spell. Others, including Chani and her young friends? Not so much. Villeneuve, who adapted Herbert’s book with screenwriter Jon Spaihts (Passengers, Doctor Strange), gives us a lot of truly lovely stuff as he depicts life among the Fremen. I found it beautiful how sand walking, the arhythmic movement that the Fremen use to avoid drawing the attention of the giant subterranean sandworms, looks like dancing, and how the patterns sand walking leaves in the sand looks like Arabic script. Fremen culture is much more elaborately depicted here than it was in the first film. (Which makes it much more frustrating that no Middle Eastern actors were cast in significant Fremen roles. The talent is there. C’mon.) We appreciate the immense tragedy when the Fremen culture is attacked again, in a renewed Harkonnen offensive to retake what they see as theirs. The political machinations are many here, and I don’t want to spoil them for those who haven’t read the book, which will be most of the movie’s viewers, because book bestsellership requires far smaller an audience than movie blockbustership. (The fantastic cast also features Christopher Walken [The Jungle Book, Eddie the Eagle] as the feckless emperor, and Léa Seydoux [No Time to Die, The Grand Budapest Hotel] as another Bene Gesserit wielding powers simultaneously awesome and pathetically prosaic; Josh Brolin [Avengers: Endgame, Deadpool 2] returns as Atreides soldier Gurney Halleck.) But this is very much a story about power as control, and about the politics that enable that control as religion. That Fremen prophecy foretelling the arrival of a liberator? Total fabrication of the Bene Gesserit religious order, from which women pull the galactic strings. They’ve been working on this for centuries. But even they, with their mystical powers and well-earned aura of menace, do not have the control they think they do. Dune 2 is ugly and outrageous and brutal and cynical, and it hits square in the social plexus of the horrifying real-world 2024 milieu in which we all exist… which slightly softens all the white-savior, cultural-appropriation stuff. This movie, while not perfect, has important shit to say, shit that must be heard. Again: Villeneuve’s hand with it all is an elegant sledgehammer, bashing us around the head about things we should already be able to see for ourselves but clearly can’t. Or won’t. It’s like this: As the cruel, sluglike* Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård: Borg vs McEnroe, Our Kind of Traitor) vies to regain his control of Arakis, he removes his Arakis lieutenantship from one nephew, Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista: Knock at the Cabin, My Spy), and hands it to another, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler: Aliens in the Attic). When she hears of this, the emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh: Oppenheimer, Black Widow), is appalled: “But he’s psychotic,” she objects. And the first thing that sprang to mind for me was: But aren’t they all? Villeneuve’s depiction of the Harkonnen homeworld, Giedi Prime, will make your blood run cold. We meet Feyd-Rautha as his uncle grants him a gladiatorial battle in a brutalist stadium to prove his mettle before the populace — it’s fixed, of course; the other combatants are drugged — and it’s some real Leni Riefenstahl shit. Bad enough, but Giedi Prime basks in the sickening glow of a “black sun,” and cinematographer Greig Fraser shoots this not in a creamy, dreamy black-and-white but in a kind of infrared, which leaches color and is simply stomach-churningly wrong. The kind of wrong that screams: Human beings should not be living in this kind of natural environment, and no wonder the Harkonnens are such awful people. (Oh, and “black sun” is definitely a Nazi thing.) But it isn’t only the Harkonnens who are psychotic: Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson: Reminiscence, Doctor Sleep), by now aren’t much better. A Bene Gesserit priestess, she accepts the role of Reverend Mother among the Fremen, and she leans hard into the job; tattooing her face with Fremen symbols that represent the prophecy is the least of it. It’s more white-savior crap — why would the Fremen want an outsider as their spiritual leader? she doesn’t even understand their culture, has to be taught about it — but Villeneuve also leans hard into showing how deeply wrong what Jessica is doing is. In the first film, she seemed a sympathetic character, defying the Bene Gesserit leadership in the form of the calculating Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling: The Little Stranger, Red Sparrow) and throwing a spanner into their plan to manipulate the powerful men who rule the galaxy. (It’s complicated, but as part of the Bene Gesserit long game, she was supposed to have a daughter by Leto, not the son that Paul is; the sex of her child was under her control. Bene Gesserit workarounds for that come into play here.) Now, though? It seems that it wasn’t galactic fascism she objected to, merely the particular flavor of it that would have excluded Paul. With a path in sight to grab power for her son, she’s suddenly all for it. Are we, the audience, suddenly all for it as well? Dune 2 is a long movie, and it revels in that: it’s seductive; it sucks you in, gets you on Paul’s side, as in the sequence when he calls a sandworm to ride for the first time, to demonstrate his worthiness as a member of Fremen society. It is big, bold, grand mythmaking stuff. The film prompts us to cheer his success… and it’s tough not to. But I would like to think — and it’s not that much of a stretch, really — that Villeneuve is very desperately asking his audience to recognize the cognitive dissonance that many of us will come into this film with, and possibly leave with: Can we see that this young man whom we reflexively applaud is actually, you know, a tyrant in the making? And what do we do with that realization if we do come to it? Because one of the last images of Dune: Part Two is Paul rallying the Fremen for even bigger, bloodier battles to come (whether a presumed third film materializes or not), and while the visual details of it are quite different from the Nazi-esque rally on the Harkonnen homeworld — the colors are deceptively warm, for one — it is, at its root, exactly the same vile horror, about the power of personality and propaganda to move masses. Villeneuve is fucking with us in a way that I’m not sure mainstream audiences are ready to deal with. Because real “leaders” in the real world are pulling the same shit. The stakes are so very high. Are we up to the challenge? You are wrong.  Dune is not a savior narrative of any kind. Paul does not in fact save anyone from anything.  The reason you can’t see this, is the same as the ‘fanboys’ who only know how to say ‘woke’ as they have so embraced their own limitations and refuse to grow out of them.  You have such a strong and limited that to quote Paul: You see only what you want to see. He literally walks into a culture about which all he knows is what he’s read in a book and is acclaimed as their savior. And so far, so good. It’s not going to go well, but no one knows that yet. He is acclaimed as a savior by the Fremen BECAUSE Catholic’s have proselytized for Centuries to get poor people to wait for a savior to come.  Sound familiar????? In the process of turning dessert world Dune into a paradise – he destroys the dessert and the worms, damaging the ecology…. Again sound familiar. Dune is not a savior narrative.  It is a story of the Jihad Vs. the Crusades but set in space and it is a bitter critique of the hypocrisy of religion and the folly of messiah’s and heroes. I am reviewing THIS movie. I am not reviewing the books, and I am not reviewing whatever movie might come next, if any at all. However long it takes for these movies to get to making the points you are talking about, it isn’t there yet. And this movie exists in a history of Hollywood that has centered white people, and particularly white men, for far too long. That is also a context in which it must be understood. In the novels, Paul becomes more and more a “God Emperor” or “Dune Messiah.”
And after the first sequels, Herbert realizes that each new one gushes money and they become wispier and wispier as he pumps them out. Most of the people commenting on MaryAnn’s review were talking about the book instead of the movie, although you were presumably joking when you did it. Having read all the Dune books that Frank Herbert wrote (and none of the ones that his son and Kevin J. Anderson produced after his death), I have a hard time picturing Frank pumping out sequel after sequel because they gush money.  If I remember correctly, the Atreides are supposedly of Greek ancestry, so Mediterranean in origin (of course whether this is still relevant after more than 10000 years, is another question). Herbert famously said that Dune was intended as a warning against Messianic figures, so whether this defies your interpretation of Dune as a white-savior trope is something that I leave up to you.  It is Denis Villeneuve and his production team that picked the actor for Paul, so if anyone is to blame for the white savior it is them. I think Frank Herbert was just thinking in terms of “Led By The Outsider” as a trope, which is more generic that the “white-savior” trope. And while the Fremen can be seen as stand-ins for Middle-Eastern people, I don’t think that was Frank Herbert’s intention necessarily. By placing the story so far into the future he wanted the Fremen to be a people of nondescript ethnicity, a people uniquely shaped by Arrakis. I personally think that Paul is the villain of the story and not the hero, nor the white savior: After he drinks the Water of Life and achieves the ability to see future and past clearly (with the direction of the future being defined by the choices he has and will make), he consciously make the choice to pick the path to the future that leads to his and his mother’s (and unborn sister’s) survival, even if that means unleashing a religious war on the universe in which millions or even billions will die. And those people will both be on the Fremen and non-Fremen sides. BTW: Jessica, in the ceremony where she drinks the Water of Life, is gifted with the memory of the previous Reverend Mother that was part of the Fremen, who in turn acquired the memory of her predecessor. This way Jessica is immediately fully versed in the Fremen culture. Herbert famously said that Dune was intended as a warning against Messianic figures, so whether this defies your interpretation of Dune as a white-savior trope is something that I leave up to you. Authorial intent is just one part of the puzzle… and frankly, the least important one. Things can be present in stories that authors didn’t intend, and things they intended can be missing. But again, I am reviewing this movie, not the book. No, and a quick Google search doesn’t make me any wiser, apart from listing a number of “Ma and Pa Kettle go to …” movies from the 1950’s. Nothing about Arrakis though."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE," I see possible futures all at once, and in so many futures our enemies prevail, comments Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) while sounding like the Kwisatz Haderach. His Bene Gesserit mother, confidant, and best friend Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), pregnant with Paul’s psychic sister, waits for her son to fulfill his destiny while the sandworm-riding Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) see the young man as their Mahdi or savior. Like George Lucas and Ridley Scott, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve proves himself a visionary as Dune: Part Two is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. When teenage Villeneuve read Frank Herbert’s Dune for the first time 43 years ago, he was unaware of the implications of that moment. Only someone with such profound adoration for the 1965 novel could have delivered such an ambitious, masterful, and speculative adaptation of the sci-fi classic as Dune: Part Two. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts, forge their path as the duo loosen up for the second part of the saga. They bring a fresh perspective to the material by breaking away from the novel a few times, especially with the character of Chani played by Zendaya. It translates better for the screen while allowing the actress to shine by playing a multifaceted character with alternating emotions. She’s torn between her love for Paul and what she feels is blind faith exhibited by her people. They believe Paul renamed Maud’Dib after the smart Arrakis desert mouse, is their messiah. Chani, not so much. Zendaya is first-rate as the conflicted warrior who yells This prophecy is how they enslave us! while sending shivers to the audience. Dune: Part Two picks up where the first film left off. It moves at a faster pace, there is more action, greater special effects, and a fresh group of actors joining the cast including Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Anya Taylor-Joy, Souheila Yacoub, and the saga’s biggest surprise and best addition, Austin Butler as the villainous Feyd-Rautha. Gone is Butler’s Elvis accent (it took him a while to shake it) as the actor is transformed into the ambitious warrior nephew of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Sting played the role in the 1984 version directed by David Lynch. Here, Butler is truly frightening. He moves like a tiger waiting for the right moment to pounce. The shaven head and pale complexion in contrast to the dark clothing give the actor the appearance of a cenobite forged from the mind of Clive Barker. The monochrome gladiator scene in the film stands out as Villeneuve removes the beauty of color and all visual distractions to focus on Butler’s first-rate performance. Timothée Chalamet’s portrayal as the film’s hero is better highlighted as the actor gets to take a deep dive into Paul who is torn in several directions before finally accepting his fate. The biblical overtones are omnipresent. I also enjoyed the performance by Rebecca Ferguson As Lady Jessica. Her tattooed face, incandescent eyes, and look of determination let the Swedish actress deliver a subtle performance that doesn’t require much dialogue to attain distinction. 2021’s Dune covered roughly 2/3 of Herbert’s novel setting up events for the climactic Part Two which shifts the balance in characters. Dave Bautista’s Glossu Rabban and Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother Mohiam are scaled back, while Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck comes in at the right moment to step up his role as the former House Atreides military leader proves to be Paul’s biggest supporter and friend. The VIP in the ensemble goes to Javier Bardem As Fremen Sietch Tab leader Stilgar. The Oscar-winning actor brings humor and bravado to the role. It’s a commanding performance on par with No Country for Old Men, Biutiful, and Being the Ricardos. The special effects are as expected, exhilarating and Hans Zimmer’s score which goes from haunting and ominous to a climax-building crescendo is majestic evoking a sense of awe especially when accompanied by Loire Cotler’s soul-stirring vocals. With Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, and now Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s impact on science fiction is immeasurable. There are shades of his masterpiece Sicario throughout Dune: Part Two, from the way his camera follows the actors, to the overhead shots, and his use of the score to raise tension.

"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Where it really comes into its own as a hugely satisfying Hollywood sci-fi epic is in the action-adventure material&#44; which is also backloaded&#44; so the very long film seems to keep getting bigger and richer as it goes along&#46;
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE," Faith and power clash at the core of Dune: Part Two. The film is the second of a trilogy adaptation of the beloved novels by Frank Herbert, a mystical tale of wars between noble families in the vastness of space and the rise of a messianic figure named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet).  This middle film picks up the story after a brutal massacre of Paul’s family line. Heir of a noble house and the subject of prophecies, Paul wrestles with his apparent destiny as savior and leader. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a clairvoyant priestess of the matriarchal religious order Bene Gesserit, tries to maneuver him toward that destiny. But his love, Chani (Zendaya), wants only a simple life together. Amid this relational drama, Paul leads a desert tribe in guerrilla warfare against brutal imperial forces who want to hoard his planet’s precious element called spice. Dune: Part Two is a lush adaptation of dense source material. It’s a busy 2 hours and 46 minutes, packed with plot and subplots and the constant threat of ravenous, man-eating sandworms. The space battles are an impressive mix of tension and spectacle, and the desert sand is almost its own character, functioning as both shield and weapon for the warriors Paul leads. Though combatants are armed with spacecraft and atomic weapons, many fights come down to hand-to-hand combat with swords, choreographed to be quick, powerful, and exciting. These elements make for a fun and engaging adaptation, with solid performances and beautiful cinematography. But Dune: Part Two owes its intellectual interest to Herbert’s books. Is faith merely another resource to be exploited in the quest for power? Is it another drug, like spice, that the powerful can claim, use, and abuse? Or is it real, tapping into a true well of knowledge and sustenance? The Dune series asks but doesn’t try to answer. A product of the early 1960s, Herbert’s work is deeply interested in the effects of psychedelic drugs. Spice is mildly psychedelic, opening minds to see visions and nightmares. Another substance, called the “Water of Life,” is deeply psychedelic, frequently fatal, and life-altering in its effects. The Dune stories treat these drugs as both beneficial and dangerous, a gift for those few strong enough to absorb and survive the visions they induce. That perspective feels like the product of a bygone era, strange to consider after six decades of change in our norms and laws around drug use. The book series’ take on drugs might have been provocative in 1965, but it feels dated and shallow in light of present conversations and concerns around drugs. Taking another cue from Herbert’s books, the movie’s universe is vaguely Islamic. The sand, the clothing, and even the language give it a Lawrence-of-Arabia-in-space feel. This is a Western interpretation, of course, not one originating from the Muslim world itself, and some elements, like the Bene Gesserit, are drawn more from Catholicism than anything in Islam. That kind of storytelling syncretism can be risky, but by taking elements of known faiths and throwing them into another world, Dune: Part Two raises sharp questions about religion and power. Just as in our world, there are many factions vying for control—even the factions have factions. Some are true believers, convinced that Paul Atreides is a messianic figure who will lead his people to paradise. Others, like Chani, believe in nothing but their own strength and swords. And while the believers are mocked for their ability to contort any event to become a “fulfillment” of prophecy, no one can deny the strength of their faith or the strength it gives them. Like the psychedelic spice, faith is powerful and difficult to control. The faithful become a force in themselves. That’s not to say faith always coincides with purity of heart. The Bene Gesserit priestesses, including Paul’s mother, both shape and exploit the faith of the masses. This second Dune film leaves open to interpretation whether the priestesses themselves believe what they teach or simply use it to gain power. They are both benevolent and sinister, unpredictable and ineffable. In some ways, they echo pagan gods in their selfishness and inscrutability: Their ends are their own, and the mere humans who cross them are easily sacrificed. Paul is different. He cares for the people. He eschews power—at least at first. Indeed, he fears his own power and its place in a faith he isn’t sure he shares, dreading his fundamentalist followers and the horrors they may embrace because of their belief in him. He can see the future, perhaps multiple possible futures, and his visions involve a devastating holy war waged in his name. This is repugnant to him—yet he is drawn inexorably into the fray. The parallels to Jesus are obvious and fascinating. Paul Atreides begins his journey seeming a lot like Christ: He is foretold, anticipated, believed in even before he is born. He cares for justice and peace. He is humble, loving, given to service. Like Jesus on the road to Calvary, Paul longs to avoid the dark future ahead of him.  But their paths diverge. Paul travels toward more earthly power, more control, more bloodshed. Jesus, of course, rejected that path, though his followers expected and encouraged it (Acts 1:6). He chose the cross. Paul Atreides does not. In some ways, Dune feels like an exploration of what might have been had Jesus told Peter to sharpen his sword instead of to sheathe it (Matt. 26:52–53). The lessons of Christianity are upside down in this universe: To gain your life, you do not lay it down—you take another’s life. The last do not become first. The least do not become greatest. In the end, the least are sacrificed. The meek inherit nothing. And yet here too, to gain the world, Paul Atreides must lose his soul."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE," These are uncertain times for big, ambitious science fiction films, but with the release of French Canadian auteur Denis Villeneuve’s enveloping Dune: Part Two, the sandworm has turned. In bringing his thematically rich, visually stunning, formally bifurcated adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 space opera to a finale, Villeneuve has solved a riddle that’s beguiled big-brain filmmakers from Alejandro Jodorowsky to Ridley Scott, to David Lynch, all of whom struggled to adapt Herbert’s doorstop of a novel. (Unlike the former two, Lynch actually did make his Dune, but that 1984 flop is a camp curiosity, and Lynch has disowned it, as have many devotees of Herbert’s book and its five sequels.) Villeneuve reportedly wants to a make a third entry adapting Herbert’s follow-up, Dune Messiah, but just the fact he got to finish this one feels miraculous given that its precursor, Part One, was one of the very pricey movies that Warner Bros. sent sent straight to the Streaming Service Formerly Known as HBO Max in 2021, concurrent with its theatrical release in the U.S. Urgent and compelling even to those who haven’t read or only vaguely recall Herbert’s dense far-future saga, Part Two runs a fleet 168 minutes, bringing the two halves’ combined run time to five hours, 23 minutes—none of them wasted! This latter part won’t prompt a reappraisal from anyone who complained that Part One was meandering or humorless, but this movie isn’t for them. It is largely humorless, save for a few sly line readings from Javier Bardem, and all the more absorbing for it. Bardem returns as a leader of the desert-dwelling Fremen of planet Arrakis, who are hunted by the brutal, colonizing, glabrous, and chalk-complected Harkonnen clan. The somber tone is actually a strength of the film—Villeneuve isn’t throwing in quips to try to make all this fantasy glib or palatable to civilians in the tiresome way so many superhero films of recent vintage have tried to do. Even Christopher Walken, in a handful of scenes as two-faced puppetmaster Emperor Shaddam IV, plays it straight. A world in which Game of Thrones becomes a spinoff-spawning hit is a world ready for a straight-arrow Dune, which is basically Game of Thrones meets The Godfather anyway, though the book predates both.  Anyway, that Bardem character, Stilgar, believes the prophecies claiming that Timothée Chalamet’s Byronesque Paul Atreides, who, with his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is among the last survivors of a clan sent to harvest Arrakis’ precious life-extending, consciousness-expanding substance “spice,” will become a savior to the Fremen. Younger generations of these desert dwellers—chief among them Zendaya’s Chani, whose romance with Paul adds melodramatic sweep to the movie’s abundant scope—dismiss these religious convictions as propaganda, as does Paul himself. (He’s also haunted by visions seeming to suggest he’ll become a despot—a troubling thing to learn about oneself.) Much of this ancient dogma, we learn, has been seeded over generations by the Bene Gesserit, a secretive sisterhood devoted to the enlightenment of the human species. But they play the long, long game, making their motives opaque if not sinister. (As a reminder, Paul’s own mom belongs to this intergalactic coven of maybe-good witches!) I don’t know why I’m indulging in the mortal critical sin of ladling on a plot summary here. Perhaps it’s to convince myself I actually understood a film I very much enjoyed. I think I got maybe 77 percent of it. Villeneuve (who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts) is so adept at filling the frame with tension and mystery, and at slicing away the exposition Lynch left in, that you can just let the experience wash over you. Cinematographer Greig Fraser shot the movie in IMAX, and it warrants the maximalist format.  Like his fellow Canadian visionary James Cameron, Villeneuve upped his profile by making a superb sequel to a seminal, paradigm-shifting Ridley Scott classic—Aliens in Cameron’s case, Blade Runner 2049 in Villeneuve’s. But where Cameron has chosen to spend his remaining creative years on planet Pandora, manufacturing worlds out of whole digital cloth, Villeneuve is still shooting his movies in real places. Arrakis is played (mostly) by Jordan and Abu Dhabi, and that tactile mise-en-scene yields visceral dividends. You might actually feel the sand between your toes. Lady Jessica and Paul both spend parts of Part Two in conversation with the unborn child growing inside of Jessica—a being Villeneuve actually shows floating in the womb like the Star Child at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. “This world is beyond cruelty,” her big brother tells her. Why wait until she’s actually born to let her in on what a sandy bummer it all is? Taken in tandem, Villeneuve’s grand, enveloping Dune splits the difference between Stanley Kubrick’s chilly exploration of human evolution and the pulpy Star Wars flicks that George Lucas fashioned out of Herbert’s novels, Akira Kurosawa movies, and ’60s Marvel Comics. Butler, playing the sociopathic young nephew of corpulent Harkonnen in Chief Stellan Skarsgård, exhibits a heretofore unseen range, affecting an uncanny impression of the Swedish actor’s voice. For a guy who got famous playing the King, he makes a pretty good prince. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE," Fanaticism is a closed circle, maddening because it’s impregnable, maddening because it destroys everything in the process of building itself. It’s a riddle without a solution, and once you’ve drunk deep the plasma spring, it’s a long way back–if you ever get there. There are people who “deprogram” cult members, but I don’t buy it, you guys. I’m of the belief that when you’re gone, you’re gone. You went by choice, after all. You denied your ears the beeswax but didn’t tie yourself to the mast. My mom bought into a cult for the last several years of her life. She held on to it tightly, and it gripped her right back. I suppose that’s one of the appealing things about cults: when you find the right one, you join the company of a great many people who agree with you. If you’re broken in some way, if your awareness of that has made you lonesome and alone, that must feel good. I take a little bit of the blame for her susceptibility to such things. I was a terrible son to her. Maybe she needed something to hold that would hold her back; I did, too. I found it in a wonderful wife and kids. She found it, some of it, in a cult that finally accepted her. I don’t know if I believe that. I don’t know what I believe. Maybe this is just narcissism–mine or hers, I don’t know either. But she’s dead now, and I’m the only one left to wonder about what happened between us. Throughout the entire extended running time of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Part Two, messianic rebel and Lawrence of Arabia orientalist leader Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) refuses to court the support of millions of “southern fundamentalist” fighters because he knows that once he does, he will become the colonialist monster his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), has hoped he will be. She’s part of a cult, you see, the Bene Gesserit, which has spread a story about the coming of a white god to the brown lands and brown people that has taken hold in the brutal southern hemisphere of a planet, Arrakis, treasured and vied over for its natural resources. The allegory, proximate and ultimate, isn’t subtle. Paul falls in love with an indigenous fighter, Chani (Zendaya), learns the language and the ways, and is given a name by his chief advocate, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), both secret (“Usul,” meaning the foundation of a column in the film’s made-up language) and known (“Muad’dib,” after a small desert mouse that is resourceful enough to survive the harshest elements). No matter what Paul does to try to convince Stilgar he is a man and not the Quetzalcoatl to Stilgar’s Montezuma, it’s more evidence in Stilgar’s mind that Paul is, in fact, the fulfillment of an implanted colonial prophecy designed to control his people and the resource–a psychotropic spice called “melange” that allows for instant space-travel in this universe–unique to his planet. That’s the nature of fanaticism, cults, religions: whatever evidence you provide to disprove it becomes proof of it. It is a closed, peristaltic circle. Ouroboros, the worm devouring itself. I think sometimes not about how the worm eats but how it is never sated. The worm is insatiable. Dune Part Two isn’t perfect. I’m not convinced by either of its young leads beyond that they look the part; I’m not convinced that one is the leader of men, and I’m not convinced the other has the depth and mystery to win his heart. Maybe I’ve aged out of being able to see these qualities in the very young. More fatally, in the pursuit of clarity, I’m not convinced the picture doesn’t fall over too often into oversimplification. But the overall effect–landing as the movie does while Gaza is martyred to the genocidal impulses of a Zionist colonization machine allied with an international cabal of white nationalists (note how fish-belly pale the villainous, 1930s-Berlin leather-daddy Harkonnen are, and how in this one, Paul says, “We are all Harkonnen,” and laughs a bitter kind of laughter)–is devastating. I wonder if the film doesn’t actually work better because its hero is swallowed whole by the monstrousness of his position. It is an epically-scaled tentpole from a major studio spending millions of dollars to tell the story of a messianic leader with vengeance on his lips who pulls his power from fundamentalists manipulated by his mother’s cult to bring about genocide, famine, death, and war. Plague? That, too, it’s suggested, via a series of visions Paul endures showing a man in his death throes as his mother glides past, beautiful and pure and not, as she is in the bulk of the film, a filthy Lady Macbeth hunched in secret war council with her unborn child, speaking to her in unsettling intravenous close-ups from inside her womb. Dune Part Two is almost more the companion piece to Alex Garland’s upcoming Civil War than its own first part–both films landing in the first third of 2024 like diving bells made brittle in the oceans of our fear and self-loathing this election year. How could we have painted ourselves into this humiliating moral corner? There’s no moral “out” left for us, not anymore, you mad fucking idiots. Best possible choice? The lesser of two evils? We don’t have choice. There isn’t a lesser evil. The worm is overfed and still insatiable."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE," 
In the wake of the superhero boom, it takes a lot to persuade me to see a big-budget epic in which the protagonist strolls away from explosions. But I read Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic Dune at a tender age and saw the David Lynch version on its 1984 release, so I couldn't stay away from the 2021 adaptation of the novel's first half by Québécois director Denis Villeneuve — or its sequel. Anyway, Dune: Part One ended on a cliff-hanger, so here we are.
 
Previously on Dune: It's the far future, but people still duel with swords. Everybody wants to control the planet Arrakis, source of the psychotropic substance called spice, which makes interstellar travel possible. The emperor (Christopher Walken) orders the Atreides family to take charge of the planet, only to double-cross them in concert with their enemy, the loathsome Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). With the head of the family dead, teenage heir Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mom, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), escape into the desert and find refuge with the Indigenous Fremen.
 
In the second film, our protagonists learn to survive in a hostile landscape inhabited by mammoth, hungry sandworms. Leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes in a prophecy that Paul will lead the Fremen to paradise, not knowing that said prophecy was seeded on Arrakis by the Bene Gesserit, the esoteric religious (and somewhat superpowered) order to which Jessica belongs. Stilgar strong-arms Jessica into drinking a brain-opening substance called the ""water of life"" and becoming the tribe's spiritual leader. Young warrior Chani (Zendaya) doesn't trust the outsiders who have always exploited her world, but Paul wins her over with boyish charm and humility.
 
Paul and the Fremen engage in guerrilla warfare against the ruling Harkonnens, causing shake-ups off-planet, where the emperor, the baron, the Bene Gesserit and others play high-stakes games of court politics. Everything is headed toward a showdown. But will Paul really lead the Fremen to paradise or only use them to start a bloody galactic revenge crusade?
 
As sword-wielding epics go, Dune is less like Star Wars than ""Game of Thrones."" There are bad guys — the Harkonnens are almost comically evil, portrayed here with liberal use of Nazi imagery — but there aren't many good guys. Or good girls, for that matter. Everybody who isn't bloodthirstily fighting is ruthlessly scheming, from the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) to the emperor's demure daughter (Florence Pugh). Even Paul, our supposed hero, struggles with a will to power that pushes him inexorably toward violent ends.
 
While the screenplay by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts takes great pains to lay out Paul's internal conflict, his character never comes fully to life on-screen. He's weighed down by enormous symbolic baggage, making this a thankless role to play. Herbert's stiff dialogue defeated Kyle MacLachlan in 1984, and Chalamet doesn't have much better luck with it. He comes off as more callow than committed to the role's solemnity, as if he might be tempted to break character and start giggling (and you can't always blame him).
 
The film's real center of gravity is its spectacle, the craft with which Villeneuve and his crew depict Herbert's stupendously complex worlds. The desert landscape of Arrakis has a delicacy and viscerality that recall the days of George Lucas' Tatooine. In aerial shots, it has a sculpted beauty; up close, the sand flying in our faces feels convincing. The sequence in which Paul first rides a sandworm is harrowing and exhilarating; regardless of how much CGI went into it, the stunt looks genuinely hard. The scene is dreamlike and fantastical, but it doesn't have the frustrating weightlessness of so many superhero films.
 
The dream becomes a nightmare in equally visually thrilling scenes set on Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld. We meet the sociopathic counterpart to Paul, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), in a gladiatorial arena straight out of Spartacus. The whole world is captured in an eerie, airless black and white that suggests an '80s music video circle of hell, where people wear a lot of vinyl and chains — and kill for fun.
 
With alternatives like these, it's not hard to sympathize with the Fremen, even as they transform from scrappy survivors into fanatics. By the film's climax, both Paul and Jessica have been infected with galaxy brain — a phenomenon Herbert seems to have foreseen — and the audience may be worn out. A strategic change to the book's ending, however, promises juicy conflict to come.
 
Dune is a heady brew, but its overweening ambition and weirdness are antidotes to the four-quadrant calculation of so many modern blockbusters. I'll be back for more.
 
Dune (1984; Max, rentable): Lynch's compressed adaptation of the novel is lacking in many ways. But its steampunk-meets-punk-rock aesthetic clearly influenced Villeneuve's version, and as I watched Part Two, I found myself remembering moments in the earlier film that deserve to be called iconic. You can't beat Sting as Feyd-Rautha.
 
Arrival (2016; Paramount+, Peacock, Showtime, rentable): I'm a fan of Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and Blade Runner 2049, but this moody, thoughtful adaptation of a Ted Chiang story about extraterrestrial communication is still my favorite Villeneuve movie.

"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,It's impressive filmmaking.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE," Director/writer Denis Villeneuve knows how to make a throw-down sci-fi epic. He proved that with his captivating production Dune (2021), which won six 2022 Oscars® for cinematography, production design, visual effects, sound, editing and score. As audiences contemplate this sequel, they’ll expect the visuals, sounds and pacing to be near perfect. But what about the storyline (script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts), will it be profound?  And how will he treat that heady mix of pageantry and action. Will he reach higher than before? For the first hour, that’s in doubt. Depth and exhilaration are missing. Trying to figure out who is who, who hates who and why the factions are so pissed off is a chore. But there’s a big payoff. Wait for it.  Sometime in the far future, after a climate disaster, water is scarce and sacred. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, Wonka), the son of a murdered duke, and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning) duck and hide among the sand dunes on the remote planet Arrakis. They’re being shepherded by a group of indigenous rebel fighters, the Fremen, led by the warrior Stilgar (Javier Bardem, No Country for Old Men). Meanwhile, Paul has a budding relationship with one of the tribe’s members, Chani (Zendaya, Spider-Man: No Way Home). They have love in their eyes, but she also has trust issues with the ambitious interloper.  At the one-hour mark, the protagonists, their idiosyncrasies and relationships are established. The Fremen’s suspicions of Paul wane, and he takes on an entirely different role in their hierarchy. Even more important, the brutality of the Harkonnen evolves. Viewers are taken to their netherworld. Away from the earth tones of Arrakis, to the stark black and white images of a futuristic land run by the venomously evil and very plump Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, Mamma Mia!). The ruthless Emperor badgers his chief lieutenant Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) to stop the Fremen from ruining his extraction of spice. Standing in the wings is the Baron’s scheming nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, Elvis), a heartless and conniving fiend who is so white, he looks like he doesn’t have blood in his veins. When the audience gets an extended view of the enemy, and its scheming palace intrigue, finally the clash between good and evil becomes fever pitch. The stakes in conflicts are clear. Action sequences intensify with arena fights, war combat and killings. On screen for all to view are impeccably choregraphed stunts and battle scenes. Enough to make any sci-fi head, with a lust for movement and mayhem, salivate.  All those important themes are side issues, subplots, background details. At the heart of the script are human feelings, impulses and passion. Young people in love. Family intrigue. Cunning Reverend Mothers. Good people fighting evildoers. Greed. Vengeance. Jealousy. Power grabs. Deep-seated animal instincts. Complex behaviors.  Villeneuve is a master at creating and controlling this futuristic world. Great tastes. A great sense of drama, passion and motion. This is adventure filmmaking at a very high level. Engaging, breathtaking, ambitious and filled with grandeur. It’s like he’s reaching for the sky.  In her interpretation of the courageous Chani, Zendaya finds the conflicting emotions and altruistic motivation that guide her. Baron is evil incarnate because Skarsgård makes him so. And it’s hard to believe that the blanched white evil nephew with the glistening bald head is Austin Butler. From the movie Elvis! What a 180-degree turn. If the devil was a man, this is what he’d look and act like. Butler masterfully creates this trickery, aided by the voodoo magic of a top-notch makeup department. "
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Whether you think you're interested in a sci-fi or not, this is a powerful and quite beautiful reminder of what a stunning medium cinema can still be, when enough ambition, intelligence, artistry – and money – all come together in the same place. Bravo."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL," There is much to discuss about Part Two of Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” adaptation, including a deep dive on “worm juice” in spoiler talk. Plus, Rd. 2 matchups in ‘50s Madness. "
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part One was my favourite film of 2021. I was captivated by its visuals, its scope, its scale and the depth of its story. As someone who has not read Frank Herbert's seminal novel, I was not sure what to expect but the results blew me away. Now, three years later is the follow-up, or more succinctly, Part Two of the story. Director Denis Villeneuve has over the last few years firmly established himself as Hollywood's premier visual director delivering epic sci-fi films such as the aforementioned Dune, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival, and Dune: Part Two continues this trend with a grandeur that is nothing short of breathtaking. Somehow, Part Two manages to up the ante in every aspect, including performances, to deliver an unforgettable experience. In all honesty, I did not watch Dune: Part Two, I experienced it. From the beautiful majesty of its visuals to the awe-inspiring sound design and the fantastic production design, this film was an absolute joy to behold. The story this time around focuses on larger and deeper thematic strands, continuing the story of Part One and taking it to new and exciting (and also dark) places as we continue following our lead Paul Atreides, played with confident steel by Timothée Chalamet. The full, star-studded cast has a part to play and they play it with such enthusiasm and confidence, especially Zendaya as the warrior Chani, who is given far more to do this time around, and Austin Butler in an unrecognisable and memorable turn as the villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. Though Villeneuve is absolutely a visual director, there are plenty of smaller character moments that pay off handsomely by the end of the movie. Though it could be argued that the final twenty minutes of the movie were rushed, and I can't disagree, the finale felt like a more than satisfying conclusion to this movie story and a tantalising follow-up to the next film in the saga, Dune Messiah. Without spoiling anything in this film, the messiah aspect of the third instalment will be key as Part Two deals with a messianic revolution bumping up against more grounded (see: less religious) principles and ideas, and the ramifications of every related decision which will prove significant going forward. Dune: Part Two is a thrilling, exciting, heavy, and intelligent science fiction film that should be celebrated for years to come. It will be hard for any other film this year to top the majesty, scale, and epicness of Dune: Part Two, and, yes, this could potentially become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made if Dune Messiah sticks its landing. Time will tell, but whatever the outcome, Dune: Part Two is a film that deserves to be remembered and lauded. Blumhouse's terrible recent output has included Night Swim and Five Nights at Freddy's (and many would happily include The Exorcist: Believer into the mix), and, cutting to the chase, Imaginary can be added to the list. In fact, Imaginary tops the list of Blumhouse's failures as this is simply a dreadful film. Imaginary is the type of bland, banal, uninspired and lazy horror film that is becoming common in the genre as a way of gaining a quick buck for minor output - but this could be a new low. How this received a 15 rating in the UK from the BBFC is beyond me as nothing happens. Literally. Chauncey - the bear in the marketing - does nothing, one person dies off-screen, and there are a few hokey jumpscares, but, other than that, it's a poorly acted slog about a new family wading through generic drama as Alice (Braun), the weird young kid, bonds and speaks to a teddy bear for about an hour. It then becomes a cheap-looking attempt to capture the magic of older, better horror flicks with a crazed, abysmal Betty Buckley gurning and shouting for the camera. In an attempt to...get Chauncey the bear over (?), they namecheck him so many times that it becomes a parody and they provide him with a warped version of Alice's voice which was nothing short of hilarious (a mid-movie therapy session provided a good belly laugh due to this). I felt for DeWanda Wise here as she tries, she really tries, to sell what she is asked to do and she is a likeable presence in the film as the stepmother who just wants to bond with her new family, but nothing is saving this. Not even Tom Payne's middle-class English rockstar (who plays the world's most oblivious father before he departs the entire movie to go on tour) adds anything. How this narrative ended the way it did is mind-boggling - who in their right mind would conjure this up and look proudly at it, smiling like a new parent, and declare it fit for humans to endure? Hopefully, Blumhouse can get back on track this year, though their next scheduled release is a remake of the excellent Speak No Evil so who knows what they'll do with that? Imaginary may work as a gateway horror, but even then it could traumatise people who then move on to stronger horror like Madame Web. There is nothing redeemable about this, and it's one of the worst horror films I've seen in years. I'm left imagining the utopia I lived in before seeing Imaginary, as it was an infinitely better time. Move over Valek, there’s a new nun in town. Sydney Sweeney’s Sister Cecilia is the latest ass-kicking agent of God ready to throw down with the worst that Hell can offer. Actually, no she isn’t. Michael Mohan’s Immaculate is a religious horror that is not in keeping with recent offerings, such as The Nun films and Prey for the Devil, in that our lead is not fighting demons or the possessed.  Instead, she is dealing with a miracle - an immaculate conception - following her transfer from her closed parish in the States to a secluded convent in picturesque Italy -and as the story progresses, it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems in the sprawling, echo-filled convent lit mainly by candles and atmosphere. Immaculate is a solid slow-burn horror until it takes a turn in the final fifteen minutes where it leans fully into its gonzo nature, channelling the New French Extremity subgenre of years past and delivering a finale that feels bolder than most in recent years. Sydney Sweeney continues her recent dabbling in different genres and delivers a strong overall performance despite an admittedly rocky opening act, leading to an all-in virtuoso final one-take sequence. It should be said that, narratively, Immaculate isn’t necessarily providing anything original, however, its dedication to atmosphere, scares and impressive gore keeps this entertaining for the entirety of its brisk runtime. That was my main takeaway from the film, for a story dealing with heavy subjects and imagery, I found myself simply enjoying what I was watching. The filmmakers were able to move between moods deftly and I never felt an imbalance in tone - though I do believe an extra ten minutes (or so) in the final third would have eased its slightly frantic feel, or maybe the chaotic nature was just what the film needed to end on. Either way, Immaculate was an unexpected curveball given the major recent genre and subgenre outputs. Effectively crafted with an unnerving score from Will Bates, it felt bold at times, and patient at others leading to its gonzo finale. Sweeney is impressive here, and, though it may not be perfect, it was nuntheless a lot of fun - surprisingly, too. For the majority of my life, bustin’ has made me feel good. Great, in fact. I’ve been a fan of Ghostbusters since I was a kid way back when, and it has been so good to see the franchise back on the big screen again following 2016’s Answer the Call and 2021’s wonderful Afterlife. While 1984’s original classic was a snarky satire on small businesses and the supernatural horror genre, that hasn’t stopped Sony from expanding on its humble roots. Now, in 2024, we have Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Directed by Gil Kenan, this is the first film in the main continuity not directed by a Reitman - though Jason remains on board as a writer - and finds the whole gang from Afterlife, OGs included, back in New York City to bust a chilly ancient villain, Garakka, who is hellbent on claiming the city (and the world) as his frozen empire. The trailers promised something bigger than before and Frozen Empire is certainly bigger, but unfortunately, it is not better. It is absolutely an enjoyable romp, but one that is overstuffed and a world away from 1984’s original in terms of tone, vibe, and attempts at a grounded feel (yes, ghosts, walking statues and marshmallow men exist, hear me out). Where that film, and Ghostbusters II, succeeded was in keeping things focused on our crew, the schlubs who were just like us, but everyone involved worked with the tools they had - Frozen Empire takes wild detours that explicitly bring the supernatural to the human characters, and it is to the detriment of the story. The story itself is bursting at the seams from the beginning, with too many characters and too much happening. There are new villains, old characters, a focus on Phoebe's emotional arc, a new ghost-busting laboratory, and much more. As a result of trying to give every member of the cast something to work with, no character has a chance to stand out fully, and the story suffers. The characters and performances are all fine enough, Grace is again very good as Phoebe - though her main subplot (featuring a solid Lind) was horribly disappointing - and Rudd, Aykroyd, and Nanjiani provide strong supporting performances but the sheer volume of characters means no one has a chance to stand out fully. Murray, Oswalt, Hudson, Kim, Coon - all get fun moments but it becomes a mess by the time the big Marvel-esque showdown arrives complete with a fully CGI villain. Gozer and Vigo worked so well because they were played by actors on set, they felt authentic, but here the fear factor was lost despite Garakka’s great visual look. Now, there were plenty of great gags and quips throughout - Murray and Nanjiani were having a blast - alongside some fun scenes of bustin’ ghosts (including some cool new ghosts) and smaller character moments, so Frozen Empire isn’t a flop or a write-off. Far from it, it is very watchable and enjoyable but it is unfocused. The franchise seems geared firmly towards families now as its key demographic, which is fine as my daughter loved it, and this felt like the true start of passing the torch along. The supernatural horror parody is gone, and the snarky satire of politics and upstart business is gone, replaced by a direction that feels more blockbuster-focused. Kenan and co. aimed for something different, a risk which should be commended, but it didn’t entirely work leaving Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire as a fun but highly flawed effort."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE," When Dune: Part Two (2024) opens with the commandment “Power over Spice is power over all”, for one brief moment, there is an unexpected synergy between Dune creator and science-fiction legend Frank Herbert, writer-director Denis Villeneuve, and the Indian grandmama who is the custodian of heirloom masala recipes. After all, if there is anyone who will agree about the importance of spice, it is she who has mastered Indian cuisine and knows how food can be used to nudge others to do your bidding (which is precisely the point of The Voice in the Dune universe). Ironically what Dune: Part Two goes on to falter at are two things that stereotypically grandmothers (particularly desi ones) have been excellent at: Storytelling and adding drama to any situation. The sequel to Dune: Part One (2021) mostly follows Herbert’s recipe — there are only a few deliberate and significant changes — to serve us a dish that is grand, lavish and made with the finest ingredients, but is just a little bland. (Ok fine, no more food or cooking metaphors. Grandmama, exit left.) Dune: Part Two begins strongly, trusting the audience to remember where the first film ended and taking us into the desert planet Arrakis which is once again under House Harkonnen since the fall of House Atreides.  Much like at the start of Dune: Part One, this time too the Harkonnen spice-mining mission is plagued by guerrilla attacks carried out by the indigenous Fremen of Arrakis. Only now, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his pregnant mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are with the Fremen, strengthening their ranks. Some Fremen, like the endearing Stilgar (Javier Bardem), believe Paul is their messiah. Others, like Chani (Zendaya), acknowledge Paul is a gifted warrior, but the idea of him being a creature of prophecy is something Chani chafes against. She dreams of Fremen being led by one of their own rather than an outsider. For Paul, the idea of being the Kwisatz Haderach — a super-being born as a result of the careful breeding programmes carried out by the religious order of the Bene Gesserit — also feels uncomfortable. Yet the boy who told his father he didn’t want the burden of being the future of House Atreides in Dune: Part One now wrestles with a harder, more mature desire for revenge. To be able to command an army of hardy Fremen is a temptation that’s hard to resist when you want to take on an emperor (even if that emperor is a rather lost-looking Christopher Walken). Meanwhile, growing inside Jessica is a sinister, magical baby girl who talks to Jessica and is actively plotting Paul’s ascent to power.  None of this should feel boring, especially when it’s being brought to life by a director as gifted as Villeneuve and a cast that has the luxury of squandering talented actors like Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux in minor roles. To Villeneuve’s credit, there are strands of Dune: Part Two that are fascinating, like Jessica’s conversations with her unborn daughter. Fans of the books will perhaps miss the chance to see the “Abomination” — we do get a glimpse of Ana Taylor Joy as Alia. However, she doesn’t get any real action in this film — but Ferguson is magnificent as the manic and determined Reverend Mother, especially when she has whispered conversations with the foetus whose ancestral memories are sparked into being after Jessica drinks the magical (and poisonous) Water of Life. Zendaya as the proud and stubbornly rational Chani is also a joy to watch in a role that has been considerably expanded by Villeneuve’s screenplay. The way she grapples with her love for Paul and the politics she believes in, makes Chani all the more charismatic. Unfortunately, Zendaya and Ferguson are only supporting characters in this saga. The burden of this epic rests on Paul and the spectacles that Villeneuve conjures as he realises Herbert’s imaginings onto the big screen. In visual terms, the imagery of Dune: Part Two is often stunning, but it doesn’t feel as impactful as what cinematographer Greig Fraser and the special effects team were able to achieve in the first film. Chalamet, though luminous in moments, doesn’t consistently seem up to the challenge of helming this space opera. Part of the problem is that there are no credible stumbling blocks on Paul’s path to greatness. It’s too obvious that Paul is the story’s overarching hero and in an effort to make a credible messianic leader out of the slight and baby-faced Chalamet, all the challenges that Paul faces are rendered toothless. There’s never any doubt that the Fremen who are initially sceptical about Paul will become fans or that Paul is going to win every duel. Even when all the Great Houses come to vanquish him and the Emperor himself shows up, the climax feels like an obvious setup to showcase Paul’s awesomeness. Obstacles are tackled easily, challenges take little effort to neutralise, and nothing feels powerful enough to truly challenge Paul. Villeneuve throws gigantic sandworms at us, takes us to the Harkonnen’s monochrome planet, brings in visions of a terrible war, and has Chalamet and Zendaya canoodle, but it’s not enough to make Dune: Part Two feel gripping. Considering Villeneuve’s love for complex and unnerving subjects, it’s ironic that Dune: Part Two feels like a straightforward story about a hero coming into his own, rather than a saga of entangled ambitions and thwarted stratagems. It’s tempting to wonder how much more interesting Dune: Part Two would have felt if Villeneuve had let Bene Gesserit hold on to its air of matriarchal menace and the film had spent more time exploring the possibilities hinted at when the Bene Gesserit disclose Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is part of the order’s elaborate breeding plan. Despite Butler’s billing, Villeneuve doesn’t let Feyd-Rautha grow into a credible threat and even though there are obvious parallels between Feyd-Rautha and Paul, the film isn’t able to establish a strong enough connection between the two characters. A contest between Chalamet and Butler could have been a mesmerising watch, but even though there are scenes that allow Butler to play a flamboyant villain and Chalamet to present himself as a ruthless man, neither actor is able to make enough of an impact. In the books, we’re told that the religious order’s original plan was that the Kwisatz Haderach would manifest in the child born to an Atreides daughter, fathered by none other than Feyd-Rautha. (Jessica’s decision to have a son and train him in the Bene Gesserit ways disrupts these plans, as we were told in Dune: Part One.) Paul and Feyd-Rautha’s duel is a contest between two possible futures, two men who are simultaneously drawn to and repelled by one another. None of this comes through in Dune: Part Two, which presents Feyd-Rautha only as the Bene Gesserit’s back-up plan if Paul doesn’t step up to the role they’ve assigned to him. When the two finally come face to face, the most dramatic part of Paul and Feyd-Rautha’s fight is the bald pate versus an enviable head of curls. Sinister, hairless and eyebrow-less, Butler flares quivering nostrils and grits his impressive jaw to impress upon us how much he’s acting, but like Chalamet’s attempts at roaring, the effect is limited. "
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE," The second part of director Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's landmark sci-fi novel is simply awe-inspiring. It begins with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), hiding out in the desert of Arrakis. The spice-rich planet is coveted by their vicious Harkonnen enemies and Christopher Walken's scheming galactic Emperor. The story follows Paul's odyssey from guerrilla fighter to a reluctant messiah plagued by dreams of a destiny that could ignite a holy war. Once again, Chalamet impresses. He shares affecting romantic scenes with warrior Chani (Zendaya), and convinces as a steely leader ready to wreak vengeance on Stellan Skarsgard's brutal Baron. Fresh faces in the cast include Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux, plus Austin Butler as a formidable new adversary, who's introduced in a mesmerising monochrome sequence. As with the Oscar-winning first instalment, Villeneuve shows mastery of scale and scope, with stunning cinematography and a thumping score from Hans Zimmer. There are also excellent special effects and stirring action, not least Paul wrangling an enormous sandworm in a breathtaking rush through the dunes."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part One completely blew me away in 2021. I loved every second of it. As a fan of the wider book series, I was left awestruck by how director Denis Villeneuve brought the hostile yet beautiful world of Arrakis to life, and how deftly he handled the complex and generation-spanning story.  But Dune also left me with a lot of fear. Yes, I know, fear is the mind-killer--however it was justified. The second half of Frank Herbert's original 1965 novel is where things really kick into overdrive. Paul Atreides buries himself in the sandy world of the Fremen and quickly ascends to become their messiah, well and truly kicking off the fight for Dune.

Picking up from the instant its predecessor left off, Dune: Part Two brings viewers back into the shoes of Paul (played by Timothée Chalamet) shortly after he defeated Jamis in a fight to the death.  Over the ensuing 2 hours 20 minutes (or thereabouts), viewers are welcomed - like Paul - into the world of the Fremen. How they live, how they survive, and what living on Arrakis really means to them. Along this journey, Paul's position as the Kwisatz Haderach, the Lisan al Gaib (a messianic figure with the gift of foresight and limited prescience) becomes better known in the wider community. Religious fanatics fight for him, while non-believers shun his existence. Throughout this plot thread, Chalamet delivers a perfect rendition of a boy with - quite literally - the fate of the entire galaxy on his shoulders. he is constantly tortured by the acts of hatred and prejudice being carried out on his people, the Fremen, while also being overcome with the terror of the impending holy crusade those same people will carry out in his name. Chalamet was glorious in Dune: Part One - but he left the movie and carried out the work all franchise actors ought to. He thought about his character's arc and changed his performance in Part Two as a result. Everything he does has more weight, more angst, more dedication; watching him is a joy. Chalamet is magnetic as Paul, and I cannot wait to see his story continue to unfold in Dune: Messiah. Beside Paul along this excruciating journey is Chani, his lover and confidant, played by Zendaya. The Spider-Man star was marketed as a major part of Dune: Part One, but ultimately ended up as the focus of various flashbacks, flashforwards, and a lot of tension-building. With an Odeon Limitless membership, you can watch every film as often as you like for a flat monthly fee. Not only that, but Limitless members also get access to screenings for unreleased movies as well as 10% off food and drink! In Dune: Part Two, she is a major part of the story - and the film is all the better for it. During the picture, Chani witnesses the rise of this new messiah firsthand, and as it snowballs out of control, her fear is palpable. She stoically, heavily, and with visible pain tells Paul how dangerous his path is, and how he ought to stray from it - but it seems his fate has already been set in stone. Zendaya does a beautiful job of demonstrating Chani's battle between her head and heart across the picture.  As a result, Zendaya delivers a powerful performance; a bout of simmering anger, desperation, and forlorn hope as the man she loves struggles with things she can't fully comprehend. This is easily Zendaya's best on-screen performance to date, and her future in the series will no doubt expand into further joy. There are several new characters introduced into the politics of Dune: Part Two, as well. Florence Pugh plays the universe's politically-charged Princess Irulan; Léa Seydoux is the scheming Lady Margot Fenring; but none make quite the impact that Austin Butler does. A lot of hype - on and offscreen - surrounded the new antagonist, Feyd-Rautha, played by the Elvis Presley doppelgänger. Before the villain is even seen on screen, other characters describe him as a madman, vicious, more. When he finally enters stage right, he lives up to these rumours - but not much else. Butler is legitimately scary as Feyd-Rautha; a monstrous evildoer with nothing but hatred on his to-do list. So then, perhaps his performance is ultimately successful, but there isn't much else to latch on to with Butler. Feyd-Rautha carries out heinous and awful actions for the sake of it, struggling to create a well-rounded and compelling villain. Perhaps I need another watch (or four), but Butler was the only part of Dune: Part Two I doubted as the credits rolled. Director Denis Villeneuve has, once again, built a world that not only feels viscerally realistic, but also looks beautiful, stark, and begs to be explored further. When the Canadian maestro finally brings the series' third movie (Dune: Messiah) to the big screen, Dune: Part Two will no doubt be considered one of the best films of the trilogy, and indeed one of the most incredible pieces of cinema in recent memory. It is this generation's rival for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It trumps Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back as the king of modern science-fiction. Dune: Part Two is not only one of the greatest science-fiction pictures of all time, it is one of the best films ever made. Dune: Part Two is the new gold standard for sci-fi movies, and an exciting new direction for Villeneuve, Chalamet, Zendaya, and everyone involved.

"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE," Dirigido por Denis Villeneuve. Roteiro de Denis Villeneuve e Jon Spaihts. Com: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Dave Bautista, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, Babs Olusanmokun, Souheila Yacoub, Roger Yuan, Giusi Merli, Alison Halstead, Anya Taylor-Joy, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling e Christopher Walken.  “Você quer controlar um povo? Diga a ele que um messias virá e eles esperarão”, diz Chani em certo momento de Duna: Parte 2. Ciente de que o próprio amado é uma figura messiânica em potencial que adia a própria ascensão por temer o resultado que esta traria, a jovem não permite que seus sentimentos obscureçam a consciência de que as “profecias” sobre um “salvador” fazem parte de uma estratégia de dominação colocada em prática pela mãe do protagonista, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), e que mesmo as possíveis consequências positivas da liderança de Paul Atreides (Chalamet) empalideceriam diante do fato de que um estrangeiro assumiu este papel em vez de algum nativo. Sem a obrigação de ter que apresentar o universo criado por Frank Herbert em seu livro original, já que este trabalho já havia sido feito na ótima Parte 1, o cineasta Denis Villeneuve e seu co-roteirista Jon Spaihts podem concentrar esta continuação no desenvolvimento da dinâmica entre os personagens e seus interesses, abordando as intrigas políticas palacianas, os diversos planos concebidos por cada Casa (Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino) e pelo culto Bene Gesserit, os conflitos internos destes grupos e, ainda mais importante, a instrumentalização das crenças religiosas em prol de uma causa. Demonstrando como a Fé é uma motivadora poderosa, Duna sabe que é muito mais fácil mover um povo convencendo-o de que é o “escolhido” e que, portanto, uma disputa geográfica não é uma simples luta por terra, mas por algo infinitamente maior. Esta é uma percepção que a Princesa Irulan (Pugh), filha do Imperador (Walken), detém com clareza e que a move a aconselhar o pai a lidar com os conflitos no planeta Arrakis com cautela em vez de com força bruta, já que só há uma coisa mais perigosa que um líder religioso: um mártir. Pupila da Reverenda Madre Mohiam (Rampling), Irulan aos poucos se dá conta da dimensão da manipulação da líder das Bene Gesserit, cujos desígnios encontram como obstáculo os interesses particulares de uma de suas representantes, Lady Jessica, que se mostra determinada a convencer os Fremen (habitantes nativos de Arrakis) de que Paul – ou Muad´Dib ou Mahdi ou Usul ou Lisan al Gaib ou Kwisatz Haderach – é o Messias, um projeto que inicia de modo calculista ao focar a princípio naqueles que demonstram medo ou uma personalidade fragilizada. O curioso é como o mais resistente a esta ideia é o próprio Paul, que insiste em negar este papel – o que, evidentemente, os crentes enxergam como sendo uma demonstração de humildade que serviria como mais uma prova de que ele é um enviado divino. Neste sentido, por sinal, a performance de Javier Bardem é fundamental para que percebamos este processo, já que a natureza calorosa e forte do sujeito aos poucos é substituída por uma postura de adoração que o transforma em um seguidor passivo e fanático disposto a morrer pelo “Lisan al Gaib” – e é assustador constatar como alguém antes tão disposto a questionar figuras de poder pode se tornar tão subserviente e acrítico. Em contrapartida, a Chani vivida por Zendaya compreende plenamente este risco, não hesitando em virar-lhe as costas ao vê-lo abraçar um papel tão maniqueísta. Já Timothée Chalamet, apesar das críticas de alguns à sua aparente inexpressividade, comprova como o tom monocórdio de sua voz e o olhar vazio funcionam como contraponto eficaz ao volume elevado e à modulação raivosa com que se expressa após beber a Água da Vida e aceitar a condição de Messias (por falar nisso, aproveito para mencionar a imitação impecável que Austin Butler faz de Stellan Skarsgård em sua composição vocal, o que se revela uma escolha divertida e eficiente). Contando com uma direção de arte assinada por Patrice Vermette que faz jus à complexidade daquele universo, Duna: Parte 2 é hábil ao estabelecer visuais radicalmente diferentes para cada planeta e até ao retratar regiões diferentes de um mesmo mundo: se o norte de Arrakis é repleto de ambientes que surgem como imensas cavernas adaptadas aos propósitos dos Fremen, por exemplo, o sul é apresentado como uma região com edificações, remetendo a cidades projetadas mais tradicionalmente (ainda que sem abandonar a estética rochosa) – e o templo colossal no qual Paul se dirige aos fiéis no final do segundo ato é marcante ao trazer aberturas que permitem que diversos fachos de luz se projetem sobre sua arena central como uma confirmação divina do que vemos ali. Enquanto isso, o planeta dos Harkonnen aparece como uma imagem em negativo em seus ambientes externos, como se o sol que o ilumina sugasse todas as cores, convertendo todos em estátuas de mármore, sendo especialmente fascinante notar como os fogos de artifício se tornam explosões de tinta preta contra o céu branco. (E mesmo que espaços escuros e opressivos não sejam exatamente originais como lar de vilões, não há como negar sua eficácia narrativa.) Para completar, os equipamentos construídos e utilizados pelos personagens soam orgânicos às suas culturas (como as naves que remetem a insetos) e adequadamente envelhecidos pelo uso, sendo também interessante observar, por exemplo, como o conceito de um papiro como mídia para envio de mensagens é adaptado para se apresentar como um tubo de metal com as palavras gravadas em sua superfície, mantendo uma natureza que remete a algo medieval e futurista ao mesmo tempo. Já a fotografia de Greig Fraser reforça a beleza e o caráter mutável de Arrakis ao oscilar entre tons agradavelmente quentes, alaranjados, e passagens nas quais a superexposição da imagem sugere um calor sufocante e hostil. Aliás, um dos maiores méritos da Parte 2 é permitir que a narrativa invista tempo em sequências mais contemplativas que exploram a beleza do planeta e nas quais os personagens se dão ao luxo de esquecer por alguns minutos de todas as dificuldades que experimentam, entregando-se apenas ao prazer da companhia uns dos outros – algo que é refletido também no desenho de som, que em diversos momentos descarta qualquer ruído além do vento e do ruído da areia se deslocando, o que confere um naturalismo sólido ao que vemos (neste sentido, a cena em que vemos vários guerreiros Harkonnen levitando próximos à superfície vertical de uma montanha de pedra é também memorável). E se as sequências de ação contam com uma mise-en-scène bem estabelecida que permite que o espectador compreenda sem problemas a lógica do que ocorre na tela (a estratégia adotada na batalha final, por exemplo, jamais gera confusão), o destaque é sem dúvida aquela que retrata a primeira vez em que o protagonista monta sozinho em um gigantesco verme da areia, quando Villeneuve revela a dimensão da criatura ao longe e mais tarde, sem sacrificar a noção de escala, acompanha Paul enquanto corre, desliza pela areia, prende seus arpões no animal e finalmente sai da nuvem de poeira, surgindo imponente de pé sobre este e guiando seus movimentos. (Dito isso, em nenhum instante o longa explica como eles descem quando chegam ao seu destino.) Um outro elemento importante da Parte 2 reside, como na anterior, na influência das culturas e signos árabes sobre a concepção de Arrakis e seus habitantes, o que inclui suas vestes, seus costumes (como o lamento feminino alto e em grupo diante de um cadáver), seu vocabulário (como a referência a djinns) e sua religião (como ao se prostarem em uma mesma direção, como se voltados a Meca). Do mesmo modo, não é à toa que Villeneuve, ao encenar um ataque dos Harkonnen aos Fremen, inclui vários planos que parecem a tela de controle de um drone, remetendo às imagens que já vimos inúmeras vezes de árabes (guerrilheiros ou civis) sendo massacrados por mísseis disparados pelo exército norte-americano ou, mais recentemente, israelense (poucos dias antes do lançamento do filme, por exemplo, registros quase idênticos mostraram civis palestinos sendo mortos enquanto tentavam receber alimentos em um ponto de distribuição). E se o fato de os Harkonnen se referirem frequentemente aos Fremen como “ratos” soa familiar, basta pesquisar a regularidade com que os palestinos são tratados de forma idêntica pela extrema-direita sionista ao redor do mundo, incluindo no Brasil (algo que os nazistas também faziam com relação aos judeus). Aliás, é também importante reconhecer como Villeneuve não ignora o Orientalismo descrito por Edward Said em sua própria abordagem e como isto influencia a percepção do espectador sobre os personagens por mais que o filme tente evitar suas armadilhas: em certo instante, por exemplo, Paul diz que os Harkonnen foram ao deserto para caçá-lo – uma postura arrogante que o coloca como centro de todos os acontecimentos e relega os Fremen a meros seguidores, como se incapazes de autodeterminação (algo que Stilgar imediatamente aponta). Por outro lado, é impossível negar como o longa repete o velho equívoco ao realmente situar Paul como uma espécie de T.E. Lawrence “guiando” os árabes na revolta de 1916 mesmo que Chani critique esta situação diversas vezes. Brilhante em seu esforço para ilustrar como o processo de conversão/catequização frequentemente tem início em tons benignos até encontrar espaço para uma radicalização que se retroalimenta, corrompendo o fiel e levando-o a crer que suas ações mais reprováveis têm um “propósito” maior (como disse o físico Steven Weinberg, “com ou sem religião, sempre haverá pessoas boas fazendo coisas boas e pessoas más fazendo coisas más. No entanto, para que uma pessoa boa faça uma coisa má, é preciso religião”), Duna: Parte 2 tem plena consciência de que não está contando a história de um jovem que se converte em herói, mas sim em ameaça – e a cena que traz Paul abraçando esta posição é concebida não como um momento inspirador, mas de horror, carregando nas sombras, na trilha com tons angustiantes e nos primeiros planos que expõem a reação apreensiva de alguns e de fanatismo de outros. (Aliás, neste aspecto é mais do que apropriado que a Princesa Irulan surja no clímax da narrativa vestindo uma malha de aço que remete à figura de Joana D´Arc, já que esta também era movida pela crença de ser um instrumento divino.) Reagindo à recusa das demais Casas em aceitar sua posição de poder com a determinação imediata de que seus inimigos sejam “conduzidos ao Paraíso”, Paul/Lisan al Gaib inicia uma Guerra Santa que sua mãe vê como a concretização de seu destino, encarando a inevitável destruição de milhões de vidas como algo necessário para que alcancem um objetivo maior e “divino”. O que em nada difere da crença dos evangélicos de que o retorno de todos os judeus a Israel e a ocorrência de um amplo conflito na região é algo essencial para que Jesus retorne para o Juízo Final.

"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzAfter directing the original Dune in 2021, the Quebec filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”/”Enemy”) returns to magnificently direct and write the follow-up for the epic sci-fi film with co-writer Jon Spaihts. It’s based on the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert.The dazzling CGI visuals are so good they deserve to be seen on the big screen to get its full impact.Part Two picks up after Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) won in the original film a sword-fight with a hostile Fremen warrior in the desert wastes of Arrakis. Paul’s nobleman father after assigned by Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken) to govern the planet of Arrakis, had been killed by the evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), who with the Emperor’s approval, takes over again the guardianship of the important planet with the sole source of the invaluable Spice. The fascist-like Baron schemes to eliminate the House of Atreides for good by having its only survivors, Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), left in the desert to die. He’s helped in this wicked endeavor by his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler).To survive, Paul and his mom must take shelter with the nomadic rebel Fremen tribe. Paul is given the name Muad’Dib, and promises the skeptical tribe to be their “messiah” or “chosen one,” and also to lead them to paradise with military victory. Two intertwining stories are now followed.In one story, there’s the fight against the Harkonnens with the Fremen tribe and Paul. The ruthless ones crave to control the invaluable “spices” on the planet Arrakis, that allows them to make space travel happen. The weapons used in the colorful battle scenes range from swords to missiles.In the other story, Paul, as an outsider, transforms himself into a wise military and political leader who must gain the confidence of the doubting Fremen to follow his leadership if there’s any chance of winning the war. Paul is helped in these efforts by the support of the religious Fremen believer and leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and by the intimate love relationship he develops with his mentor, the fierce Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya).By the time we reach the climax, Paul has earned his right to be the leader of the Fremen.There are many in supporting roles who do fine jobs, including Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, the Emperor’s daughter; James Brolin as Paul’s childhood mentor Gurney; and, Dave Bautisa as the Beast Rabban.This follow-up action-packed spectacle version surpasses even the first-rate original (no dull spots here). The filmmaker’s story-telling smartly captures the ill-effects of living under a dictatorship who are carrying out a government colonial policy and a corrupt capitalist system."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE," Despite the presence of giant worms and talking space fetuses and numerous flashy fight scenes, “Dune: Part Two” is an adult sci-fi epic that takes its deep and very complex themes seriously throughout its long runtime. Other tellings of this story wouldn’t wrestle so fervently with identity, class, religion, and more the way that they are being tackled in director Denis Villeneuve’s film. The movie stands as an earnest testament to Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel that even further interrogates prickly discourses about saviors, the powerful, and the dispossessed thanks to the script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. But it’s not all heady conversations and musings on these heavy topics, as there’s plenty of amazing imagery and exciting action to fully flesh out the world and keep it entertaining. There are some parts where that 166-minutes length is felt, and some redundancy could’ve been cut down for the sake of streamlining. But mostly “Dune: Part Two” delivers on the promise of the first installment to deliver a genuinely fantastic sci-fi masterpiece. “Part Two” picks up immediately where the first one ended, with Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) now hiding with the Fremen on Arrakis. With the help of Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul learns their desert ways and how to survive in the harsh environments. Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) has tasked his nephew, Rabban (Dave Bautista), with squeezing as much spice from Arrakis as possible to avoid a similar fate as the House Atreides if the Emperor (Christopher Walken) isn’t pleased with production. Paul is reluctant to embrace and use the prophecies seeded on Dune by the Bene-Gesserit, while his mother is all too happy to employ them to promote her son amongst their new people (and keep him safe). Paul wants revenge against all Harkonnens — including newcomer Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) — but doesn’t want to use the Fremen simply for his own purposes, and therefore be another outsider that manipulates them. Villeneuve’s sequel both has a lot going on and very little. Firstly, it is entirely necessary to have seen the first part to know what is going on at any given time. This isn’t a detriment—it was always going to be told in two parts—but it is important to note in this age where installments try to hide that they are sequels or further entries in a larger story, even going so far as obscuring the number in the series. Viewers are immediately plunged into the story and there is never any catch up to acclimate folks to the events of “Dune.” But, at almost three hours long, that exposition isn’t missed as deeper themes are discussed. It would be easy for this to be the tale of a white savior showing up non-white people in their own customs to become an intergalactic hero. And that’s certainly one interpretation of Paul’s story—but the script is painfully aware of that (as was the book), and goes to great lengths to show how the prophecy was actually a source of control and that Paul’s great reluctance at taking the helm of the leader stems from not wanting to usurp the Fremen’s own agency. As the voice of the Fremen, the one who is distrusting of the religiosity and outsiders, Chani excels at being fiery independence and tender partner to Paul, helping soothe that storm that rages within him—which is all aided by an excellent performance by Zendaya. All the performances are great across the board, with no actor in “Dune: Part Two” lapsing into a one-note character. Bardem is hilarious and intoxicating as the true-believer Stilgar that wishes Paul would be the figure of prophecy that he has been raised to believe in. Bautista’s Rabban is a rageful monster but ultimately ineffectual papier-mâché Mephistopheles that grants his ogre persona with a touch of sadness because of his inabilities. Ferguson and Chalamet find even more layers to their characters from the first movie as Jessica and Paul change but stay akin to the people we met in the previous installment. And newcomers (to “Dune”) like Butler, Léa Seydoux, and Florence Pugh (as Princess Irulan, the Emperor’s daughter) bring their own flavors into the mix that help further expand the universe and deepen the intrigue of the moving parts at work. It is a truly fascinating world that Villeneuve has built from Herbert’s universe. Beautifully captured by DP Greig Fraser, the vast desert can look cruel in one scene and wondrously inviting in the next, depending on what is called for. The production design and costuming, with its many extras and settings, is unparalleled in most modern filmmaking—at least not since “Fury Road.” “Dune: Part Two” is a fully realized existence with amazing ideas at work in design that create something alien yet fundamentally human at the same time. It is our far future, and so has remnants of our DNA sprinkled throughout while still revealing new and daring visuals constantly. This is all greatly aided by Hans Zimmer’s amazing bombastic score with its intense percussion, desert sounds, and vocal exchanges to create a space that feels Othered but still familiar and home-like. These visuals and audio are born from our pasts but are fully realized in this remarkable film’s vision of tomorrow. If there is a flaw to “Dune: Part Two” is that around the 2/3 mark, it can feel like that beautifully rendered internal conflict of Paul’s has been underlined enough. And that some of those scenes of anguish and grappling can go on too long. But what to cut? I don’t know. There’s a famous scene in “Amadeus” where the Emperor says that Mozart’s music is full of “too many notes.” When Mozart asks which to cut, the Emperor has nothing to say to it. That’s how it feels with “Dune: Part Two”—it’s probable that every moment is needed to paint this beautiful masterpiece, but one can’t help but feel that at times it is going a bit long and slow over material already covered. This thankfully minor issue is usually quickly resolved by moving on to a new plot development or location with its own dazzling imagery and engaging performances. All told, “Dune: Part Two” is the real deal in terms of sci-fi epics, and will probably end up being one of the most defining films of the genre for the next decade to come. It’s a tremendous work and stunning sequel that is simply unparalleled. You can find our full content archive

"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE," Slotting into the subgenre of cute/traumatizing animated movies for kids, Robot Dreams is best watched immediately before your next therapy session. Realized with bright, hand-drawn images that have greater dimension than an ocean of CGI, Pablo Berger’s dialogue-free film stars Dog, a lonely pooch whose only comforts are TV dinners and staring longingly at the jubilant family across the street. Desperate for companionship, Dog purchases Robot, a smiling android who becomes his roommate and dance partner, opening our canine protagonist’s eyes to the wonderment of pre-9/11 New York (the Twin Towers are visible in several shots). If the film ended there, it would have been the cinematic treat of the winter, but Berger, adapting a comic book by Sara Varon, splits Dog and Robot apart in a manner both arbitrary and horrific. For all its playful flourishes, watching Robot Dreams is like watching a feature-length version of the Inside Out scene where Bing Bong vanishes in a cloud of dust. The mix of adorableness and brutality is enough to make you wail, “How can a movie with a cephalopod playing percussion in the subway hurt me like this?!” Robot Dreams is too wise and tender to deny, but for better or worse, there’s a touch of sadism behind its sweetness. NR. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. Cinema 21, Living Room. Wednesday, March 6. Every dawn, Hirayama (Koji Yakusho) awakens without an alarm. His neighbor’s sidewalk sweeping initiates the handsome 60-year-old’s daily consciousness, and a routine begins. Mustache trim, coveralls, canned coffee, cassette in the van stereo (Patti Smith or Lou Reed) as Hirayama commutes into Shibuya City to dutifully clean Tokyo’s public toilets. From what we can tell—because Hirayama says maybe five sentences in Perfect Days’ first half—the dirty job is just a job to him. The work remains in balance with Hirayama’s passion for music, his voracious reading, and his lunchtime nature photography. It’s no mystery why directing legend Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas; Wings of Desire) would be interested in rendering such a life. What 78-year-old capital-A artist wouldn’t be? This is idealistic working-class poetry (à la Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson) about a man who accepts life as a series of days that can be pleasurable if porcelain scrubbing and creative ruminating are treated with equal care. As the Cannes jury decided when they gave him Best Actor in 2023, Yakusho makes all this mundanity incredibly watchable. The Japanese star’s shifting micro-expressions reveal a character who can be bashful, boyish or imposing when his constancy is interrupted by his co-worker, his niece, or a fateful stranger. We may wonder why Hirayama chooses solitude, but his ability to be present is as comforting as it is aspirational. Wenders taps into a precious cinematic paradox: We viewers escape our lives to be mindful inside someone else’s. PG. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Bridgeport, Cinema 21, Laurelhurst, Progress Ridge. The first act of Drive-Away Dolls, Ethan Coen’s pre-Y2K lesbian screwball comedy, is pure cringe. It’s 1999 and two friends, Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) and Jamie (Margaret Qualley), are driving a rented sedan from Philadelphia to Tallahassee—and acting more like caricatures than characters. Marian is a bookish romantic; Jamie just wants to get laid, dude! The film is so dependent on stock characterizations that Ethan initially seems to be flailing without his filmmaker brother Joel (like Joel’s gorgeously austere The Tragedy of Macbeth, Drive-Away Dolls is a Coen brother movie, singular). Yet when Marian and Jamie get ensnared in a scheme involving a seething senator (Matt Damon) and a murdered dildo collector (Pedro Pascal), Drive-Away Dolls emerges as a cleverly comedic and romantic provocation. Despite being set after Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, the film imagines the ‘90s as an age when bigoted politicians were more ridiculous than dangerous and even Florida church ladies could be prevailed upon to support gay marriage. Kinky lovemaking abounds, but the evolution of Marian and Jamie’s bond—from friendship to far more—carries a whiff of Jane Austen, with Qualley playing a boisterous Elizabeth Bennet to Viswanathan’s disdainful Mr. Darcy. Is it any wonder that Coen wrote this jubilant lark of a movie with his wife, the film editor Tricia Cooke? The couple that plays together stays together. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

As tonally and stylistically consistent with its predecessor as any sequel you’ll encounter, Dune: Part Two—which adapts the back half of Frank Herbert’s landmark novel—is an escalation. We catch up with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) deep in the northern deserts of Arrakis, learning the ways of the indigenous Fremen, who debate among themselves whether Paul is the prophesied savior Muad’Dib. Falling for his fellow guerrilla fighter Chani (Zendaya), Paul seeks revenge on the invaders who destroyed House Atreides and whose ranks are now bolstered by sociopathic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). With production design that would make a pharaoh blush and sonics that touch bone marrow, director Denis Villeneuve outdoes himself in the realms of scale and sensory impact (any sequence involving sandworms is a guaranteed jaw-dropper). Yet no amount of mind-expanding spice could convince an audience that Chalamet and Zendaya have romantic chemistry or can quite explain Villeneuve’s overly slick habit of resolving hard-earned confrontations with swift, barely visible violence. Part Two also complicates the first film’s coldness by actualizing how cryptic storytelling can become when every major character is basically drunk on fate, unsure whether they are pawns, gods or kingmakers…or if convincing onlookers of that status simply makes it so, a philosophical dilemma destined to be resolved in a planned third film. It’s curious to say that a two-hour, 45-minute epic of this tonnage is holding something back, but Villeneuve is (once again) just as interested in prophesying the next film as he is in cementing the current one.

Like most 16-year-olds, Seydou (Seydou Starr) wants more out of life. His family home in Dakar, Senegal, is cramped, his construction job is menial, and his small world is more or less run by his mother and his sisters. This is the launch pad of a classically masculine quest, as Seydou and his cousin Moussa (Moustapha Fall) undertake a bruising odyssey across North Africa in hopes of reaching Italy, starting music careers, and sending money home. Once the journey begins, Io Capitano is a standard yet affecting drama about the carceral horrors experienced by undocumented immigrants—the kind of drama that (with respect) is tailor-made to get nominated for Best International Feature at the Oscars, as Io Capitano is. In a struggle defined by dirty cops, human traffickers, and broken dreams, Italian director Matteo Garrone (Gomorrah, Dogman) has assembled an empathy check for anti-immigration Europeans, perhaps even the far-right prime minister of his home country, Giorgia Meloni. The folk-tale framing gives the movie its narrative grip, though that conceit doesn’t always sit easily next to the process-driven indignities endured by Seydou and Moussa. Some interludes seem almost to punish the boys for their dreams of grandeur, but that may also be the point. Broadly speaking, the fantasies they harbor are near-universal among teenagers, only these two are met with nativism and machine guns. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room. Nico Parker gives a breakout performance as Doris in Suncoast, the directorial debut from Laura Chinn, who based the film on her experience watching her brother die of brain cancer. In the movie, the brother is Max (Cree Kawa), who grows up with Doris in Florida. Even in the face of death, life goes on. The siblings’ mother, Kristine (Laura Linney), watches over Max at a hospice, while Doris befriends Paul (Woody Harrelson), an activist campaigning for Terry Schiavo to be kept on life support (the time is the mid-2000s). Suncoast is a deeply felt coming-of-age film that mostly works, despite stepping into familiar territory (anytime a film features driving lessons and a prom, clichés are guaranteed). Linney and Harrelson have their roles down pat, but it is Parker who breathes life into Suncoast. She takes Chinn’s sincere writing and runs with it in beautiful ways, turning Doris into a relatable teen who believably grapples with the awkwardness of friendship and the grief of her brother’s deterioration. It’s a performance that makes Suncoast a rarity: a film that evokes a specific moment in time without getting too heavy-handed with the nostalgia. R. DANIEL RESTER. Hulu. “Sometimes,” Rita Marley (Lashawna Lynch) says to her husband Bob (Kingsley Ben-Adir), “the messenger must become the message.” Her affirmation illuminates the thesis of Bob Marley: One Love, that the reggae superstar must learn to accept the consequences and dangers that come with being an activist and not let them impede his mission. It’s a noble sentiment that makes for a compelling arc, but it is undercut by the screenplay’s version of Marley and his beliefs, which are sanitized to the point of sterility. The story—which kicks off with the attempted assassination of Marley in 1976, prompting an exile to London where he recovers from the trauma while writing his landmark ninth studio album, Exodus—rarely rises above artist-biopic clichés, despite occasional flashes of brilliance from director Reinaldo Marcus Greene (King Richard) and the compelling combo of Ben-Adir and Lynch (whose performance is a reminder that after supporting roles in No Time to Die and The Woman King, she’s overdue for a starring vehicle of her own). Perhaps One Love’s greatest disappointment is that it’s so thoroughly average; a man like Marley deserves a mightier film. Devotees may find some enjoyment in hearing hits from the singer’s back catalog in surround sound, but anyone hoping One Love will do justice to an icon will find that the cinematic message lacks the conviction of the messenger.

"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE," ""It has been (accepted) by all Muslims in every epoch, that at the end of time, a man from the family (of the Prophet) will without fail make his appearance, one who will strengthen Islam and make justice triumph,"" wrote Ibn Khaldun in The Muqqadamiah. ""Muslims will follow him, and he will gain domination over the Muslim realm. He will be called the Mahdî."" In the Tunisian-born sociologist, philosopher, and historian's exhaustive 14th-century introduction to the Islamic world of theology, philosophy, ecology, economics, power and politics, there is no escaping just how influential it was on Frank Herbert's original Dune novel series. From desert life versus sedentary culture, the rise and fall of dynasties and the diversity of religious practice, Herbert weaved these weighty historical concepts and themes into a sweeping narrative that delivers an epic critique of the Messiah Complex. Now entering Part Two of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation, co-written by Jon Spaihts, Paul's journey towards embracing his manufactured fate comes into keen focus; as does the overwhelming MENA and Islamic influence on the desert planet of Arrakis and the Fremen, its indigenous habitants. Having survived the devastating attack on House Atreides by rivals the Harkonnens in Dune — Part One, and the betrayal of Emperor Shaddam IV who supported the overthrow, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are forced into the desert and taken in by Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem). This is after Paul won a fatal duel against the Fremen Jamis and much of the 2hr 48 minute runtime is dedicated to his and Lady Jessica's assimilation into and ultimate leadership over this nomadic warrior people. As well as lead a revolt against the usurping Harkonnens and the Emperor to claim control over the planet's spice production – the most valuable substance in the universe. One of Dune Part Two's successes is how acutely it wrestles with the scheming efforts of the Bene Gesserit and the false idolatry they've for centuries laid the groundwork for. Jessica's superpowered matriarchal order has spent many generations manipulating the Fremen tribes into believing their invented prophecy of the Kwisatz Haderach (AKA the Mahdi/Lisan Al-Gaib) – an off-worlder who will lead them to their salvation. Aware of dynastical changes of rule, the Bene Gesserit secure bloodlines of Houses to maintain power in the universe but Jessica's self-serving plans for her first child by the fallen Duke Leto I have positioned Paul into that messianic role; a move that creates friction between mother and son as their paths diverge then realign in the third act. Ferguson injects some of that Doctor Sleep/Rose the Hat eeriness into her performance; there's an increasingly disturbing glint in Jessica's eye as she becomes Reverand Mother and goes on a holy conversion mission to the South of Arrakis. The ominous conversations she has with her pre-born daughter (growing in her womb) intensify the weirdness that Ferguson revels in. Searing visions, conversations about faith and divination with the Fremen and arguments with Jessica, lay the groundwork for the tumultuous voyage of the mind, body and soul Paul goes through under the influence of spice that shimmers across the vast desert dunes. There's a rich interiority of these particular characters and Chalamet compellingly charts Paul's emotional evolution from unwilling saviour to pragmatic leader. However, the biggest motivating factor for accepting this destiny is oddly underexpressed. His relationship with Chani (Zendaya) also comes into clearer focus and the sweet-looking pair suits the somewhat basic YA romance filter applied to it; Paul's attempt to mansplain sand-walking to the Arrakis native raises a smile. But changes from the book mean there isn't an equal exchange of knowledge between the two that truly cements their affections or the genuine depth of their bond to each other – save for an ambiguous headband that might hint at a key plot point that has been erased from this part of the story. There's a dearth of character development as to who Chani is beyond a member of the Fedeykin (the Fremen's fearsome guerrilla fighter group), devout to her nation but sceptical of their faith. In the novel, Liet Kynes is her father with Sharon Duncan-Brewster playing a gender-swapped version of that character; here, there's zero acknowledgement of that relationship. Chani is no damsel-in-distress but Zendaya's ability to connect us to her journey is restrained to a typical strong female characterisation throwing a romantic spanner in the works for the male lead. That superficiality is more widespread in the Fremen cast. Little time is spent in establishing these people and their culture beyond fighting, survival and religious fanaticism. The casting of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souhelia Yacoub is a win for Arab representation in a film that restricts actors of MENA heritage to background players. A nonsensical joke about Stilgar's accent coming from ""the South"" is a reminder that Bardem is cosplaying as a Bedouin Arab. Bardem offers a warm, frequently humorous performance but mostly at the expense of Stilgar's faith. A faith that makes mentions of Jinn and is depicted through costumes including abayas, hijabs and keffiyehs. Ferguson's Imazighen facial tattoos and headdresses hit home not just the cultural appropriation of Jessica once she becomes Reverend Mother but the film too. That we are not privy to the secret histories and traditions she has inherited (robbed!) through this ritual is another way the film denies the Fremen a more vigorous depiction. A visit to the brutalist, monochrome world of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) introduces his sadistic nephew Feyd-Rautha, who wouldn't look out of place at Berlin's infamous Berghain nightclub. Austin Butler does a decent enough Stellan Skarsgard impression and throws himself into the vicious role. In the Medival England-inspired pastures of Kaitain, Florence Pugh offers a restrained turn as Princess Irulan while Christopher Walken's Emperor offers none of the playfulness we've long been accustomed to. There are too many characters to do them justice in a film more focused on the grandiose than the granular motivations of its side players or a more fervent exploration of imperialism and colonialism beyond ""good vs bad"" and cultural aesthetics. Still, Villeneuve, with cinematographer Greig Fraser, renders an awe-inspiring cinematic space for the battle to continue. There's an almost oil painting-like texture to the Arrakis CGI, from the majestic sandworms to the ships and freighters attacking the native warriors. Han Zimmer's earthy score of heavy drums and ululating is once again oppressive. Some action sequences are thrilling and stylish; an early Fremen ambush on Harkonnen soldiers is gripping. A later Fremen attack on a spice harvester in wide shots and intense close-ups is riveting. But the final battle between the Fremen and Outworlders, not to mention between Feyd-Rautha and Paul, feels rushed and anticlimactic. Sure the main conflict of this book is somewhat resolved but a true resolution is not sufficiently achieved. After spending nearly six hours on Dune Part One and Part Two, I can say I had a better time with the latter. But as a whole, audiences deserve a far more satisfying return on their investment."

"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"What is really impressive about Part Two, is that despite how complex and like a miasma the plot becomes... the storytelling is so clear. "
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," Am I the chosen one and if so, does that lead me on a path of destruction? Also, what does my girlfriend think of all this? Denis Villenueve’s sequel, Dune: Part Two, doesn’t waste any time, lighting the fires with a nice catch-me-up from the lovely Florence Pugh, playing the calculating daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken, having a ball) who may or may not carry bigger stakes late in the film. It kicks the tires with a breathtaking Fremen hijacking sequence, as they aim to deflate the spice plants all around Arrakis.  Now, if you heard that last line and got a headache, let me relieve the pain. In the first film, Paul watched his father and his mighty empire perish shortly after they came to Arrakis, the desert DUNE-filled planet that generates and stores “spice,” the diamond-shining substance that can extend life, offer premonitions, and other enhancements. In taking down House Atreides, Stellan Skarsgard’s House Harkonnen claimed ownership to the spice factories. The sequel unfolds with the Fremen, aka the rebels and original owners of the planet and its “gifts,” shaking the trees of their new dictators.  It all comes back to poor young Paul, who isn’t afforded the normal good young times of the run-of-the-mill heir to a throne. He lost nearly everything, and is slowly gaining it back with Chani, Stigard, and his new family. But his mother still has power and sway with him, and Harkonnen has a big weapon (Dave Bautista), and a shiny new dagger in Austin Butler’s Feyd-Reutha. All of it will be coming Paul’s way, as he figures out if he’s just another guy… or potentially a very powerful being.  This relationship also fails to generate a lot of heat, at least from my corner of the theater space. Both actors are good and do create some chemistry, but their lack of faith in each other extends to the audience not feeling unwavering in their support of the on screen couple. At one point, I felt like screaming, “commit, or just fight alongside each other.” A big part of the film’s finale centers around the idea of committing to each other in unconventional ways, and I felt more tired with these two being a unified front than I did with the film’s other plot. Maybe the third film will bring it, and them, more together. The chances of Dune: Messiah getting made have to be solid, because the end of this film is anticlimactic. Don’t get me wrong, it’s thrilling and well-filmed--but it’s a building block to a third movie that won’t be here for at least three or four years. Things happen in the end, but much is left to the next chapter or a future conflict of interests.  I’m not thrilled about that. If you’re reading this review and wondering if I love this material, the answer should be as clear as my addiction to the local baseball team. I like and admire the material and its execution *far* more than I love it. So, when we’re two movies and six hours in with only a couple of knots tied, the angst in me is real. How much more do we have to go? Will there be a Fremen spin-off? An origin film about Bardem’s character. Gosh, he’s good here. The Spanish pro can terrify easily in other roles, but his veteran leader, one who believes firmer than anyone that Paul is indeed special, offers a poetic nobility to the actor’s resume. But I don’t want a movie about his younger self.  After Dune: Part One concluded, I was left wanting more Josh Brolin and Bautista, preferably kicking each other’s ass. Bautista’s pale evil Harkonnen soldier does cross paths with the Atreides soldier. Brolin’s refugee, Gurney, has ties to Paul and his late dad, and wants to avenge the latter. In the end of Part Two, he does get that shot and crosses weapons with Bautista’s Rabban.  And it lasts all of ten seconds. A few exchanges, and done. The victor is for the viewer to discover, but it was disappointing. I compare it to one of Mike Tyson’s shortest bouts. On the other hand, the climactic fight between Chalamet and Butler is much better. On the whole, it’s not great because it does seem to get itself in a hurry. But the actors commit and the choreography is solid. How it wraps up is initially covered in doubt, and that’s due to the ability of the actors and stunt coordinators to get it all right. Kudos there, but not on the Brolin-Bautista face-off. While I would hand the acting prize to either Ferguson (let’s just say I can’t and don’t want to discuss her arc) or Bardem, the sound is the electrifying element at play in Villenueve’s epic sequel. Zimmer knows how to inject poignant energy into the loudest and biggest action spectacles, something he has done with the Pirates films and the Dark Knight movies. Here, like his work in Mad Max: Fury Road, the score throttles and instantly connects the viewer.  The best part of the movie is the first 45 minutes, which is a modest amount of action and storytelling thrown together in an athletic yet elegant jam by the master composer. If there’s a lingering thing from watching this one, it’s the score sticking inside my head. It gets you going when the film lags in the middle.  I will maintain and strengthen my front that Chalamet may not be the second coming of cheesecake, but he’s a very fine actor who handles the role’s progression well. Am I blown away by him like most? No, at least not yet. He’s still very young, but his (deeper) voice and athletic ability is growing and getting stronger. A couple scenes near the end cemented the fact that he did make for a sage choice to inhabit the world of Paul Atreides, who is NOT the most fortunate son. He goes toe-to-toe with Butler with the blades, but exchanges a key and very incendiary scene with Walken’s Emperor as well. The kid can act, and these two films showcase that growth. Here’s the thing, my friends. I still don’t love the material or the movies-but I recommend the sequel based on its kinetic first act, overall cast potency, thrilling sound, and overall satisfying qualities. Any scene involving the gigantic “worms” that pop up out of the desert ground will throw a jolt through your system.  While I would have craved more closure and wanted the relationship between Paul and Chani to find some resolution or identity, Villenueve does a good job with what is seemingly holy grail material. It’s not easy stepping into this world and dealing like he does with this size and scope of ambition and cast, but two films in he is does at least make you consider the desire for a third one. I just don’t sit here dying for its existence, even if the ending left a few unanswered questions and details. The similarities to Star Wars is real, and that connects to my overall liking but not adoring takeaway from these movies.  I agree with you. While I enjoyed the movie, I felt a bit cheated at the ending which just set up future movies that I may not be that interested in. A bit like Yellowstone; I weary of the long delay."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," I didn’t read author Frank Herbert’s Dune books. The 1984 version of the film by David Lynch is decent, but I never want to watch it again. I’ve watched Dune: Part One twice and still feel like it’s boring. Dune is this massive sci-fi epic that has consistently been cursed thanks to its dense lore. Despite its incredible cast and fantastic special effects, the sand-ridden world of Dune feels too vast to completely comprehend – and I think it’s funny that current Dune director Denis Villeneuve recently stated that he hates dialogue when Dune: Part One is two-and-a-half-hours of nothing but dialogue and set up for its sequel. And yet, for all my disinterest in the preceding entry and series overall, I still plugged in my stillsuit for a trip to see Dune: Part Two. Dune: Part Two picks up almost immediately after the ending of Dune: Part One. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), are still trying to convince the Fremen that they belong among them.  Stilgar (Javier Bardem) has many Fremen believing that Paul is some prophetic savior, while the rest of the Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), believe that the outsiders are spies. Things aren’t helped by the fact that Paul’s intentions are questionable from the start, as he claims he’s no messiah but rather just a man looking to learn the ways of the Fremen in order to get revenge for the death of his father.  As for Jessica, in service of easing these tensions, when the opportunity arises, she ascends to the role of the Fremen’s Reverend Mother and proceeds to use her status to help convince her followers of Paul’s holy status – all the while being pregnant with Paul’s baby sister, with whom she has full-on, one-sided conversations throughout the film. Meanwhile, as spice production under his watch continues to be interrupted by Fremen attacks, Rabban is demoted from his post as the ruler of Arrakis by The Baron, who in turn replaces him with his younger, bloodthirsty, and psychopathic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). While I may not be a fan of the Dune series itself, I’ve always found Villeneuve’s other works (Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival) to be phenomenal enough to keep me coming back for more. Same goes for the impressive filmography of Dune: Part Two‘s cinematographer Greg Fraiser (The Creator, The Batman, Rogue One, Killing Them Softly), whose films are always beautifully shot. The introduction of Feyd-Rautha on Giedi Prime is a particular triumph, as the scenes on the planet take place entirely in black-and-white, which provides an intriguing contrast to how sand scenes are often entirely white, Harkonnen sequences are heavy on black, and full-on action takes place in total color. Further, Dune: Part Two is far most action-packed than its predecessor. The Harkonnen now utilize the Ornithopters while the Fremen travel and fight using sandworms, and while most hand-to-hand combat involves blades, the film features countless awe-inspiring explosions. The worm-riding sequence will give you legitimate goosebumps, especially if you see the film in IMAX.  The second half of Dune: Part Two has far worse pacing than the first, it’s run time overwhelmed with sandy worm worshippers having their heads way too far up their asses. Not only is Timothee Chalamet a stronger actor when he has less to work with, but Paul is also a more attractive as a character when he’s humbly learning the ways of the Fremen rather than shouting about how great he is. Chalamet’s weight as a believable prophet also falters in his weak delivery of louder lines. And while Dune: Part Two may be a visual splendor, its plot feels like it doesn’t make a lick of sense. The Harkonnen material, particularly on Geidi Prime and with scenes involving Lea Seydoux, gives the film an atmosphere akin to that of Death Stranding – the magnificently bizarre video game that is both gloriously unique and yet probably the dumbest thing to describe out loud. Dune: Part Two leads towards a holy war, but you don’t understand half of the stuff people discuss in the film. The storytelling of Dune feels so elongated and convoluted, as between the two films released thus far, it shouldn’t take nearly six hours to get to yet another cliffhanger ending for what will likely be the most savage film of the entire trilogy, especially when the wait between Dune films is almost as unbearable as a ten-minute conversation revolving around the Atreides bloodline. Impeccably shot, filled with superb visual effects, and dripping with mostly strong performances from its entire cast, Villnueve’s latest will have you almost entirely invested in the dry, twisty, and monochromatic sci-fi drama for nearly all of its three hours."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," If you’ve felt guilty you never read “Dune,” take heart. The second part of Denis Villeneuve’s epic tells you everything you need to know – and entertains. Sure, there are more subtitles than a foreign language film and enough sand to make the folks in “Mad Max” a bit jealous, but this is grand storytelling on an understandable scale that doesn’t look down on its audience. Villeneuve, in fact, makes you feel like it’s time to jump on board, ride the wave and enjoy what hundreds of craftsmen have wrought. It’s a stunning, gorgeous film that pulls you in (far better than the first film) and makes you wonder who’s betraying who. Clearly, our sympathies are with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the son of a duke who’s expected to lead his people and others out of the line of fire and into a place of freedom. He’s abetted by members of the Fremen tribe, Chani (Zendaya), and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who want him to be more than he really is. Stilgar is all-in on the concept of “messiah”; Chani has her doubts. Chalamet and Zendaya play the relationship for all its worth and become a team of sorts that doesn’t appear to have cracks. Then, another group – House Harkonnen – turns up and looks to hail from a professional wrestling world. Their savior is a creepy fighter named Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, in a great performance) who isn’t afraid to take on anyone. Key to Paul’s intermittent success, however, is his ability to harness sandworms and ride them to glory. Think: Charlton Heston in “Ben-Hur” and you’ll get the picture. Much of “Dune, Part Two,” in fact, resembles old swords-and-sorcerers’ films. Massive crowds cheer on questionable behavior while individuals play out the skullduggery. If anything, it’s a look at cult behavior and how it can manifest. Most of the characters are very superficial (and understandable), but Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) manages to intrigue throughout. She’s the product of others' choices, a climber who wouldn’t mind crafting her own legacy. Villeneuve conjures memories of “Lawrence of Arabia” more than once and gets some gorgeous visuals just holding on untouched sand dunes. When he introduces those worms, the action heats up and Chalamet gets to ride to glory. “Part Two,” however, hardly seems like the end of this franchise. There’s a questionable move at the end and enough Frank Herbert story to launch a “Star Wars”-level empire. More “Dune”? We’re in, particularly if Zendaya gets the kind of trajectory this suggests. Like Chalamet, she’s the industry’s hope – a talent who can hold the attention an IMAX screen demands. Movie critic Bruce Miller says ""Dune"" makes you think plenty of action is about to unfold. It's a big, sprawling film that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible. It’s so interested in setting a tone, this “Dune” never really tells a story. Now, as technically fine as it is, Part Two needed to be waiting in the wings, ready to unfold at Christmas. “Godzilla x Kong” doesn’t have a strong script and its work for the humans is marginal at best. Still, if you're craving popcorn, this is your movie."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," ¿Estás preparado para volver a las arenas de Arrakis? Tras el éxito de Dune en 2021, Denis Villeneuve estrena Dune: Parte Dos, el filme con el que concluye su adaptación de la novela de Frank Herbert a base de espectacularidad, reparto de lujo (Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsgârd y Florence Pugh, entre otros) y muchos gusanos de arena.  Publicada por primera vez en 1965, la saga de Paul Atreides es un hito de la ciencia ficción que ha dejado huella en múltiples ámbitos, desde la literatura hasta los videojuegos, pasando por esos intentos de llevarla al cine que, bien acabaron hundiéndose en el desierto, bien resultaron de aquella manera. Así pues, Villeneuve se enfrenta a un desafío enorme con este colofón. ¿Justificarán sus resultados esa tercera parte que planea rodar en el futuro? Denis Villeneuve ya no tenía excusa. Tras haber dedicado la primera entrega de Dune a exponer las premisas de una historia, su segundo largo acerca del planeta desierto afrontaba la obligación de sacar dicha historia adelante, un trabajo duro para aquellos fans de la ciencia ficción que, como él mismo, se vienen arriba con la construcción de mundos. Al canadiense, además, le rodeaba el aura de jugador de ventaja al contar con tres horas para un colofón que David Lynch tuvo que resumir en veinte minutos.  Y si recordamos además las flaquezas de su filme de 2021 (ese que a veces se quedaba a las puertas de ser una Barry Lyndon de las galaxias para después ceder a las necesidades de una narrativa reseca y ultracondensada), resultará lógico que algunos esperásemos su regreso con el cuchillo a punto. Así pues, ahora sorprende que esa hostilidad se haya convertido en reconocimiento ante un trabajo que no dejará en el género una huella tan profunda como algunos afirman, y que tampoco habrá provocado pesadillas entre los ejecutivos de Warner, pero al que se le nota el esfuerzo por ser fiel a su materia prima y, lo más importante, también a sí mismo. Más allá de la socorrida referencia a Lawrence y los beduinos, la historia de Dune también arrastra ecos de El gatopardo: un aristócrata que renuncia a las virtudes de su clase (verdaderas o no, esa es otra) a cambio de la conservación de sus privilegios. Y hete aquí que esa componenda, a falta de un Alain Delon con destiltraje, se encarna de forma más que notable en Timothée Chalamet.  La metamorfosis del actor a lo largo de esta película volverá obsoletos muchos chistes sobre melocotones al enfrentarle a la disyuntiva entre un sistema putrefacto (representado por esos Harkonnen que, en parte gracias a la llegada de Austin Butler, dan por fin la grima necesaria) y la barbarie del nuevo orden espoleado por Rebecca Ferguson, mamá terrible donde las haya, y sus artimañas religiosas.  El corazón de la cinta, eso sí, reside en Zendaya y en Javier Bardem: la primera, habitando un personaje que se eleva por encima del interés romántico para enunciar las verdades del barquero (¿del gusanero?) acerca de la manipulación y la explotación; el segundo, pasando de entrañable mentor a esbirro fanatizado y mostrándonos en ese tránsito la caída de toda una cultura en el abismo. En su conjunto, ¿es la Dune de Villeneuve una adaptación impecable? En absoluto, y tampoco una película libre de tachas. Pero sí una que solventa sus dificultades (visuales y narrativas) con finura, y que destaca cuando se resiste a ceder ante la épica fácil o a consolarnos mediante grandes apoteosis, no obstante la espectacularidad que la envuelve de la primera a la última escena.  Más allá de su especia y sus profecías, la novela de Frank Herbert sigue siendo una advertencia sobre el caudillismo, sobre el mito del salvador blanco y sobre lo fácilmente que cualquiera (ya sea un habitante de un desierto alienígena o un lector que se emociona al pasar las páginas) puede abandonar su humanidad al servicio de una figura carismática. Esta película dividida en dos pone esa idea en imágenes de manera sugerente y, a veces, también visceral: no es poco logro. El duque Paul Atreides se une a los Fremen y comienza su camino hasta convertirse en su líder mientras trata de evitar el terrible futuro que ha previsto: una guerra santa en su nombre, esparciéndose por todo el universo conocido.

"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," Director/co-screenwriter (with Jon Spaihts) Denis Villeneuve displays first-rate epic chops with DUNE: PART TWO. Frank Herbert’s sprawling 1965 novel has been adapted for film and television before, but it is widely believed that Villeneuve’s 2021 DUNE: PART ONE has been the most successful effort. Part of that success arguably lay in the fact that the source material was separated into two films, allowing enough screen time to tell the story without hacking out crucial bits. DUNE: PART TWO begins more or less where DUNE: PART ONE left off. The Harkonnen dynasty has wiped out the Atreides dynasty in order to control the desert planet Arrakis. Arrakis is the only place in the universe that produces the “spice” that allows interstellar travel, extreme longevity, and psychic voyaging. Unbeknownst to the Harkonnens, Atreides heir Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have both escaped and taken shelter with the Arrakis natives the Fremen, whose own name for their planet is Dune. Paul impresses the Fremen with his fighting skills. Despite her profound suspicion of outsiders, Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) is attracted to Paul, who is also drawn to her. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) begins to believe that Paul may be the planet’s prophesied messiah. Paul and Chani are both horrified by this, for different reasons. Paul has nightmares about causing intergalactic war; Chani believes that a Fremen leader should be Dune-born and raised and is also afraid that becoming a religious icon will irretrievably change the man she loves. Jessica, meanwhile, is a member (albeit a rebellious one) of the secret all-female magic-using society the Bene Gesserit. Jessica agrees with Stilgar about the prophecy, and sets about getting the loyalty of the Fremen. As for Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), he’s got nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) trying to quell the populace on Arrakis. Harkonnen would like to see his other nephew, psychotic but capable Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), take the throne from the current Emperor (Christopher Walken). That’s just the basic set-up. There is no denying Villeneuve’s skill at creating visual impact. The varied spacecraft are fully-realized, intricately detailed replicas of what is described and suggested by the science-fiction cover art of Herbert’s day. So are the costumes and props, though they are more intricate than anything conjured in the two-dimensional graphics of the ‘60s.The battles are ferocious and move in breathtaking waves. The one-on-one fights are superbly choreographed and fluidly executed. Furthermore, there are flights of imagination in both color and design. The Harkonnen home planet, under a black sun, is shown wholly in blacks, whites, and grays. Combined with the shapes of its trappings, it truly comes off as another world. Most of the cast is also right on pitch. First among equals here is Zendaya, who can convey profound heartbreak or fury without a word. Ferguson has both wonder and power as Jessica. Bardem is filled with conviction and joy as Stilgar. Butler gives dimension to the predatory Feyd-Rautha. Other notable performances come from Florence Pugh as the Emperor’s daughter and Charlotte Rampling as the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. It’s not that Chalamet isn’t a good actor overall – his choices make sense – but he’s simply not on the same pseudo-Shakespearean wavelength as most of his colleagues. This kind of material, with characters who know that their actions are shaping the cosmos, and who sometimes express themselves in dialogue that doesn’t always flow naturally, calls for a particular style. Chalamet is doing something different, which isn’t exactly wrong, but it’s noticeable. Something that audiences in 2024 are likely to notice more than either Herbert’s readers or viewers of earlier dramatizations were is DUNE’s great white savior plotline. While the characters discuss things in terms of families, outsiders, and Fremen, what we see is the brown and Black people of Dune rallying round the white Paul and Jessica. In this, Chani is the main voice of opposition. Granted, this is not set on our world, but still, we either have to roll with it for the purposes of this film or get off-board. DUNE: PART TWO is undeniably spectacular. Whether and how much one is moved by that spectacle depends on large part on what else, if anything, the viewer wants from it."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," Picking up where the first film left off, Dune: Part Two is a visual and sonic feast akin to the first that will enthrall the audience’s senses. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), remain with the Fremen. Led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem),  Paul and Jessica are newcomers to the Fremen society and are not trusted. While some believe Paul to be the “chosen one,” other Fremen, like Chani (Zendaya), are skeptical. They do not believe that a Messiah is coming, and they certainly don’t believe it to be Paul.  The Harkonnens continue to pillage their way across Arrakis in an attempt to take control of the planet while Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) is promoting the fall of House Atreides. His daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), secretly believes that Paul may still be alive, but at this point, she has nothing to solidify this thought. Even a conversation with Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) does not dissuade Irulan from her theories.  As Paul delves further into Fremen society, including learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter and riding a sandworm, Stilgar continues to fill his people with hope that Paul is the one they’ve all been waiting for. However, while Paul doesn’t believe in this himself, his mother is set on spreading the word of the prophecy to the fundamentalists in Northern Arrakis. The best thing about Dune: Part Two are the performances. Zendaya’s Chani is the heart of the film, and she is given much more to do this time than she does in the previous film. Her chemistry with Chalamet’s Paul is palpable, and the short-lived honeymoon phase between the pair makes for some of the film’s best understated moments. Chalamet commands the screen, particularly in the film’s third act, as he leans into the power he previously claimed he did not want to entangle himself with. Every line delivery is concise, and it’s easy to see the goodwill that Paul may have gained in the first film and the beginning of Part Two slowly slipping away. This could not have been done with such believability if Chalamet didn’t turn in a pitch-perfect performance.  However, the best of the returning cast is Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica. Ferguson has a charisma about her that is palpable in any film she’s acted in, and it’s not different in the two Dune movies. In Part Two, Ferguson does a lot of heavy lifting as her character is most important in moving the film’s narrative forward. Every look, every line delivery commands your attention and Ferguson is astonishing in every moment she’s on-screen in Dune: Part Two. Her character is one of the ones to watch most intently as her ambition grows and the her dangerousness builds from scene to scene. Newcomers to the franchise are Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, Léa Seydoux as the Bene Gesserit Lady Margot Fenring, and Florence Pugh as Irulan. The trio is excellent as their respective characters, Butler and Seydoux, are menacing, each portraying their powerful characters with a gravitas that cements their formidability and lets the audience know from the moment their characters appear on-screen to pay close attention to them both. While Butler has more screen time compared to Pugh and Seydoux, the actresses make the most of their screen time, and it will be intriguing to see their storylines expand with the next installment.  Of course, we cannot discuss Dune: Part Two without discussing the film’s visuals and music. A treat to both the eyes and ears, this film is somehow even better than the first in how it brings Frank Herbert’s novels to life. From the moment the movie begins, it is clear that no expense was spared regarding the visual effects. Not one interplanetary vessel, sandworm or explosion was out of place, and in seeing new worlds, the monochromatic home of the Harkonnens with the black sun was one of the most visually interesting moments in the movie. Yet again, the incomparable Hans Zimmer brings his A-game for the film’s score. The music ebbs and flows easily with whatever is occurring on-screen. In heartfelt moments, you have a song like “A Time of Quiet Between the Storms” or the aggressive percussion and synth beats of the “Harkonnen Arena” – which leaves a feeling of unease throughout that particular segment. Of course, the bombastic and otherworldly are coming to the forefront in “Worm Army.” Zimmer’s score is impactful throughout the movie’s entirety. Zimmer’s music elevates each and every pivotal scene to new heights. That said, there are some negatives for the positives in Dune: Part Two. The film’s pacing wasn’t the best, with some sequences stretching on for too long, while others seemed over too quickly. However, the most glaring negative is the same one carried over from the previous film: the lack of SWANA (Southwest Asian/North African) actors in key roles, aside from Souheila Yacoub, who portrays Shishakli. There was also a level of discomfort that came with this, particularly when the House of Harkonnen (which is primarily white) was attacking and laying waste to Arrakis, a planet populated by the Fremen, who are mostly Black and brown citizens.  With Dune: Part Two showing more of Fremen society, it is even more glaring than in the first film. It is shown in their clothing, the way they depict them praying, and the language they speak (which has very distinct Arabic influences). In addition to the “white saviour” trope partly continued from the first film (although once you get to the film’s third act, you’ll see this narrative change), this is Dune: Part Two’s biggest problem (for me). Whether it’s a film based on the 1989 Montréal massacre with Polytechnique or following a father trying to find his missing child in Prisoners or “Time to meet God” in Sicario, Denis Villeneuve continues to show moviegoers why he is such a thrilling director. Villeneuve knows how to bring a broad range of stories to life, and working alongside cinematographer Greig Fraser for both Dune films, the pair truly capture a sci-fi spectacle.  With an unforgettable score, vivid visuals, and powerful performances, Dune: Part Two is what a sci-fi epic should be. However, that doesn’t mean it is above criticism – even if the film, for the most part, was good."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,In Dune&#58; Part Two&#44; Villeneuve is less subtle with his choices&#44; being aggressively vocal about the film&#8217;s intent&#44; leaving very little room for ambiguity&#46;
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two continues the sci-fi adaptation established by Denis Villeneuve’s original Dune. The novel adaptation is not the first time the story has made its way to the big screen. But after Dune: Part Two, it’s become the definite version in my mind, with almost every aspect of the movie hitting so hard that it leaves you in awe. A masterpiece in every sense of the word. Read on for my Dune: Part Two review.  Dune is Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi franchise, that began with one book and has spawned into a multimedia empire with sequels galore. Villeneuve’s Dune is not the first big-screen adaptation, with the controversial David Lynch movie being the first mainstream one. However, Villeneuve does the impossible by easing audiences into the world of the franchise with the first film, and immerses them in its story to completion with Dune: Part Two.  The story picks up directly after the events of Dune, with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) the sole remaining survivor of House Atreides. Joining with the Fremen, he begins his journey for revenge. But at the same time, the political machinations of the Bene Gesseritt, via Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have more elaborate plans in mind. The film is a culmination of what I thought was all set up in the first Dune. Which is what didn’t work for me in the first film. But here, Villeneuve closes out the story bringing every plot thread to a satisfying and explosive conclusion.  The entire Dune franchise, and even visually what Villeneuve has set up from the first film, seems like an epic sci-fi masterpiece. Which it absolutely is that. But with Dune: Part Two, we see how it’s so much more than that. While set in a futuristic sci-fi world, the core story is essentially a revenge thriller; Paul is out to avenge the death of his father and House.  But along the way, he becomes entangled in the politics of this universe, religious fervor, and his destiny amongst it all. The prophecy of one rising up and being the messiah of the Fremen people adds a more abstract fantasy element to this sci-fi property. But how complex that turns out, and where it takes the story is truly captivating and thoroughly engaging.  I was thrown off by how Dune: Part Two is also this epic love story full of some incredibly shot sequences that would feel out of place in any other movie about giant sandworms and hallucinogenic spice. But the chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya lights up the screen. Their love story, along with the impact it has on the larger story is just one small subplot of the movie, that enhances and intensifies Paul’s journey so much more.  I cannot end this Dune: Part Two review without discussing the more technical elements of the film. It’s shot beautifully, with steady cams, frantic zooms, and pans that really put audiences into the POV of these rebel Fremen fighting for their future within the sands and stones of a desert planet. The movie starts with his low-angle shot, as Paul and the Fremen crouch in a sand dune. The panning as perspective changes, remains low, creating an almost claustrophobic feel for audiences. But just enough to work within the scene, not enough to pull audiences out of it.  Greig Fraser’s cinematography is gorgeous and astonishingly breathtaking. The establishing shots alone are works of art, but then when the story is added and the frame fills with characters, VFX, and music, it all becomes something so tangible and awe-inducing. There are frames from Dune: Part Two that could be murals or wall art, but will also carry the weight of the story behind them, even in a still frame.  Not to mention the Hans Zimmer score that will leave you breathless, and in awe of what a collaborative medium filmmaking really is. A frame of film or note from the score will immerse you back in that world, at the moment you originally heard it, with all the emotional responses that come with it.  Dune: Part Two works as an epic conclusion to an introduction in the first Dune. Part Two works better as the conclusion, experiencing as one cohesive story rather than two parts of one whole. The criticisms of the first film become void if experienced one after the other. It’s a story of epic proportions told by an insanely talented filmmaker, who knows how to play every moment with the maximum impact on audiences. And the ability to pull career-nest performances from its insanely massive cast.  Chalamet shines in a role that I think pulls him out of the coming-of-age films he’s made his career on. And into a more mature actor stepping into a new era of his career. Ferguson is sublime as the over-protective mother who is adding to her son’s legacy in her own problematic ways. Zendaya is intense and loving and has an amazing story arc of her own. Austin Butler impresses as Paul’s antagonist, Feyd Rautha, in a role that is as cerebral as it is physically demanding. Every performance in Dune: Part Two works, along with absolutely every other thing about it.  
Follow the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, Paul endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. "
"Mar 5, 2024",NEUTRAL," Can we talk about 4DX? Where the seats do a roller coaster thing; swerving and jostling throughout movie, causing motion sickness for those who have it. (I don’t, but my subconscious was in a constant state of wanting to turn around and catch the teenager(s) kicking my seat.) Then there’s the puffs of wind in your ears when you least expect it, and 4DX also sprays water on you. I’m not a fan of this. You don’t know where that water’s been! Especially in New York City. Anyway, with or without 4DX, I didn’t really care for “Dune: Part Two.” “Part One” was a made-for-IMAX science-fiction epic featuring a massive sense of scale. The desert planet Arrakis featured gargantuan hovering machines and football-field-long sandworms looking like monolithic elephant trunks with vacuum-cleaner-dust-brush-attachment mouths. They utterly dwarfed the tiny humans. It was fun the first time out. While the sense of scale and spectacle still outstrips most special-effects blockbuster cinema offerings, including “Avatar,” this time around there’s a ponderous sense of “been there done that.” Unfortunately, if you’ve seen one monster-worm rodeo, you’ve seen ‘em all. (“Worm rodeo” is my term using a sand-thumper gizmo to attract a big sand worm with vibrations, await it’s inevitable underground tsunami-like arrival, swing some grappling hooks, and then go worm-back-riding, or worm-surfing in the desert.) Overthrowing the Empire can only be accomplished by Paul becoming the foretold warrior-prophet of the Fremen. Paul must become a sort of sand-Neo (Keanu Reeve’s messianic character from the “Matrix” series). This requires some propaganda. Paul’s mom Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) reluctantly supports the concept, along with Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a Fremen zealot who’s convinced Paul will return Arrakis to the oasis of abundantly watered green vegetation of eons long past. Paul is not ethically 100 percent onboard with this wholesale con job, and neither, obviously is Chani, until Paul’s convinced there really is no other way. Once fully committed, and especially after imbibing a viscous blue liquid that’s extracted via syringe from drowned juvenile sand worms, he commits atrocities and betrays those closest to him with a merciless belief in the end justifying the means. Quite a bit of “Dune: Part Two” is shot in black and white, and some of the depictions of the colosseum carnage and the giant, bombastic, fascistic rallies of said evil fat man are more than a little reminiscent of Leni Riefenstahl’s “Triumph of the Will.” Zendaya and Chalamet don’t have a chemistry that burns up the screen. The film needed some relationship juiciness, what with all that dry, dry sand. Director Villeneuve’s definitely got style and a genuine specificity of vision—I’ll give him that. But this dark world and universe, with it’s alabaster-white evil humans is, for my taste, too eerily (and suspiciously) similar to Ridley Scott’s “Prometheus” world, with its evil alabaster-white humanoids, and its direct links to those face-hugging, acid-veined, chest-exploding aliens that have taken up permanent residence in our collective imagination since 1979. I’ve grown a little tired of the endless darkness and tales of moral compromise."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Finally&#44; DUNE takes proper cinematic shape as the glorious sci-fi soap opera metaphor intended by Frank Herbert in Villeneuve&apos;s continuation&#44; although its most potent offerings exist in the periphery&#46;
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," Villeneuve escenifica un conflicto interplanetario al borde de una guerra santa, con un inmenso elenco de personajes nuevos y viejos, para narrar una épica oscura sobre el camino del héroe. Retomando el hilo narrativo meros momentos luego del cierre de la anterior película, Duna: Parte Dos (Dune: Part Two, 2024) descubre a Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) refugiado entre los nativos Fremen tras la masacre de su gente a manos de los Harkonnen. La tribu del planeta desértico tiene a los Atreides y a los Harkonnen por colonizadores oportunistas, interesados en su metáfora-para-el-petróleo y nada más, pero resulta que Paul en particular da la talla del legendario mesías que los Fremen aguardan hace siglos. Esta incógnita sobre la naturaleza profetizada de Paul se vuelve el núcleo central del conflicto en una trama que enroca varias urdimbres políticas (como los sanguinarios Harkonnen en su papel de imperio romano en decadencia y la logia femenina de las Bene Gesserit, que trafica y sentencia linajes cuales moiras griegas) con el fervor religioso de los Fremen, increpado por el fanático Stilgar (Javier Bardem) y aún más por la madre y recalcitrante svengali de Paul, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Si Paul quiere pelear junto a los Fremen, debe aprender su cultura; si quiere unirlos contra un enemigo en común, debe convertirse en su líder; si quiere liderar a un pueblo religioso, debe hacer de mesías; y en las cuidadas palabras del escritor Kurt Vonnegut, “Somos quienes pretendemos ser. Así que debemos tener cuidado quiénes pretendemos ser”. El camino de este joven héroe en particular es uno de incertidumbre y artificio, y por más arcaicos que el esoterismo y la ciencia ficción de “Duna” hayan quedado en comparación con sus imitadores pop, sus meditaciones sobre problemática religiosa, la mística e instrumentalización de la fe, y el resbaloso atractivo del poder son infinitamente más convincentes que el maniqueísmo del “Star Wars” que ha llegado al siglo XXI. La segunda parte también se anima aunque sea un poco más a deshelar la humanidad de Paul y el círculo que lo rodea a través del humor (Bardem, Josh Brolin) y el casto romance Young Adult con la guerrera Chani (Zendaya), cuyo escepticismo sobre la divinidad de Paul lo mantiene en jaque. En el otro extremo, los otrora formidables Harkonnen han caído en la incompetencia - se matan principalmente entre sí - y el Barón (Stellan Skarsgard) parece no haber planeado más allá del golpe que le dio poder sobre Arrakis. En el momento clave que la película necesita su segundo aliento se introduce al sádico y violento Feyd (Austin Butler), autoproclamado némesis de Paul. Filmada por Greig Fraser con especial énfasis en las impactantes dimensiones de despliegues de fuerza; de las naves, los ejércitos, coliseos, desiertos y las criaturas que lo habitan, y musicalizada con la típica pompa atronadora de Hans Zimmer, la película flexiona una contextura titánica digna de una épica religiosa o mitológica. Donde Villeneuve quizás enflaquece es al filmar escenas de guerra: el director de Sicario (2015) claramente está más cómodo filmando duelos, emboscadas y guerrillas, los cuales suplen la primera mitad de la película de una acción magnífica que la segunda mitad nunca equipara del todo. En materia de saldar las varias cuentas pendientes de la primera parte, así como introducir y resolver las propias la segunda, la película rinde satisfactoriamente más allá de algún que otro anticlímax que parece ser más que nada víctima de la edición. Pero si bien el final alcanza una catarsis trágica de manera definitiva también no puede dejar de sugerir que Villeneuve adaptará aunque sea una novela más en la serie (¿Como la coda de una trilogía? ¿O de nuevo dividiendo al libro en dos?). De todas formas Duna: Parte Dos es tanto un gran medio como una gran conclusión."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," La imaginación te llevará a todas partes, dijo un genio una vez. Y aunque de por sí la imaginación muchas veces puede ser un reflejo disfrazado de lo que somos, nuestra capacidad de plasmarla y hacerla realidad es el acto de mayor catarsis a la que nos podemos someter. Imaginar algo y crearlo, resulta ser, no solo la satisfacción más enorme del ser humano, sino por momentos su única razón de vivir. “Dune: Part Two” es el más reciente resultado de la imaginación humana, plasmada hace más de 50 años en las letras de Frank Herbert, y hoy trasladada al arte más complejo de nuestra existencia, el cine. Muchos pensamientos llegan a la vez a la hora de visualizar esta película, muchos más a la hora de pensarla. Pero a la hora de resumirlo, creo que existe una dualidad sorpresiva en la experiencia de verla. La primera es la más evidente, una historia que grita a todo pulmón su bagaje cultural humano, que conectamos con nuestra propia historia, y hacemos conexiones espirituales, religiosas, históricas y narrativas a patrones que vemos repetidos muchas veces en el comportamiento humano. Pero la segunda no es tan tangible, y es la realización personal del punto preciso en el que nos encontramos como humanidad en el que somos capaces de crear un producto de entretenimiento que rompa sus propias fronteras entre una pieza artística, una historia contada, un logro cinematográfico y una adaptación de una de las novelas más celebradas de la historia del género. Pues para llegar ahí no solo existe un responsable, sino un esfuerzo colectivo, creativo, administrativo y económico, que pudiera ponerse a la par con el conflicto entre los Atreides y los Harkonnen. Su genialidad inicia en aquel primer punto, como la película utiliza la ciencia ficción a su favor para alejarse de los patrones humanos en el primer nivel de conciencia a la hora de verla, ¿qué logra esto? Que nos distanciemos, que pongamos una barrera entre nuestra experiencia humana y la que vemos en pantalla, y así convencernos de que aunque muy bien esto puede ser real, es totalmente ficticio y es producto de nuestra imaginación. Pero siempre con el debido respeto y seriedad que, irónicamente, nuestra imaginación merece. Una vez creada esta distancia entre el espectador y lo contado en la película, su historia es lo suficientemente inteligente y capaz como para mostrarnos los patrones que tanto conocemos al ser tan nuestros, la colonización, la codicia, los conflictos familiares, lo autoritario, la brutalidad, la consciencia política, la religión, la pobreza, la venganza, la mentalidad popular o de rebaño, la esperanza, y así, con una singularidad infrecuente en el cine, mantiene una sincronía en las decisiones de los personajes como para que su audiencia los comprenda, o aun más allá, se vea en ellos. Ya no somos ellos, pero nos entendemos, pues sus problemas son mis problemas y sus deseos son mis deseos, en contextos solamente separados por la imaginación. Y con eso paso a aquel segundo punto de la dualidad sorpresiva. ¿Qué se necesita para crear una distancia y/o una barrera entre lo que vemos en pantalla y mi audiencia? Pues un equipo creativo con la capacidad y los medios para dejar volar una imaginación atenta a los detalles, pensada desde las palabras de un idioma irreconocible pero cercano, hasta la más mínima presencia tecnológica distinta a lo que hoy conocemos como real. Frank Herbert, al escribir “Dune”, seguro pensó que lo estaba dejando todo en el papel, como es de costumbre cuando dejamos volar nuestra imaginación sin fronteras. Y en una labor titánica de conocimiento del material original y de resumir, para contar en tres horas, cientos de páginas de contexto, lo más importante es la capacidad subestimada de imaginarse algo visual y sonoro que sirva como la nueva norma para las millones de personas que verán esta película. Pues cuando leemos, la experiencia es individual, pero en el esfuerzo colectivo de realizar una película, pensamos en el recibimiento colectivo de esta. Hacer cine no es un ejercicio solitario, así como verlo y experimentarlo tampoco lo es, una vez presentamos algo en pantalla, audiovisual, nuestra mente inmediatamente lo toma como la nueva realidad, y para millones de fanáticos de esta saga, “Dune” ahora es lo que Denis Villeneuve ha creado para ellos. Así ocurrió con “The Lord of the Rings”, “Harry Potter”, “Game of Thrones”, y cientos de otras adaptaciones audiovisuales que terminan siendo la norma colectiva de estos reflejos imaginativos de lo que somos, o lo que podemos ser. ¿Cómo se inicia a crear algo como “Dune: Part Two”? No tengo idea, me imagino que con una primera entrega tan buena como aquella lo fue. Capaz de mostrarnos una experiencia cinematográfica que reviva aquel género venerado hace muchos años en el cine, LO ÉPICO, resumir una historia que solo promete más y más, y darnos una de las secuelas más impresionantes de la historia del cine, revitalizando el género de la ciencia ficción. Por más creadores que se tomen tan en serio nuestra imaginación. Viva el cine carajo."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is a triumphant and visionary science fiction film. It builds on what worked in the first film, and firmly establishes that it has been constructed out of not only an affection for the source material, but also a profound understanding of the tragedy at the heart of Herbert’s work. This is a story in which a boy becomes a hero and wins. It is a story of why that story is a tragedy. It paints gorgeous visuals in motion, not just of sci-fi combat and explosions, but of a world away from ours in all the small details. The rattling suck of air through tubes in the sand, the dance of walking without rhythm across dunes, the gaping maw of a black-toothed enemy, the skittering glitter of spice blown across the land, the crystal clarity of hidden waters, the smooth tumble of sand through fingers. There’s a mesmerizing fullness to the imagery, of it being glimpses of a real world that resonates with texture and smell and taste rather than just the hollow glitz of sci-fi visuals. And it embraces the sheer weirdness of the world. Not as acid trippy as the Lynch movie, but still reveling in the bizarreness. For instance, when ink bubble fireworks burst like a celebrating squid above a stadium of alabaster hordes stomping and swaying like an albino Nazi rally. Balloons drop metal monsters the size of apartment buildings into the desert, sand worms erupt like Cthulhu’s fingers out of oceans of sand. Even with the weirdness on display, it feels more grounded as the characters are more fully realized than in the first film. Chani in particular is given a lot more character, more complexity, than is present in the novel in which she tends to be a motivator and plot device, but not necessarily a person. That’s true of many of the characters, to be true. Herbert, for all his brilliance, was also a product of his times in science fiction and he wrote in a period where characters were secondary to plots. Villeneuve deserves great credit for teasing out the emotion of characters without compromising the ideas, of making their passions and dreams as important as their moves on the chessboard of power. It’s teasing out that emotion that leads to the greatest success of the movie: capturing the sadness at the heart of the story. It calls back at times to Paul’s conversation with his father in the first film, in which he expresses such doubts about wanting anything to do with power. At a first viewing, it read as the cliché of the reluctant hero. Yes, yes, you just want a simple life, but we know you’ll rise to be a hero because that’s what the story says should happen. But what makes this story so powerful, what so many have seen between the lines over the decades in Herbert’s novels, is that the hero’s journey is not glory, it’s a trap. But it’s not so naïve as to simply argue that heroes are bad, or that fighting evil makes you evil. No, it argues the sadness that victory always destroys what you are fighting to save. The only way to defeat an empire is to be an empire, the only way to save the Fremen way of life is to unleash them. “Lead them to paradise,” Chalamet says at the moment of triumph and to the shouts of elation with such infinite sadness.  But with all that said, the film feels rushed even at nearly three hours of run time. There is no real passage of time, and despite cataloging a whirlwind of events, a mere six months or so pass. We can’t pretend otherwise because of the biological clock that starts early in the movie. Book readers will know that it’s timing forced by deciding that Alia will not be in this film, which is probably a good editorial decision, but traps the story in a constrained timeline. As with the first film, I cannot for the life of me understand how someone who hasn’t read the book can follow half of what’s going on. Not just in terms of easter eggs, or hidden longer term meanings of events, but on a basic level of understanding the basics of what is going on from moment to moment. The best I can say to someone who enjoyed the first movie but has not read the book is to trust that the plot does make sense if you look up the answers after the fact. And also to tell you to read the damned book already."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," Dennis Villeneuve’s Dune sequel is a sombre science-fiction spectacle that insists on the scale of cinema: erupting sandworms are Cecil B. DeMille colossal, the sound design centred on Hans Zimmer’s score thunderously enveloping. In a genre once jokingly called space opera, its grand aristocratic dynasties and passions justify the term. It also treats its 1965 Frank Herbert source as a classic novel, teasing out abiding themes from its proto-hippie era. Vietnam-style aerial gunships hover, and atomic warfare, religious faith and extremism, ecology and colonialism give the narrative sinew. We last saw boyish hero Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his ferociously loyal mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) on the desert planet Arrakis, in the company of its indigenous, Bedouin-like nomad warriors the Fremen. The house of Atreides has been otherwise massacred in a sneak attack by the forces of slug-like, bloated Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), with the secret blessing of Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken). Arrakis is the source of the Spice trade the Empire relies on, now mined by the Harkonnens under threat from mammoth sandworms and Fremen guerillas. Paul riding a sandworm deserves a giant screen for its roaring sound and vision, and he’s accepted by some Fremen as a promised messiah, a faith Jessica cynically encourages with her own new psychic powers. Paul and his Fremen beloved Chani (Zendaya) meanwhile waltz in the dunes at dusk like Astaire and Rogers, but nightmare visions of holy war slaughter in his name make Paul resist his calling, till it consumes him. Javier Bardem ekes rare humour from his Fremen leader Stilgar’s credulous faith in this kid messiah. Levity isn’t, though, Villeneuve’s gig. From the punishing child kidnap hit Prisoners (2013) to the philosophical, moving sf of Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), he increasingly rivals Christopher Nolan in serious ideas at epic scale. His imagery has more fluid poetry than Nolan’s sometimes clunky grandeur, and there’s a sense here of moving through shifting dunes on a planet where all is dust, bar bone-white caverns where ice-blue liquids transmute souls. Haddoken colonists meanwhile deploy squat, gun-metal black, Gigeresque machines. Tight close-ups of actors filmed in the fabled magic hour add warmly human elements to the digital splendour and intricate, thrusting narrative. Elsewhere, the Emperor’s daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) plots her own survival, and Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother pits her machinations against Jessica’s, each ruthlessly deploying acolytes resembling Christians and Muslims. This Dune’s female balance includes Zendaya’s rough-edged Fremen heroine and Lea Séydoux’s Lady Margot, effortless seductress of new villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis’s unrecognisable Austin Butler, pictured above left with Seydoux), a psychopathic pawn in bigger games. Seen together, Séydoux and Butler could be Eros and Thanatos. Only Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings compares as a saga, and at 5½ hours to date (more is planned), Dune has the virtue of relative brevity – a climactic battle Jackson would wallow in is swiftly tactical here. You can debate Villeneuve’s po-faced, unfashionably reverent attitude, and mourn Jodorowsky’s madly impossible, abandoned Seventies Dune dream (David Lynch’s 1984 version meanwhile remains serviceably strange). This Dune doesn’t lodge long in the heart. Villeneuve has though built a remarkable world filled with timely ideas. Prophecy devastatingly shadows pageantry, in the grimly triumphal end."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie displays all manner of magnificence — black suns and 800mph winds, sandstorm assassins and massive stone ziggurats, all in a palette of grey and beige like a Mesopotamian temple renovated by Jasper Conran. "
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," The review embargo is up. I can now talk about Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part II” which is a much more entertaining film than the first one. The scores, so far, are 79 on Metacritic and 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. I was told by Warner Bros not to mention too much of the plot, so I won’t really discuss the story at length here. All of this to say that ‘Dune 2’ is pure spectacle filmmaking. It’s as ambitious a studio film as I’ve seen in quite a bit of time. If the first one was all about building character and worlds, this one just goes straight for the jugular. It’s partly a road movie as Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya) hide in the mountains of Arakkis with the Fremen. Paul is starting to be seen as this messianic figure, and word is quickly spreading, that he might be “The One.” Meanwhile, Villeneuve manages to tackle multiple storylines in the process. The Harkonnen, who mass murdered Paul’s family and the Atreides, have retaken hold of the spice fields. The scenes that take place in House of Harkonnen are shot in color, but photographed in this nightmaresque grey and black. The third storyline involves the Bene Gesserit Order and the Emperor (Christopher Walken) who purposely set up House of Atreides’ fall at the hands of the Harkonnen. Florence Pugh plays Princess Irulan, the only person wise enough to realize that her people’s demise might be near. What we have here is a revenge story. Paul wants to seek revenge on the Harkonnen and the Bene Gesserit, and to do so he’ll have to convince the millions of Fremen that he is their messiah. It’s a meaty and involving story that involves 166 minutes of tactical planning and constant chess pieces being moved left, right and center. The cast assembled here helps hide some of the flaws — particularly the overlength. Chalamet is great. Zendaya expertly nails Chani’s inner demons. There are also these muscular effective performances from Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin and, best of all, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen. Herbert’s novel, and the movies, tackle religion, war, revenge, and romance. These topics are ageless. Paul’s reluctance to accept his fate comes from the fact that he knows that the only way to “win” and get the revenge he seeks is to also fully inhabit fascist tendencies. The only way to conquer evil is to be evil. How’s that for topical relevance? Technically speaking, ‘Dune 2’ is a marvel, the sand worm sequences have never been more visceral, and the breathless scope of the sets are mesmerizingly realized. And yet, Villeneuve doesn’t lose sight of the the intimacy of his characters. Amidst the chaos, Paul and Chani are falling in love, but it’s always tackled in subdued fashion. Never overbearing to the story at hand.  The result is a staggering statement of near biblical approach — a risk-taking endeavor to storytelling that threatens to derail at any minute, but is kept whole by Villeneuve’s smartly conceived narrative. The ending is a bit of a mess, but by that point you really don’t care as you’re fully invested in the stakes at hand.  Yes, there are some dated tropes in “Dune.” The book, first published in 1965, was one of the blueprints that George Lucas used to make “Star Wars,” and the fact that Lucas’ films have been copied to death by other sci-fi films doesn’t help Dune’s case for 2024 freshness. "
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," The inevitable analogy of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two as The Empire Strikes Back to Dune: Part One’s Star Wars was recently highlighted by Christopher Nolan. The Empire Strikes Back has become the paradigmatic genre sequel that surpasses the original, and the standard by which every ambitious second film in a series is measured. And the debt of George Lucas’s Star Wars mythos to Frank Herbert’s Dune novels (a corrupt galactic empire, a quasi-religious order with mind-control powers, etc.) is substantial enough to make comparisons unavoidable. When the sequel depicts the young protagonist going into hiding, undergoing intense training and visionary trials, and eventually confronting a terrible revelation about his ancestry — all visualized on an overwhelming scale, with images of staggering power and utterly persuasive visual effects — the comparison becomes almost redundant. Yet it would be equally true, if not truer, to call Villeneuve’s Dune movies a kind of anti–Star Wars. I’m tempted to call them the definitive anti–Star Wars movies, and Dune: Part Two the anti–Empire Strikes Back. Indeed, to speak as I did above of the “Star Wars mythos” suggests the characterization of the Dune saga as an anti-myth. For all that Lucas drew from Dune in crafting his galaxy far, far away, the whole outlook and tone of Star Wars owes more to inspirations celebrating the triumph of good over evil, from conventional Westerns and serialized sci-fi swashbucklers to J.R.R. Tolkien’s implicitly Catholic The Lord of the Rings. By the end of Dune: Part Two, it’s clear that while the idea of “the triumph of good over evil” is popular in some regions of the Dune universe, that idea is a cruel lie in a harsh cosmos with no lack of overwhelmingly evil forces and Machiavellian power players, but a dearth of powers worth rooting for. Villeneuve’s two-part story offers a “Hero’s Journey” story that throws a deeply skeptical light on the very idea of heroism; an instance of what anthropologist Manvir Singh dubbed the “Sympathetic Plot” with a protagonist who is in some ways strikingly unsympathetic. And while the Jedi mysticism of Star Wars could be called, if not pro-religious, at least “spirituality-positive,” the Dune saga offers a mixed critique of Abrahamic-style faith. In Star Wars, skeptical characters who mock “sad devotion” or “hokey religions” sooner or later learn the error of their cynicism. In Dune: Part Two, warnings like “If you want to control people, you tell them a messiah will come…they’ll wait for centuries” and “This prophecy is how they enslave us!” come from the most sympathetic and grounded character, the young Fremen woman Chani, played by Zendaya. At the same time, perhaps reflecting the director’s mixed feelings about his Catholic upbringing, faith in Villeneuve’s Dune films is double-edged. While religion can function as a tool of manipulation and oppression, it can also enable people to do the otherwise impossible, such as survive in the harshest regions of the desert planet of Arrakis. It’s no coincidence that it’s the “uninhabitable” south that we find the most devout Fremen, the ones waiting for a messiah figure. Faith can even be a force of resistance, as Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulen points out to her father, Christopher Walken’s Emperor, warning him against using military force against devout opponents: “You underestimate the power of faith.” In my reviews of Dune: Part One and now Dune: Part Two (filed and pending publication; stay tuned!) I’ve written a bit comparing and contrasting Dune with Star Wars. Here I’d like to consider Star Wars in relation to The Lord of the Rings and J.R.R. Tolkien’s larger legendarium."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune 2 ignites the essence missing from its predecessor&#46; With a pulsating heartbeat&#44; it weaves characters and world-building into a sci-fi odyssey akin to a biblical epic&#46; 
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," En el año 2021 ocurrieron muchas cosas en el mundo del cine. Y pocas fueron buenas. El parón obligatorio de la emergencia sanitaria de la pandemia retrasó proyectos, llevó a otros directamente a la cancelación y reformuló el panorama. Sin embargo, uno de los grandes eventos memorables fue la llegada al cine de la segunda adaptación de “Dune” de Frank Herbert.  Esta vez, la obra tenía una solidez elegante y fría, más cercana al relato mitológico que a la épica. También era una exploración cuidadosa en las preocupaciones y tensiones de la novela original de la saga literaria, conocida por su densidad. Con docenas de libros que relatan y añaden información a la historia central, “Dune” se consideró inadaptable por más de treinta años. Desde los intentos de Alejandro Jodorowsky de abarcar todo el trasfondo a la inesperada pobreza narrativa de David Lynch. Lo cierto es que el relato fundacional de la ciencia ficción contemporánea atravesó docenas de manos y de bocetos. Finalmente, vio luz en una puesta en escena sobria, que el director Denis Villeneuve utilizó con un objetivo en particular: brindar contexto a la obra en general a costa de la espectacularidad de la obra en pantalla. Fue, desde luego, una decisión arriesgada. “Dune” llegó a los cines con la potencia de una narración que contenía a otras tantas. Después de todo, la novela de Herbert es el origen de varias de las aventuras en la galaxia más conocidas: “Star Wars”, la más obvia. De modo que cualquier cosa que Denis Villeneuve intentara parecería visto, trillado o al menos repetido. El realizador entonces tomó la decisión suicida con una premisa de semejante envergadura. Ir en sentido contrario y atenerse a lo simple, muscular y primitivo de todas las inquietudes del escritor y la forma en que el conjunto de novelas, las exploró con cuidado. El resultado fue, entonces, una cinta que anunciaba una franquicia, al menos una trilogía. No de la forma tramposa, levemente ridícula y forzada de las películas de Marvel, con sus argumentos incompletos y escenas poscréditos utilitarias. El guion de Denis Villeneuve, Eric Roth y Jon Spaihts, tomó los mitos imaginados por Herbert y los depuró hasta hacerlos más digeribles y mucho más compactos que la narración literaria. “Dune” mostró las raíces de lo que vendría después, su utilidad y la forma en que la narración inicial acerca de Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) podría funcionar a futuro. Incluso, se tomó el atrevimiento de no mostrar a las criaturas temibles, centro de toda la trama. Los gusanos de arena apenas brotaron de Arrakis en dos ocasiones como una imagen movediza en la tempestad. Lo que dejó claro que “Dune”, con todo y su elegancia metódica, sólo era la preparación para algo más en lenta sucesión. Esa “otra cosa”, llega y sobradamente con “Dune: parte dos”, que deja clara la ambición central de la película anterior y del universo entero, ahora sí, mostrado en todo su esplendor. La cinta de Denis Villeneuve podría ser la mejor película de ciencia ficción de la década, no sólo a escala, sino en su cuidadosa planeación. Sin perder el tiempo en detalles que ya planteó su predecesora, la trama va directo al grano. La derrota (aparente) de los Atreides tuvo repercusiones inmediatas. Por lo que en un giro de habilidad sorprendente, el cineasta hace imprescindible la primera película, sin que sea necesaria para sostener la actual. El leve matiz puede parecer contradictorio, pero no lo es. Se trata de que “Dune”, en su carácter de elemento fundacional para entender todo lo que se cuenta en el presente del mundo que plantea, hace más rica la experiencia, pero no anula la que llega ahora a la pantalla grande. Villeneuve analiza la historia en su naturaleza de rompecabezas. Saber acerca del origen de la revolución que emerge de la arena ardiente hace doblemente satisfactorio su existencia. Pero no saberlo, no disminuye el placer de ver “Dune: parte dos”. De modo que la cinta empieza sin preámbulos. De las palabras en Fremen que abren la acción y que recuerdan la importancia de la especia Melange, siguen las palabras de la princesa Irulan (Florence Pugh). La hija del emperador explica los detalles de la carnicería en primer plano. Los Harkonnen, amparados bajo el músculo del soberano del Universo Conocido (Christopher Walken) están decididos a convertir a Arrakis en un feudo particular. La cámara transforma los espacios pálidos bajo el sol en un genocidio total que apunta a un solo culpable: el Barón (Stellan Skarsgård), que ahora es uno de los hombres más importantes de la galaxia. Eso después de arrasar por completo con los Atreides. Con esa simple escena, Villeneuve se aleja de otras tantas sagas intergalácticas y hace de la suya un lugar lóbrego, temible, retorcido. Lo interesante de “Dune: parte dos” es el hecho de conseguir que una narración que parece contada en docenas de ocasiones y de formas más vistosas, tenga algo de original. También de sofisticado y de poderoso, en especial a medida que el entrenamiento de Paul (más sombrío, enfurecido, puro propósito concentrado), llena la pantalla y conduce la acción. A su lado, Chani (Zendaya, magnífica y silenciosa, la encarnación de los pueblos del desierto), es la representación viva de los desterrados al extrarradio. Así que su relación con este Mesías que podría no serlo, abre un puente entre el resto del universo y los que dominan la portentosa especia, moneda de cambio en la obra de Herbert.  Gradualmente, la batalla entre ambas facciones se hará total y letal. Tan violenta como para volverse un elemento casi orgánico que la película asume como escenario central. Mientras todo ocurre, Paul intenta comprender cuál es su lugar en esta historia, vengándose, pero a la vez consciente de que su naturaleza como líder bien podría ser impostada. Villeneuve juega con la idea de lo ético que tanto atormentó al personaje en el libro, para convertirlo en una madurez oscura que le arrebata sus últimas trazas de inocencia y quizás, de nobleza. La guerra santa espera en el futuro. Pero ahora mismo, Paul (y su madre Jessica, interpretada por Rebecca Ferguson, con un tono espectral y psicótico) forjan las alianzas para cimentar su triunfo. Es entonces cuando Villeneuve se juega el todo por el todo, para llevar a la cinta a un terreno que deslumbra por ser una osadía en tiempos de imágenes sin arte, destinadas a sorprender sin profundizar. Pero el director va en un sentido por completo nuevo. Con los gusanos de arena emergiendo del desierto como bestias imparables, la película roza lo colosal sin renunciar a su mensaje en el trasfondo. ¿Qué es lo que logrará Paul, venciendo a sus enemigos, alcanzando el poder en una coyuntura que le obligará a actuar según una profecía? La película no lo responde, tampoco es su interés. Uno de los grandes triunfos de esta épica majestuosa es no ser sencilla, ni en planteamiento o desarrollo. Antes que eso, Villeneuve va a lo complejo, a la cuestión del triunfo justiciero, como la llama que está a punto de encender por completo el Universo Conocido, escenario del libro y película. A la luz de “Dune: parte dos” una buena cantidad de épicas espaciales parecen infantiles, menores, simples, mal construidas. La cinta, que alcanza su tope máximo y se vuelve impredecible para sus últimos treinta minutos, demuestra que es mucho más que una cuidadosa adaptación. Es un mundo en expansión, tan elaborado como para dejar sin aliento a sus héroes, que pasan casi a un panteón Olímpico privado. Al público, en la butaca, tomado por sorpresa por esta obra de arte construida con mimo hasta el más mínimo detalle.  Entre ambas cosas, Villeneuve muestra su visión y da un paso al vacío. Solo que a diferencia de sus personajes, le eleva el coraje de acometer un riesgo y triunfar. Terminada la película — que bien podría ser la conclusión de la historia en pantalla — los cabos sueltos, sostienen el entramado. Las preguntas sin responder no importan tanto como el prodigio de un relato semejante, en una época de cine simple. Una herencia para la posteridad.  Disney se ufanó de sus próximos estrenos en el CinemaCon 2024: la nueva de ""El planeta de los simios"", ""Intensa-Mente 2"", ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" y ""La joven y el mar"", entre otras. ¿Quieres saber cuándo se estrenan en Venezuela? "
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE," “Duna: Parte 2” es la continuación de su predecesora en el más puro sentido de la palabra. Lo que Denis Villeneuve ha hecho con el filme es terminar de adaptar la primera novela de la saga de Frank Herbert de la manera más respetuosa posible, continuando con el estilo establecido en la primera película, y cambiando y acortado y alargado elementos narrativos y de personajes cuando lo creía necesario, sin ir en contra del espíritu de la obra original. El resultado, por supuesto, es excelente; un “blockbuster” de gran magnitud que mucho nos dice sobre la colonización, la apropiación cultural, el fervor religioso, y la forma en que percibimos a nuestros líderes. “Duna: Parte 2” me gustó incluso más que su predecesora. Al comenzar la película, vemos como Paul Atreides (Timotheé Chalamet) y su madre, la embarazada Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), viven relativamente tranquilos en el planeta desértico Arrakis con los Fremen, liderados por Stilgar (Javier Bardem), quien cree sin reparos en la venida de un nuevo mesías llamado Lisan al Gaib. Jessica, siguiendo el trabajo de las Bene Gesseret, sigue difundiendo las historias sobre su hijo, para hacerle creer a todos los Fremen que ÉL eventualmente se convertirá en Lisan al Gaib, mientras que Paul se concentra en aprender las costumbres de su nueva gente, enamorándose de la aguerrida Chani (Zendaya) quien, a diferencia de Stilgar, no cree en las profecías para nada. Pero tal y como Paul había estado viendo en sus visiones, la Guerra Santa se avecina. En su propio planeta, el Emperador del Universo Conocido Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken, a quien da gusto ver en el cine después de tiempo) se preocupa por los rumores sobre Lisan al Gaib, mientras su hija la Princesa Irulan (Florence Pugh) conversa con las Bene Gesseret sobre la venida del mesías. Mientras tanto, el Barón Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) decide mandar a su psicótico sobrino, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) a Arrakis para que lo ayude a controlar las reservas de Especia, y con algo de suerte, acabar con Paul. Todas estas historias (y hasta un par más) eventualmente se cruzan, resultando en el potencial cumplimiento del destino de Paul. A diferencia de otras películas fantásticas sobre héroes valientes, “Duna: Parte 2” no tiene miedo de adaptar con precisión los elementos más oscuros de la novela de Frank Herbert. Por ende, uno se va dando cuenta gradualmente del camino que Paul está tomando —por más de que al inicio no lo quiera—, el cual acabará en guerra y destrucción. Después de todo, se trata de un mesías que no ha llegado “orgánicamente”, si no más bien después de siglos de manipulación por parte de las Bene Gesseret, las maestras titiriteras de la galaxia que trabajan siempre en las sombras. Evidentemente, Paul tiene sus propias motivaciones y al final del día toma decisiones claras en relación a su destino, pero uno no puede evitar sentir que se trata de un muñeco que está siendo controlado por fuerzas incluso superiores a él. Consideren, si no, a Lady Jessica, quien como personaje es una excelente representación del concepto de apropiación cultural. Es una mujer que se convierte en una figura religiosa importante prácticamente a la fuerza, y que comienza a utilizar la ropa y las costumbres de la gente que la ha recibido para cumplir con los deseos de las Bene Gesseret. O también consideren a Chani, quien como parte del proceso de adaptación, tiene un rol un poco distinto al que tiene en la novela original. Aquí, es la contraparte de Paul: lo ama y confía en él, pero a la vez, no cree e la profecía, y mientras él se va convirtiendo en una figura mesiánica, ella se va alejando más, dándose cuenta de que su pareja no es más que un instrumento de control: un líder que busca “llevar al paraíso” a los Fremen, pero potencialmente a cambio de su libertad. Es así, pues, que “Duna: Parte 2” logra esquivar cualquier comparación a las estereotípicas historias tipo “salvador blanco” que hemos visto ya varias veces en el cine, porque precisamente eso es lo que critica. Nos presenta a personajes aparentemente heroicos o valerosos, que al final del día llegan a un planeta ajeno para convertirse en sus salvadores, agarrando sus costumbres y aparentemente cumpliendo con sus historias, mientras son manipulados por fuerzas más poderosas. Obviamente el espectador empatiza con Paul y Chani y Stligar (quien es caracterizado como un fundamentalista religioso, completamente convencido de la naturaleza mesiánica de Paul), pero también logra entender que la transformación del primero no es algo que debe ser celebrado. De hecho, Villeneuve lo presenta, hacia el final de la película, casi como una secuencia de terror, y no como un hecho heroico. Como se deben imaginar, y al igual que la primera cinta, “Duna: Parte 2” es una maravilla técnica. Pocas veces se ve hoy en día un “blockbuster” que cuente con efectos visuales prácticamente perfectos, pero eso es precisamente lo que tiene esta producción. Los diferentes mundos presentados, desde Arrakis hasta el planeta de los Harkonnen (que luce espectacular gracias a una fotografía en blanco y negro con un “look” similar al de la luz ultravioleta) son completamente convincentes, y las secuencias de acción son de una escala impresionante. Hasta me atrevería a decir que “Duna: Parte 2” luce mejor que su predecesora, la cual ya de por sí carecía de defectos visuales. De las actuaciones tampoco hay quejas. Timotheé Chalamet nos otorga la actuación más madura de su carrera, desarrollado de forma creíble la transformación gradual de Paul, quien pasa de ser un chico gentil y fuerte a presentarse como un Salvador violento y vengativo. Por su parte, Zendaya es como la voz de la razón en la historia; uno nunca duda que Chani está enamorada de Paul, pero a la vez entiende lo mucho que se opone a buena parte de sus acciones. Es un romance complejo, entonces, casi como un “jala y empuja” entre los dos chicos: ella trata de jalarlo a una realidad más inmediata, mientras que él la empuja para tomar el camino de su destino mesiánico. El hecho de que la película termine de la forma en que termina, nos dice mucho sobre Chani, y sobre lo que pasará (o podría pasar) en la tercera entrega. Como Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson está espectacular; le otorga suficiente ambigüedad como para dejarlo a uno con varias preguntas sobre “sus planes dentro de planes”. Javier Bardem, por su parte, tiene algunas de las mejores líneas de diálogo de la película (y incluso le extrajo algunas risas al público en mi sala); Austin Butler es suficientemente intimidante como el psicopático Feyd-Rautha, y Christopher Walken hace bastante con el breve rol del Emperador Shaddam IV. Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux y Anya Taylor-Joy tienen roles pequeños pero importantes, que seguramente se expandirán en la siguiente película, “Duna: Mesías”. “Duna: Parte 2” sirve como el perfecto ejemplo de lo que Denis Villeneuve es capaz de hacer con un gran presupuesto, un excelente reparto, y una ambiciosa fuente de inspiración. Se trata de un “blockbuster” espectacular, de increíbles efectos visuales, secuencias de acción de gran escala, y personajes de nombres complicados. Pero a la vez, se trata, también, de una historia reflexiva sobre el poder del fanatismo religioso, el peligro que representan los líderes con demasiado poder, y las consecuencias del colonialismo. Es una película potente que debería calar en el público incluso más que su predecesora, y que espero sea lo suficientemente exitosa como para garantizar la realización de “Duna: Mesías”. Villeneuve merece completar la trilogía, especialmente si logra mantener este altísimo nivel de calidad. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

"Mar 4, 2024",NEUTRAL," In “Dune: Part Two” the prophecy of al Gaib comes to life, Muad’Dib carves the path from boy to prophet, and Villeneuve sets up a grandiose vision that seems to be focused on the second novel, “Dune: Messiah.” Unfortunately, the film has baffling decisions in nearly every battle sequence during its runtime. With stilted fight choreography, awful CGI explosions, terrible overhead structure rendering (particularly in the final portion of the film), and inept ground-tearing visual effects during its sandworm ride sequences. It’s a wonder that the film isn’t more polished in its post-production visual effects after being delayed from November 3rd, 2023. Villeneuve capably and reliably convinces when his images are blocked from the knee down, but when the vision expands, his choices and quite likely his budget limitations keep him from successfully delivering his vision. “Dune: Part Two” is a bit oddity, its frames are composed in a thoughtful way leading the audience through some of the broader beats of the novel, but the characters don’t linger, their moments fade quickly, and the nuances of relationships so important on the page fade and end up mostly seeming immaterial during the film. Chalamet and Zendaya can share a look that satisfies but their actual moments and the content of their speech fail to resonate. It’s like viewing an impression of a human relationship you can see it, but you can’t feel it. Javier Bardem’s Stilgar is the most resounding success that Villeneuve makes as he builds toward “Dune: Messiah.” Stilgar, the Naib of Sietch Tabr in the film is a slight departure from the Stilgar of the books, with Villeneuve’s interpretation separating the Northern and Southern Fremen from one another by casting the Southern Fremen as fundamentalist believers in the Bene Gesserit prophecy sewn on Arrakis. Bardem’s devout interpretation of the character throughout the film is an effective choice that Villeneuve makes in his somewhat altered vision of the first Dune novel and accomplishes a significant amount of heavy lifting for a third film should there be one. The first “Dune” film from David Lynch while flawed in many ways did have an element of humanity to it, a quirkiness, an aliveness that is absent from Villeneuve’s adaption. For all his formal competence I can’t say that I find this rendition to be any better than the 1984 adaption. Sometimes campiness can be a feature, not a bug, and the sterility of this interpretation has me longing for that seemingly more human and jovial interpretation of the text than this mathematical and distant one.  Despite the film’s various faults, Chalamet’s portrayal of Paul is effective, his performance conveys the journey from boy to Kwizatz Haderach as well as anyone could imagine. When the film centers on real locations and real structures and props Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Villeneuve’s vision come through clearly. Unfortunately, the film is heavily reliant on visual effects that often look poor at best."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," It may only be March 1, but this feels like this could be the most anticipated film of 2024. Dune: Part Two is finally here and playing constantly at a theater near you. As visually and technically impressive as any film you have ever seen. This is true cinematic craftsmanship and everyone is working at the top of their game. It is hard to believe Dune devotees will not absolutely love this. The early reactions have been insanely positive and there are so many moments that people will be talking about for a long time. I’ll quietly wait my turn and ask, “Are we not being seduced by the expansive vision and presentation of Dune and giving a pass to the delivery of the actual story? Do we even care about the story all that much?” If the 2021 Dune was not your jam, Dune: Part Two may impress you more from a cinematic standpoint, but there isn’t much here to change one’s opinion. I’m not alone in believing the big barrier for a lot of people to conquer with Dune is that the characters and inherit connection to said characters remains at an arms length. Though Villeneuve gets strong performances from an impressive cast, some find it hard to retain, remember, and invest in the Paul Atreides story.  The Northern Lights. The Great Pyramid. Machu Picchu. The Eiffel Tower. The Statue of Liberty. Dune: Part Two. Having spent a few days on #FilmTwitter and watching the film side of TikTok, here is what I can surmise when it comes to reactions to Dune: Part Two: This movie is among the greatest visual sights that a human eye can witness. Also, this is apparently the greatest sequel of all time. And as one X user and movie reviewer tweeted, “(Dune: Part Two is)...the most visually impressive movie I’ve seen - an assault on all the senses.” To be fair, the already infamous popcorn bucket to promote the film may be an assault on all the senses…but I digress.Seems that people have lost their ever-loving minds over Denis Villenueve’s sequel to 2021’s ambitious, expansive, six-time Oscar winner. In completing the rest of Frank Herbert’s substantial 1965 science-fiction novel, Dune: Part Two is the latest example of a film that someone cannot love enough. I know this firsthand - I heaped praise on it for a good three or four minutes with someone who has also seen the film…only to then be asked why I did not like it. Some of us have been down this road before with 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, a cinematic juggernaut that has developed a cult-like (and rather cutthroat) fanbase. Apparently that film and Dune: Part Two are perfect movies. In that case, I suppose our work here is done. Once you encounter the perfect version of something, there is really nothing left to discuss or analyze, right?At the risk of committing blasphemy or some form of cinematic treason, I would suggest to #FilmTwitter and FilmTok and everyone else within earshot, that Dune: Part Two is not perfect. Yet, I recognize that the hyperbolic reactions come from an understandable place. Villenueve’s sequel is cinematic excellence, staggering and breathtaking to watch on a big screen. In this installment, the story is not bogged down as much by the need for incessant world-building. Dune: Part Two is more accessible, less convoluted, and full of performances which may define careers. Timothée Chalamet, for example, may henceforth become synonymous with the name Paul Atreides, as Mark Hamill is with Luke Skywalker and a young Harrison Ford with Indiana Jones. A groundbreaking work of art, the craftsmanship, the technical aspects, the vision and scope is all exceptional. Dune: Part Two is an embodiment of filmmakers, in nearly every capacity, functioning at the top of their game.Who knows - it might even be possible that the 2025 Oscars may have already found its next Best Picture winner before 2024’s winner is even announced. When you dig deeper and delve into the execution around the storytelling, that’s where gaffes and blemishes start to surface. I will humbly ask this: “Do we really care about the story or are we just blown away at a really amazing exhibit of images, sounds, and spectacle?” To me, though a more engaging and impressive achievement than the 2021 opener, Part Two still feels like a film trying to find the emotional ties it needs to truly embed within our hearts and minds.Herbert’s book, by the end, evolves into a story of religious fanaticism and, honestly, to me, can be largely reduced down to the old cliché that absolute power corrupts absolutely. In Paul, we have a character who continues to be shown a darker path, seduced by a more nefarious approach to help solve the perceived ills of his kingdom. As the dust jacket closes on Herbert’s novel, Paul has embraced a bleak, somewhat shocking path, and here we see his moves partially guided by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Forgive me if I wonder out loud whether her story might be the most interesting story being told in Dune: Part One and Two. Silly me… there I go questioning perfection again. Having spent a few days on #FilmTwitter and watching the film side of TikTok, here is what I can surmise when it comes to reactions to Dune: Part Two: This movie is among the greatest visual sights that a human eye can witness.  Seems that people have lost their ever-loving minds over Denis Villenueve’s sequel to 2021’s ambitious, expansive, six-time Oscar winner.

Chalamet is dynamic this time around, more comfortable standing front and center in the middle of an epic science-fiction adventure. Alongside Zendaya’s warrior Chani, they present a hope and romanticism to the potential good that can come from Paul aligning himself with the Fremen, people native to the planet Arrakis. Inevitably, the Fremen are on a collision course with the tyranny of the Harkonnen clan, led by the slovenly Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), his bumbling nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) and eventually aided by a second, younger nephew, the menacing Feyd-Rautha, portrayed by a terrifying Austin Butler.While spice is always the harbinger for conflict and war in this world, malevolence shapes the decisions of many this time around.

I love how Villenueve and his team have built Arrakis in these two films.

Though even with Chalamet quite convincing and Zendaya terrific in creating a character of depth, hesitant to trust and love while retaining a protective armor with her well-being, I remain at an arms length.

"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," There is perhaps nothing more exhilarating than nearly three hours trapped in a chaotic, futuristic universe. I might be in the minority on this one, but I could spend a solid hour staring at sand when writer-director Denis Villeneuve is behind the camera. It helps that, in this case, the story he develops is complex in imagery, with worlds, creatures, and evolved humans that require extensive time in the make-up chair and post-production. There is so much food for fodder, and, in this metaphor, Villeneuve is a Michelin-star chef. But the story is also universal in its themes of good triumphing over evil and fate versus free will. There is something for nearly everyone. A complex political landscape filled with ancient royal families from different planets? Yes, please. Epic, sweeping shots of a desert planet guarded by omnivorous, gargantuan worm monsters? Oh yeah. A true-love-doomed storyline harkening straight back to Shakespeare? Swoon. Top it off with a hairless, eyebrow-less, ink-toothed Austin Butler, and you can sign me right up! For my fellow sci-fi, world-building juggernauts, ""Dune: Part Two"" is pretty darn perfect.  The first installment was a favorite of ours back in 2021. ""Part Two"" is the sequel of all sequels. With a nearly three-hour runtime, the film simply cannot give us enough Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the prophesied messiah of the Freman people. His journey to accepting his pre-determined fate is a tale nearly as old as time. Though it will feel like a familiar plight, ""Dune"" was written by Tacoma-born Frank Herbert some 10 years before ""Star Wars"" and 30 years before ""Harry Potter."" Paul Atreides is, therefore, the OG of young white male saviors preordained for greatness. In Chalamet's hands (and perfectly coifed curls), I've become a ""Dune"" convert. In case you forgot, the young Atreides has been forced out into the brutal desert landscape of Arrakis, a planet highly desirable for its natural resource known as Spice. It's a highly addictive substance that has become essential to life 20,000 years from now. It can only be harvested in the conditions on that planet, which means various political families are vying for the privilege of overseeing the mining efforts. But the foreign powers are hit with resistance by the Fremen, a subculture of humans who have adapted to live on Arrakis' most uninhabitable regions, surviving on little water and moving within the sand as easily as a bird in the sky. They are self-appointed guardians of the planet, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Their bright blue irises are acquired by their long exposure to spice, and their belief system revolves around the imminent arrival of the Lisan al Gaib, the son of a Bene Gesserit, an ancient society of powerful women who have harnessed supernatural mental and physical abilities. As the myth goes, the Lisan al Gaib will one day appear on Arrakis and lead them to freedom and paradise. Paul Atreides - or, as I like to call him for all my fellow Potterheads, the boy who Lisan al Gaib - sits precariously at the center of the action. He is the sole heir to one of the most powerful family dynasties in the solar system. He is believed to be dead by all except the Fremen, who have taken him under their wing. And he has the immeasurable powers inherited from his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), to lead the Fremen in revolt against the status quo. He alone is ready to contend with the corruption of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his greedy underling Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), the leader of the house assigned to usurp Paul's family as Arrakis' slave driver. Of all the characters receiving fuller arcs in this film, Jessica is by and far the most wild metamorphosis. She transforms from a relatively shy and insecure mother and wife to a conniving, omniscient and authoritative Reverend Mother of the Fremen. This process requires drinking the poison pulled from a sandworm and experiencing ""spice agony,"" thereby awakening her ""Other Memory"" to see the future. Ferguson has proven her versatility throughout her career, but this role really shows audiences her fierce control of every scene she's in and the emotional manipulation she commits without letting anyone in on the ruse.  That could be said of much of the cast, as well. There isn't a weak performance or unsteady singular moment in the film. Austin Butler makes his appearance halfway through as Feyd-Rautha, Baron Harkonnen's nephew. We saw and heard Butler mutate into Elvis last year, and, in this film, his voice pitches to impeccably imitate Skarsgård's Swedish accent. At times, it's hard to forget he isn't one of the Skarsgård brothers we see frequently in similar evil roles. Aided by facial prosthetics and movie magic, Butler terrorizes every time he's on screen. Despite its many side stories and intricate family trees, the plot of ""Dune"" is as straightforward as it comes. There are very obvious good guys (the oppressed Fremen seeking liberation) and even more conventional bad guys (the fear-inducing Harkonnen, whose hairless bodies look to have never seen the sun and whose merciless and cruel tendencies make them feel like distant cousins to Voldemort). The forbidden love between Chalamet’s Paul and Zendaya’s Chani is a nice touch to round out the story. As much I enjoy Zendaya, her role here is more as a dissenting viewpoint to the other Fremen's fawning adoration over their messiah. She's also a combative romantic interest who challenges Paul. If he weren't so focused on, I don't know, saving an entire population of living souls, this could almost be a happy love story. But alas, it's not a rom-com. This is as high fantasy-science fiction as they come, and, thankfully, in the hands of visionary Villeneuve, this continuation film is told with spectacular special effects, an epic setting, solid performances and a script that steadily develops these larger-than-life characters until viewers will feel like they are eyewitnesses to the future. It would be helpful to have seen the first part, but even without the context, ""Part Two"" is a breathtaking trip to another world, a fever dream from which we never want to wake."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two hits the ground running. Well, make that walking. Paul Atredies (Timothée Chalamet) and his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are in the hands of Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) as he shepherds them to safety across the northern desert of Arrakis. There’s nothing in the way of a recap, but I’m not certain one is required. Paul and Jessica are on the run from the Harkonnen, and winning the trust of the Fremen is the key to their survival. That’s basically it. Of course, Frank Herbert’s sprawling source material is far more complex than that, and much like they did with 2021’s Academy Award–winning Dune, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts have gone out of their way to transfer as many of the author’s themes and subplots to the screen as they can. This adaptation of the second half of the book is a sprawling, visually dynamic affair, and it overflows in outstanding moments and with sequences of auditory brilliance. However, much like its predecessor, I found this sequel frequently cold and emotionally barren at the most inopportune times. The second half is particularly monotonous as Paul trudges toward a destiny he does not want and presciently believes will be his damnation — and by extension the universe’s. Villeneuve stages several eye-popping set pieces but then all too often resolves them with abrupt suddenness. The film is all exhilarating buildup leading to an unsatisfactory, and even somewhat perfunctory, payoff. While I was impressed with the director’s cinematic gusto, I was equally disappointed by how little I cared about the majority of the characters or their plights. Not that I thought any of this during the picture’s opening half. It is during this section that Paul settles in with the Fremen and starts becoming a valuable asset in their fight against the Harkonnen. Chalamet is at his best here, and whether it’s bantering back and forth with a surprisingly relaxed (and often very, very funny) Bardem or working toward a thorny romantic entanglement with Zendaya (returning as the respected Fremen warrior Chani), the foundation he fabricates for Paul’s eventual transformation into the fabled Kwisatz Haderach is a solid one. Everything builds to the moment when Paul — now known by the Fremen as “Muad’Dib” — must pass a final test of manhood and ride a sandworm. It’s also the most noticeable instance in which Villeneuve uncorks a sequence of jaw-dropping kinetic magnificence — only for things to conclude with an unfinished thud. Paul calls the worm, composer Hans Zimmer (The Creator) conducts his intensely confrontational score with vitriolic urgency, cinematographer Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty) crafts one awe-inspiring image after another, and the line between practical and computer-generated visual effects vanishes entirely. But while all of this looks and sounds stunning, there is no emotional payoff. Villeneuve quickly moves events along to focus on other characters and additional subplots. Considering there’s so much story to be told, this isn’t shocking. In the same breath, keeping things in such an unfinished state robs Paul of the necessary interior nuances that make him such a troubled and fascinating protagonist. This is a man who wants no part of the prophecy he is at the center of, fearing that becoming a messianic leader will only lead to ruination for everyone he cares about. It drove me nuts to have so many bits where Paul fulfills an aspect of said prophecy for a momentary need, only for them to gloss over the long-term ramifications. It’s not just Paul who falls victim to this form of narrative shorthand. With the Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) failing miserably to control the Fremen on Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) turns to another nephew, the bloodthirsty Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), to turn the tide back into their favor. Butler is suitably psychotic in the role, and from the first second he monochromatically steps into the frame, I found it impossible to take my eyes off of him. But the gladiatorial combat he’s introduced in is a major letdown, while a later assault he leads on a Fremen stronghold happens because the story needs it to (it’s the catalyst to get Paul moving from north to south) and does nothing to develop the villain beyond the plainly obvious. The same goes for Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (a game, if miscast, Christopher Walken) and his Bene Gesserit daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). The sections involving them rely heavily on voiceovers from Pugh as she recaps events in her diary, and these scenes have about the same impact on the proceedings as Virginia Madsen (portraying the same narrator) did on David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation, i.e., practically none. There are exceptions to all of this, and that is part of what makes Dune: Part Two so monumentally vexing. Irulan has a heated tête-à-tête with Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), and Pugh and Rampling bounce off one another with masterfully modulated subtlety. There’s another bit between Butler and Léa Seydoux that is dazzling, the latter’s seduction of the former having an arachnid virtuosity that’s unlike anything I’ve seen in ages. Finally, and maybe most important of all, the scene in which Paul finally takes charge of the Fremen during a giant meeting of the clans is well worth the wait, and the full magnitude of what he is doing is portrayed with a noticeable undercurrent of tragic inevitability that mirrors Herbert’s source material nicely. Then there is Zendaya. She’s superb. Chani sees what is happening and knows she should not be falling in love with Paul, and yet no matter the danger, she cannot help but do so anyhow. The actor’s eyes are always probing, consistently questioning. Zendaya has an uncontrolled fire kindling within her lithe, athletic frame, and it’s a constant guessing game as to whether she’ll be able to keep it from exploding. This is the best performance of her young career so far. Villeneuve has guts. He does not shy away from the darker aspects of Herbert’s prose, and while I could have done without the blatant cliffhanger setting up the next chapter of this saga (which will undoubtedly be pulled from the author’s Dune Messiah), I respect that the director delivers a downer of a climax. If I felt more of an attachment to anyone other than Chani, I probably would have applauded this ending, as some in my small screening audience did. But that wasn’t the case. While I’ll journey back to Arrakis with Villeneuve for a third time when the opportunity presents itself, I’m no longer nearly as excited about making the trek, and that’s too bad.

"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Discovery have a blockbuster hit on their hands, as Dune: Part Two debuts to more than $80 million at the domestic box office and rave reviews from critics and audiences. Which is understandable and expected, as writer-director Denis Villeneuve’s and cowriter Jon Spaihts’ sequel to the acclaimed 2021 Dune is a thrilling, glorious sci-fi masterpiece. Financially this one isn’t too hard to call at this point. While there are a couple of million of dollars worth of variance, Dune: Part Two will end the weekend with about $82 million domestic — overperforming slightly, as I’d expected — and up to $90 million internationally (but we’ll have better numbers for that tomorrow), with major foreign markets to come including China and Japan. The final freshman bow total should be somewhere around $165 million, but could go as high as $170 million. Update: International box office is indeed coming in on the highest end of predictions, near $100 million and likely to finish at least north of $95 million. Even if Dune: Part Two has the same modest final multiplier as the first film at 2.6x, despite lacking a recent Covid pandemic surge from a new variant and the simultaneous streaming release of the film on [HBO] Max after leaking online a week prior to theatrical, that would put the sequel north of $200 million domestic by the end of its theatrical run. Since Part Two has superior audience scores and critical reviews, and with even more premium screen at higher ticket prices (somewhat offset by a slightly longer runtime and thus less daily screenings in some venues), I expect at least a 3x multiplier in the end, for at least $234 million in North America. International markets are good for $80 million minimum and possibly $90 million or more. At a 2.6x multiplier, foreign sales would add around $221 million, but that jumps to $255-270 million if the film performs at better levels based on audience scores and pricing. Remember, this is without China or Japan, which will add tens of millions more to Dune: Part Two’s global haul as well — the two nations combined for $46 million for Dune. But even without them, we’re still already talking about potentially $489-500 million or more. So let’s call it $545 million. This is just an easy and modest calculation of Dune: Part Two’s potential. While we can’t dismiss the chance it might generate less longterm positive word of mouth, thus hold less strongly week to week, and wind up less popular overseas, which is all to say it could be a nice blockbuster level hit but at the lower level of about $500 million. That’s different from a huge breakout hit that gets within shooting distance of $1 billion territory, though. It’s good for WBD and a testament to the filmmaking that it’s probably going to perform at least in the $500 million range and start the year off well, but what Warner wants is something that blows the doors off the box office, and that depends on just how good Dune: Part Two really is. If it’s great enough, we could be talking about box office results far higher for the franchise. Lucky for everyone involved, Dune: Part Two is spectacular and likely to become one of the year’s most talked-about, successful, and acclaimed releases. I cannot fathom any other film this year could possibly compare to the cinematography and visual effects in Part Two, which are beyond even the monumental accomplishments of the first film. This is what movie theaters exist for, this type of visual and complete story immersion. Christopher Nolan is among those who’ve compared Dune: Part Two to Star Wars films, particularly The Empire Strikes Back, but I think it’s far more comparable to The Lord of the Rings trilogy in terms of tone, style, and the vision behind it. I actually find the first Dune film to be more akin to The Empire Strikes Back, since it ended on more of a cliffhanger note and didn’t quite feel like a complete contained story of its own, whereas Dune: Part Two works even if there is no follow-up. This story has been told now, though we know there is inevitably more to come in the world of Dune, whether we wind up seeing it or not. But of course we’ll see it, the only question is how soon. With the excellent box office results, we can expect to see it sooner than later, I’d bet. This film is all Villeneuve’s vision, and in experiencing it we can more fully and clearly see the vision and intentions within the first Dune, which I gave a mixed-positive review at the time as feeling like only the setup, part of a story that we weren’t even sure we’d see finished and not for at least a few years. Character arcs and interactions felt incomplete and frustratingly narrowly drawn within the context of plot points as opposed to relationships. But Dune is a film that rewards repeat viewings, and once you know the story — and know you’ll finally see the rest of the story imminently — you can watch it and let the film flow over and through you, let the visuals carry you and stop trying to recall every name and term and reference. My high hopes and expectations based on the first film’s trailers were an obstacle to my ability to fully embrace and enjoy that movie. But now, with Dune: Part Two, the storytelling embraces us, we are drawn in and surround by it, we are not immersed but rather consumed by the richness and depth and undeniability of it all. Scale and scope are not merely visual and auditory in Part Two, although indeed the visuals and commitment to relying on imagery and action are of mythical godlike scale. Within that sense of enormity and endless sand, desert, and sky, Villeneuve and brilliant cinematographer Greig Fraser also find that sense of the personal scale, of humanity trying to survive in the vast expanse of this world they’ve created. We are awed, mesmerized by the sight of mountainous spacecraft descending over a city, of gargantuan alien worms rising and towering over us, but inevitably our attention is always drawn to the people confronting the scale — the ships, the creatures, the planet, the universe, the political equations and deadly wars, they dwarf us yet are beholden to the choices and demands of these characters who bend reality to their will. That is Dune: Part Two, a tale of humanity surviving, resisting, prevailing, against impossible odds and a natural world/universe full of extremes and threats that wear and batter us down, from the cold indifference of space to the inferno of Arrakis. My only quibbles are minor in the grand context of Dune: Part Two’s amazing visionary success. The spice and its impact, the surrealist sensibility of how spice is used for space travel, gets little attention here. Control of spice is used as a framing device yet only pops up as a notable plot-point or topic of discussion occasionally, giving way to the more personal and political elements, and of course the religious themes dominate. I’d like to have seen a little more effort to work in the uses of spice and how obsessed with it the political situation is. There are also many moments where the dialogue — which I know is of generally lower interest to Villeneuve — is very formal even in casual settings and moments of tension or urgency, so it sounds more like reading from a page than someone speaking naturally. This also makes a few jokes (of which there aren’t many, to be sure, as it wouldn’t feel remotely appropriate in this type of story and filmmaking) feel tonally incongruent with the rest of the storytelling approach. But I also realize some dialogue choices are affectations related to the tonal impression of the film and its foundation in theocracy and formalized rituals, I just think there are several scenes that would’ve played more smoothly with rewording of the dialogue — and frankly some of these moments could’ve just done with even less dialogue, or none at all. When I rewatch the first Dune film from 2021, all of its flaws seem minor now, while its best elements stand out and define it. It improves with age, and it’s only been three years. I’m grateful to be able to watch it now with new eyes, and even happier that I can now consider and appreciate it alongside its second half, to form a whole. Dune: Part Two is a testament to the power of cinema as transformative, immersive storytelling. See it on the biggest screen possible (but please wear a mask, we are still in a pandemic, as well as suffering from RSV, flu, and other illnesses still spreading), sit close, open your mind, and be transported to Dune, desert planet."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Character&#44; you may think&#44; is not the point of a story like this one &#8211; it&#8217;s myth-making&#44; allegory &#8211; but without real people to care about&#44; there&#8217;s a ceiling on how invested we can become&#46;
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," ‘Dune: Part Two’ continues the science fiction saga that follows a young duke on his path to lead a rebellion and regain his family’s position. Frank Herbert’s Dune is an award-winning, classic sci-fi saga with so many moving parts, it’s impossible to capture all of the nuances in a standard two-hour film. Thus, it’s been adapted into miniseries and multi-part movies in an attempt to incorporate as much of Herbert’s universe as possible. Some of the details that make it so difficult to portray on screen are the complex political, scientific and social models that compel almost every action in the narrative. So, filmmakers can either get bogged down in trying to explain it all or opt for a high-level overview supplemented by new character arcs. In Dune: Part Two, director Denis Villeneuve chooses the latter. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), successfully embedded themselves amongst the Fremen, mostly thanks to Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who believes they could be the manifestation of a long-held prophecy, and Chani (Zendaya), who teaches him the way of her people. As the pair reluctantly accept their roles as messiah and Reverend Mother respectively, the war for the spice and control of Arrakis rages on. Beast Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) is struggling to maintain the Baron’s (Stellan Skarsgård) support as his ability to harvest the spice is repeatedly frustrated by Fremen attacks led by the newly named, Muad’Dib. So, his uncle redistributes the planet’s control to his other nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), who has a much colder approach to ending the conflict, which will force Paul’s hand and possibly bring forth the devastating Holy War he’s foreseen in his dreams. This film is clearly influenced by the 1962 epic adventure drama, Lawrence of Arabia, which told the real-life story of a British soldier that played a significant role in the Arab Revolt. There are scenes in Villeneuve’s movie that strongly resemble those in its predecessor from Paul’s overwhelming reception by the Fremen to him leading them into battle against the occupying House Harkonnen. Moreover, though Herbert wrote the original story in 1965, it’s not surprising to see parallels between the movie and current world conflicts, pitting indigenous peoples against invading forces. The first installment of this series attempted to establish the various houses and the reasons for tensions between them, losing some viewers as it conveyed the complexities of their relationships and the significance of their conflicts within the big picture. This second part disregards most of the story’s nuances in favour of stunning action sequences that engulf the screen with battles and explosions, and feature the mightiness of the monstrous worms that inhabit the planet. The sound rumbles through the IMAX seats and immerses audiences in the cinematic spectacle. For anyone not familiar with the source material, the movie will seem less confusing and more enjoyable. Conversely, fans will be disappointed by all that’s glossed over, altered or omitted completely. Yet, the most upsetting change is made to Chani’s character and her relationship with Paul. In Herbert’s book, she’s supportive of Paul’s cause and they openly discuss the hard decisions he will have to make if he continues down this path. In the film, Chani explicitly opposes Paul’s actions and he behaves very uncharacteristically towards her, fostering trust issues between them. While there are many changes to the narrative, including a much briefer timeline that modifies the entire existence of some characters, driving a wedge between Paul and Chani is the most egregious. In their attempt to give Chani more agency and strengthen her character, they lose one of Paul’s foundations and most important confidante. Villeneuve has mentioned making a third film based on Herbert’s second book, Dune Messiah, but so much that is at the centre of that narrative has been removed from this story, it’s difficult to imagine how the two could be reconciled.

"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," If there’s another blockbuster this year that matches the visual impact of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two, I’ll eat my desert boots. The second Dune instalment is jaw-on-the-floor spectacular. It elegantly weaves together top-tier special effects and arresting cinematography; it layers muscle, sinew and savagery on to the bones of Part One. It’s an inhospitable, brutal kind of beauty that Villeneuve has created – there’s not enough lip balm in the universe to make a visit to the sandblasted wilderness planet of Arrakis look appealing. But this epic action picture, which follows the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) from a cheeky whippersnapper who’s a bit handy with a sword, to a feared warrior, to the prophesied leader of the Fremen tribe of Arrakis, is realised with a retina-searing intensity. So how is it that Villeneuve has been able to succeed – and make no mistake, Dune: Part Two is an emphatic success – in adapting a book that was long considered to be unfilmable? The breadth and scope of Dune, Frank Herbert’s 1965 far-future saga of interstellar feudal conflict, proved a daunting prospect to previous prospective film-makers. The generous budget available to Villeneuve’s pictures certainly helps – the lack of funds was the factor that sank Alejandro Jodorowsky’s proposed 14-hour film adaptation of the book in the early 1970s. And studio support is another – while Warner Brothers hasn’t exactly covered itself in glory recently, as anyone who has been following the Coyote vs Acme debacle will know, it has at least given Villeneuve the space and freedom to achieve his creative vision (compare this with David Lynch’s less happy experience with his version of Dune, originally intended to run at three hours, then unceremoniously hacked down by nearly 40 minutes). But a crucial element in Villeneuve’s approach, a creative ethos that gels particularly effectively with the material, is his firm commitment to showing rather than telling. A chunk of exposition at the very start of the film, delivered as an entry into the “Imperial Diary’’ and narrated by Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), neatly proves how futile it is to attempt to unpick the intricacies of this densely plotted chronicle. In this case, too much dialogue and plot explanation drain the energy from the picture; it’s far more effective to employ Villeneuve’s preferred tactic of exploring the story visually. This technique occasionally misfires, with some of the transitions between vividly created scenes and set pieces feeling a little cursory and disjointed. But on the whole, it does no harm at all to bathe the audience in heady, colour-saturated atmosphere rather than to spoon-feed them with easily digestible gobbets of plot. Although Paul is the main focus of the story, this instalment allows other characters to come to the fore, most notably Fremen warrior Chani (an impressive, physically committed performance from the always magnetic Zendaya). But a standout in a supporting role is Austin Butler, playing Feyd-Rautha, the psychopathic nephew of Stellan Skarsgård’s levitating despot, Baron Harkonnen. A vast, seat-shuddering spectacle like this movie is no place for subtlety, and Butler evidently got that particular memo. From the moment he tests the calibre of a freshly sharpened blade with his extended tongue, before trying it on the throat of one of his slaves, he is phenomenal. It’s a gleefully over-the-top performance fuelled by malice and channelled through axe-blade cheekbones and a smile that could strip the skin from your face. Equally impressive and only slightly less disturbing is Rebecca Ferguson, reprising her role of Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother. Driven by her ambition for her son, and twisted by the gruelling ritual that transforms her into the Reverend Mother of the Fremen, Jessica takes on a chilling ruthlessness, something that Ferguson manages to convey almost entirely through an icily inscrutable gaze and a collection of facial tattoos. The immense, breathtaking visuals and the grandstanding performances are more than matched by Hans Zimmer’s behemoth of a score. There are passages so thunderous, it sounds as though he somehow harnessed the noise of colliding planets in place of percussion. It’s a fittingly ominous accompaniment to a story that lurches away from passionate idealism, truth and romance, and towards political machinations, betrayals, zealotry, the weaponisation of fear and the looming threat of a devastating religious war. There are moments when Dune: Part Two feels uncomfortably timely."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," Coming out of the first Dune, anyone familiar with the novel – or David Lynch’s uneven but underrated 1984 adaptation – had a few questions about what Dune Part Two would hold. For one, the first film had used up most of the plot, leaving little more than an escalating series of battles and the growing misgivings of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) to fill the back half. How would director Denis Villeneuve turn that thin gruel into an epic worthy of the name? Rather than simply pad things out with fresh subplots or new characters (though Dune Part Two does feature both), Villeneuve doubles down on going big. Call it a vibes-based approach to storytelling: overwhelming visuals and a pummelling score work hard to give this a constant bone-deep sense of profundity and meaning even where the story itself is just a series of rebel attacks on farm trucks. As for the story: now hiding out with a band of Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) Paul and his pregnant mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) – the last survivors of House Atreides, sent to rule the economically vital planet Arrakis as part of what turns out to have been a murderous trap laid by the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and rival House Harkonnen – gradually come to be accepted by them and are initiated into their desert ways. Lady Jessica becomes a Reverend Mother, a figure of much power, while Paul grows into the role of warrior and leader (he also gets to ride around on giant sand worms, who move like fast-swimming whales barely breaching the surface). Some see him as the foretold messiah, a mantel he struggles against – mostly because he knows the belief’s origins in manipulative propaganda spread by the Bene Gesserit, the secretive and powerful sisterhood his mother is a member of. While the Harkonnens, now back in charge of the planet, alternate between sending out raiding parties and killing their own underlings, under Paul’s leadership the Fremen’s attacks on Spice production grow bolder and more effective. The call grows for Paul to travel south and drink the Water of Life, a potion that usually kills men but may – if the prophecy is true – give him the visions he needs to free the planet. Already Paul knows going south will lead to a galaxy-wide war that will kill billions. When the Harkonnens bring in the even more ruthless Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to crush the resistance, he may no longer have a choice. Despite the desert setting there’s not a whole lot of warmth in the performances (Bardem being a notable exception). Even the return of Josh Brolin’s Gurney doesn’t add much of a human dimension to what is increasingly a series of galaxy-shattering power plays. To be fair, that’s to be expected: the arc across the two films is a journey from the (relatively) small and intimate to an up-front clash of massive armies and centuries-spanning schemes. Even the growing romance between Paul and Fremen Chani (Zendaya) is more of a friendship (with benefits) than any epic passion. But as young lovers together against the galaxy they’re a good team… at least until Paul takes the first steps towards godhood and her doubts see her shunted to the sidelines. Any further ambiguity about Paul having been bred to be a human Weapon of Mass Destruction is snuffed out by the black-and-white nature of his struggle against the Harkonnens. They’re even shown in literal monochrome during an epic celebration of arena slaughter and military might (complete with ink blot fireworks) that introduces Feyd-Rautha. But while the story could be told in half the time and half the performances fail to register (even Christopher Walken isn’t all he could be), the images are more than twice as grand. The calls to see this on the biggest screen you can are correct; the central appeal of this film is the thrill of being overwhelmed by the spectacle, and Villeneuve delivers time and time again. This doesn’t quite reach the epic heights of weirdness seen in Lynch’s version (the more physically transformative aspects of Spice use remain unseen here), but there’s more than enough moments of the uncanny and unsettling to break the 40 year stranglehold Star Wars has had on the visual language of space opera. Spaceships and alien worlds and bizarre creatures should be stunning and awe-inspiring and weird, not just beat-up and worn out; this is a future with an edge to it. While there’s a spin-off TV series in the works, this may or may not be the end of Dune on the big screen. The smart money’s on a third film being announced once the box office numbers are in; this ends on a note that works as an ending and as a beginning. The story may not demand a third instalment, but this is a franchise built on excess. When the fate of the galaxy is at stake, too much is never enough.

"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," In a desert far, far away is Dune: Part Two. The second installment of the sandy saga of a young warrior named Paul, wandering the gritty grounds of his futuristic planet in search of the spice of life. He encounters old and new foes as he seeks revenge for his fallen family while trying to stave off a holy war. If you haven’t read the Dune book series from author Frank Herbert, seen the original 1984 film or even Dune: Part One just a few years ago, what’s a matter wit you?! Have you had your head in the sand? This sprawling, blockbuster was green lit for a sequel seconds after Part One hit the big screen in 2021. The sci-fi romantic adventure of warring families is The Ten Commandments meets Star Wars. Timothee Chalamet is the Moses of Arrakis riding sand worms in pursuit of a better life for his chosen people. Denis Villeneuve reprises his roles as writer, director, and producer of Dune and Part Two is just as big and breathtakingly beautiful to look at as Part One. It’s IMAXimum satisfaction. If you are a fan of this story and genre, it’s worth the extra bucks to see Dune: Part Two in IMAX. It kept my husband Ricky awake…that and a giant Pepsi. The film clocks in at just under three hours, but it moves fast…like the sand in an hourglass.  The majority of the Part One cast is back along with Chalamet including Zendaya as love interest and battle babe Chani, Stellan Skarsgard, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferguson and scene stealer and comic relief, Javier Bardem. New family foes have been added including Christopher Walken as the Emperor, Florence Pugh as his Princess daughter and Austin Butler as Paul’s most formidable spice traitor. Butler gained 25 pounds of muscle and lost all his hair and fortunately his Elvis accent for the role of Feyd-Rautha.  This sequel is more egotistical than its predecessor. It has more swagger since its initial success. It’s also more ambitious and complicated technically. Personally, I’m not a huge science fiction fan so the story, like the first, is still somewhat hard to follow for me and the dialogue is sometimes unintelligible, but Dune: Part Two is why we go to the movies. Read up on the legend beforehand, especially if you haven’t seen Part One, settle in with some popcorn and marvel at what masterful filmmaking is all about.

"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two dives straight into action, sparing no time for pleasantries. This sequel doesn’t coddle the audience with a gentle transition from its predecessor but instead plunges directly into the thick of its narrative. With much to accomplish and even more at stake, in a runtime of just under three hours, Dune 2 resumes the epic journey of Paul Atreides from the very start.  Dune, like most introductory fantasy films, didn’t carry enough action for some movie-goers. Whenever we enter a new world, we need the film to lay the foundation so we can better understand the story. Except, with Dune, although they spent an entire film attempting to answer the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the world, it still seemed somewhat confusing.  Dune: Part Two carries a similar style and with so much action, it can be difficult to find one’s footing when the film begins. It’s the difference between Star Wars and its sequel The Empire Strikes Back. While many fans loved the first film, things really cook once you get to the second. Dune: Part Two is a sequel purposed by greed, lineage, power, and prophecy.  After wiping out House Atreides, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård; Andor) attempts to resume spice harvesting but the Fremen render it impossible. When Rabban (Dave Bautista; Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) fails to get spice production back on track, the sadistic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler; Elvis) is charged with the task.  Meanwhile, Paul learns the ways of the Fremen, and his relationship with Chani (Zendaya; Spider-Man No Way Home) grows. Yes, we finally get our fill of Chani after being teased with her presence throughout the first film. Chani, unlike the rest of the Fremen, doesn’t believe in the prophecy. She knows the prophecy was planted by the Bene Gesserit and encourages Paul’s resistance to it. As Paul gains the respect of the people of the desert, more and more believe that he is the savior from “the outer world”. And while Paul still rejects the prophecy, he doesn’t mind using the Fremen’s belief to assist in revenge for his father’s death. At the heart of Frank Herbert’s “Dune” is a cautionary tale about the manipulation of religious zeal for imperial ambitions. The Fremen, native to the desert planet of Arrakis, have been embroiled in a struggle for survival and freedom. Their lives have been invaded by outsiders driven by the lust for spice. Paul’s arrival is initially seen as a beacon of hope. This seems harmless as long as Paul and the Fremen are of one mind, one voice, and one purpose. But here, we see a rift of potential division when Paul has to decide between what he wants and what must be done. This narrative weaves through the film, drawing clear parallels to the use of religion as a tool for political and social control. One thing is certain: Denis Villeneuve knows what to do with a big-budget production. Viewing Dune: Part Two in theaters almost made me reconsider my previous notion of what constitutes a blockbuster film. Visually, the film is a wonder. Watching it in IMAX, you’ll feel as if you are on Arrakis yourself. In Dolby, the sound envelops around you, including the impeccable score by legendary composer Hans Zimmer. It’s not just a film you see; it’s a film you feel. The technical prowess of Villeneuve is half of what draws us fully into the story and the fates of the characters.  What I found most exhilarating in this film is the latitude given to Zendaya to flex her talent. Zendaya is an excellent actor as she’s demonstrated through her gutwrenching performance in Euphoria. But here, within this film, we see her carry a multitude of emotions, and carry her own in Two Tower’s-esque action sequences. Chani is strong and resilient yet kind. And although she has feelings for Paul, her allegiance lies with the Fremen. Chani’s fervent apprehension about allowing outsiders into their community wasn’t in vain. She feared not only that the Fremen’s mission would be corrupted but also that her love for Paul would be tainted. Small details in the film enrich her character arc. Although her intensity and resolve never waver, we notice she begins to wear blue on her head or elsewhere on her person—a sign in Fremen culture that she’s romantically connected to another.  Despite her deep love for Paul, Chani communicates, through her unspoken words and eyes, that beyond this love, she harbors doubts about whether he will fulfill the expectations he has set. Chani begins to pull audiences away from Paul. It’s through her and Paul’s relationship journey that we begin to see that Paul may not be the hero we once thought he was. It isn’t sudden, but Chani can sense that the closer Paul gets to his revenge, the further he slips from her. Zendaya’s emotional resonance as Chani is undeniable, which propels her character to be more of a focus, at times, than Chalamet’s Paul. The entire ensemble of Dune: Part Two is exquisite. While we’ve seen Chalamet captivate audiences in the first ‘Dune,’ his evolution throughout this sequel is particularly invigorating. Chalamet, known for his ability to portray vulnerability in Call Me By Your Name and bring a fun, warmhearted energy to Wonka, demonstrates remarkable versatility. In Dune 2 he subtly shifts, layer by layer, as his character grapples with the inevitable, showcasing a complex transformation that speaks to his promising future in cinema. Javier Bardem brings both hope and comedic relief in his portrayal of Stilgar, embodying a character completely devoted to what he believes Paul represents. His unwavering dedication is not only inspiring but also compels the audience to share in his belief.  The standout character, intentionally so, is Feyd-Rautha, played by Butler, who masterfully becomes a psychopathic menace. From his first appearance in the film, Butler’s Feyd-Rautha is unmistakably a chilling sadist, with nothing but unhinged malevolence in his eyes. Additionally, we’re offered a tantalizing glimpse of what Florence Pugh (A Good Person) could bring to the role of Princess Irulan, should we be fortunate enough to see a third film, potentially exploring “Dune Messiah”. Dune: Part Two isn’t perfect, but its strengths outshine any lulls in pacing or narrative shifts. The action scenes will have you holding your breath. The moment Paul attempts to ride a sandworm for the first time perfectly captures what audiences yearn for in the sci-fi adventure genre. The visual effects aren’t just impressive; they place you inside the unforgiving landscape of Arrakis, making the tension palpable. The hand-to-hand combat between Paul and Feyd-Rautha featured tight choreography, both tense and realistic. Dune: Part Two is the film we’ve been waiting for in terms of cinematic majesty. It’s unclear when we’ll get another film, but it’s evident that there is a lot more story tell. It’s rare to see a big-budget film that looks and feels like the budget is warranted. Beyond the star power, this film offers a visual and auditory feast that justifies its grand-scale investment.  Dune: Part Two not only lives up to its anticipation but also sets a high bar for epic storytelling, leaving audiences craving more."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Bouncing between something great and something terrible&#44; Dune&#58; Part Two lands firmly in the middle as a good yet ultimately flawed action epic&#46;
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL," Dune: Part 2 transports the audience to a different world as time speeds by magically. I’ve not read any of the Dune books, but I saw the original Dune movie when I was a teenager but only saw it because I liked Sting, and I honestly don’t remember anything about that film, so my perspective is that of someone who is coming to this story fresh. When I watched Dune: Part 1, at home during the pandemic, I had no idea what was going on and the pacing was super slow but thought the world was fascinating. The pacing of Dune: Part 1 lulled me to sleep each time I tried to watch it. I saw Dune: Part Two on opening day, and the storytelling is exceptional. The script is quite good, and it feels like the actors had a fantastic time together whilst telling this epic story. I loved that Dune: Part 2 picks the story up immediately after Part One without a time jump. We find Paul (Timothée Chalamet, Willie Wonka) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Mission Impossible-Dead Reckoning) on the run with the Chani (Zendaya, Euphoria) and the Fremen. Through his humility and acts of heroism Paul softens Chani’s heart towards him and she decides to teach him the ways of the Freman as Paul mourns the death of his father and entire community. Meanwhile, Paul’s mother Jessica finds space in the Freman’s spiritual community and takes a prominent role. As the House of Harkonnen attempts to mine spice, Paul advises Silgar (Javier Bardem, No Country for Old Men), one of the leaders of the Freman, on strategies to disrupt mining production and destroy mining colonies."

"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," 1. La segunda parte de la adaptación de la novela de Frank Herbert por el director y guionista, Denis Villeneuve, es una experiencia cinematográfica como pocas; una vez entramos en  un universo fascinante y complejo, con acción drama y sendos toques de metáfisica y religión.  La película reencuentra a Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), el joven heredero que ahora lucha por el control del planeta Arrakis, fuente de la especia, la sustancia más valiosa del universo. Paul se alía con los Fremen, los habitantes nativos del desierto, encabezados por Stilgar (un sensacional Javie Bardem)  y para encontrar su destino como su mesías. 2. Con una cinematografía impecable y emocionantes efectos especiales, la historia del noble Atreides con su camino para ganarse el respeto de los hombres del desierto y probar que es digno de ser su líder, mientras busca salvar su amor por Chani y proteger a su madre y a su hermana, es una secuencia de combates, gusanos devoradores gigantes y mundos oscuros que le quitarán la respiración. La música de Hans Zimmer le da el toque épico a la cinta.  le va a regalar algunas escenas que se conviertes inmediatamente en referentes cinematográficos que que le regalán a Butler la oportunidad de dejar de ser Elvis. Una película que en definitiva debe verse en pantalla plátinada, IMAX si es posible, esperamos pronto ver maratones de la parte 1 y la parte 2 que bien valen la pena. "

"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," From popcorn buckets sure to be misused in cosmically terrifying ways to what seems like an unprecedented social media blitz, Dune: Part Two is casting a pop culture shadow the size of an obese sandworm. One promo clip forced most of the performers to say the word “epic” when describing the film, as though they had spontaneously conjured up that adjective. It was maybe Austin Butler’s best Dune-related acting. Just kidding, Hound Dog, you’re worth a dozen Chalamets. Writer/director Denis Villeneuve and cowriter Jon Spaihts fundamentally do not understand what makes the intergalactic desert drama’s story compelling. To be fair, having never read Frank Herbert’s source material, I don’t really either… But I do know that people love the shit out of it. And it has to be for reasons beyond what we’ve seen in the story to this point in the cinematic adaptation, now more than five-plus hours in. Because, thus far, the only surprising element has been how unintentionally hilarious Timothée Chalamet’s line delivery is. From “I’ve been having dreams” to multiple rage tantrums, his outer space messiah feels more like a sentient Reddit comment. Every story beat is explicitly foreshadowed and then happens exactly as described, with everyone acting shocked by it. To be clear, I am the biggest sucker on this planet for space opera shenanigans and a proud giver-of-an-A-grade to Jupiter Ascending. With this kind of budget and Villeneuve’s visual flare, the worst this could possibly be is a mostly good time. Dune 2: The Dunening is a mostly good time. Picking up immediately after part one, which more sorta stopped than “had an actual ending,” we see Paul Atreides (Chalamet) acclimating to his new role as the somewhat-reluctant Jesus Christ of the desert-dwelling Fremen. The movie’s first hour is its best, weirdly, as watching Space Paul fall in love with Chani (Zendaya) and learn from his replacement daddy, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), feels somehow less gross than most “special white boy gets accepted by a native tribe he’ll later lead” movies. But don’t get fooled, Space Paul is a very special white boy who gets accepted by a native tribe he’ll later lead. He also has dreams. See the aforementioned Chalamet quote. Those dreams say that his inevitable clash with the Emperor of the Universe (Christopher Walken) will be costly and bad. While Space Paul and his mom, Space Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), grapple with their intergalactic religious destinies, the evil Feyd-Rautha (Butler) licks a lot of knives on a planet full of bald people. Florence Pugh spends most of the movie dictating notes into a space tape recorder. I don’t know, man. It’s all joyless and serious. The only humor is accidental, as Space Paul keeps collecting complicated names to make up for the fact that his birth name is Paul. He is also called Usul and Maud’Dib, and then a few other things that I’m too tired to Google. Josh Brolin comes back out of nowhere. There are nuclear weapons, so apparently this is also set in the Oppenheimer cinematic universe. Other than visually stunning, which it inarguably and unquestionably is, the movie series is likely a victim of the book’s influence. That is to say, Herbert’s book so greatly affected all science fiction that followed it to the point where it feels redundant and obvious…because we’ve spent so much time with stuff that ripped it off. And all of that would probably be fine, if the lead didn’t make me want to gnaw my own arm off every time he spoke. He is anti-charismatic, and watching his tiny little elfin body do combat is so silly. I wouldn’t believe him as a department store manager leading employees in a battle against Black Friday shoppers, let alone as the savior of the entire galaxy. Again, I somehow still liked this movie, I want to stress that. But I equally want to stress that we need to stop it with this Chalamet business as soon as possible. And yet, will I be there for Dune 3: Dune It to Me One More Time? Yes. NOTE: Please read this review: Siddhant Adlakha at JoySauce.com says “These changes, while seemingly minor in the grand scheme of things, are emblematic of the film’s overarching narrative point of view, one which takes Herbert’s re-imagining of an Islamic galactic power structure (with mostly Shia influences) and further re-imagines it as a patronizing tale of saviorism.” Ian Thomas Malone at ianthomasmalone.com says “Paul’s weaknesses as a messiah somewhat reflect the reality that our society has moved beyond some of the confines of Herbert’s sandbox. Villeneuve has crafted a beautiful film that will likely go down as the definitive take on the franchise, while also exposing many of the flaws that demonstrate why it took so long to get made in the first place.” DarkSkyLady at LatinaMedia.co says “Dune: Part Two is a stunning film to behold. But it’s almost three hours long, and its lead cannot shoulder the weight of its thematic ambitions.”"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,The gifted Quebecois filmmaker unleashes all his big guns&#44; including a couple of eyeworthy sandworm-riding experiences that might rock your soul while shaking the large-screen viewing venue at which you likely will be enjoying first-class cinema&#46;
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," Timothee Chalamet achieves something here that has eluded him to this point. There is a moment in “Dune: Part Two” where the charismatic, handsome actor disappears and all that remains is the character he has become. If “Dune” from 2021 was a preface, an introduction, breaking us gently into the dense universe of author Frank Herbert, then “Dune: Part Two” is an acceleration. With each of his films, director — now auteur — Denis Villeneuve hones his craft, carving at the heels of brilliance seen in Christopher Nolan films. While there are not as many small, intimate moments here, the scale is gargantuan. The Oscar-winning cinematography of the 2021 film is easily one-upped. Early in the film, we see Harkonnen scouts jump floating to evade an oncoming sandworm. Greig Fraser’s wide shot of individually aligned figures ascending a massive rock in the middle of a vast desert is a stunning example of the visual language used here. After joining with the Fremen in the northern part of Arrakis, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) continue to learn the ways of the desert. As one of the last surviving members of House Atreides, Paul begins to embrace his future as one of the Freman people, rejecting both his role as a duke and resisting against disturbing visions of a power that calls to him. For her part, Jessica, with child, continues to stoke the religious flames that her son is the promised legend, Muad’Dib. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) sees all the signs that Paul is the messiah. The Harkonnen leaders now fully back in control of Arrakis and spice production, squeeze hard on eradicating the planet from anyone who stands in their way. Internet forum rules ...

"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune&#58; Part Two was well worth the wait and exceeds all expectations&#46;
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," When director Denis Villeneuve released the first half of his adaptation of “Dune” in 2021, after pandemic delays, it arrived with mountains of hype. The anticipation was well worth it and the grandiose film proved to be the worthy adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel fans had been hoping for. Villeneuve’s visually immersive trip succeeded at the box office and eventually won six Oscars. Now the director makes doing a follow-up seem easy with “Dune: Part Two,” a sequel even more awe-inspiring than the first film. As the title states, this is not simply a new addition to some franchise. It’s the next chapter for a story too gargantuan for one sole movie. With all of the exposition out of the way, Villeneuve is free to truly go all out in imagining alien worlds, galactic wars and what amounts to a messiah’s rise. Literally continuing where we left off, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) are in the deserts of Arrakis with the Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). The desert planet is now in the grip of the marauding forces of the Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), who has placed his nephew Glossu Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) in charge. After eliminating the House of Atreides in the first movie, the Harkonnen are now free to plunder Arrakis’ coveted natural resource, spice. As all occupying armies tend to learn, it won’t be so easy. The Fremen start waging guerrilla war against the invaders while Paul grapples with the firm belief of those around him that he is the Mahdi, a messianic leader foretold by prophecy. He has also grown closer to one of the Fremen, Chani (Zendaya). But love won’t distract him from a thirst for revenge against those who killed his father (Oscar Isaac in “Part One”) and the drive to become a leader among his new people. The Baron Harkonnen is also willing to wage an even more brutal war against his enemies, even if it risks the ire of the Emperor (Christopher Walken). “Dune: Part Two” personifies a style of filmmaking too rare these days where spectacle and story are finely balanced. Villeneuve has always been best known for his visuals, even going back to smaller films like “Enemy” and “Prisoners,” where psychological suspense was gorgeously lit. As he ascended in Hollywood with notable films such as “Sicario” and “Arrival,” it’s the images everyone remembers. “Dune: Part Two” should be seen on the biggest screen you can find, but the story remains a riveting saga both classical and imaginative. Sci-fi epics have a messiah complex and “Part Two” is the culmination of what was hinted at when Chalamet’s Paul was introduced as a quiet, intelligent young man being groomed for power. Now he is required to be a more potent presence, essentially forming an army of loyal warriors who will follow him into battle. Herbert’s story has a devoted cult following in itself, since it’s one of those mystical parables with obvious references to Islam and Christianity. Paul is a redeemer who might fulfill the promise of Arrakis being reborn into a lush new planet, retaking its original name of Dune. There’s enough room for doubt, and we wonder at times if the prophecy is true or if Lady Jessica, who also ascends as an oracle figure among the Fremen, is not pushing a convenient narrative. Stilgar might also just be a willing, blind believer. “Dune” fans have no doubt that Paul is the one, but the beauty of this film is that anyone can be taken in. This time it’s an all-out war film as the Fremen battle massive Harkonnen ships and bomb spice processing plants. Dave Bautista is more prominent as the darkly comic fool who can’t handle the locals fighting back against their occupiers. Chalamet and Zendaya are given much more to do on the physical level, combining subtle romance that turns into something more heated with intense action scenes. Zendaya riding a giant sand worm should become a memorable blockbuster image. Villeneuve also pushes further with truly creating the sensation that we are seeing alien worlds and environments. An arena fight staged in the Harkonnen world, where a black sun makes everything black and white, is intensely eerie, with the feel we’ve been dropped in some other place definitely not of our corner of the galaxy. The cinematography by Greig Fraser, who won an Oscar for his work in the first film, is a gorgeous canvas of shadows and light. The desert landscapes feel more alive and interiors are lit with a baroque richness. In approaching the material, you sense the filmmakers wanting to nod at Ridley Scott, David Fincher and James Cameron all at once.  “Part Two” runs at about 166 minutes, and like the first film it justifies its length. There are new characters but they don’t work as mere filler. The most memorable is Austin Butler (“Elvis”) as Feyd-Rautha, a sociopathic Harkonnen brought in by the Baron to truly wipe out the Fremen. It’s one of those oozing, creepily unnerving roles and Butler does it well, enhanced by great makeup. This was the role famously inhabited by Sting in David Lynch’s 1984 “Dune” adaptation, still slammed and loved in equal measure. Florence Pugh looks taken out of a medieval period movie as Princess Irulan, who we wish would give her father the Emperor advice he would listen to. Christopher Walken is a natural as the latter, looking confidently magnanimous even when the throne room turns into a battle zone. Yet, somehow Stellan Skarsgård still chews all the scenery with perverse menace as the floating Baron. He understands the assignment of being larger than life in a film with wide shots of vast armies and gigantic ships, not to mention priestesses who get hallucinatory potions out of sand worms. Hans Zimmer’s music score is up to the task as well, with its combination of Middle Eastern sounds and electronic thunderclaps. The first “Dune” famously ended on a “to be continued” note and had the tone of an unfinished movie. “Part Two” surprisingly also ends on a rather open-ended closing, with clearly more story to tell. Villeneuve doesn’t try to offer a complete narrative as Lynch did with his version. The director has not committed yet to a third film, something that might be determined when the box office returns come in. But if he won’t return for a third movie, most likely an adaptation of “Dune: Messiah,” this is still a worthy, grandiose exit. Like “The Lord of the Rings,” we know there’s plenty more. As a filmmaker, Villeneuve has always crafted images of striking relevancy. His great 2010 “Incendies,” about sectarian war in the Middle East, feels more urgent now. “Dune: Part Two” is a grand entertainment but also sustains the ideas of the Herbert novel, exploring the madness of conquest and the power of belief. The staging of it all makes us believe a typically subdued actor like Chalamet somehow fits. It ends on Zendaya racing across the sand towards destiny, breathlessly leaving us waiting to see where the story goes. "
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," Revenge is a dish best served sandy in Dune: Part Two. On the desert planet of Arrakis, where golden hills as far as the eye can see are shaped from the most-coveted and -psychedelic substance in author Frank Herbert's estimation, there's no other way. Vengeance is just one course on Paul Atreides' (Timothée Chalamet, Wonka) menu, however. Pop culture's supreme spice boy, heir to the stewardship of his adopted realm, has a prophecy to fulfil whether he likes it or not; propaganda to navigate, especially about him being the messiah; and an Indigenous population, the Fremen, to prove himself to. So mines Denis Villeneuve's soaring sequel to 2021's Dune, which continues exploring the costs and consequences of relentless quests for power — plus the justifications, compromises, tragedies and narratives that are inescapable in such pursuits. The filmmaker crafts his fourth contemplative and breathtaking sci-fi movie in a row, then, after Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 as well. The vast arid expanse that constantly pervades the frames in Dune: Part Two isn't solely a stunning sight. It looks spectacular, as the entire feature does, with Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser (The Creator) back after winning an Oscar for the first Dune; but as Paul, his widowed mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, Silo), and Fremen Stilgar (Javier Bardem, The Little Mermaid) and Chani (Zendaya, Euphoria) traverse it, it helps carve in some of this page-to-screen saga's fundamental ideas. So does the stark monochrome when the film jumps to Giedi Prime, home world to House Harkonnen, House Atreides' enemy, plus Arrakis' ruler both before and after Paul's dad Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) got the gig in Villeneuve's initial Dune. People here are dwarfed not only by their mammoth surroundings, but by the bigger, broader, non-stop push for supremacy. While there's no shortage of detail in both Part One and Part Two — emotional, thematic and visual alike — there's also no avoiding that battling against being mere pawns in an intergalactic game of chess is another of its characters' complicated fights. When the tales that Herbert started penning almost six decades ago — the first Dune book hit shelves in 1965 — made their 2020s-era cinema debut, it was by splitting the writer's introductory trip to Arrakis in half. As the film's title card made plain, Villeneuve always hoped-slash-planned that a second movie would follow. It was a savvy gamble, and it's still paying off. Even in just the opening recent Dune flick (David Lynch got there first in the 80s), breaking the 896-leaf text in two for cinema allowed the story's intricacies to unfurl unhurried. It also ensured that its figures gained flesh and complexity beyond propelling the plot. Crucial to Villeneuve's take on Dune, and to his work in general, is seeing and feeling the minutiae; Paul's path and inner conflict, and Chani's reaction to it in particular, wouldn't cut as deeply otherwise. Without personal stakes, neither would the overall narrative, with its musing on what it means to seek command and dominance — or perhaps shirk it — as well as the resulting ripple effects. House Atreides' move from the lush, ocean-filled Caladan to Arrakis fuelled Part One. Relocating came via decree, not choice — and the bloodthirsty Harkonnens, led by Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård, Andor) with his brutish nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) doing his bidding, were about as happy with the change in planetary control as expected of their usual vicious demeanour. Before the movie was out, management had reverted back by force, leaving Paul and Jessica in hiding after House Atreides was betrayed and decimated. As scripted by its director with the also-returning Jon Spaihts (The Mummy), that's where Dune: Part Two picks up, with many Fremen still wary of aiding the two outlanders. But Stilgar is unwavering in his certainty that the new saviour that's been heralded for generations — the Lisan al Gaib, as incited by the Bene Gesserit, a string-pulling sisterhood sect — is Paul. Although 1998 album You've Come a Long Way Baby doesn't contain Fatboy Slim's overt reference to Dune, aka 'Weapon of Choice' with its ""walk without rhythm and it won't attract the worm"" lines, that record's moniker does describe Paul's journey throughout Dune: Part Two. Also, while Hans Zimmer (Top Gun: Maverick) is on score duties again, commandingly so, thinking about 'Weapon of Choice' is unavoidable when Villeneuve has added Christopher Walken (Severance) to the cast as Emperor Shaddam IV. So, as the House Corrino head and leader of the known universe believes that the Atreides bloodline has been vanquished — daughter Princess Irulen (Florence Pugh, Oppenheimer) isn't as confident — Paul trains to be one of the Fremen's guerrilla-esque Fedaykin fighters. He conquers riding sandworms like chariots, and also Chani's heart, even as she's unfailing in her contention that a messiah is another form of dictator and promising one is purely a method of subjugation. Wresting back Arrakis from the Harkonnen, partly by sabotaging their spice-mining operations, is one of Paul's aims. Again, revenge over his slain father is another. Dune: Part Two makes its time with the Fremen, both in the desert and in cave cities, so rich and textured and human that its departures elsewhere are jarring. That's by immaculate and meticulous design, of course, with the aforementioned shift from Arrakis to Giedi Prime — where the twisted Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, Elvis) is another nephew to the Baron, and even more savage and ruthless, especially in a helluva unsettling yet entrancing gladiatorial scene — proving especially impactful. The two settings are desolate in their own ways, but there's no trace of warmth or hope in the black-and-white realm where the Harkonnens only know callousness. As the Bene Gesserit, via Jessica, her superior Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling, Benedetta) and the resourceful Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux, Crimes of the Future), keep trying to bend the galaxy to the matriarchal group's will, grappling with power is a desolate endeavour, too. In a telling that earns its 166-minute length due to its sheer weight, through being so nimble in laying out its story and anchoring more possible chapters (there's another five Herbert novels, and others on top since his death), Paul's is a tale of being haunted by his role, future and its implications. Unsurprisingly for a film where dialogue is not just spoken aloud but also communicated telepathically, there's a compelling interiority to Chalamet's second Dune turn. It's pitch-perfect, and in line with everything that Paul is wrestling with; he's equally excellent in action-hero mode in crisply staged and shot heists and frays, doing the Benjamin Millepied (Carmen)-choreographed sandwalk, giving rousing speeches, being plagued by visions and swooning amid the spice with Zendaya's Chani. In one of her best performances yet, she's the second of the feature's standouts and its emotional centre. Every feeling that's pumping through Chani's veins, from love and dedication to skepticism and disappointment, the audience experiences as well. The third: Butler's ferocious effort, which gets everyone shaking in a far different manner to his Academy Award-nominated stint as the king of rock 'n' roll. Indeed, with portrayals this potent, and everything seen and heard matching — the feature's technical feats are again impeccable and astounding — Dune: Part Two leaves its viewers saying thank you, thank you very much not only to this grand marvel and its predecessor, but to the potential for more spiciness to come."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"With Dune: Part Two, the Canadian [Villeneuve] no longer has to prove anything. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," The sheer scale and craft of Denis Villeneuve’s epic follow-up can’t be denied. Still, it’s hard to ignore the sense that a story like this ought to be a bit more confounding. Denis Villeneuve has a way with dread. The opening of his Oscar-nominated 2010 drama, Incendies, surveys a room full of child soldiers having their heads shaved for battle, a Kubrickian homage with a queasy mix of empathy and exploitation, scored by an anxious Radiohead anthem. Such sinister showmanship is the French Canadian filmmaker’s stock-in-trade, and since crossing over from Quebec to Hollywood, he’s applied his slow-burn methodology to bigger and bigger projects with mostly impressive results. The effectiveness of accomplished midrange thrillers like Prisoners and Sicario lies in their sense of steadily encroaching evil—the feeling that, no matter how bad things are getting, there’s something worse around the corner. Switching to sci-fi for Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 meant inflating the bad vibes to apocalyptic extremes. And if there’s a common denominator between Villeneuve’s two Dune movies—the second of which arrives slightly later than expected due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes—it’s their mix of tactile majesty and ambient, free-floating menace. Martin Scorsese once compared the MCU films to a theme park ride; at nearly three carefully distended hours, Dune: Part Two feels more like a funeral procession. Inertia creeps, moving up slowly. There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. The morbidity is baked into the material. Frank Herbert’s source novels were styled as allegories of sky-is-falling Cold War geopolitics, with anti-imperialist critiques and barely sublimated eco-horror themes. George Lucas made the original Star Wars in thrall to Dune; his achievement was effectively to depoliticize his predecessor’s ideologically loaded form of space opera. What Star Wars added to the equation was, well, a new hope—one that hybridized Herbert’s despairing vision with the circumspect, all-American heroism of old Westerns and gee-whiz serials, cute anthropomorphic robots, and Han Solo as a walking one-liner dispenser. The closest thing Dune has to Han Solo is Josh Brolin’s sardonic Gurney Halleck, a roughneck who doesn’t exactly have a lot of competition on Arrakis as the resident cutup. As one of the more solemn A-list filmmakers around, Villeneuve is temperamentally suited to this assignment. He’s the perfect tenant for such a jagged and cavernous intellectual property—a filmmaker more interested in reverence than renovation. He’s not liable to impose a personal vision like Alejandro Jodorowsky or David Lynch, whose reward for sweltering in Mexico for six months with Sting was a blank check to make the passion project that turned out to be Blue Velvet. Lynch’s Dune looks, in retrospect, like a noble failure, as well as an inspiring parable of the one-for-you, one-for-me variety. Villeneuve’s track record of box office and critical excellence means he exercises near-total control over both the selection and execution of his films, which is why it’s interesting—and a little disconcerting—that he seems content to remain a cog in the Dune machine. The genuine daring of his embarking on Part One without the guarantee of a sequel has shifted into a cozier sort of caretaking; after the movie grossed nearly half a billion dollars at the height of a global pandemic, he’ll get as many kicks at the can as he wants. Hence Part Two’s decidedly and defiantly open ending, which, for those keeping score at home, makes two strategic anticlimaxes in a row.  By way of recap: When we last saw the slender Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), he was hiding out in the remotest, most sandworm-infested regions of Arrakis with his pregnant mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), after their aristocratic bloodline, including Paul’s father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac), was all but wiped out in a sneak attack masterminded by the conquest-driven Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). Villeneuve’s decision at the end of Part One to cut off Paul’s story just as he was becoming indoctrinated in the Sunni-coded warrior sect known as the Fremen—delaying his prophesied evolution from a callow princeling to a revolutionary firebrand—was on one level an acknowledgment of the series’ epic scope. But it was also a canny commercial consideration. In an era of franchise overload, Part One’s relative reticence was refreshing: It actually left audiences wanting more.  How those viewers will feel when Part Two devotes so much of its first act to a form of doomy, slow-motion stasis is another question. Having done the hard work of world-building in the first installment, Villeneuve initially seems content to sort of just hang out amid the wreckage. The sequel opens with a tersely satisfying action set piece—a sunblasted skirmish between a group of Harkonnen henchmen and Paul’s not-so-merry band of Fremen associates, whose struggles against their more heavily armed adversaries are secondary to the ongoing conflict with their environment (although they’ve learned how to use their home turf to their advantage). Villeneuve is always good at gory details, and scenes where the Fremen literally drain the corpses of comrades and rivals alike for liquid resources have an icky, clinical fascination; the revelation of a reservoir filled with such recycled bodily fluids approaches a sort of mordant poetry. The Fremen are led by the soulful, battle-tested mystic Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who projects moral authority but still has some convincing to do about the white boy he’s taken under his wing. Specifically, he has to sell the idea that Paul, once properly radicalized, might grow up to be a mythic savior. Less ambivalent—and yet even more anxiously invested—is Chani (Zendaya), Paul’s potential lover and an emblem of her people’s wary regard for the ostensibly noble “Great Houses” that hover, literally and figuratively, over their resource-rich stomping grounds. This malevolent and capricious ruling class gets plenty of screen time in the form of returning characters like Harkonnen, a gelatinous grotesque given to submerging in oil baths, and the veiled kingmaker Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). New players include Austin Butler as Harkonnen’s cruel combat-fetishist nephew, Feyd-Rautha (floated by his uncle as a potential successor); Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan (a key player left out of Part One); and her father, Shaddam IV, a galactic emperor played endearingly and inevitably by Christopher Walken with the self-parodying shtick of one of his SNL sketches. To say this is a vast and charismatic ensemble is an understatement, and we haven’t even gotten to Léa Seydoux as a seductive and manipulative secret agent. If Villeneuve errs on the side of giving his actors stuff to do, his instincts are in the right place: Everybody here is talented and deserves screen time. But the characters are so instrumentalized by the demands of the plot—especially in its long, relentlessly crosscut midsection—that the actors feel marginalized, even when they’re supposed to be on display. Exhibit A would be Butler, who’s been duly hyped and given a properly demonic look (think Billy Corgan circa Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness plus a six-pack and minus eyebrows). Feyd-Rautha first shows up in a brutal and memorable monochrome gladiatorial sequence styled for maximum eyeball-searing impact. The problem is that the character doesn’t have anywhere to go from there, and neither does Butler. He cuts a menacing figure with a serpentine smile—and he does a mean Skarsgard impression—but that’s about it. As for the leads, Chalamet remains deceptively well-cast in a part that leverages his heartthrob status against more ambiguous qualities, while Ferguson bristles with just the right sphinxlike stoicism. (In this world, women are manipulative, impeccably dressed enigmas who exist to skeptically prod male worthiness.) There’s just enough thorniness in Paul and Jessica’s mother-son relationship to keep their scenes sharp, but they also have a surfeit of downtime: Both are subject to rituals that literally knock them out of commission for scenes at a time. These trials underline the physical and psychic perils of the Duneverse, which pushes even its powerful inhabitants to their limits. But the pileup of scenes depicting convalescence has another effect: It adds to the sense of a massive, formidable movie unable to get rolling, the cinematic equivalent of a Shai-Hulud stuck in neutral.  Such heavy-bottomed megatonnage is, on some level, an achievement in and of itself. Villeneuve’s recent comments about distrusting dialogue and wanting to make a silent movie are borne out by the eloquence of his best images (and unfortunately by his occasional struggles to make exposition interesting). When it comes to pure architectural or textural spectacle, Villeneuve may even be the equal of his spiritual predecessor Ridley Scott, with whom he shares an innate gift for conveying scale and building sequences for both spatial coherence and narrative tension. (When Paul proves his mettle by shanghaiing a passing sandworm, it’s pure white-knuckle kineticism.) As an artist, he’s also as hard to peg as Sir Ridley, whose hypnotic eye as a filmmaker belies the question of actual perspective—of what he sees in his material and whether it’s more than the simple promise of another project (or paycheck). This has not always been the case. If you were to go back beyond Incendies to Villeneuve’s absurdist French-language breakthrough Maelstrom, you’d discover a wacky and gratifyingly eccentric mash-up of myth and modernity, with some palpably personal storytelling flourishes. (The story is narrated by a dying fish, a choice inspired by the director’s battle with trout-inflicted food poisoning.) The director’s haunting true-crime drama Polytechnique, about the notorious 1989 Montreal massacre, undeniably imitated Gus Van Sant’s Palme d’Or–winning Elephant, but it was also the work of an inventive, experimental artist with something at stake. Even a short like the award-winning Next Floor—about a luxurious gourmet banquet gone awry—manifested as a knowing commentary on conspicuous consumption, angled slyly against the powers that be.  But for all its very real shock and awe, Dune: Part Two is ultimately too one-note to register as a trenchant commentary on real-world affairs, past or present. The Harkonnens are surely colonial bad guys but in a cartoony, indirect way, while the presentation of the Fremen as easily swayed religious fundamentalists is more about keeping the plot moving than interrogating dogma. Yes, the story is dark, but not in any particularly complex ways; its grimness is more like a factory setting. It’s a strange paradox that the bulkier Villeneuve’s movies get, the less gravitas they have. Not only that, but by burrowing so deeply into Herbert’s vision, he risks disappearing completely. Villeneuve’s directorial “touches” here don’t seem to have been made by human hands; it’s more like auteurism by algorithm. An existential question: What does a movie directed by a replicant look like?  This may all seem a little churlish for a movie that’s currently breaking Rotten Tomatoes records and is likely to clean up at the box office. As a feat of project management, Dune: Part Two is undeniable. But given how fundamentally bizarre the world of Dune is—or should be—critical consensus seems like an odd goal. Shouldn’t it be weirder? Villeneuve’s movie features so many sterling components—Greig Fraser’s drably elegant cinematography, Joe Walker’s shivery editing, Hans Zimmer’s wailing score—that it could be taken for a masterpiece, and yet its perfection is more dutiful than exhilarating. There’s definitely more story to be told, and while Villeneuve has proved himself as the right guy to tell it, it’d be nice to think (or imagine) that a filmmaker hailed for his consistency still has some surprises up his sleeve. Until then, the wait for Part Three, however long, will be steeped in ambiguous feelings—not quite dread, but not exactly excitement, either.

"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune film, released in 2021, ended with these words: “This is only the beginning.” It was a sudden conclusion that left some viewers frustrated. Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune film, released in 2021, ended with these words: “This is only the beginning.” It was a sudden conclusion that left some viewers frustrated. Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune film, released in 2021, ended with these words: “This is only the beginning.” It was a sudden conclusion that left some viewers frustrated. The story begins where the last film left off, on the desert planet Arrakis, which produces a substance called “the spice.” The indigenous inhabitants of the desert, the Fremen, revere the spice for its sacred properties but the occupying imperial powers need it to fuel interplanetary travel, making it the most valuable substance in the universe. As noble dynasties vie for power and wealth and the Emperor (an underused Christopher Walken) strategically sets them against each other, House Atreides, the occupying power on Arrakis, has been attacked by a rival house, led by the monstrous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). Paul Artreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have fled into the desert, where they are taken in by the Fremen. Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a Fremen leader and devoutly religious man, protects Paul. The warrior Chani (Zendaya), despite her mistrust of outsiders, mentors him, and the two fall in love. Chalamet, like his character, is growing into his role. Paul is troubled by dreams and visions and, especially, by the prophecies of his mother, who is becoming an increasingly unsettling character, thanks in part to ferocious work by Ferguson. Some of the Fremen see Paul as a long-prophesied religious messiah. Others hope he could be a revolutionary military and political leader. Paul must decide who he will become, but is his future predestined or is it chosen? There’s more. So much more: super-stylized gladiatorial combat, forcefully choreographed hand-to-hand fighting, precisely orchestrated battle scenes, religious strife, mystical poison, drop-ins by Anya Taylor-Joy, Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux. And sand worms. So many sand worms. (It helps to have read the book, or at least a Duniverse wiki, to fill in the sometimes abrupt junctures and gaps.) The characters and their emotions can feel remote and removed and solemn, though Bardem gets a little playful and Walken, as always, is just a bit off-kilter. There’s also a gleefully over-the-top embodiment of evil from Austin Butler as Baron Harkonnen’s nephew, a sadistic sociopath. (Now, instead of talking just like Elvis, Butler is talking just like Stellan Skarsgard, and it’s eerie.) Villeneuve, cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette pull off some extraordinary backdrops and set-pieces, drawing on such sources as Metropolis, Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now and more than a little Leni Riefenstahl. (House Harkonnen is very fascism-forward.) But these influences are absorbed into a universe that feels like its own thing. At a time when blockbusters have been getting more generic and flimsy, there’s a lot to be said for visuals that are not just textured and solid but sometimes genuinely surprising. Approaching Frank Herbert’s big ideas around authoritarianism, colonialism and capitalism and the human and environmental costs of resource extraction, Villeneuve sometimes struggles, but always in a sincere and valiant way. While Herbert’s books have been claimed by both the left and right, Villeneuve is veering progressive, in particular trying to handle what could be seen as a white-saviour narrative, with “The Boy from the Outer World,” as Paul is called by some, leading a planet’s Indigenous peoples to war. Villeneuve never quite sorts this issue out, but he does at least make some room for Chani’s skepticism about messianic religious thinking, supported by the character’s expanded role and Zendaya’s grounded performance. The film also allows for Paul’s continuing ambivalence about heroism and victory. For a big Hollywood blockbuster, Dune is unafraid to say some very dark things about religion, politics, power and violence. And for those who didn’t like the ending of the 2021 film, be warned: this second instalment is also prepared to leave some its biggest questions unresolved. Studying at the University of Winnipeg and later Toronto’s York University, Alison Gillmor planned to become an art historian. She ended up catching the journalism bug when she started as visual arts reviewer at the Winnipeg Free Press in 1992. While the war may be portrayed as a jaw-dropping spectacle, the answers to all those political and moral questions may leave the audience deeply uncomfortable. Herbert would be proud. It rivals 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road as a staggering, monumental achievement in genre filmmaking and reminds us what truly talented movie directors can do. Villeneuve’s great talent lies, I think, in invocation. He may be less perfect when it comes to conclusions but he’s brilliant at summoning — a sense of doom, a suddenly appeared spacecraft, a sandworm.

"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," Still, thanks to Villeneuve’s masterful direction, the aforementioned brilliant technical elements and a star-studded cast of actors who pour themselves into the material — you can practically see them shaking the sand out of their boots after a long day’s filming — “Dune Part 2” makes for a wondrous viewing experience. To invoke the cliché because it’s apt, if at all possible you should see it on the largest possible screen in one of those Dolby theaters with “seat transducers” that vibrate in sync with the action on the screen. “Dune: Part Two” picks up shortly after the events of the first film and introduces two more key characters to an already crowded field: Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (a disappointingly muted Christopher Walken), who are concerned that Paul Atreides may still be alive after they conspired with the psychic witches known as the Bene Gesserit and the Harkonnens to destroy the House of Atreides. Meanwhile, on the desert planet Arrakis, the Skywalker-esque Paul has struck up a friendship that could blossom into romance with the brave and plucky and quick-witted Freman warrior Chani (Zendaya) and has demonstrated such skill and acumen that Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of a Freman tribe, has come to believe Paul is the prophecy fulfilled — a messiah who can lead the Freman to prosperity and peace. (Others strongly believe such a claim is heresy. It’s all very New Testament-y.) It’s unclear if Paul truly is the Chosen One, but he has continued to master the special powers and skills he was just learning from his mother in the first “Dune,” and he’s also leaning into his role as a fierce warrior who can command an army and is willing to take on the bloodthirsty and power-hungry Baron Harkonnen and the baron’s perhaps even more terrifying and destructive nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, who is played by a bald-headed Austin Butler, and congratulations to the greatly talented Austin for finally shedding that Elvis accent, good on you! (A “Gladiator”-esque arena battle pitting Feyd-Rautha against multiple opponents is an action highlight of the film.) With so many characters to juggle, some of them, e.g., Pugh’s Princess Irulan, are thinly drawn and get scarce screen time. On the plus side, Javier Bardem as Stilgar and Josh Brolin as Paul’s former mentor, the swashbuckling Gurney Halleck, are scene-stealing forces every time they pop up. Chalamet and Zendaya have a lovely chemistry in their quiet moments together; they would make for a power rom-com couple for sure. Even when “Dune: Part Two” gets a bit lost in the weeds, or should we sands, of the plot, it’s an impressive and at times gloriously beautiful piece of work."

"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE," The three-year gap between Denis Villeneuve’s two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel Dune has clearly been well spent. Dune: Part Two turns up the visual spectacle, layers its characters, and peers more closely at the intersection between prophecy, politics and individual will. The sci-fi fantasy films are set in the distant future. Various feudal houses have pledged their allegiance to the Padishah Emperor. A precious commodity called spice makes interstellar travel possible. Spice is found only on the remote planet Arrakis, and is guarded by giant sandworms and the guerilla Fremen tribe. At the end of Dune, Paul Atreidis (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) were among the few survivors of an attack on Arrakis. Dispatched to Arrakis to mine the spice, the Atreidis clan found itself to be the target of an assassination plot hatched by rival Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). Paul and Jessica took shelter with the Fremen. The events were partly foreseen by Paul in his dreams and partly manipulated by Jessica, a member of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood that has been influencing events from the shadows for centuries. In Dune: Part Two, written by Villeneuve and Joe Spaihts, Paul goes native. He pursues his attraction for Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) and earns the trust of Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Paul also learns to handle the sandworms. Meanwhile, Jessica channels her Bene Gesserit skills to present Paul as the promised messiah who will bring peace and prosperity to Arrakis. Stilgar firmly believes in the prophecy, while the secular-minded Chani has her doubts. The debate between mystical beliefs and optics – is Paul indeed the long-awaited saviour or merely the product of Bene Gesserit stage management? – takes place alongside the efforts of new players to address the fall of House Atreidis. These include Irulan (Florence Pugh), the daughter of the Padishah Emperor (Christopher Walken), the Baron’s nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), and Margot (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit member in the Emperor’s court. Villeneuve pulls off a complicated dance between occult practices and hard realpolitik with panache. Except for a slightly rushed extended climax, Dune: Part Two is smoother than its predecessor, even as it is denser. Ideas that were deliberately left hanging in the first movie come sharply into view. Paul’s journey isn’t as clear-cut as he thought it would be. Ambiguous family ties, hidden motives and manipulation of Fremen loyalty add to the levels of intrigue. The 166-minute sequel has been released in regular and IMAX formats. The stunning compositions range from maximalist widescreen frames to intense close-ups. Reuniting with cinematographer Greig Fraiser, production designer Patrice Vermette and music composer Hans Zimmer, Villeneuve pays as much attention to the action set pieces as to the intimate encounters. The sense of immersion in a make-believe world is never stronger than in the scenes involving the sandworms – the exhilarating Fremen version of a bullet train. Especially on an IMAX screen, Dune: Part Two’s improved images appear cleaner than the previous movie, as though someone rubbed the sand stuck to the camera lens. The contrast with the forbiddingly monochrome Harkonnen realm is stark. But the movie doesn’t present a good-and-evil binary. Dune novelist Herbert Frank was heavily influenced by Middle Eastern cultures. Tucked into Dune: Part Two’s grandiose staging is a cautionary tale of imperialist tendencies, the hidden impulses behind war, and the perils of following a single, messianic voice. “Power is power,” said a wise woman in the fantasy series Game of Thrones. Dune: Part Two has several prominent female characters who aid or hinder events. Zendaya’s Chani comes into her own, emerging as Paul’s equal as well as his conscience keeper. Along with Rebecca Ferguson’s Jessica and Florence Pugh’s Irulin, Chani looks set to play a key role in the proposed Dune: Part 3. Timothée Chalamet too grows into his role as a reluctant rebel. The sequel makes room for humour. Stilgar’s fervent appeals to Paul to embrace his inner messiah gives Javier Bardem some fine moments and a brooding, stately narrative a much-needed touch of levity."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune 2 is a visually stunning epic best consumed by those willing to invest in its world&#46;
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," *I rewatched Lynch’s Dune somewhat recently** on the Arrow-released 4K set. I quite enjoyed it for what it is. (Also, my friend Max wrote a great and extremely thorough book about it.) The last time I saw it was when it was on HBO in, I’d assume, 1985. Back then I only watched it because of Sting. At the time I assumed Sting was the main character. He is not. Like in this adaptation, Feyd takes a long time to show up. (**I just looked up what I apparently consider “somewhat recently.” According to Letterboxd I last watched David Lynch’s Dune in September of 2021, almost two and a half years ago. I truly have no concept of time anymore.) Look, a lot of people loved 2021’s Dune. I remember being mixed: impressed with the gall of even trying to make an adaptation of a book that so many people have declared unfilmable, but also realizing I just sat through two and a half hours of character introduction and exposition. To be clear, beautiful-looking character introductions and exposition, but character introductions and exposition nonetheless. On Villeneuve’s press tour for his first Dune, here was the first half of a movie, with no ending, that despite it all was getting almost universal acclaim and would wind up with a Best Picture nomination, and instead of taking a victory lap, even he was like, Just wait for the next one. He was right. You’re going to see people throw around the word “masterpiece” about Dune: Part Two and I’m not going to sit here and tell you they are wrong. It very well might be. (I would say, ask me in a year.) But Dune: Part Two is certainly up there with some of the best science fiction movies I’ve ever seen. And yeah, turns out Dune is certainly a filmable movie. Dune: Part Two, unsurprisingly, picks up where Dune left off – Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), walking off with the Freman on the desert planet of Arrakis, a planet of great interest to many warring factions as the only producer of Spice, which is both a mind opening drug and fuel. (Imagine if a canister of Pennzoil could also produce the effects of LSD.) Leading the Freman is Stilgar, who is convinced Paul is a messiah who will lead the Freman to victory in vanquishing the Harkonnen, eventually commanded by Feyd, from Arrakis. A fellow Freman, Chani (Zendaya), thinks Paul becoming a messiah is bunk (Paul tends to agree) as the two fight alongside each other and a romance develops. Getting too much more into the weeds of the plot of Dune seems like a fool’s errand. The people who know it, well they already know it. And the people who don’t, it doesn’t tend to lend itself into an easy summary of events. And, of course, the book containing so many parallels with our world’s dependency on fossil fuels, and who strives and suffers, as a result has been well documented. Also of note, which is kind of out there now, but Dune: Part Two doesn’t wrap itself up at the end. Villeneuve has tentative plans to make Dune: Messiah, though no script is finished and nothing has been green-lit. And Villeneuve wants to take a few years away from Dune anyway, so it will be awhile. Dune: Messiah takes place 12 years after the events of these movies, so he has some time.  Though, it will be interesting to see how Dune: Part Two performs. The first movie did well, with the disclaimer “all things considered.” Meaning people were still skittish about movie theaters and, maybe more importantly, Dune hit HBO Max on the same day it was released in theaters. There will be no “all things considered“ this time. So, for the foreseeable future, people are just going to have to be satisfied with having, finally, both parts of the definitive film adaptation of Dune. A movie, again, many people will call a masterpiece. And, again, they might just be right. "
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"In an age of ever-increasing runtimes, it’s a rare achievement that the film’s 166-minute length feels earned."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Everything that Dune was is visibly redoubled in Dune Part Two. The film is an amalgamation of Frank Herbert's unique vision, director Denis Villeneuve's penchant for finding variety and depth in the visceral, cinematographer Greig Fraser's incredible eye for detail in large-scale compositions, production design of the highest order and a magnificent ensemble cast that is perfectly in tune with the spirit of a super ambitious cinematic project that does not leave a single speck of sand unturned. The action-packed sequel to Villeneuve's 2021 film is sci-fi filmmaking at its very best. The writer-director delivers a fully realised universe and a stunning visual canvas populated with perfectly etched characters. Rarely is a follow-up to a film this invigorating and immersive. Dune Part Two is a triumph of both staging and pacing. It is richly detailed and arrestingly structured. With all the exposition having been taken care of in the relatively sluggish Dune, Dune Part Two hits the ground running and it keeps galloping at the kind of frenetic pace that ensures that even at nearly three hours it does not feel like a long movie. Stray parts of Dune Part Two are inevitably confounding - it isn't without reason that Frank Herbert's 1965 novel was once thought to be unfilmable, a fact proven beyond an iota of doubt by David Lynch's disastrous Dune (1984) - but Villeneuve is able to devise a method of delivery that never seems straining for effect. Hans Zimmer's score enhances the operatic rhythm of the film. It works not only as a string of compositions but, like the rhythms of the desert setting, as an integral part of the aural design of Dune Part Two. What could be more exhilarating than the sight of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) taming a rampaging sandworm and riding it? Dune Part Two has no dearth of such surprises, not the least of which is the transformation of Austin Butler into a ruthless nephew of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) who thrives on wreaking havoc. The film sweeps one away with its scale and spectacle, but its epic proportions do not snuff out the human elements embedded in the narrative. Villeneuve finds a very visual way of conveying his abiding interest in the characters and the setting. Even in the most extreme of close-ups, the landscape, be it the desert bathed in a golden and russet glow or the Harkonnen home world bleached out by a black sun, isn't removed from the visual equation. It always lurks in the background. The reverse is equally true - the people we see in the drama, whether they are merely talking or are engaged in grand and explosive action, never lose their centrality. Dune Part Two kicks off in the immediate aftermath of the events seen in its precursor and evolves into a powerful and enthralling epic that brings the first novel of Dune series to a close. The narrative cauldron that Villeneuve rustles up crackles with energy. The characters, at least the ones at the centre of the action, pulsate with life. Paul Atreides and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) seek to secure their well-being among the Fremen, inhabitants of the desert planet Arrakis, known for its spice, as they plan to settle scores with the evil Harkonnens. There are many smaller battles to be fought before Paul can well and truly claim his place under the sun. Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the Emperor of the Known Universe, has teamed up with Baron Harkonnen and his family, which includes the pitiless Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), to help the latter wrest back control of Arrakis and hasten the fall of House Astreides. The inhospitable Arrakis, home to the Fremen tribe, is a prized planet because it is the only one among thousands that produces spice. Harvesting the spice is tough and fraught with great risk because of the giant worms underneath the surface. Stilgar (Javier Bardem), leader of the Fremen, believes that Paul is the outsider who is prophesied to bring peace and prosperity to his people. But not everybody is convinced. Not even Paul himself. He takes nothing for granted and seeks to assimilate himself with the Fremen to earn their trust. Paul's Bene Gesserit mother, part of an order of women who dream of power and control over the world that they inhabit - and places beyond the physical dimensions of it - has her own ideas. Friction ensues between the two as also between Paul and his mentor Gurney (Josh Brolin). Dune Part Two revolves around the young protagonist thrust into a role that is far bigger than the individual he is. Paul must figure out for himself what he is ordained to be and play his part without succumbing to the imperfections that the human flesh is heir to. Paul is hobbled by doubt but he is conditioned to keep fear at bay. Will he succeed is embracing his destiny? ""Fear is the little death that brings obliteration,"" Lady Jessica had said to him in Dune. A significant portion of Part Two is devoted to the young man finding his way forward even as misgivings snap at his heels. In the process, Dune Part Two delivers ceaseless action. The screenplay by Villeneuve and John Spaihts not only gets totally into the spirit of Herbert's dense, complex tale, it also punctuates the conversations and elaborate world-building with sharp character development on one hand and eye-popping, high-octane sequences on the other. The coming-of-age theme of Dune continues here and, at an early enough juncture, gives way to a love story. Chani (Zendaya), seen mainly in visions that Paul has in the first film, steps forward and occupies a far larger stage in Dune Part Two. Zendaya figures prominently in the film's most watchable parts. Zendaya shines brighter than almost everybody else in the cast barring Rebecca Ferguson. The two actors convey a spectrum of emotions and psychological nuances that gives the action a wide-ranging register as well as recesses where it can stop awhile. Two other women - Princess Irulan, the Emperor's daughter played by Florence Pugh, and Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit woman played by Lea Seydoux - have lesser roles in the film but they are second to none in terms of the impression that they make. The ending of Dune Part Two is an improvement on the abrupt denouement of the first film, but it might still leave many in the audience a tad dissatisfied. On the positive side, it points to what Villeneuve has always had in mind - a trilogy. That is a tantalizing thought - Dune Messiah, the second novel in the series of sci-fi books, is even less filmable. Given what Villeneuve has achieved with Dune and Dune Part Two, there is no reason to believe another visual treat isn't on the cards."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,An impressive second half to Denis Villeneuve&#8217;s sci-fi epic progresses the dense plot instead of just laying the groundwork&#46; It worms its way through imposing narrative obstacles with spicy directorial choices that may be commonly misinterpreted&#46;&#160;
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," In the interest of complete honesty, I was not looking forward to Dune: Part Two for a very specific reason: Dune: Part One bored me stiff. Frank Herbert’s novel, on which the movies are based, is notoriously complicated, and the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s screen adaptation felt like two-and-a-half hours of dull exposition. Happily, and to my great surprise, the second installment is significantly better, with more action and character development. It seems pretty clear that Part One was the movie they had to make in order to do the one they really wanted to make. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) has joined forces with Chani (Zendaya) to wrestle back control of the planet Arrakis, which is rich with valuable spices. That means taking on the sinister Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). He also strives to prove he is the “Chosen One” believed by many people, including friend Stilgar (Javier Bardem), to be a prophesied savior. Rebecca Ferguson and Josh Brolin return as, respectively, Paul’s mother Jessica and his mentor Gurney, and Florence Pugh joins the cast as Irulan, a princess whose ultimate connection to Paul is best left unrevealed for those who don’t already know. With all the set-up out of the way, Dune: Part Two is free to delve fully into Paul’s journey. The concept of him becoming a savior is handled in a compelling manner, with suggestions that it comes with a potential downside to match the benefits. His parallel romantic relationship with Chani builds to a dramatic resolution between them that furthers the complexity of the situation. And although her arc isn’t explored as deeply, Jessica undergoes a change that adds meaning to her son’s odyssey. Rather than endless scenes of characters being introduced, the film lets those characters start to do things. The story is energized as a result. Action scenes are plentiful this time. A sequence where Paul rides one of the massive desert sandworms is thrilling, as is his combined effort with Chani to shoot down armed vehicles flying above them. Visually speaking, a black-and-white gladiator-type fight featuring Fayd-Rautha is a highlight, offering style to match the stunningly choreographed violence. Accentuating these scenes are some of the most impressive special effects in recent memory. They don’t look like obvious CGI, a trait that lets them infuse Dune: Part Two with a sense of grandeur and scope. The performances are strong across the board. Chalamet does amazing minimalist acting in the first two-thirds, so that his more forceful turn during the finale packs the necessary punch. Butler is the other standout, making Fayd-Rautha a bald, pasty-white, perpetually sneering menace. He’s genuinely kind of scary. Herbert’s tale has always been a little self-serious. That’s true here, too, but the first-rate cast helps the themes related to faith and destiny shine through. Because of the denseness of the source material, certain aspects of the movie are streamlined and therefore feel a bit thin, especially the stuff with Gurney. Irulan, meanwhile, is present largely to verbally advance plot points, despite being nicely portrayed by the always excellent Pugh. For whatever flaws it has, Dune: Part Two is an improvement over its predecessor. Increased action, a non-lethargic pace, and those incredible sandworms won me over, against the odds.  Dune: Part Two is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some suggestive material, and brief strong language. The running time is 2 hours and 46 minutes."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"The world of Dune remains intriguingly complex, full of characters whose roles shift and evolve. Credit Villeneuve with filling the screen with enough exotic flavor and bold action to keep Dune vividly alive through two helpings. "

Filled with breathtaking images, stunning action and a story that transcends the science fiction genre, it brings to life Frank Herbert’s celebrated 1965 novel in a way I never thought possible. It’s a beautifully realized film, but it isn’t quite perfect. It is the completion of a two-part story about the rise to power of Duke Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). The emperor of the known universe Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) has given the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, to Paul’s father Duke Leto Atreides (played by Oscar Isaac in the first part) after the greedy and psychotic Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) has failed to maintain spice production yet has somehow become filthy rich. Although considered a dry, useless planet sparsely populated by desert tribes known as Fremen and held at bay by gigantic sand worms known as Shai-Hulud, the planet has become extremely valuable because of the abundance of a spice melange, This spice is vital to commerce between planets because it gives Spacing Guild Navigators the ability to conduct interstellar travel. It can also extend life and, among a few select individuals, provide extrasensory visions. In an epic betrayal, Baron Harkonnen sends his Sardaukar Shock Trooops to attack the Baron Atreides, killing him and destroying his royal presence on Arrakis. But, during the attack, Paul escapes with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is discovered to be pregnant. This is pivotal because Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a sect of female mystics who have used highly attuned mental and physical powers to help shape the bloodlines of influential families throughout the politically aligned planets. As Part Two opens, Paul and his mother have been taken in by the Fremen and discover their very existence may be interwoven with an ancient prophesy and complex offworld politics. During his time with the Fremen, Paul has had visions of a young Freman woman, named Chani (Zendaya). Now that he is among them, he discovers she is vital to his understanding of these desert tribal ways. It is here that “Dune: Part Two” displays its most nagging flaw. While the Fremen are clearly evolved from Muslim or other desert tribal people, mixed by author Frank Herbert into a futuristic amalgamation, the people themselves clearly exhibit ethnic customs and features, yet they speak in flat American English accents and even resort to this era’s use of idioms and profanity. All except Javier Bardem’s Spanish tones in his role as the Fremen Stilgar. Given that the people on these various planets have developed alliances and conflicts over hundreds of years across the vastness of space one would think their identities rooted in complex religions, politics, and technology would desperately want to hold onto their ethnic fiefdoms. Still, “Dune: Part Two” is an awesome film to watch and to listen to as well. Composer Hans Zimmer’s score puts a sand worm-sized bite into your consciousness with its multi-layered tones and hard impact musical references.

"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE," If the first film set the table, scratching the surface of this characters and world, then “Dune Part: Two” is the full course meal – a sweeping sci-fi epic with top notch storytelling and even better craftsmanship. It’s a film where Villeneuve has raised the stakes and picked up the pace, resulting in one of the best films in the genre in recent memory. “Part Two” picks up with Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) uniting with Chani (Zendeya) and the rest of the Freman after the violent coup to overthrow his family orchestrated by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Paul tries to mount a plan to seek revenge for his father while wrestling with the belief from some Freman see him as the messiah. As Paul continues his quest to confront the Baron and the Emperor (Christopher Walken), who allowed his family to be destroyed, his transition from timid young man to possible leader of a revolution takes place – putting his blossoming romance with Chani in jeopardy. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts do an excellent job of adapting Herbert’s complex story that features this expansive desert-like world full of rich, larger-than-life characters. Chalamet brings Paul’s conflict to screen quite effectively, making this hero one who seems to be more in a moral gray area than clearly black or white (much like most of the characters in this film). Javier Bardem brings some well-needed comedic moments for the audience in his role as Freman tribe leader Silgar, while Zendeya perfectly gives the film its much needed moral compass. There are some new additions that shine as well, including Florence Pugh as the emperor’s daughter. However, it’s Austin Butler – barely recognizable as the Baron’s sadistic nephew – who really stands out in a role that deserves award consideration. His character’s entrance is perhaps one of the signature moments of a film full of epic visuals and action sequences. Villeneuve has crafted a film that is full of those epic sequences, a truly immersive experience where the reins have been loosened and the man behind the latest “Blade Runner” and “The Arrival” has been allowed to truly put his talents on display. This is a film that is a poster child for the theatrical experience – a world unlike anyone has ever seen that is at times simply breath taking. Like the first film, “Part Two” does leave plenty on the table – with a third installment likely to come (although a date has yet to be announced). What really makes this film special is that it serves as both an excellent standalone and just a small piece of a greater story that still has more to tell. Villeneuve has raised the bar with “Dune: Part Two,” which now takes its place not just as the quintessential adaptation of the beloved novel – but one of the top level series in its genre."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Time seemed to slow down a great deal during the initial COVID emergency, and the slowness with which it geared up again has had an odd effect on most people’s inner clocks. The arrival of Dune: Part Two feels aeons removed from Part One, though that prior installment was released just 2.5 years ago—which made it one of the first big, expensive blockbuster-type films to open in theaters after their forced closure, when many viewers were reluctant to return. (Of course, some still are, or simply fell out of the habit enough that they won’t come back.) That mentally expanded gap probably explains my muted reaction to Deux, having thought the first one among the strongest of modern sci-fi fantasy popcorn epics, but being a bit mysteriously underwhelmed by this followup. Honestly, I don’t think it’s the film’s fault—it’s more that 30 months is a long pause after which to pick up a complicated narrative where you left off. No doubt many fans have already done a preparatory rewatch of the 2021 film, or even renewed their acquaintance with the book (which I read a loooooong time ago). Doing a little such homework wouldn’t be a bad idea before hitting the multiplex this time. In any case, we’re back on desert planet Arrakis, where the profoundly desirable “Spice” (a magically powerful resource rather more valuable than, say, garam masala) is harvested by argumentative warring offshore entities—to the considerable annoyance and oppression of the Fremen, who actually live there. Thus the latter were wary, to say the least, when foreign princeling Paul Atreides (Timothy Chalamet) turned up in flight from his noble family’s war with the evil Harkonnens, He and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) are pretty much the last survivors of their clan’s brutal slaughter by those bad guys (including Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista). Which is tough luck. But it doesn’t make Arrakians more inclined to accept that their uninvited visitors are some kind of long-foretold saviors come at last to free the Fremen. Of course, they are exactly that, the discovery that mom is pregnant adding another layer of prophetic something-or-other. Part One was impressive for being so engrossing despite its intrigue being mostly buildup for the climactic events/action yet to come. (The reason the two films were made separately—rather than in one prolonged effort a la Lord of the Rings—was because the bleak specter of David Lynch’s 1984 Dune, an expensive and much-ridiculed flop, made it seem wise to proceed one costly budgetary outlay at a time.) Two is thus more action-oriented, with payoffs for elements just teased previously, like generous views of the gigantic sandworms. The Harkonnens arrive en masse in their hulking black steel vehicles and black armor to kill off the pesky Fremen’s guerrilla forces. A battle or three down the line, the latter camp gradually begins to allow that floppy-haired Paul may indeed be their designated warrior and spiritual leader. This is a bit of an upset, because they don’t really have leaders—their society is based on equality. Between the Triumph of the Will-like fascist configurations of the bad guys and the Chosen One status of our hero, Dune is not the kind of fantasy that truly cares much for equality. Its innate humorlessness—certainly compared to a sci-fi mythology like that of Star Wars, which no doubt was influenced by Frank Herbert’s original novels—tends to particularly underline this time around that Paul is your classic blue-blooded young white male whose unasked-for Specialness decrees he’ll rescue a more dark-complected, “primitive” people, like Lawrence of Arabia with a laser gun. This may be a “thinking man’s” $200 million dollar sci-fi action movie, but still: Better not to think about it too much. Part Two has a lot going for it, but as you struggle to recall the context for various ongoing royal disputes and subterfuges (involving characters played by a shaven-headed Austin Butler in Sting’s old role, plus Florence Pugh, Lea Seydoux, Charlotte Rampling, and a bewilderingly out-of-place Christopher Walken), it’s disappointing that the two stressed major story themes are rather dull, and undermined by lack of casting spark.  Every tax-deductible donation helps us grow to cover the issues that mean the most to our community. Become a 48 Hills Hero and support the only daily progressive news source in the Bay Area. One is the recurrent “He is Our Savior!”/“No he’s not!!” debate, which rests a bit heavily on Chalamet’s thin shoulders—he seems better equipped to front a retro hipster band like The Strokes than to, y’know, fulfill an Ancient Prophecy and liberate an entire planet. The other is the romance between Paul and Zendaya as Chani, a young Fremen fighter reluctant to admit “My boyfriend is the Second Coming.” Their relationship hits the same pining-but-conflicted notes over and over, minus the performance chemistry to keep that dynamic interesting. Nonetheless, Dune: Part Two is a quality 21st-century Hollywood behemoth, making good use of good actors (Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin also figure significantly) if hardly taxing their resources. Denis Villeneuve expertly stages the somewhat unwieldy plot, which provides more propulsion than did his somewhat ponderous prior stabs at sci-fi grandeur (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival). They felt stifled by the same aesthetic that is wholly apt here, as if the director were unconsciously edging towards Herbert’s sandy worlds all along. It’s a big, busy spectacle that earns its self-importance (and nearly three-hour length) with a tenor that feels closer to Spartacus or Ben-Hur than your average Marvel flick. And as those prestige epics of yore were enlarged yea further by the imperial symphonics of Alex North and Miklos Rozsa, so here composer Hans Zimmer pushes for big, bigger, biggest. Indeed, between his score and the equally thundering sound design, Part Two might be mistaken for reviving Sensurround, the mid-Seventies gimmick that literally made theater seats rattle for movies like Earthquake and Rollercoaster. Going with a “less is more” principal by contrast is the depiction of privileged Harkonnen perversity, which Lynch pushed to homophobic and pustule-popping extremes in his ill-starred swing at this material. Here, uber-toned psychotic Butler and latex-laden, Jabba-like Skarsgard are the Laurel & Hardy of space Caligulas. Still, their sadistic cruelties are mostly, mercifully left to our queasy imaginations. Part One was delayed by COVID, this sequel by last fall’s Hollywood strikes. Bad timing aside, both deliver fantastical big-budget entertainment of above-average taste and intelligence, not elevating themselves above mainstream demands yet raising the bar a little. While you may be temporarily half-deaf after Dune: Part Two, you won’t feel like you’ve sacrificed any brain cells. If this conclusion to the saga (or at least to its first opus…god knows there’s plenty more Frank Herbert where that came from) didn’t seem quite as exciting a culmination as I’d anticipated, chalk that up to a rusty memory, which had already largely buried Pt. 1. Those who want to avoid spending a fair amount of these 166 minutes wondering “Who are these characters again? What’s their interplanetary conflict?” might consider doing a quick synopsis review of the 2021 film before plunking down your sequel moolah. Dune: Part Two opens in theaters nationwide Fri/1. A visual (and perhaps audio) antidote to Dune’s alternating desert earth tones and fascistic monochromes is They Shot the Piano Player, a new animated feature from the makers of 2010’s Chico and Rita. This is another ode to a historic Latin jazz milieu, although rather than being a fictive love story of Batista-era Havana, it’s a “docudrama” about a present-day journalist whose New Yorker article about the sixties bossa nova craze leads him to obsessively research a long-forgotten pianist preserved only in scattered recordings. He was struck not only that distinctive samba-jazz pianist Francisco Tenorio Jr. had largely been erased from music history, but that his exit—“disappeared” at age 34 in 1976, amidst Argentina’s violent military dictatorship—was further obscuring, his body never found. This latest collaboration between two veteran Spanish talents, director Fernando Trueba (Belle Epoch) and artist/designer Javier Mariscal, reprises Chico’s eye-popping visual appeal. The line-drawing style itself if just serviceable, but what makes the movie is the bold vibrancy of the colors they’re filled in with. It’s like a steam bath in hothouse hues, providing just as much sensory joy as the music heard. But rewarding as it is in many ways, Shot is also somewhat hemmed in by its reportorial-investigation narrative, which isn’t that absorbing. It also has a terribly distracting element in that real-life writer Jeff Harris’ character is voiced onscreen by Jeff Goldblum, whose voice is so singular that we can never forget the actor’s presence for a moment. (The casting makes honorific sense because Goldblum, too, is a jazz pianist—but that voice is as jarringly distinctive as Jimmy Durante’s.) When we eventually learn Tenorio Jr.’s fate—suffice it to say his torturer-killer eventually confesses, fearing little consequence so late in the game—it is very sad, if unsurprising. Sad in particular because the musician had been scrupulously apolitical, so his death was wholly unnecessary even by the brutal logic of military dictatorships. But the lack of surprise makes these 103 minutes feel longer, with a digressive narrative progress that could’ve been much more compactly told, especially given its detective-mystery genre tilt. Jazz and samba aficionados will be gratified not just by the music, but by the number of players and composers interviewed by Harris (or heard in archival audio) including such luminaries as Gilberto Gil, Milton Nascimento and Joao Gilberto. Fans of their sounds will be ecstatic. I’ll admit that when things got a little repetitious for my taste both sonically and plot-wise, I just zoned out and drank in the spectrum of saturated tropical colors Mariscal lays out for us like an ocular feast. They Shot the Piano Player opens Fri/1 at the Opera Plaza Cinemas in SF. 48 Hills welcomes comments in the form of letters to the editor, which you can submit here.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," I’ll open my review of Dune: Part 2 on the same note I began my critique of the first Dune, 28 months, half a pandemic and one Hollywood strike ago: I want more. More of Timothée Chalamet’s brooding warrior-prince Paul Atreides, last of a noble household. More of Josh Brolin’s troubadour/weapons master turned smuggler Gurney Halleck. More Javier Bardem as Stilgar, a desert leader torn between pragmatism and idolatry as he tutors Paul in the ways of his people, even as he falls under the spell of young man’s messianic mysticism. More of Zendaya’s Chani, matching her betrothed in strength and passion. And I want it all from director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve, who delivered a stunning, stirring part one and does not disappoint one iota in this second chapter. (He eschews the term “sequel,” and who am I to argue?) It may sound strange to speak of a $100-million-plus studio property as having a personal touch, but only Villeneuve could have made this Dune. Others have tried, including Alejandro Jodorowsky, Ridley Scott and Peter Berg; all found the task beyond them. David Lynch’s Dune, the only one to reach fruition, arrived at best truncated and half-formed. Take Villeneuve’s continued fascination with modes of communication, on full display in the 2016 alien first contact story Arrival, and to a lesser but vital extent in Blade Runner 2049, with Ryan Gosling’s “cells interlinked” mantra. Dune is mostly in English for the benefit of viewers, but it includes snatches of the Fremen tongue spoken on the desert planet Arrakis; the more guttural dialect of the power-hungry house of Harkonnen; at least one non-verbal sign language; The Voice, a kind of hypnotic cadence that demands obeyance; and whatever language crashes over the film’s opening seconds, sounding like a death-metal bassist doing battle with a Harley Davidson. “Power over spice is power over all,” it intones. In case you’d forgotten. In a recent chat with journalists, Villeneuve revealed that he’d sent his actors to Fremen language school, and employed a dialect coach on set to ensure consistency of accents. “It sounds like a real language because it is one,” he said. Villeneuve also has a way of reinventing science-fiction tropes so cemented in our minds that you didn’t think they could be done any other way. In the first Dune, he jettisoned pew-pew lasers in favour of a new take on the 19th-century Martian heat rays of H.G. Wells. This time out we get an early scene of sort-of jetpacks, as a group of Harkonnen soldiers half-climb, half-float up a cliff face — before being brutally taken down by am ambushing Fremen force. Oh, and my favourite, fireworks blossoming in the sky like plasmic soap bubbles. We’ve had the same basic firework design here on Earth, in fiction and reality, since at least the 1680s. Villeneuve has found a way to make them burst anew. Dune: Part 2 picks up directly where Dune left off. Paul’s family has been betrayed and splintered by the power-hungry Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellen Skarsgard), whose retinue includes Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), a real psychopath, motivated by “desire and humiliation” as one character notes, and a kissing cousin to Joaquin Phoenix’s Emperor Commodus from Gladiator. There’s also an actual Emperor of the galaxy, played by Christopher Walken, and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). They help set the scene in the opening of the film, and will prove pivotal before it wraps up two and three quarter hours later. (A long time, yet somehow also not long enough; did I mention how badly I want Part Three?) Much of the action takes place on Arrakis — delightfully, someone will call the planet Dune before the film is over — as Paul joins the indigenous Fremen tribes in ousting the Harkonnen, whose power is matched only by their overconfidence. “Our resources are limited,” Paul says at one point. “Fear is all we have.” It might just be enough, especially as he’s helped by his mother (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of a religious order that’s been quietly pulling political strings for centuries. Bardem’s character, barely there in the first film, plays a larger role in this one as he tries to convince his people that Paul is the messiah they’ve been waiting for. Sometimes he resorts to tautological reasoning. “The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi,” he declares at one point of Paul’s alleged divinity, a real deified if you do, deified if you don’t moment. Zendaya’s character is more suspicious of this zealotry, but even she can see that Paul — or Muad’Dib as he starts to call himself, taking the name of a tiny, sturdy desert mouse — is both a skilled tactician and a natural (if not necessarily supernatural) leader. It doesn’t hurt that he manages to ride one of the giant sand worms of Arrakis, the SeaDoos of the desert. Though for his part, Paul is stricken with visions of the future, and a holy war he will inadvertently spark and then prove unable to quench. There are many moving parts in Dune: Part 2, but Villeneuve, who absorbed the novels of Frank Herbert as a teenager and has been ruminating on them ever since, proves more than equal to the task of bringing this story to the screen. There are even moments of sly humour in the film. When Stilgar is explaining to Paul how to survive in the desert, he warns the younger man to beware of the centipedes. The big ones are harmless, he tells his protege/prophet. It’s the little ones you have to fear. But as he says this, he holds his hands out at a distance that suggests the “little” centipedes are bigger than you’d think. That’s Dune for you; more than you’d expect.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," “Dune: Part Two” (2024) – “It’s been a while since you’ve had one of those nightmares,” Chani (Zendaya) says and asks, “Tell me, what was it about?” This exchange opens Warner Bros. Pictures’ “Dune: Part Two, Official Trailer 3”, and director/co-writer Denis Villeneuve’s dream project – his science fiction cinematic vision adapted from Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel – continues in theatres on Feb. 29, 2024, more than a while since his first film’s release on Oct. 22, 2021.  “Dune: Part Two” – listed with a 166-minute runtime but ended after 156, according to this critic’s watch – offers a deliberately leisure pace for “Dune” fanatics, “Dune” novices, and everyone in between to absorb the grandeur and pageantry of a story between good and evil, oppressors and underdogs, and choice versus fate, all on a faraway desert planet called Arrakis in the year 10191.  Villeneuve’s follow-up follows right after the events of his 2021 predecessor.  He leans into the regal formalities of Paul’s journey toward (possibly) transforming into a messiah for the Fremen, desert dwellers who spend their lives fighting the Harkonnen, a chalky-white race, hell-bent on military might and controlling spice production on the planet. Paul copes with the fallout of slaying Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) – at the end of the first film – and the Fremen are divided, between North and South, about spiritual beliefs and whether Mr. Atreides is the “chosen one,” a title that he doesn’t readily accept.  He wishes to fight for his fallen house and late father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), alongside the Fremen, honor and respect his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and discover a hopeful romance with Chani.  Meanwhile, the grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and the distant Emperor (Christopher Walken) push back against the Fremen (also referred to as “rats”) with force through the Harkonnen and Imperial troops, assemblies of war machines called ornithopters that look like a steampunk collaboration of helicopters and dragonflies, and the Baron’s sicko nephew, a creep with an utterly punchable face, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler).  For those who loved “Dune” (2021), this film – in the words of Jerry Maguire – will most likely “complete (you),” as Denis bathes in the visual majesty of Arrakis, a place chock-full of dunes and moons.  According to IMDb, photography in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates help provide the former.  If you didn’t care for the first film, the second falls into similar patterns of pacing and procedures.  “Dune” is a spectacular, procedural exercise, but “Dune: Part Two” burns more calories, just enough for me to recommend it. Granted, it’s been over two years since this critic has watched the first picture, but “Part Two” seems to devote more screentime to action set pieces, including the curious floating abilities of Harkonnen soldiers’ suits.  The ornithopter assault looks straight out of the Vietnam War, and the film includes moments of sabotage of the massive spice drilling apparatuses, a few sandworm surfing escapades, and a third-act collision between imperial and Harkonnen forces versus Fremen battalions.  From a purely cinematic perspective, Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser transport us – with Oscar-caliber sweat – outside our comfortable theatre seats and into a foreign, remote, and mesmerizing abyss.  Machines and sporadic traces of life bid for survival in an excessively arid climate while a perpetual power struggle of wills, 400-meter sandworms, cannons, swords, and laser guns clash under a brutal sun.  However, “Dune: Part Two” is not filled with physical matches throughout the two-and-a-half-hour-plus runtime.  These aggressive on-screen collisions appear as small mini-events of militaristic majesty between long spells of dry discourse.  “Dune: Part Two” is not excessively conversational, but this movie is not the thrill-a-minute “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015) either, and the main players seem to repeat the same basic ideas while standing or sitting around and pondering what it all means on piles of sand and rocky buttes or inside antiseptic, metallic conference rooms.  For instance, The Baron frequently complains about his spice production problems, and Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) repeatedly takes the verbal brunt of the operation’s shortcomings.  Jessica has a raging battle with drinking worm urine, and Paul’s future is her favorite go-to topic, ad nauseam.  The narrative often cuts to Feyd-Rautha so that he can randomly act like a psychopath for a few minutes at a time. Still, the leads and the seemingly limitless extras don elaborate, eye-catching textiles of opulent royal intricacies, menacing military armor, and purposely unflattering ragged wrapped rags.  Chalamet and Zendaya work fine together, but their initial chemistry during the first hour wanes during the last 90-plus minutes, primarily because the script deviates from Paul and Chani’s loving focus and into mechanical questions about their pragmatic fit with Mr. Atreides’ destiny and additional time in propping up Feyd-Rautha’s bullying tactics.  Unfortunately, the film wastes Florence Pugh and Walken by barely offering them anything to do as Princess Irulan and the Emperor.  They deliver their lines on a nondescript sound stage for the most part, and audiences might desperately wish for some mass quantities of spicy cowbell that never clang true. As far as Chalamet playing a messiah, is his performance convincing?  Well, he seems fine enough, and Timothee isn’t accidentally dropping his sword during the most critical moments, so there’s that.  Why didn’t the Baron immediately murder Beast Rabban when spice production initially fell on his watch, especially when the gluttonous leader is incredibly ruthless with everyone else?  Perhaps the Baron is a WWE fan.  Hey, it’s possible."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,If Dune&#58; Part 1 didn&apos;t make you a believer&#59; Part 2 just might&#46; 
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. The ending of Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune film made it possible to read this telling of Frank Herbert’s opus as a grim but optimistically opened narrative about a young man embracing destiny to become a liberator. The film framed Paul Atreides’ wisdom as his most invaluable tool, and it presented his moral clarity as a sign of his walking a righteous path. As in the book, you were meant to see Paul as a complicated but sympathetic figure at the beginning of his Shakespearean hero’s journey. But Dune: Part Two lays bare what it takes for a person to become a mythic figure and challenges you to understand just how profoundly bleak this tale has always been. Picking up essentially right where Dune ends, Dune: Part Two delves deeper into the aftermath of House Atreides’ fall and chronicles Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica’s (Rebecca Ferguson) continued fight for survival on the desert planet Arrakis. Even with Jessica’s powerful Bene Gesserit mind-sharpening techniques at their disposal, being stranded on Arrakis is tantamount to death between the brutal storms and titanic sandworms. And after seeing his friends and family slaughtered by the Harkonnens, Paul has every reason to feel almost unimaginable despair.  But after only being able to see glimpses of Chani (Zendaya) in his increasingly prophetic dreams, finally meeting her in person fills Paul with an overwhelming sense of wonder — both at her individual strength and the strength she embodies as a member of the Fremen, the only people who know how to survive in Arrakis’ desert landscape. Though Dune: Part Two continues to build on the first film’s intricate mystery about how Paul is almost certainly the chosen one fated to lead the Fremen to paradise, the new movie uses Chani and her fellow northerners like Shishakli (Souheila Yacoub) to illustrate what the actual work of sustaining a revolution looks like.  Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser once again present Arrakis as a breathtakingly expansive, desolate place of beauty and danger. But Dune: Part Two uses its time on the planet to more thoughtfully explore how the Fremen see the desert as part of themselves. That idea is woven into the pacing and choreography of almost all the film’s tense clashes between Baron Vladimir Harkonnen’s (Stellan Skarsgård) soldiers and the Fremen, whose deep knowledge of Arrakis’ landscape makes them unmatched warriors. Fremen like Chani and Shishakli see their fight against their oppressors as a battle they have to win for themselves, and they find it absurd how much faith southerners like tribe head Stilgar (Javier Bardem) put in ancient myths about a messiah. But in Paul, Stilgar cannot help but see an answer to his people’s prayers for deliverance. And when the young prince insists that he wants to serve the Fremen rather than control them the way his family once controlled the planet, even Chani is compelled to consider whether there might be something special about him. Especially through its depiction of the women closest to Paul, Dune: Part Two paints a more detailed picture of how deeply interconnected this universe’s cultural systems of power are beyond their shared reliance on Arrakis’ spice. Despite being incredibly insular, there are religious threads that connect the Fremen to the Bene Gesserit in fascinating ways. And while there are some members of the Machiavellian sisterhood who want Paul dead, others, like Emperor Shaddam IV’s (Christopher Walken) daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), are secretly fascinated by his seemingly inevitable rise to prominence within the Fremen’s ranks. In addition to further complicating the story at hand, Dune: Part Two’s fleshing out of the Bene Gesserit through Irulan and other newcomers like Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux) provides even more insight into the sisterhood’s deep history and its goals. Much in the same way the film emphasizes how the Fremen have mastered the art of desert survival, it also makes clear that the Bene Gesserit are almost always in their own element, thanks to millennia of carefully planned political engineering.  This is true of Irulan as she covertly chronicles history’s events by her father’s side, and Margot as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) sends her on an important mission to the largely colorless Harkonnen homeworld. But the Bene Gesserit’s knack for survival and scheming are most brilliantly personified in Lady Jessica as she, like her son, is swiftly accepted by the Fremen, who see her abilities as yet another sign of Paul’s godhead. By foregrounding Chani and Jessica so strongly in Dune: Part Two’s story and using their arcs to add more context to Paul’s transformation into Muad’Dib, Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts make it almost impossible to misinterpret the film as a straightforward white savior narrative. Herbert wrote Dune as a multifaceted critique of that trope with Paul serving as the ultimate representation of neo-imperialism’s capacity to connect but also destroy entire civilizations all under the auspices of social or economic progress. At times, it was harder to see those concepts at work in the first Dune because of how you were meant to be swept up in the mystery and newness of Paul’s life on Arrakis. But Part Two is far more explicit with its articulation of how dangerous the very idea of a Kwisatz Haderach is, and the film takes care to highlight how many players mean to wield that concept as a weapon. Both Herbert and Villeneuve’s authorial intentions can’t be dismissed when thinking about Dune: Part Two’s presentation of a white prince becoming a messiah figure to a group of people who are intentionally coded as Muslim through almost every aspect of their fictional culture. That said, the film is still a piece of entertainment, and one in which actual Muslim and MENA actors are largely relegated to the background or to the periphery of large-scale battles where untold numbers of Fremen lose their lives. Those battles and their artistry are part of what make Dune: Part Two such an effective spectacle and a masterful showcase of Villeneuve’s ability to realize worlds that are as beautiful as they are terrifying. For all of its heady solemnity, the film is categorically breathtaking and dominated by nuanced performances made that much more powerful by Hans Zimmer’s richly textured score. But the most impressive thing about Dune: Part Two is the way it manages to weave all of its threads together into a fascinating tapestry — one whose story is poised to become even more monumental and portentous if Villeneuve gets the chance to keep expanding on it."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," If you felt a bit cheated by a two-and-a-half-hour space saga that didn’t have a conclusion then your heart may well sink further when the even longer Part Two signs off with another cliffhanger. Even so, this spectacular follow-up is so gripping, you’ll be aching to see director Denis Villeneuve tie together his many plot strands in the final instalment of his planned trilogy. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) is hiding in the giant worm-infested desert with his mystical mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) after his royal father was murdered by a treacherous rival family. To survive, they need to convince the local rebels that Paul is the “outsider” who has been prophesied to free the oppressed Fremon tribes from the evil House Of Harkonnen.  Fremon warrior Stilgar (Javier Bardem) thinks our hero is “the One” but his comrade Chani (Zendaya) is not convinced. Paul doesn’t believe in the prophecy either, but plays along with it while he plots revenge on Baron Vladimir Harkonnon (Stellan Skarsgard). Another speaker-rattling Hans Zimmer score powers ominous scenes on the planet Giedi Prime, where we meet the Baron’s creepy, hairless heir Feyd-Rautha (a shaven Austin Butler).  If there is another instalment, a brief vision suggests her daughter will be played by Anya Taylor-Joy. We should also see more of Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh, who appear fleetingly as the galaxy’s emperor and his daughter. SET in 1989, the snappy dialogue in screenwriter Diablo Cody’s retro comedy-horror may make you chuckle, but the relentless references to director Tim Burton’s works (most notably Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands homages) mean this soon resembles a fan flick. Teen goth misfit Lisa (Kathryn Newton) is living with her dad, new stepmum and cheerleader stepsister Taffy (a brilliant Liza Soberano) in a pastel-pink home but prefers listening to The Cure and hanging out at the tombstone of a young Victorian pianist. When the corpse (played by Cole Sprouse) comes back to life, the two form a relationship and go on a slaughter spree to re­claim his missing body parts. Cultural references are spot on with hair crimping, tanning beds, and Desperately Seeking Susan outfits, while cult classic teen murder movie Heathers seems to have influenced the high-school scenes. There are occasional moments of originality, and some novel power ballad slasher scenes – including an amusing “Bobbiting” to On The Wings Of Love – but with so many obvious influences it’s hard not to feel like you’ve seen it all before. TUNISIAN divorcee Olfa Hamrouni’s two eldest daughters, Rahma and Ghofrane, were radicalised by Islamic extremists when they were teens following the Arab Spring. They fled to Libya, where they remain held in detention today. The two progressive, likeable young women credit a spell in a domestic reform centre when they were ten and 12 years old for preventing them also being “devoured by the wolf”. Docu-drama director Kaouther Ben Hania blends re-enactments using actors with the real-life family in a bid to unravel how half of this funny, warm, strong-willed quartet of feisty, smart, siblings went from heavy metal fans to wearing the niqab and joining Islamic State. Olfa is a complex subject – a traumatised, devastated mother, both cheerfully admitting subjecting her offspring to childhood ­beatings, yet also broad-minded, hopeful and herself a revolutionary as well."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Upon hearing that Denis Villeneuve was making “Dune”, I remember thinking there was no better director to take on Frank Herbert’s science-fiction classic. That sentiment was proven right with the release of Villeneuve’s 2021 feature – the jaw-dropping first chapter of his masterful big screen epic. After a brief delay following last year’s Hollywood labor disputes, “Dune: Part Two” is finally here and sees Villeneuve reuniting with the first film’s incredible cast and talent behind the camera. Villeneuve’s first venture was an immersive and breathtaking introduction to Herbert’s universe, captured through the passionate lens of a visionary filmmaker. Part Two picks up the story right where its predecessor left off and then expands on it through intensive world-building and character work. A few brilliantly cast new faces are added, seamlessly fitting into the rich and complex world. Then there are the many returning faces – a star-studded ensemble who once again bring their fascinating array of characters to life. Much like the previous film, “Dune: Part Two” offers up a visual feast. The spectacular locations, the thrilling set pieces, and the outstanding costume design are just some of what makes the movie such a stunner. But perhaps more impressive is Villeneuve’s amazing ability to artfully translate Herbert’s dense and complex story to the big screen. Politics, religion, and mythology play significant roles in “Dune” and add intriguing layers to the storytelling. And Villeneuve and his co-writing partner Jon Spaihts don’t shortchange any of those elements. As a refresher, the “Dune” films are set in the distant future within an empire known as the Imperium. Leading the Imperium is the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (played in Part Two by Christopher Walken) who oversees several Great and Minor Houses. Among them is the noble House Atreides and their mortal enemies, House Harkonnen. At the center of the main conflict is Arrakis, a harsh desert planet that is the lone source of the most valuable commodity in the universe, Spice Melange. Through devious plotting and subterfuge, Shaddam uses House Harkonnen to annihilate House Atreides after feeling threatened by the popularity of its beloved leader, Duke Leto. What he didn’t count on was Leto’s son Paul surviving and forming an alliance with the Fremen, the native inhabitants of Arrakis. Part Two picks up with the lone survivors of House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), working to earn the trust of the Fremen people. Many among the Fremen suspect them of being spies. But tribe leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) defends them, believing Paul to be their prophesied messiah. Meanwhile Paul continues to grow closer to Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen warrior who thinks the prophecy is nonsense but who stands by Paul as he assimilates into her culture. Paul and the Fremen intensify their guerrilla raids on the Harkonnen spice harvesters which inevitably gets the attention of the ruthless House leader Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a devilishly sinister Stellan Skarsgård). Out of patience with his nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) – the overseer of spice production on Arrakis, the Baron replaces him with his younger nephew, the psychotic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Elsewhere the word of Paul’s survival and rise to power among the Fremen reaches the Emperor who has desperately worked to conceal his involvement in the House Atreides slaughter.  Those are just some of the tensions that grow throughout the absorbing story with its many moving pieces. Part Two has its rousing moments, some romance, and even prickly family drama. But it’s the thematic depth that makes it so intriguing. Take the wicked undercurrent of manipulation and deception that’s felt throughout the film, almost always in the service of power and control. We see it in the hegemonization of cultures through the planting of false religions and in the wielding of political might to maintain power. We even see it the efforts to build an army in the name of the greater good. To no surprise “Dune: Part Two” is a technical achievement, complete with thrilling action, dazzling visual effects, and unmatched artistic vision. DP Greig Fraser captivates with his camera whether shooting the vast sun-scorched dunes of Arrakis or intimate close-ups that peer deep behind the eyes of the characters; whether capturing hypnotic and sometimes unsettling dream sequences or fierce sprawling combat sequences and sandworm surfing. There is never a moment when his images aren’t appealing in one way or another. And it’s all accented by Hans Zimmer’s penetrating score. “Dune: Part Two” clicks perfectly into place with the first film and builds upon it in a number of scintillating ways. The performances shine from top to bottom (none brighter than Austin Butler’s). And the sheer craft on display, along with the extraordinary storytelling, results in an awe-inspiring and mature science-fiction blockbuster that immediately left me hoping for a Part Three. Will we get one? Rumor has it a script is nearly finished. But as always it will depend on how this one does at the box office. Hopefully it gets the audience it deserves. “Dune: Part Two” opens in theaters today. Keith, I only read the first half until after I see it.  Denis was on Colbert last night and was talking about some of the FX.  Also that there will be a part 3 based on Dune Messiah.  Looks freegin awesome.  I love what he did with Blade Runner 2049 and with Dune part 1. The spectacle is Grand but what’s really amazing is how they get the cultural , political,  and religious aspects integrated into the story in a way that makes them important and coherent. What an achievement. I bought my ticket in late January as I was going to see this tomorrow but the flu came in and it kicked my ass.  Fandango refused to fund me as I had to drive to my local AMC multiplex where I was able to get a refund.  I was really hoping to see this but now I have to stay home for a bit. I loved the first film as well. It was my #1 film that year. Rewatched it over the weekend and it (to no surprise) holds up extremely well. I enjoyed the first 2/3’s of the film probably more so than the latter third and felt occasionally things were a bit disjointed, but overall very enjoyable with superb visuals, performances and score. I liked the first Dune film, although I did register a complaint it was a bit low on action and excessive in run time. I liked this second Dune film better than the first, but while I think the amount of action was satisfactory the film is obscenely too long. Hollywood has convinced itself a movie only two hours long just isn’t “epic” enough. My other concern was a couple of times I wondered how we got from one scene to the next from a physical location standpoint. Perhaps a second viewing will clear those transition concerns up, and I do look forward to seeing it again. I also am really looking forward to the finale of this trilogy. Wonderful characters and cast. It’s interesting…I ready the novel right now and it actually makes me appreciate the length of both films. I completely get what you’re saying about the sudden wave of long movies. But some have really earned their length for me – Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Dune."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," In my review for the Denis Villeneuve-directed Blade Runner 2049, I made the bold statement that I felt it to be the greatest sequel since The Godfather Part II. Upon multiple viewings of both, since, I wholeheartedly stand by that belief. Villeneuve has now made a sequel to one of his own films. So, walking into the theater, I couldn’t help remembering my opinion of 2049and wonder if it would stand the test of Dune: Part Two. Picking up immediately after the events of Dune, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have been taken in by the Fremen, the native people of the planet Arrakis. While many are suspicious of these newcomers, their leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) stands up for their presence, for he strongly believes that Paul is the prophesied savior Lisan al Gaib. Paul rejects this idea, simply wanting to join in their fight against the oppressive Harkonnen family and be accepted by the Fremen as one of their own. Once the latter happens, he takes the nickname of Muad’Dib, becoming a leader of the rebellion and a thorn in the Harkonnens’ side. He also is accepted by Chani (Zendaya), a young Fremen woman who falls in love with him. Yet, Paul’s exposure to the pure spice in the air around him causes his inherent ability to see visions of the future to strengthen. They show him that if he accepts the mantle of Lisan al Gaib, then a holy war will break out and cause great destruction. This is the reason he refuses to even humor Stilgar’s beliefs. Yet, destiny keeps driving him farther down this path, so far that he might not have a choice in the matter. Dune: Part Two is a masterpiece of epic science fiction filmmaking. In these two films, Villeneuve has accomplished bringing to life Frank Herbert’s classic novel in such a visionary  way that no doubt satisfies the book’s lifelong fans, while also making it accessible to general audiences, something a previous theatrical film version and a cable miniseries both failed at. Everything about this film is amazing. It looks gorgeous thanks to the cinematography of Greig Fraser, capturing the stark beauty of the desert along with the harsh brutalism of the Harkonnen architecture. It’s score from Hans Zimmer is appropriately rousing and emotive. Of course, the acting is Grade A because the cast is stacked. Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård and Charlotte Rampling all return. Also included this go-around are Christopher Walken, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux. That is a capital C Cast! So, back to my original question: Does this sequel surpass Villeneuve’s previous sequel in quality? It turned out to be a difficult question to answer for me. While in a lot of ways Dune: Part Two and 2049 are equals, mostly in their realizations of complete universes, they are different enough to make comparison a bit tricky. With Dune, the framework has already been laid out by the novel. All Villeneuve had to do was interpret Herbert’s words into visuals. Whereas, with 2049, while he also had a framework from the original film, he still had to come up with a totally new universe that imagined how Blade Runner’s world would be thirty years later. From our own experience with time, we know how different things are now than in 1994. On top of this, Villeneuve has indicated that he’s like to make a third film, based upon the events in the second novel Dune Messiah. While this film has a definitive ending, it’s just like the book wherein it ends, but on a note that says it could go on, which was obviously Herbert’s intent, since he went on to write five more himself, not to mention the more than a dozen other books in the saga written by Herbert’s son Brian in collaboration with Kevin J. Anderson. Once this proposed third film happens, Part Two won’t be so much a sequel as part of a trilogy, which then puts it upon that fine line. So, while when discussing the realm of sequels, I stand by my original assessment of 2049, I firmly believe that Dune: Part Two is one of the best films of the 21st century, if not in the entire history of the medium.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic science-fiction novel Dune faced a challenging debut in 2021. Theaters were still in the grips of the pandemic, and Warner Bros. Discovery opted to release the film on its HBO Max streaming service the same day it came out in theaters, cannibalizing the box office. Despite these obstacles, the film managed to gross more than $400 million worldwide, justifying Villeneuve’s return to the desert planet of Arrakis so he could adapt the second half of the novel. In the first movie, House Atreides had been all but wiped out by the evil Harkonnens who desire to control the universe’s most valuable commodity—spice, the psychotropic dust that makes interstellar travel possible. Dune: Part Two picks up where the last movie left off. Paul and his mother, the Lady Jessica, have fled to Arrakis’s wasteland hoping to find sanctuary with the planet’s native inhabitants known as Fremen. The first third of the movie depicts their attempts to gain acceptance by these fiercely independent people and learn how to survive in an inhospitable terrain. When the wicked Harrkonens try to wipe out the Fremen, Paul rallies his new allies to exact revenge for the fall of House Atreides. Most of the cast returns for this sequel. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul as a young man growing into his role as a reluctant messiah. Rebecca Ferguson is Paul’s calculating mother who wants to see him fulfill his destiny more than he does. Javier Bardem plays Stilgar, one of the Fremen leaders, and he brings some surprising comic relief to an otherwise somber franchise. Zendaya, as Paul's love interest, gets much more screen time than she did in the first installment. We also get some newcomers. Austin Butler joins the film as Feyd-Rautha, the talented, yet depraved scion of House Harkonnen. Christopher Walken plays the desperate emperor of the universe, and Florence Pugh his enigmatic daughter. Like the first installment, Dune: Part Two, earns its PG-13 rating from scenes of war as well as up-close-and-personal violence, and bad language is pretty mild compared to similarly rated movies. Part Two includes a little more sensuality than the first film, but Villeneuve shows restraint. He includes two lovers lying together, but they’re only filmed from the neck up. Unlike the novel, which spanned years, these movies take place over a matter of months. Villeneuve is willing to depart from his source material, but I wish he had departed a little more. The film clocks in at 166 minutes, and I think Villeneuve could have improved the pacing by cutting Austin Butler’s character from the story. Dune purists will find that suggestion heretical, but it would have made for a more cohesive film. On the whole though, Dune Part Two is a worthy follow-up to the first movie, and Villeneuve plans a third installment based on the second novel in the series to complete Paul’s story. Dune is an epic adventure, but it’s also a morality tale with one of its main themes being the dangers of co-opting religion for political power. Paul is destined to become the Fremen messiah, but he knows the prophecies about his coming are political fabrications. He hates what he’s becoming, but he becomes it anyway. How else can he stop the Harkonnens? Frank Herbert, who seemed suspicious of all religion, probably didn’t have Augustine of Hippo in mind when he wrote Dune, but the book’s themes resemble the fifth-century Christian bishop’s critique of human society without grace. In Dune, the elites manipulate commoners with their prophecies. Ancient Rome was the same way with the educated classes promoting a civic religion to help control the population. Augustine also says the Romans didn’t possess real virtue. Rather they merely possessed splendid vices that kept even worse wickedness in check. Paul Atreides is cut of the same cloth, embracing his role as a dark messiah to thwart the even greater wickedness of the Harkonnens. On the graceless desert planet of Dune, vengeance is possible, but redemption is not. Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," It is one thing that novelist Frank Herbert wrote a complicated tale of a mind-twisting drug known as Spice and a reluctant messiah that played out against an action-filled backdrop with Dune. Books can take all the time needed to explore both. Turning the 1965 novel into a feature film has been the challenge. Director/co-writer Denis Villeneuve has shown with “Dune: Part Two” that an action film can also dive deep into political, religious and personal relationships. The tendency is to keep these apart, but the collision of such dynamic opposite cinematic forces makes for a fully rounded production. It has been 29 months since the first part was released and a quick refresher course would not be a bad idea as there is little explanatory dialogue to open the second film. It picks up only moments after the first film ended. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the son of an aristocratic family and once heir to the planet of Arrakis, has seen his people wiped out. The bloated Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) has betrayed Artreides and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), leaving them in the desert to die. Atreides joins forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen to seek revenge against those who destroyed his family. The fact Stilgar (Javier Bardem), leader of the Fremen tribe at Sietch Tabr, believes that Atreides is the chosen one adds to the conflict between a very human desire for revenge and the possibility of divine intervention. The search to avenge the deaths sparks action sequences that range from the monolithic to the minor. The best hope of stopping Atreides is the psychopathic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). He is introduced in a stunning gladiatorial setting that is so gigantic, looking at it might cause a nosebleed. It is the kind of scene created with IMAX in mind. Villenueve gracefully slides between the action sequences into more cerebral moments where all the big topic elements of Herbert’s novel are explored. Greed, political corruption, faith, the lack of faith, love and hate are all addressed against the simmering hot sands. One of the truly amazing parts of “Dune: Part Two” is that while most of the film unfolds against a stark desert backdrop, there is a majestic beauty to almost every scene. Cinematographer Creig Fraser turns rolling dunes of sand into a mesmerizing vision and not the monotonous repetition for which the world can be portrayed. It would have been easy for a film this grand in design and execution to overshadow the actors. Just as he found the balance of story and visuals, Villenueve gives his players room for big moments – such as the call to arms by Atreides – or small ones such as the relationship between Atreides and Chani. It is a film loaded with acting talent from the ruggedness of Josh Brolin to the sliminess of Skarsgård. Florence Pugh’s role as Princess Irulan is limited but there is more to come from her. The most surprising performance comes from Butler. He has thrown off any remnants of his role as the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll in “Elvis” to play a character devoid of all humanity. He gets across the violent craziness of the character with a single glance. At the heart of the acting performances is how much maturity Chalamet shows in playing Atreides. He has gone from an insecure young man to a political and spiritual force who can raise an army with only a few words. Only moments exist between the two parts of the film but how much Chalamet’s character changes makes it feel like a lifetime has passed. His most personal scenes are with Zendaya as their relationship grows. The film embraces that connection but never lets it distract from all the larger themes that fill the production. Villenueve established his credentials for being able to handle complicated stories and big action moments with the first “Dune” film. He solidifies those credentials by making both a film that will take your breath away with its visual spectacle and make you think because of the brilliant examination of storylines connected to the heart, mind and soul. The gap between the first and second films was massive. Because Villenueve gave “Part Two” an open end, the framework is set for a “Part Three.” It just needs to come quicker. “Dune: Part Two” is stunning to look at, has memorable action scenes and a bevy of great performances. It loses a few points for setting up that the audience will have to pay to see at least one more film. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune&#58; Part Two is the counter balance to the recent blockbuster mediocrity&#46; The story is dense&#46; The characters are complex&#46;  The world is captivating&#44; and the production is flawless&#46;  A must see film for sci-fi fans and cinephiles&#46;  
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune was bursting out all over Leicester Square at the world premiere a couple of weeks ago. I've been to lots of grand openings there down the years, but never to one quite as flamboyant, with quite as much fanfare, causing so much frenzy. Probably not for 60 years, since the heyday of The Beatles, has that patch of central London resounded with the kind of noisy adoration directed (this time) at the star of the Dune films, 28-year-old Timothee Chalamet. And at least there were four Beatles to share the attention. The young American star gets 'Chalamania', as it's known, all to himself. The bigger issue, though, was this: would Denis Villeneuve's epic sequel justify the razzamatazz, not to mention the investment of an entire evening? Dune: Part Two lasts almost three hours. It is even longer than the first film, and that seemed to go on forever. Happily, it does. The 2021 movie tackled many of the plot complexities that for years fuelled the belief that Frank Herbert's mighty 1965 science-fiction novel was 'unfilmable' (claims not exactly punctured by David Lynch's 1984 stinker). It was terrific, but exhausting, laboriously introducing us to the inter-planetary empire Herbert imagined, and the various dynasties grappling for power or simply survival. The sequel has a mercifully more straightforward narrative. On the barren planet Arrakis, with most of his own kinsfolk wiped out, Paul Atreides (Chalamet) prepares to lead the beleaguered, disenfranchised Fremen tribe against his and their mortal enemies, the formidably evil House Harkonnen. Ruled by the grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard in a wobbly fat suit), to whom they swear allegiance at chilling Nuremberg-style rallies, the Harkonnen owe their political and military supremacy to their control of 'spice' — the most valuable commodity in this universe, generally assumed by Dune devotees to be a metaphor for oil. Paul's aim is to disrupt spice production, but unlike our own Just Stop Oil brigade, he needs to do more than lie down on a motorway. Anyway, Arrakis doesn't have motorways. It's a vast desert, in which he must prove himself to the Fremen by undergoing various challenges, such as sand-surfing behind a worm roughly the size of a superyacht. But there are others who mistrust him. Is he a false prophet or their true 'mahdi', their messiah? His modesty clinches it. 'The Mahdi is too humble to say he is the Mahdi,' someone says, approvingly, which reminded me strongly of the scene in The Life Of Brian, when Brian's efforts to convince his followers that he is entirely ordinary backfire, on the basis that only the true messiah would deny his divinity. Mostly, the action unfolds in subtle shades of brown and beige, as if the set designers were told to restrict themselves to the edges of the Farrow & Ball colour chart. This makes Paul's eyes look even bluer, a bit like Peter O'Toole's in Lawrence of Arabia. As Noel Coward famously said at that premiere, if he'd been any prettier it could have been called Florence of Arabia. The same is true of Chalamet. Any more ravishing and they'd have had to call it June. But Paul is a fierce warrior first and foremost, who has a truly gripping set-piece duel with the emerging champion of the Harkonnen (a shaven-headed Austin Butler), and whose muscular beauty pleases Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), scheming daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken). Butler, Pugh and Walken are all new additions to the cast, incidentally, along with Lea Seydoux and, in a cameo, Anya Taylor-Joy. From the first film, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling also return. There are stars everywhere you look, in a movie that is lavish in every way, and demands to be seen on a big screen. This  engagingly quirky (and visually stunning) French-language drama is set on a French air force base in Madagascar in the early 1970s, where the former colonisers continue to assert their control over the now-independent. Writer-director Robin Campillo immerses us in the daily life of one family: the moody airman father, his flighty wife, their marital strains and those of their friends. But the main focus is on their impossibly cute eight-year-old son Thomas (Charlie Vauselle), whose superhero fantasies are brought to life in oddly beguiling little interludes as he seeks refuge from the weird world of grown-ups."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Instead of a theme park, it's more of a cathedral -- solemn, sober, beautiful and forbidding. Greig Fraser's photography and Hans Zimmer's score are full of majesty."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It’s all fatuous, like Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films... Nothing in Villeneuve’s Dune series is as good as Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon, which revives mythic understanding of both mankind’s history and fate. "

Whether it’s what’s on cable, streaming on Prime Video or Netflix, or opening at the movie theater, we’ve got your must-watch list. Start with TV and scroll down for movies. It’s all right here. The 2015 documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst was an astounding account of an eccentric zillionaire accused of murdering his wife, his oldest friend and a neighbor after he went on the run from authorities and disguised himself as a hearing-impaired, mute elderly woman. In the new six-episode follow-up from the same filmmaker, we delve deeper into the murders and meet the D.A.s and defense attorneys, plus experts and witnesses who’ve not come forward before. It’s rare for any Netflix original to last for five seasons — so count your blessings that this sitcom about an Indiana mechanic (Mike Epps, 53) and his family is back, and that a sixth season has already been greenlit. While Epps and Kim Fields, 54, have great rapport as a married couple who could be straight out of any classic network sitcom, the show gets a sardonic boost from Wanda Sykes, 60, as Fields’ wisecracking sister. Henry Hall (son of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, 63) stars in this Freevee comedy series based on a British hit about a close-knit family with grownup children who gather every Friday for a communal meal — which regularly devolves into chaos, thanks to pranks, misunderstandings and surprise visitors (including nosy neighbors and old childhood crushes). The secret weapon might be Carol Kane, 71, as the daffy, heavily accented grandma. The wonderful Zoe Saldaña plays Esmee, a Mexican migrant desperately trying to escape the tentacles of human and drug trafficking on both sides of the border. In one critical scene, she’s the blistering, articulate voice of the dispossessed, yelling through a glass door at the crooked front-desk clerk she’s locked out of his own motel. Meanwhile, ICE agent Shipp (the arresting Garrett Hedlund) is torn between his humanity and his duty: chasing and arresting illegal immigrants. “They’re not our problem,” says his ICE partner (Chris Coy). But seeing young, abused girls he rescued being shipped back south to a country that can’t protect them, he’s disillusioned and profoundly moved. The clunky script explains the film’s low rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes (27 percent), but the acting perhaps explains why audiences liked it about three times as much (75 percent). —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) This modest, character-driven modern noir centers on Cliff (a perfectly cast Scoot McNairy), a churchgoing traveling salesman, husband and father of a cancer-stricken child. To preserve his family, the schlub drives into the dingiest Midwestern wastelands where sales are few and temptation arrives in the form of former colleague Ricky (a skanky, American-accented Kit Harington, pushing against his Game of Thrones royal type). Desperate Cliff throws his family’s future in with the wily Ricky, who thinks Cliff’s an ideal drug-and-cash mule. Enter Josh Lucas, 52, as a drug boss enjoying the opportunity to wet his hands with blood. The climax is like Fargo without the insane laughs. —T.M.A. Handsome Matthew Modine, 65, is an underrated star. Since his pivotal role in 1987’s Full Metal Jacket, the son of a California drive-in theater manager has consistently delivered performances with integrity, sly humor and self-awareness. As prison social worker Greg Townsend, convinced of the healing power of vigorous work and teamwork, he leads a motley group of teen convicts on a 1,000-mile cycling trip to the Grand Canyon. Based on the real story of Townsend and the Ridge View Academy team he launched, the tautly scripted sports rescue drama also features a genial Sean Astin, 53, as a bike vendor and part-time sponsor. Despite some sappy moments and predictable uphill-mountain struggles, Hard Miles is an inspiring movie that pushes away the soot and trauma of our overtaxed corrections system to find the inherent good in its young denizens, one pedal, one hard mile, at a time. —T.M.A. Soulmates can’t be faked. Best friends since birth, 12-year-old Malik and Eric (irresistibly, tenderly played by Blake Cameron James and Gian Knight Ramirez), inhabit Chicago’s notorious Cabrini Green housing projects in the ’90s. From making jumpy houses out of abandoned mattresses to ditching school for the Art Institute, their powerful connection is the film’s primary focus. Complications arise when police shoot a 7-year-old in the neighborhood, spreading terror among the residents. Should Malik’s single mother (an affecting Jurnee Smollett) move to Peoria to protect her kids and their grandmother (S. Epatha Merkerson, 71, the movie’s grounding rod)? And yet, that flight from Cabrini Green will all but sever a treasured friendship that cannot be replicated, which gives the movie its universal sense of melancholy. This earnest, observant and empathetic coming-of-age adventure presents a story of African American boyhood as iconic as Stand by Me. —T.M.A. An abused child, armed robber, ex-prostitute, ex-jailbird and addict, Judee Sill was the first artist signed by mogul David Geffen in 1971. She went from living in her Cadillac to the cover of Rolling Stone, was compared to Laura Nyro and wrote minor hits (the Turtles’ “Lady-O” and her own “Jesus Was a Cross Maker,” possibly inspired by her affair with songwriter J.D. Souther, 78). Her God-haunted music, tormented life, improbable rise and tragic death are fascinatingly explained by Geffen, her producer Graham Nash, 82, Souther, Linda Ronstadt (who stole Souther back from her), 77, Jackson Browne, 75, David Crosby, more luminaries and critics plus Sill herself, whose voice still resonates. A must-see for fans of the ’70s singer-songwriter scene. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) Set in the near future, Civil War follows four disparate war correspondents (Wagner Moura, Cailee Spaeny and Stephen McKinley Henderson, 74, galvanized by the pitch-perfect Kirsten Dunst). They leave Manhattan via press van, picking across the ravaged countryside to the endangered White House. Their objective: the ultimate scoop, a photo and quote from the president (Nick Offerman, 53) while he’s still occupying the Oval Office. On the road, the quartet makes a series of horror pit stops, climaxing when they catch Jesse Plemons (Dunst’s real-life husband and Fargo costar) red-handed, ditching corpses – and seeking more. In a one-scene role, the actor shatters as a violent, xenophobic, red state militia man. The film, never as daring or nuanced as it needs to be, rests uneasily between Oliver Stone’s provocative war correspondent movie Salvador and Gerard Butler’s ballistic blockbuster Olympus Has Fallen. It’s part political critique, part isn’t-it-cool-when-things-explode — a dystopia at war with itself. —T.M.A. The writers of Boardwalk Empire and the hit Paul Giamatti miniseries John Adams bring you Michael Douglas, 79, as founding father Benjamin Franklin in an adaptation of Stacy Schiff’s dazzling 2005 book, A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France and the Birth of America. The eight-part miniseries revisits when America was losing the Revolutionary War — until its greatest scientist-statesman hit France like a lightning bolt, charming them into helping us change the course of history. Hoa Xuande, Sandra Oh, 52, and Robert Downey Jr., 59 (in multiple roles), star in an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about a half-Vietnamese, half-French communist agent who joins the South Vietnamese Army during the Vietnam War, then moves to California. In Netflix’s No. 1 hit show, the makers of Game of Thrones and True Blood bring you a sci-fi show about an astrophysicist (Rosalind Chao, 66) whose hunt for aliens in the 1960s causes big trouble for humanity years later. After apocalyptic bombs devastate the world, it’s overrun with mutant creatures and pragmatic bounty hunters such as The Ghoul (Justified’s Walton Goggins, 52). Kyle MacLachlan, 65 (Twin Peaks), plays Hank, the overseer of a vault where folks hide from calamity. Remember Matt Damon in the 1999 hit film The Talented Mr. Ripley, based on Patricia Highsmith’s novel about Tom Ripley, a talented impostor and killer? Now see Andrew Scott, 47, who shot to fame as the “hot priest” on TV’s Fleabag, as slippery Ripley in a new series adaptation by Steven Zaillian, 71, writer of Schindler’s List. ​The 1989 Patrick Swayze action film gets a 21st-century update, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing a world-weary former UFC fighter who takes a job as a bouncer at a Florida Keys dive bar that seems to attract a very aggro clientele. Brace yourself for bare-knuckle brawling. Many doubted the wisdom of rebooting this much-razzed cult classic — but it broke a record with 50 million viewers, the biggest debut of any Amazon/MGM Studios original in history. Kristen Wiig, 50, plays a divorcée trying to break into 1969 Palm Beach high society in a highly promising miniseries with the most illustrious comedy cast of the year: Carol Burnett, 90, Laura Dern, 57, Allison Janney, 64, Julia Duffy, 72, Josh Lucas, 52, and Ricky Martin, 52. In the 20th season of the steamy hospital drama, we’ll see the aftermath of multiple cliff-hangers featuring two crucial smooches and two near-death experiences, by a patient (Sam Page) and his surgeon (Kim Raver, 54). The titular Dr. Grey (Ellen Pompeo, 54), won’t be a regular anymore, but she’ll do voice-overs and maybe even appear on screen. “It’s not a complete goodbye,” Pompeo says. Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan compares this incredibly epic film of Frank Herbert’s SF classic to The Empire Strikes Back, which outdid the original Star Wars. He’s got a point. It’s an eye-popping, sonically stunning, highly original story with massively more action, character and plot than the 2021 Dune: Part One. Timothée Chalamet is more vibrant as Paul, the hero battling the Nazi-esque Harkonnens, and the grownups are great: Javier Bardem, 54, and Josh Brolin, 56, as his friends and mentors, Christopher Walken, 80, as the evil Emperor and Stellan Skarsgård, 72, as the Jabba the Hutt-like Baron Harkonnen. The amazingly confusing plot mostly holds your interest, but it’s the images that stick with you: Paul riding the giant sand worm, warriors erupting from the ground like skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts, rallies straight out of Triumph of the Will, fabulous battles. It’s like a trip to other planets. —T.A. Kingsley Ben-Adir, who played Malcolm X in the Oscar-nominated 2020 One Night in Miami ..., delivers a smartly focused performance as reggae legend Bob Marley. He nails the late star’s Jamaican patois (you sometimes wish the film had subtitles), but what’s missing is the Soul Rebel who brought stadiums of fans to their feet. You can feel director Reinaldo Marcus Green straining against the family-approved biopic format, in which less attractive episodes such as infidelities and arrests get only a glancing mention. When the focus stays on Marley’s singular talent — for example, a lingering scene in which he and the band piece together the classic tune “Exodus” — One Love succeeds in getting things together so you can feel all right. —Thom Geier (T.G.) Not since Babette’s Feast has there been a culinary movie so delicious. In this sensual French period entry for the Oscar, which was overshadowed by the more serious contemporary best picture nominee Anatomy of a Fall, Juliette Binoche, 59, leads the way around a large, rustic kitchen in 1889 France. The actress is graceful, passionate and mysterious as Eugenie, a chef whose culinary talent and skills border on the mystical. Employed for two decades by the famed gourmet Dodin Bouffant (Binoche’s ex-partner Benoît Magimel, 49), the magnificent first act finds her cooking with mouthwatering detail, her hands never still or unsure, her concentration absolute. From this emerge the delicate flavors of her collaboration and consensual no-strings sexual relationship with Bouffant, the nurturing of an apprentice and an appreciation for food preparation as its own genius. The Taste of Things is a yummy version of a life well lived, where dinner isn’t a meal between dusk and dark, but a daily celebration of life for as long as it lasts. —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP. Previously, he was the entertainment editor at Amazon, video critic at Entertainment Weekly, and a critic and writer for The Hollywood Reporter, People, MTV, The Village Voice and LA Weekly."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE," Welcome to The #Content Report, a newsletter by Vince Mancini. I’ve been writing about movies, culture, and food since the aughts. Now I’m delivering it straight to you, with none of the autoplay videos, takeover ads, or chumboxes of the ad-ruined internet. Support my work and help me bring back the cool internet by subscribing, sharing, commenting, and keeping it real. It’s hard to know what to make of the tremendously entertaining Dune: Part Two, which feels simultaneously like the best movie I’ve seen in years and not quite a movie. Dune was a suitably epic, transporting exercise in world building that, even if it stopped short of offering any kind of conclusion, at least had clearly drawn battle lines. Part Two once again feels massive, epic, fully-realized — all the usual adjectives we want from blockbuster sci-fi. See it on the biggest screen possible!  Like its predecessor, Part Two feels like it’s marching towards an epic denouement that it ends up deferring to some future sequel. Yet where Dune left me itching to see the next chapter, Dune: Part Two had me feeling more conflicted. It’s not that it needed to tell us who to root for, but I did start wondering what they were fighting about. While it’s almost impossible to imagine a better way to spend two hours and 46 minutes (that it doesn’t feel anywhere near that long is another point in its favor), the stakes have gotten muddled. The best thing about Denis Villeneuve’s Dune series is that it made me feel the way Gen Xers say seeing Star Wars for the first time made them feel. They’re both rousing sci-fi swashbucklers full of sword fights, exotic aliens, and sexy heroes that let you nerd out on as much lore-slop as your piggy snout can stand. Yet on a basic level, Star Wars feels like baby food Dune. The Empire is evil, the Rebels are good, there’s a Dark Side and Jedis, and it all works well enough, but the strokes seem broad and deliberately digestible, like it didn’t trust us with specific conflicts or nuanced morality. Dune, meanwhile, (which Star Wars had been accused of ripping off long before this Villeneuve iteration) had spice. The houses fought over the spice because it was necessary for interstellar travel, and the Fremen, who lived on the desert planet of Arrakis where spice was mined, were caught in the middle. The story was still fantastical and simplistic in some ways, but the characters were fighting over material conditions. If Star Wars gave us clashes between “Light” and “Dark,” that was the stuff of simplistic war propaganda, Dune was about colonial subjugation and battles to control precious resources, the stuff wars are actually fought over."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The movie questions the reasons—and methods—for seeking power, including the use of fear and the use of faith to control people. It suggests that kindhearted leaders are ""weak"" and corrupt leaders are successful. Paul might have once been considered a hero, but he's become an opportunist here, using whatever tools are at his disposal—with little regard for right or wrong—to gain power necessary to achieve his goal, which is nothing more than revenge. Chani is a more positive character, refusing to be swayed by simple measures and staying strong and independent. Male-driven narrative, but women in supporting roles are quite powerful (and, in some cases, admirable). Two main characters are strong women. Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is capable of bending others to her will, although she tends to lean toward unsavory activities. Chani (played by Zendaya, who has one Black and one White parent) is more positive; she's skilled, strong, independent. Supporting characters include Spanish actor Javier Bardem as the leader of the Fremen and Greek-Filipino American actor Dave Bautista as one of Baron Harkonnen's villainous minions. Black actor Alison Halstead plays the Maker Keeper, who's in charge of harvesting the Water of Life from young worms. She appears in just one scene, but it's an important job. The Dune films have raised concerns in the way they lean on Middle Eastern culture for world-building but don't include MENA actors. No body/size diversity, unless you count the Baron, whose grotesqueness is unfortunately tied to his larger size and eating. Frequent sci-fi/action violence, though little is very gory. Guns and shooting; people get shot, including a villain who's shot with a high-powered weapon, goes flying, and explodes. Piles of bodies are burned with flamethrowers, and other dead bodies are shown. Many buildings and ships are blown up. Atomic warheads. Sound of women screaming; sight of two dead women in the corner of the Baron's chamber. Neck-snapping. A man slices the necks of two women to test the sharpness of his blade. Bloody wounds. Characters fall from a high cliff. Many scenes of fighting with knives and swords; characters stabbed, sliced. Martial arts fighting. Character smashes a villain's helmet and face with a large rock. A character repeatedly smashes another's head onto a control panel. Small hook punctures a person's skin. Woman goes through ""water of life"" ceremony, writhing in agony, blood crusted on her nose. Characters are forced to kiss others' boots. Angry mob. Visions of a famine, with people howling in pain. Birds killed with flamethrower. Slapping. Gross stuff includes vomiting. One character lies on top of another, their faces close together, panting and out of breath; sex could be implied. Characters kiss more than once. One character appears to seduce another; dialogue about a man being ""sexually vulnerable"" and a woman being pregnant. One character insults another by saying ""you sandwalk like a drunk lizard."" ""Spice"" is described as a drug that has good properties but is also addictive; the only side effect is that it turns users' eyes luminous blue. It's not really depicted as a substance that can be abused. It's more just ""the thing"" that both the heroes and villains want to get their hands on. Parents need to know that Dune: Part Two is the second half of the sci-fi epic based on Frank Herbert's epic 1965 novel that began with 2021's Dune. Violence is the biggest issue: Expect lots of fighting, shooting (with futuristic guns), battling with knives/blades, slicing and slashing (very little blood shown), a few bloody wounds, many explosions, atomic warheads, head-bashing, neck-snapping, and more. Characters kiss, and there are two suggestions of sex: Once when one character lies on top of another, their faces close and both breathing heavily, and the other mentioned in dialogue. Infrequent language includes uses of ""s--t,"" ""piss,"" ""hell,"" and ""moron."" The story is about a drug known as ""spice,"" but it's more of a thing for everyone to fight over than a real drug. Despite some stuffy, draggy parts, this film is more satisfying than the first, with more nuanced themes—and its technical aspects are just as superb as its predecessor's. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya co-star. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In DUNE: PART TWO, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have been welcomed among the Fremen. Jessica drinks the Water of Life and becomes the new Reverend Mother, while Paul continues to face tests like surviving alone in the desert and riding sand worms. The Fremen regularly attack spice production plants, causing the evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) to send troops to shut the Fremen down. But the Fremen easily dispatch the invaders, who aren't acclimated to the desert atmosphere on Arrakis. Meanwhile, there are rumblings of a prophecy—encouraged by Jessica—that Paul may be the ""chosen one"" who's destined to lead the Fremen to paradise, although Paul publicly denies this. The Fremen are divided: Leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes in the prophecy, but Chani (Zendaya), who has fallen in love with Paul, fervently doesn't. The Baron ups the ante by putting his cruel nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) in charge of spice production on Arrakis. But Paul has been encouraged by his mother to drink the Water of Life (something no man has ever survived), and nothing will ever be the same. While this sequel isn't without stuffy, slow spots, it's far more propulsive than its predecessor, and it manages to tell an exceedingly complex story in a gloriously visual and compelling way. Now that we've moved past all the exposition required for this tale (as seen in Dune), Dune: Part Two jumps right into things, with the Fremen trying to get the attention of Baron Harkonnen and the emperor by attacking various spice plants. Some of the action scenes are effective and even exciting, but it seems as if director Denis Villeneuve doesn't exactly relish them; many fights are overly choreographed and cursory. (His best films, Sicario and Arrival, didn't require them, while his Blade Runner 2049 was dragged down by them.) Yet Villeneuve's elegant, expansive compositions and wise storytelling make up for it. He and co-screenwriter Jon Spaihts have dug deep into Frank Herbert's dense source novel and found themes that aren't only relevant, but urgent. The movie questions the reasons behind leadership and quests for power and the deceptive tools—fear and faith—that can quickly and easily lead to power. As a result, Paul is no longer the shining hero he appeared to be in David Lynch's 1984 Dune. He's an opportunist who's seeking to use power for his own personal goals (in this case, revenge). And he's scarily familiar. Despite its flaws, Dune: Part Two is, along with its predecessor, an uncommonly intelligent, even daring entry into the canon of sci-fi action epics—and one that's worth discussing as much as it's worth enjoying. Families can talk about Dune: Part Two's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? Why is ""spice"" considered a drug? Is it meant to represent drugs as we know them? Is it glamorized? Are there consequences for using it? What are some of the movie's themes? How can sci-fi be used to explore real-life issues like the use of faith and/or fear as tools to rise to power? How does this movie compare to the novel, the previous movie, and/or the TV movie? How is it different from those versions? How is it the same?

"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE," Picking up where the first film left off, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two sees the war for the spice-rich desert realm Arrakis raging on, as betrayed colonial prince Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) joins the fight on the side of the planet’s Middle Eastern-inspired indigenous population, the Fremen. The year is 10,191—according to the book by Frank Herbert, published in 1965, this is some 20,000 years in our future—and while Earthbound languages and cultures have morphed, contemporary concerns of territory, resources, and religious fanaticism remain. This is the backdrop against which these new Dune films unfold, and while they present stark, often dreamlike visions of Arrakis, these are dreams that wrestle with an Orientalist viewpoint, alternatingly attempting subversions of Western imperial thought, while inadvertently leaning into them as well. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, Dune: Part Two tends toward the latter, a failing that goes hand-in-hand with its inability to remain engaging for more than a few scenes at a time, thanks to images that lack vitality. What is perhaps most dreamlike about Dune: Part Two is the way its characters move. The invading Harkonnens—Herbert’s heavily militarized, Soviet-inspired conspirators, who killed Paul’s father rather than handing him the keys to Arrakis’ spice fields—float soundlessly through the air. Meanwhile Paul, his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and their Fremen comrades move beneath the sand, emerging suddenly to launch hand-to-hand offensives with machete-like blades. This dreamlike quality extends to the way Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser allow light to pierce through the corners of the frame in initial scenes, creating a hazy effect that lingers when the film begins delving into spiritual territory. Some of the Fremen believe Paul to be a prophet, whose arrival was once foretold by Jessica’s own religious cult (the Bene Gesserit), who happen to pull the strings of power alongside an aloof galactic emperor (Christopher Walken) and his cunning daughter (Florence Pugh), who rule over the Harkonnens, the Atreides, and so forth. If there’s one thing Dune: Part Two nails as a sci-fi sequel, it’s quickly getting its audience up to speed on the existing story while establishing these political mechanics. Like Paul, Jessica is given a position of religious importance within the Fremen ranks, which requires her to drink a clear blue poison derived from the planet’s notorious sandworms, an act which gives her the power of foresight and ends up corrupting her in the process (or bringing out an inner ambition, which had thus far lain dormant). While Paul hopes to take his revenge on the Harkonnens before altruistically handing the planet’s rule back to its people, Jessica tries to wield the Fremen’s belief in Paul’s divinity to consolidate power. Ferguson’s hypnotic presence as an ambitious, mystical matriarch is fascinating to watch, however, the film doesn’t just have her work in the shadows, but truncates her role to one that largely unfolds in the shadows too, far off-screen. As a mother with a psychic connection to her unborn daughter, she’s a “Villeneuve woman” if there ever was one, wrestling with the anxieties of birth and motherhood as many of his characters have (in films like August 32nd on Earth, Maelström, Polytechnique, Incendies, Enemy, and Arrival). In Herbert’s book, and in David Lynch’s 1984 film adaptation, Jessica gives birth during the events of the story, but by keeping her pregnant throughout Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts add a sense of mystery to these events, and to Jessica’s supposed connection and conversations with her unborn daughter, leading to questions about from where her ambitions stem. It’s a shame, then, that Jessica’s part in the story—which so overtly shapes the rest of Dune: Part Two—is reduced to mere plot mechanics unfolding far in the background. The film is largely concerned with Paul’s exploits as he learns the ways of the Fremen from its military leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and from his warrior love-interest Chani (Zendaya). It’s here that that movie begins to flounder, both structurally and thematically. On one hand, there’s little clarity as to the Harkonnens’ objectives beyond rooting out the Fremen revolutionaries; their overarching motive is clear, but individual battle scenes and military offensives appear at random for Paul and the Fremen to deal with, before the film returns to its stilted tale of Paul absorbing more of Fremen culture. The film has little sense of momentum. On the other hand, the cultural aspects of this Dune duology leaves a lingering bitterness, given how malformed they tend to be. The first film made it clear, through Chani’s opening narration, that the Atreides and the Harkonnens were dueling imperial forces, despite being established as the respective protagonists and antagonists of the story. Like the book, it crafted an imaginary Middle East that had long been the center of imperial conflicts between colonial forces; the films’ closest parallel, perhaps, is the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the ’70s and ’80s and America’s subsequent response, though the nebulous, post-9/11 “War on Terror” Middle East is hard to ignore as a modern influence, for better or worse. These setups are nominally paid off in Part Two, in which the Fremen are a more central focus, but the movie’s mish-mash Arab-Persian culture ends up a bizarrely sanitized fixture. Herbert’s Fremen spoke a language much more directly influenced by Arabic, not only linguistically, but politically. A key line in the film (subtitled as “long live the fighters”) features Chalamet speaking a new Fremen language entirely made up for the movie, whereas in the novel, this line was spoken as “Ya hya chouhada,” and anglicization of “Ya hya shuhadā,” a real slogan yelled by Algerian freedom fighters against French forces in the years before Dune was published. It also, notably, translates to “long live the martyrs,” though the idea of martyrdom in the context of Islam, when viewed through a modern Western lens, has come to conjure ideas of terrorist militancy. Similarly, the word “jihad” (or “struggle”), which frequently recurs in the novel, may conjure similar ideas for contemporary Western audiences, and has thus been scrubbed from the movies and occasionally replaced with “holy war.” Between erasing most of the Arabic roots of the Fremen’s language, and by refusing to place phrases associated with Arab freedom and consciousness-raising in the mouths of its ostensible heroes, the movie can't help but feel cowardly and apologetic in the way it translates Herbert’s influences, in a story whose coding leads distinctly to a tale of Arab and Middle Eastern struggle against colonial powers. These changes, while seemingly minor in the grand scheme of things, are emblematic of the film’s overarching narrative point of view, one which takes Herbert’s re-imagining of an Islamic galactic power structure (with mostly Shia influences) and further re-imagines it as a patronizing tale of saviorism. That the film doesn’t go down a traditional “white savior” path and subverts its outcome doesn’t prevent these mechanics from taking hold. Herbet’s book—a product of its time—undoubtedly had its own issues of racial and cultural optics. However, by downplaying his inspirations in this specific way, while keeping their essence intact through Arabic- and Persian-inspired names and various Arabic phrases—Paul’s Fremen nickname is “Usul,” meaning “base” or “foundation”—the resultant film is Arab and Islamic in its superficial optics, but overlaid with a Western political viewpoint. It erases, in the process, the source material’s revolutionary spirit. Paul is interested in learning about the Fremen, and he does, though much of this learning depicted on-screen ends up nominal, and is portrayed through stray words of wisdom rather than cultural experience and the transformation of perspective. Paul theoretically undergoes a shift along the way, but the audience is seldom granted a window into this journey; to the viewer, the heavily Bedouin-coded Fremen are little more than a backdrop, rather than a vibrant people of their own. The extras and minor Fremen characters are cast from among Middle Eastern and North African actors, but apart from Black American actress Zendaya, their primary speaking part belongs to the white Spaniard Bardem, a decision that—despite the fun Bardem seems to have in the role of Stilgar—is optically uncomfortable at best. Stilgar proves problematic in other ways too. As the film’s central religious fanatic, his uncompromising belief in prophecy is a major turning point for the film, though its treatment is often tongue-in-cheek. The power of belief is a central facet of the story, but Villeneuve doesn’t see it fit to take it seriously when the aforementioned belief is a sci-fi descendent of Islamic prophethood. Without the emotional sweep of this Islam-inspired faith to buoy its operatic imagery, the frame feels empty, despite being stuffed to the gills with sand and dust. The film, instead of letting its most uncomfortable emotions linger, takes a much more didactic approach. When Paul eventually turns towards desiring power (as if on a dime), Villeneuve holds his audience’s hand and guides them through the morality of this decision by cutting frequently to disapproving looks from Chani, who may as well be turning to the camera to tell the viewer “the filmmaker doesn’t endorse Paul’s naughty behavior!” (It certainly doesn’t help that Zendaya’s silent close-ups are acted as forcefully and overtly as an amateur high school play). Until Paul’s sudden lust for power, Chalamet’s performance is similarly stilted, leading to a dull central romance that takes up far too much of the movie’s already gargantuan 166-minute runtime. However, there’s a 15-minute detour midway through, during which Dune: Part Two bursts to life, in ways that feels both instructive when it comes to making a major Hollywood blockbuster such as this, as well as like a Rosetta stone for why the rest of the movie fails to make an impact. Back on the Harkonnens’ home planet—under a “black sun” that renders the images practically monochrome—this clans’ own prince, the psychotic sadist Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) enters the fray, in the form of a blood-soaked gladiatorial performance in an enormous, Brutalist arena.  Butler’s giddy, unhinged physical performance is matched by a sense of vivid imagery that elevates him to the level of fearsome and demonic—an aesthetic approach that almost never applies to Paul, rendering his own crescendos largely null—while the pulsating music and innovatively conceived alien lighting designs (fireworks made of ink!) make the image pop. An immense amount of thought and artistry brings this segment to life, but the film very quickly returns to its flat, noncommittal framing of Paul that’s rarely interesting to watch, and never leaves a visceral impact. Despite being a film about mysticism, spirituality, and the mechanics of power, these ideas seldom translate into the images themselves, which are often obscured by clouds of dusty sand. The first time Paul straddles and rides an enormous sandworm, you barely see it, despite Hans Zimmer’s thundering score attempting to imbue the scene with pomp and circumstance (thankfully, Zimmer keeps the Orientalist ululating to a minimum this time, opting instead for a more thematically appropriate thundering bass)."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," “Dune: Part Two” allows writer/director Denis Villeneuve to examine some weighty things like religion, politics and destiny in the middle of a sweeping, epic, visually stunning film. Plus, sandworms! Frank Herbert’s wildly influential novel “Dune” has seen its share of adaptations, but Villeneuve is the first to present its complexities and nuances in the grandest, most thrilling way imaginable. Villeneuve used 2021’s “Dune” to set the stage of this intergalactic power struggle. In the distant future, the royal Atreides family is given control of the desert planet of Arrakis which is home to an incredibly valuable natural resource known as “spice.” Young Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) joins his family on the planet only to be ambushed by the rival Harkonnen family, led by the super-evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). While the Atreides family and their entire military are wiped out, Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) escape into the desert and are taken in by the Fremen, the indigenous people of Arrakis. In “Dune: Part Two,” Paul and Jessica learn the ways of the desert, while tribal leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) starts to believe that Paul may be a prophesized messiah come to free the Fremen from oppression and restore Arrakis to glory. Young warrior Chani (Zendaya) is skeptical of Paul’s status as the “chosen one,” but is still drawn to his bravery and determination, and romance begins to spark between the two. Revenge against the Harkonnens is at the top of Paul’s mind and he bides his time in the desert while being haunted by visions of the future where he is the leader of a bloody genocide. While the story has a lot to chew on, the visual spectacle on display here is one of the main reasons we go to the movies in the first place. “Dune: Part Two” is packed to the gills with thrilling battles, sweeping vistas and movie stars. Chalamet and Zendaya are two of the hottest commodities Gen Z has to offer and they are joined in the cast by fellow trending up-and-comers Austin Butler and Florence Pugh. Holding down the fort of excellent, established actors with Ferguson, Bardem and Skarsgard are Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista and Christopher Walken. It’s like an entire awards show crammed into one movie. “Dune: Part Two” solidifies Villeneuve’s vision as the sci-fi epic of our time and I can’t wait for the inevitable return to Arrakis to see what happens next."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert's celebrated 1965 sci-fi novel is set some 20,000 years in the future. Human civilisation has collapsed, only to be reborn as an intergalactic feudal society ruled by a constellation of royal planets all vying for the favour of the machiavellian emperor. Not quite the kind of near-future timeframe that is the usual preserve of science fiction but for all the remoteness of a far-flung universe, the heraldic tale of flawed and conflicted hero Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the oldest story in the known universe. And boy, is Dune a tragedy. Villeneuve’s gobsmacking Dune Part One was all talky and impressionistic exposition, setting the scene for a universe of the mysterious witchy sisterhood the Bene Gesserit, warring noble families, giant sandworms, instantaneous space travel and trippy visions. It was a world-building space opera of unparalleled dimensions. That pent-up energy explodes into full, vivid life in this formidable second half. But amid all the brilliantly mounted action pieces, Dune Part Two is a sombre and sinister affair. It teems with menace and earnestness, almost to the point of bombast but Villeneuve, a fan of the book since he was a boy growing up in Quebec, also manages to capture on screen the twitchy and paranoid tale at the heart of Herbert’s monumental novel. Two years after Dune Part One fared far better at the box office (and the Oscars) than even the director dared to hope, we are dropped like a floating Sardaukar warrior back into the vertiginous world of Arrakis and almost immediately the darkness descends. Shrouded in desert mysticism and arcane utterances, Villeneuve again takes his visual cues from the likes of Lawrence of Arabia (a noted influence on Herbert’s novel) and even Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ for a sense of brutal future realism. The noble House Atreides has been duped by the calculating Emperor into taking over the desert planet, much to the petulant chagrin of House Harkonnen, a renegade royal house with black blood and a talent for casual murder, headed by the corpulent mass of flesh that is Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). He executes a coup that leaves most of House Atreides butchered but the aristocratic Duke Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have escaped into the boundless desert and inveigled their way into the good favours of the mysterious and dangerous natives, the Fremen, a nomadic people led by Stilgar, played again by a lugubrious Javier Bardem. From here Dune Part Two takes off as a full-blooded action movie with an even more sprawling cast and, perhaps with his eye on that crucial teen audience, Villeneuve focuses on the romance between Paul and young Fremen woman Chani (a flinty Zendaya). However, an expanded cast means far more players on the chessboard and even as Villeneuve sheds some of the intricacies of the novel, character development tends to suffer. Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV (Christopher Walken, sulking his way through most of short time he’s on screen) and his crafty daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) barely make an impression and even Paul and Chani’s pivotal romance seems inert and rarely fleshed out. Josh Brolin’s scowling imperial enforcer Gurney Helleck is back and pricks the pomposity with some well-aimed one-liners and even at one point a song (a jaunty little number on oud with the lyric, ""His stillsuit is full of piss…""), while blink and you’ll miss 'em appearances from Anya Taylor-Joy and Léa Seydoux leave their own lingering mystique. Villeneuve keeps the book’s myriad moving parts pumping with sheer force of will and jolts of pure adrenalin. He cuts from close-up intimacies of the leads (ah, so that’s how you kiss while wearing a stillsuit) and spectacular pitched battles. One minute we are studying faces in extreme closeup, trying to divine their innermost thoughts, the next we are looking at distant figures dwarfed by the Monument Valley vastness of Arrakis. Chalamet as the aristocrat turned desert messiah certainly grows into the role as he grapples with a destiny that clearly appals him. He is destined for a cosmic reckoning with the hated Harkonnens but he knows his taste for revenge (an unthinkable motive for something as chivalrous as, say, a Jedi knight) must have been encoded by the genetic manipulation of those pesky Bene Gesserit nuns. However, it is Austin Butler as intergalactic villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen who turns the sand to glass here. A black-toothed albino with alopecia and a deeply unnerving fetish for outlandish looking knives, he radiates menace and a talent for casual butchery that makes the bloated baron look reasonable. Even those giant worms - as big as a jumbo jet and just as loud - that caused so much eyerolling and tittering in David Lynch’s bonkers but hugely entertaining 1984 Dune adaptation, come to ferocious life and the HR Geiger-like hardware clanks and whirrs out in the desert as the Fremen wage an increasingly effective guerrilla war against the enemy. It is a truth universally acknowledged in science fiction that The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars movie and so it is with Dune Part Two. It’s better than the first one but do we get a third chapter? According to reports, Villeneuve has already began writing an adaptation of Dune Messiah, Herbert’s sequel in which Paul isn’t just the messiah, he’s also a very naughty boy. For now, the new Dune reaches a fever pitch of seductive strangeness and operatic drama. It’s a tragedy about the dangers of power and fanatism, a romance, and a superb action movie. Villeneuve’s audacious vision has set a new standard for the cinematic sci-fi epic. © RTÉ 2024. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The original novel, written by Frank Herbert in 1965, envisioned a universe several thousand years in the future where space travel is a reality, but male-dominated feudal systems have stuck around. There are emperors, dukes, soldiers and peasants; when women have power, it’s only exercised in the shadows. War is still fought (often with swords), and religion remains the dominant means of controlling the masses."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"  Part Two is largely about the further struggles of Paul (Chalomet), scion of the once great, now kaput House of Atreides, which in Part One was wiped out in a grand tangle of hostilities involving the Emperor (Christopher Walken, new to the franchise) and the grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), who looks like a sea elephant that got caught in an oil spill.
  Hiding out on a desert planet Arrakis (accent color: cinnamon), Paul has joined forces with a rebel people, the Freman, and is developing a nice if still tenuous relationship with a brave female warrior named Chani (Zendaya). Meanwhile, his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) glugs down a liquid that has the crystalline aqua-blue of a commercial mouthwash or dental rinse. In fact, it’s the Water of Life, which elevates her to a state of exalted reverence and mystical insight among the rebels. She really ups her game!
  There’s also an enjoyable nasty new villain, Feyd-Rautha, the Baron’s nephew: Played by Elvis’s Austin Butler with a bald head and toothless gums, he’s like a toxic baby. In one extraordinary segment, filmed in near-black and white, he fights a gladiatorial battle in a immense stadium that could have been designed by the galaxy's preeminent fascist architect.
  The film's bounty of new characters and performers give it a heightened sense of drama that’s at once both grander and more nuanced than Part One’s. Florence Pugh, as the Emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan, isn’t given much to do here other than wear a metallic headdress that has a certain Art Deco flair — her costume cries out for bugle beads — but she conveys a tactical intelligence and resolve that serve the princess well in the end. As Lady Margot, member of that aforementioned Sisterhood that has everything to do with Paul’s destiny and nothing to do with traveling pants, Léa Seydoux is seductive and secretive.
  Anya Taylor-Joy shows up for a brief cameo, just long enough for her gimlet eyes to register onscreen, as a woman who'll be significant if a third Dune movie ever gets going.
  The only point of concern, unfortunately, is Chalamet: His performance in Part One was both passionate and intelligent. Here it’s hard to say whether he quite grasps Paul’s emerging ruthlessness and will. Paul, in the Shakespearean manner of fantasy epics, must mature into the leader that fate demands. In the big finale, Chalamet mostly seems flustered and annoyed, like someone disappointed with his hotel accommodations. You wonder if he wasn’t better off making those Wonka chocolates. Oh, Timbo!
"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," It’s here. Three years since Denis Villeneuve unleashed his thematically nuanced, quakingly spectacular interpretation of Dune, the concluding half that nearly never was has appeared.  When the first chapter hit cinemas in 2021, this sequel – the second chunk of Villeneuve’s bisected adaptation of Frank ­Herbert’s seminal sci-fi epic – hadn’t been given the go-ahead by studio bosses, lest we forget. Had that first film’s reception been lacklustre or, heaven forbid, another pandemic had ­cocooned movie goers for months on end, Villeneuve’s Dune might well have gone the way of earlier failed or unsatisfactory attempts by Alejandro Jodorowsky and ­David Lynch, perpetuating a Hollywood hex over the franchise. But we’ve learned to never doubt Villeneuve, the canny French-Canadian who has shown a Midas touch time and again whatever the project. Healthy ticket receipts and awards success greeted his two-and-a-half-hour sci-fi event. Goodbye Dune curse, and hello at last to a worthy cinema treatment for the novel that inspired Star Wars and Avatar. For all this, a slight caveat persists. While this sequel is as sweeping and visually unforgettable as its predecessor, there comes a familiar feeling in the ­final passages. As in part one, we’ve just sat through a very good film but not a complete one. The payout you expect after 165 minutes is diluted because, while Herbert’s original doorstop has been covered, we’re still left asking: ‘Yes, but how does it all end?’ Villeneuve has said that if he gets his way, he’ll make Dune: Messiah – the second novel in Herbert’s series – to round off what he has always envisaged as a trilogy. By the time the credits roll on Dune: Part Two, it’s obvious why this narrative capstone is necessary. For now, we must accept that only two-thirds of the job is done.​ When we last saw Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), they had fled an ambush by House Harkonnen and joined Arrakis’s desert-dwelling natives, the Fremen. Fremen leader Stilgar ­(Javier Bardem, providing whiffs of comic relief here and there) is convinced Paul is the one the prophecies foretold. Not everyone is so sure, including gutsy warrioress Chani (Zendaya). With his people massacred and the Fremen now presenting a potential army to mete out revenge on House Harkonnen, Paul goes fully native – desert-walking, sandworm-riding, and getting lost in Chani’s blue eyes. All the while, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is having his spice harvest destroyed by Fremen guerilla raids led by Paul. To bring Arrakis to heel, Harkonnen must dispatch his nephew and eventual successor (a ghoulish Austin Butler). With all that going on, we have a different house to monitor, that of an all-powerful emperor (Christopher Walken) and his intuitive daughter (Florence Pugh) who have skin in the game. Should Villeneuve’s Dune project remain a two-parter then it will be a lopsided diptych, the first film full of sensation and mood and the second busy with plot dynamics (that all but point towards a climactic third film). In all other ways, this second Dune is an accomplishment in sci-fi cinema told in a heightened register. Hans Zimmer’s score thunders away. Greig Fraser’s desert cinematography (filmed in Jordan and the UAE) remains startlingly beautiful. Chalamet continues to come of age as a leading man for a new generation, and every familiar face in a crowded all-star ensemble appears key to the elaborate task."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," When I reviewed the first Dune movie two and a half years ago, I reported that it left me cold, but I allowed for the possibility that the sequel might make the first film look better in retrospect. Now that I’ve seen Dune: Part Two, I’m glad that I left that door open for myself. Not that I’m entirely happy with Part Two, but it does that job, and it’s a better movie on its own. One of my problems with the first Dune was that the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) didn’t really start until the end of that film. It picks up in earnest here, as he and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are war refugees living off the charity of the oppressed Fremen of the planet Arrakis. Half the planet thinks Paul is a messiah foretold by a prophecy who will liberate the planet, while the other half thinks the prophecy is a load of crap. He tries to downplay his status, well aware that being a chosen one will subject him to danger from his followers even more than his enemies. On the other hand, his mother cynically whips up religious sentiment among the people to protect Paul and his unborn sibling with whom she’s pregnant. Paul looks to gain the attention of the emperor (Christopher Walken), unaware that the emperor is the one behind the Harkonnens’ massacre of Paul’s father and clan. Most of the supporting characters — Paul’s love interest Chani (Zendaya), the Fremen leader (Javier Bardem), and the Harkonnens’ hothead lieutenant (Dave Bautista) — come off as more rounded figures here, so it’s worrying that Chalamet seems swallowed up by the epic scale for so much of the film. He is holding back, but then, five hours over two films is a long time to hold back. Only in the latter stages does he finally cut loose, embracing his messiah-ness and going full cult leader to rally the Fremen against their rulers. It is more than a bit disturbing, especially when he proposes marriage to the emperor’s daughter (Florence Pugh, playing a subtle political operator who nevertheless can still be outsmarted) in front of Chani, a scene made more awkward by the way Paul steamrolls over her feelings. Director/co-writer Denis Villeneuve still has some trouble toggling between the plotlines with Paul fighting alongside the Fremen, the Harkonnens fruitlessly trying to wipe out the resistance, and the emperor trying to hold onto power. Fortunately, Villeneuve still has an eye for striking visuals, such as Chani running for shelter while the Harkonnen airship that she shot down crashes behind her in flames. A black-and-white interval replete with black fireworks introduces us to the Harkonnens’ psychopathic heir apparent (Austin Butler) as he slaughters some fighters in a gladiator ring. (A shaven-headed Butler makes a properly hair-raising adversary — he likes stabbing his chambermaids to death just to test the sharpness of his swords, and regrettably, he can win a fair fight, too.) Villeneuve does not disappoint with the movie’s two big set pieces, a ritual when Paul rides a massive sandworm and proves his manhood to the Fremen and the climactic battle when the Fremen deliver a smackdown to the Harkonnens and to the high priestess (Charlotte Rampling), who all have it coming. The tragic element of the story doesn’t quite hit home here, but I daresay that will receive more treatment in a subsequent film. The better part of Dune: Part Two is the complexity of what it says about religion, as the Fremen’s belief in their messiah propels them to ultimate victory but leads them in a direction that only disgusts Chani. Lady Jessica’s order has been corrupted by its ties to the emperor, but Lady Jessica has her own self-interested reasons for breaking away and installing herself as a new reverend mother. These are subjects that other blockbuster franchises have studiously avoided, or botched, in the case of those Star Wars films. The focus on the power and the limits of faith distinguishes the Dune films from the herd."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two se enfoca en el sustrato religioso y mitológico que anima la fe de un pueblo oprimido y en circunstancias de vida paupérrimas. Para la mayoría de las personas la palabra mito designa un relato de ficción que, en el mejor de los casos, sirve de divertimento o vehículo para algún tipo de enseñanza. Los catedráticos realzan su valor cultural, como si fuese una radiografía de un tiempo lejano. Para la escuela de Psicología Analítica Profunda, representa una fuente inagotable de conocimiento y la vía regia para delinear una parte del inmarcesible contenido arquetipal que reposa en el inconsciente colectivo. Joseph Campbell sostendrá que su fin último es teleológico. María Tatar propondrá la necesidad de deconstruir y reinterpretar el mito para que se adapte a la modernidad. Todas estas visiones, aunque son de suma utilidad, suelen pasar por alto la definición Tradicional que expone Mircea Eliade en Mito y realidad: “El mito designa, una historia verdadera, y lo que es más, una historia de inapreciable valor, porque es sagrada, ejemplar y significativa (…) revelación primordial, modelo ejemplar fijado por los dioses y héroes fundadores”.  Viéndolo desde esta perspectiva, el mito se nos revela como algo sumamente poderoso: es la piedra fundacional de religiones, escuelas de misterios, sectas y líderes (desde los albores de la humanidad hasta el sol de hoy). ¿Qué sucede cuando las fronteras entre lo sagrado y lo profano se desdibujan?, ¿qué tan peligroso es que un mito se tuerza hasta transformarse en profecía?, ¿cómo se puede diferenciar entre ideación y revelación?, estas son algunas de las preguntas que nos deja  Dune: Part Two, la nueva entrega de esta laureada trilogía de Denis Villeneuve y uno de los títulos más esperados del 2024. La historia comienza poco tiempo después del final de Dune (2021) con un Paul Atreides (Timothée Chálamet) intentando acoplarse a la cultura de los Fremen en el desértico planeta Arrakis. Acompañado de su madre Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) y lidiando con los prejuicios del lugar, nuestro protagonista deberá enfrentarse a una serie de pruebas (de vida o muerte) para demostrar que puede ser un guerrero digno. Una tarea harto complicada, pero factible gracias a la ayuda de Chani (Zendaya), una de las jóvenes del pueblo, con la que Paul comienza a desarrollar una relación sentimental. En paralelo, el despiadado Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) manda a su terrible sobrino Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) a que ataque constantemente a los Fremen con el fin último de corroborar la extinción de la casa Atreides. Las cosas se complican cuando Stilgar (Javier Bardem), uno de los líderes de Arrakis, comienza a alimentar en el pueblo la idea de que Paul es el Mesías de una antigua profecía que tiene como fin la liberación de Arrakis. Un mito que es alimentado por Jessica y que obligará a Paul a tomar una serie de decisiones para que se transforme en el líder de una poderosa revolución.  Dune: Part Two se enfoca en el sustrato religioso y mitológico que anima la fe de un pueblo oprimido y en circunstancias de vida paupérrimas. Así como Dune se dedicó a presentar las estructuras de poder político y social,  Dune: Part Two se enfoca en el sustrato religioso y mitológico que anima la fe de un pueblo oprimido y en circunstancias de vida paupérrimas. No hay que ser profeta ni haber leído la novela para que el resultado salte a la vista: estamos frente a una olla de presión alimentada por una sociedad donde el fundamentalismo, los delirios mesiánicos, el consumo de enteógenos, la manipulación política, el juego de poder alrededor de la explotación de recursos naturales y las fantasías de una guerra santa están a la orden del día. Por supuesto, los paralelismos con nuestra actualidad son más que aterradores y esto hace que el guion de esta entrega se sienta mucho más complejo y rico en subtexto que su predecesora. Escrita por Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Dune) y Jon Spaihts (Dune, Prometheus, Doctor Strange), Dune: Part Two  saca provecho de ser una secuela y partir de la premisa que el espectador ya está familiarizado con el mundo que presenta. De esta forma, la historia no gasta tiempo en el world building y se centra en desarrollar mucho más la cultura de los Fremen, las intrigas alrededor del poder y las relaciones entre personajes. Esto da como resultado una historia con un ritmo mucho más dinámico, casi libre de diálogos expositivos, y que se permite explorar mucho más el viaje interior de Paul. Por último, y sin ningún tipo de spoilers, el cierre de esta entrega es casi redondo y no termina en un cliffhanger tan incómodo como el de Dune (cuya principal crítica es su final abrupto). La dirección de Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Sicario, Dune) en esta entrega está en todo su esplendor. Más allá de su impronta característica (llena de planos perfectamente compuestos, movimientos de cámara estilizados, secuencias cargadas de tensión y locaciones imponentes), la película avanza in crescendo con un ritmo que en ningún momento se pierde entre los cambios tan extremos de registro que desarrolla la historia (thriller político, ciencia ficción, delirio místico, peleas cuerpo a cuerpo, tiroteos bélicos y drama shakespeariano con ligeras dosis de romance). Gracias a la precisión de la puesta en escena de Villeneuve y su maravilloso cast, logra que personajes completamente excéntricos —y que fácilmente pudiesen ser caricaturas ridículas— se sientan terriblemente reales y peligrosos. La solemnidad de las dunas de Arrakis, las intrigas de pasillo, Sacerdotisas misteriosas, coliseos enormes, naves espaciales, guerreros fundamentalistas, visiones apocalípticas, emperadores maquiavélicos, herederos psicopáticos, héroes con delirios de grandeza, madres manipuladoras y hasta un feto que habla: todos estos elementos completamente heterogéneos —y muchos más— encajan a la perfección en el mosaico visual que construye su director, hipnotizándonos con la diversidad del mundo de Dune, pero sin jamás sacarnos del mood de la historia. Por supuesto, al lado de Villeneuve tenemos a todo el equipo creativo que arrasó en el 2022 con los premios de la Academia en las categorías técnicas. En esta ocasión, la fotografía Greig Fraser ( The Batman, The Creator, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Foxcatcher) sube la barra en su preciosismo visual y pericia técnica. Desde la secuencia con el gusano de arena, pasando por el coliseo en blanco y negro, hasta explorar toda la paleta de colores del desierto, Fraser consigue que cada cuadro de Dune: Part Two sea coherente en su look and feel aunque tenga lugares completamente heterogéneos en color y luz. El diseño de producción de Patrice Vermette ( Arrival, Enemy, Prisioners, Vice) explora espacios más “rudimentarios” que en la primera entrega, pero sin perder el setting de ciencia ficción o caer en los lugares comunes del género. Gracias al trabajo previo en Dune, acá la personalidad visual de la historia se termina de consolidar y todas las locaciones nuevas calzan sin problema en la impronta del universo. Por si fuera poco, Vermette incluye algunas referencias veladas a otros títulos de la ciencia ficción y la fantasía sin romper la unidad estética del film (algo que será el deleite de los cinéfilos). Otro punto clave y reverenciado en Dune: Part Two es la edición de Joe Walker (Arrival, Sicario, The Creator). Apoyándose en el montaje sintético para exprimir la expresividad de cada cuadro (que parece casi inagotable gracias a su impecable estética y composición), Walker logra conseguir el perfecto equilibrio entre tensión y contemplación. Al mismo tiempo, construye el dinamismo del relato valiéndose del montaje paralelo (pasando de una trama a otra, insertando visiones o cambiando de registro dramático), sin necesidad de echar mano de artificios exteriores como el montaje rítmico. Por último, la música del laureado Hans Zimmer (Inception, Interstellar, The Dark Night) sigue explorando otras versiones de los temas creados para Dune, poniendo el énfasis en composiciones donde se mezclan voces del Medio Oriente con acordes que nos resuenan a ciencia ficción (donde el feeling épico/mágico/imperial/religioso está a la orden del día en una perenne tensión). Mesías en hybris. Su transición a la esfera de poder es completamente orgánica y las secuencias de acción que tiene (sobre todo las peleas cuerpo a cuerpo) están muy bien coreografiadas. A diferencia de la entrega anterior, acá Zendaya si tiene bastante tiempo en pantalla. Su actuación sigue la misma línea de los personajes que suele encarnar: la chica ruda, independiente, que se enamora de un chico que quiere cuidar, pero sin demostrar demasiado su emocionalidad (una suerte de tsundere). Registro que funciona perfecto, pero que no es nada nuevo en su carrera. Rebecca Ferguson, como siempre, es de lo mejor de la película. Acá saca su lado más oscuro y manipulador, transformándose en una especie de bruja que, por momentos, eclipsa a cualquier otro villano de la historia. Como una suerte de Lady Macbeth ejerce su poder tras bastidores y su personaje nos mantiene enganchados sospechando de cada uno de sus movimientos. Javier Bardem funge como mentor y comic relief con intervenciones puntuales que, entre risas, nos permiten acercarnos con cautela al tema del fanatismo religioso. Stellan Skarsgård y Dave Bautista siguen encarnando personajes peligrosos y detestables, pero el que les roba el show es Austin Butler quien da vida a el mejor antagonista de toda la saga (y que con pocos minutos en pantalla nos seduce). De la misma forma, las apariciones de Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux y Christopher Walken son puntuales, pero sumamente potentes, manteniéndonos hipnotizados por su performance y las decisiones de sus personajes. Dune: Part Two sube la barra de la primera entrega transformándose en una de las mejores películas de la ciencia ficción moderna. Denis Villeneuve hizo con la obra de Frank Herbert lo que Peter Jackson con Tolkien o Francis Ford Coppola con Puzo: una adaptación perfecta que enriquece con sus imágenes al texto original. Mientras que Dune se enfocó en las intrigas políticas y las diferentes casas que interactúan por el poder (en la onda de Game of Thrones), esta entrega se dedica a desarrollar la cosmovisión de los Fremen y las complejidades religiosas que encarnan (divididos entre agnósticos y fundamentalistas). A través de la construcción del mito del Mesías que encarna Paul vemos la compleja —y peligrosa— dinámica entre religión y política. Utilizando la profecía para elevar a un “extranjero"" a la categoría de Mesías (ungido por Dios), las desérticas dunas de Arrakis se nos presentan más cerca de nosotros de lo que quisiéramos. Los miedos alrededor del fanatismo, la guerra santa, la manipulación política, el poder nuclear y las fantasías de un Salvador omnipotente que cambie la balanza en el juego político siguen estando a la orden del día en nuestras noticias. Como lo dijo Patrick Harpur, “el mundo que vemos, es el mito en el que estamos” y Dune: Part Two nos confronta con una pregunta demoledora… ¿quién tiene realmente el poder?: ¿aquel que encarna el mito o aquellos que lo construyen? Lo mejor: el ritmo que mantiene de principio a fin. Sus lecturas alrededor del fanatismo religioso y la política. La dupla Villeneuve y Fraser, hacen de cada cuadro un espectáculo imponente. Las vueltas de tuerca del guion y el cierre “redondo” a diferencia de la anterior. Lo malo: tener que esperar 2 o 3 años para el capítulo final de la trilogía. Aunque la película se sostiene por sí misma, si no recuerdas mucho de la primera te puedes perder cosas importantes de la trama. Le hicieron a Anya Taylor-Joy lo mismo que Zendaya en la parte uno."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The conflict between destiny and rebellion, between religion and humanism, is the dark, unresolved heart of Dune: Part Two — the latest chapter in Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic space opera. Like the mighty sandworms that thunder across its desert vistas, the Canadian filmmaker's tale of feuding dynasties, rapacious colonialism and meddling witches is colossal in scope. If this studious, spectacular shot at Herbert's saga can't always reconcile its warring impulses — to dazzle and critique in equal measure — then it's all part of the package, if not the point. Picking up right where its stately predecessor left off, Part Two finds the spice-rich desert planet Arrakis in the grip of the invading Harkonnens, villainous warlords who wiped out their rivals, the noble House Atreides, in a power play orchestrated by the galactic Emperor (Christopher Walken). Abandoned on Arrakis in the wake of the massacre, Atreides' boy prince — and possible cosmic messiah — Paul (Chalamet) has been provided sanctuary by the planet's besieged natives, the Fremen, along with his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Haunted by visions of death, Paul is determined to reject his lineage and lead the indigenous people to a rebellion, to destroy the Harkonnen's spice mining operation and exact revenge for the death of his father. But Jessica — who belongs to the bloodline-tinkering witches known as the Bene Gesserit — is set on seeing her son fulfil his messianic destiny. Led by the loyal but naive Stilgar (Javier Bardem), many of the Fremen believe Paul to be their saviour — but others consider him a fraud, and the prophecy a lie. The Harkonnens, meanwhile, are intent on crushing the Fremen and flushing out their mysterious new champion. They dispatch the sadistic Feyd-Rautha (a wonderfully sneering Austin Butler) to menace Arrakis — and set the stage for all-out war. Much like the opening chapter, Dune: Part Two proves Villeneuve is in a class — or at least a budget — of his own when it comes to crafting super-scale images. Looming large over the desert, the Emperor's command ship might as well be the Las Vegas Sphere, with Walken rocking a 70s cult leader fit and Florence Pugh, as the imperial Princess Irulan, looking like she's on her way to Studio 54. (Walken's unmistakable syntax – ""How would. You deal. With. This prophet?"" the Emperor wonders at one point – gives the movie some much-needed, if unintentional, laughs.) Still, Villeneuve's images are often at their best when they're simple: a close-up of Chalamet's hand; the rising and falling of the metronomic ""thumper"" used to attract sandworms; or Paul and Chani's kiss atop a dune, the kind of star-crossed moment that all but screams out for a big power ballad. (Alas, save for a fleeting scene with a slinky Léa Seydoux, the movie's not big on the erotic, nor the strange. Unlike David Lynch's unfairly maligned version, the novel's psychic power continues to elude Villeneuve's drier sensibility.) In the movie's most exhilarating action sequence, we get a sense of the rush of Paul's first sandworm ride — like we're watching an extreme sports body-cam — and it's pretty cool. As impressive as all of that is — and it really is something — Dune: Part Two sometimes struggles to match its images with human drama. Nor does it manage to reconcile them with the thornier complexity of the novel. The conflict rouses Chalamet, who seems to relish the dark side. His battle with the Machiavellian eugenicists of the Bene Gesserit — led again by Charlotte Rampling's sinister Reverend Mother — provides some of the film's best moments. (That said, the decision to relegate Paul's telepathic sister, Alia — a cameoing Anya Taylor-Joy — to a flash-forward moment, tinkers with the novel in ways that deny the film of one its most delirious pay-offs.) Villeneuve is so committed to his stentorian craft, and his images so overpowering, that you wonder whether the film's ability to question its heroism isn't smothered by all the spectacle.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," My biggest objection to the Dune series continues to be that it takes itself far too seriously. Again, I get it—we’re dealing with serious stuff here: dying civilizations, ancient prophecies, struggles for power, the dark temptation of revenge. But just because something is set in a desert doesn’t mean it has to be this dry.
"
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE," It possesses sweep, scope and compelling characters, and under the guidance of director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Bladerunner: 2049” and the original), it becomes a cinematic experience in that it’s a technical marvel showcasing the best of film with an immersive experience that almost literally knocks the viewers' socks off. Imagine sitting dead center in the theater as a thopter, the helicopter-like ship that works on the planet Arrakis, flits about and feeling the percussive wind the ship generates while sitting and watching the film. The vessel’s thunder puts the audience right in the middle of the action, essentially transcending the screen. It’s the type of experience that makes movie geeks geek even harder and reminds viewers why there is no better place to see this type of film than in a theater. In that regard alone, the story of the rise of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) as the messiah of Arrakis and its Fremen people attains credibility as a classic experience. In that regard, Villeneuve brings that world and its tech to vivid and glorious life, transporting viewers. But there exist two sides to every equation, and in the case of “Dune,” one of the issues with Frank Herbert’s sci-fi literary epic has always been the density of the material. Adapting it in its prior incarnation, David Lynch's 1984 version, which has gained cult status in recent years, yielded a memorable but incomplete effort. The 2000 Sci Fi Channel's miniseries is best forgotten. For as memorable as Villeneuve’s effort is, even with the project ultimately encompassing three films (“Dune: Messiah” is apparently in development), there exists a feeling that in trying to do justice to the story of Atreides’ ascension to messianic status, he may very well be trying to do too much. There are moments of wondering how he made the jump from one plot point to the next, creating issues in the film’s final act. That in no way diminishes the fact that “Dune” is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of epic filmmaking. What it does is highlight an issue that films in many series do not face. With most series, where the narrative unfolds over the course of multiple films, it’s possible to jump right back in and understand what is happening. If ever there were an instance when viewing the predecessor will be helpful, it’s in the case of “Dune,” primarily because the material is so dense and Villeneuve packs it with detail. For the record, I viewed “Part Two” without having seen the original, and then I watched the original and viewed “Part Two” again, which proved helpful in appreciating the latter. It’s a journey that can’t be valued in its entirety without doing so. The difference in Chalamet’s Atreides is night and day. His evolution from naïve, doe-like young adult to intellectually and spiritually enlightened leader being called to his destiny proves subtle and compelling. He has to navigate a world of politics and religion while dealing with self-doubt, an aspect of the narrative that centers the story even as those around him offer their differing opinions. On the other, there is Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), his mother, who senses and wants to seize an opportunity. Sharing the belief is Stilgar, who is a true believer brought to vivid life with a brilliant turn by Oscar winner Javier Bardem."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The story: Following the events of Dune (2021), Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), having survived the attack by House Harkonnen, are now travelling with the Fremen, the natives of the desert planet Arrakis. The Harkonnens believe Paul and Jessica are dead. The signs that Paul is the one promised to free the Fremen from tyranny are growing, though Paul resists the idea, as his premonitions speak of widespread suffering should he take on the role. The two films are adapted from Frank Herbert’s 1965 science-fiction novel Dune.  By the end of the first Dune film, the elaborate world-building has boiled down to a simple revenge story: Paul has seen his family massacred and his bloodlust will spur the action of Part Two.  That said, there is one satisfyingly staged attack on a gargantuan Spice Harvester – the walking machines that extract the sought-after compound from the sand – that sums up the Villeneuve storytelling style.  The Harvester fight is split into small moments of tactical action, reflection and reaction, rather than the screen-filling pyrotechnic pandemonium found in other space fantasies.
 In a scene of gladiatorial combat, he glows with an otherworldly luminescence through the use of special lenses. The tasteful use of camera technology says more about Feyd’s creepiness than dialogue ever will, which is a blessing, given the film’s running time of almost three hours. In addition to Feyd, other new characters include Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh); Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a member of the matriarchal religious order of the Bene Gesserit; and the Emperor, Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken).  Hot take: The revenge story comes to a satisfying conclusion here, while leaving the door open for more in the saga of Paul Atreides and his journey to becoming the chosen one. "
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Movies! They’re on a roll! Or…wait, are they? On the one hand, you have a stacked and wonderfully varied Oscars field where the only thing to get mad at is whether the movie that has already made a billion dollars is getting sufficiently recognized. On the other hand, have there been any new movies since Christmas? I challenge you to name one 2024 release you’ve wanted to see. (I found a Scottish horror movie to love but I had to look hard.) It’s true that the first part of the year is always dire. But 2023’s strikes and box office malaise, combined with predictions of production slowdowns and Netflix’s big comeback, have made things seem especially shaky for old school Hollywood in 2024. But here comes Dune: Part Two to restore your faith in big-budget, big-screen moviegoing. A press tour to end all press tours—complete with Zendaya in vintage Mugler—got us to this point, and it’s been so hyped that it’s almost a surprise that the movie Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, and more have been so strenuously promoting is actually great. This is a sci-fi epic, mythic and self-serious, but somehow crisply paced and cool instead of ridiculous, extremely long but never boring, and packed with enough action set pieces and charismatic movie stars that you kind of can’t believe your luck. Oh right, and it’s a sequel. The first question I was asked by Vogue colleagues after I trotted out of my screening abuzz with praise was, Do I have to watch Dune: Part One?—itself a nearly three-hour commitment. I did see Dune: Part One back in 2021, and I still have vivid memories of the size and scale of it—and the fact that it was awfully slow—but the truth is, I couldn’t remember any of the plot machinations when Dune 2 got rolling. So I say skip the homework. Touch down on the desert planet of Arrakis cold. Because director Denis Villeneuve knows what he’s doing: The 1965 Frank Herbert novel on which this and Part One are based is famously dense—a knotty story of interstellar armies, giant worms, and a psychotropic mineral called spice, in which a young savior prince harnesses religious fervor and the perils of environmental collapse to propel him and a tribe of guerilla fighters to triumphant rule. I am not sure how Villeneuve, who cowrote the script and has already helmed a varied collection of excellent, absorbing genre films (from Sicario and Arrival to Blade Runner 2049), made this convoluted narrative so lucid. And yet the beats of Dune: Part Two, which span a romance between Zendaya (a desert soldier) and Chalamet (Paul Atreides, our prince-messiah-hero), a brother-versus-brother rivalry (Austin Butler vs. Dave Bautista!) set in the evil ranks of House Harkonnen, and… um… Charlotte Rampling as a fully veiled space witch subverting the schemes of a emperor played by Christopher Walken (!), never fair to cohere. Or, they cohere enough. I couldn’t pass a pop quiz on the finer details of the plot, but no matter, this movie is super fun. Just when you might ask yourself if Chalamet is shouting a bit too much, along comes Javier Bardem or Josh Brolin or Rebecca Ferguson—all have key supporting roles here—to lend the proceedings actorly gravitas. Did I already mention that Florence Pugh is in this movie? And Léa Seydoux? And Anya Taylor-Joy? Have I written enough about the giant worms? Chalamet rides one the size of a skyscraper, combining the athletic stylings of kite surfing and waterskiing, and charges into an obliterating sand storm and the volume is thunderous and the CGI looks great and you’re on the edge of your seat.

"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,Visually splendid but a jumbled storytelling mess&#46; Timoth&#233;e Chalamet seems more like a sullen boy band expat than a galactic messiah&#46; Zendaya is given little to do but glare resentfully for the last 90 minutes&#46; 
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL," Until recently, one felt safe in identifying Adam Sandler as the gurning star of countless idiotic comedies (Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, The Wedding Singer, etc, etc). Some people seemed to like his foghorn approach to humour but to us, this was a baffling mystery. ​Far from it, in fact. His portrayal of a tragic New York jeweller in Uncut Gems was widely praised and even led to talk of Oscar nominations. These did not materialise, but he was equally convincing as an NBA coach in the 2022 drama Hustle, so we are now obliged to treat Mr Sandler as a serious actor, a proper thespian. He certainly has the frowny face on in Spaceman, playing a chap in the same predicament as David Bowie’s Major Tom. Jakub Prochazka is a Czech-American astronaut who’s been launched into deep space on a vague but potentially important mission — to investigate a dense cloud of primordial dust that is turning a portion of the night sky purple. It’s located midway between earth and venus, and Jakub has rattled forth in a rickety craft that resembles the one in Tarkovsky’s Solaris. Six months later, he has arrived in the vicinity of the cloud but is not in the best of shape. Though he dutifully consumes vacuum-packed stodge, jogs on a running machine to stop his from muscles wasting and chats cheerfully to mission control and his icy boss Commissioner Tuma (Isabella Rossellini), Jakub is faking it. In his downtime, he guzzles booze (who thought it was a good idea to stow vodka on a spaceship?) and obsesses about his wife Lenka (Carey Mulligan), who is pregnant and, Jakub suspects, on the point of leaving him. He’s right. Jakub’s work has made him more and more unknowable, and remote. “He can’t see me down here, I’m a dot,” she says, and she’s pretty much had enough. But when she sends a video message to that effect, Commissioner Tuma decides to suppress it. A grieving astronaut with access to industrial amounts of alcohol might not be best placed to lead this tricky mission which, if successful, will be a large feather in the Czech Republic’s cap. Jakub, meanwhile, has started to see things. Namely, a 10-foot hairy black arachnid that speaks softly (courtesy of Paul Dano) and dispenses the kind of advice a fortune cookie would be proud of. To Jakub’s horror, this imaginary friend begins poking around in the astronaut’s memories, inspecting the early stages of his relationship with Lenka and pondering the institution of marriage. “Why commit to something,” the spider wonders, “that can so easily be broken.” Indeed. “You long for your mate only when she leaves,” he asks “Why? Where was this yearning when you were together?” Compelling questions all, but the creature ultimately decides that Jakub’s loneliness is entirely self-inflicted. “I will leave you to your mission,” it says, having decided that Jakub is essentially a solipsist, “my interest in you has expired.” But Jakub has come to a disturbing conclusion — this spider might be real. It claims to be the last survivor of an alien species, and has much to say on the nature of loneliness. It tells Jakub the purple cloud is residue from the Big Bang, and refers to it with awe as, ‘The beginning’. As he seems relentlessly kind, the spider grows on Jakub, who christens him Hanus and starts feeding him. He’s particularly keen on “the spread made of hazelnut”, but has six eyes which stare in different directions, so you’re never sure which one you should be looking at. Hanus says serious things but looks like a muppet: this is not helpful. “There was so much love — where did it go?” Waka waka! It’s a central flaw in this adaptation, based on a novel by Jaroslav Kalfar. The film has interesting concepts but it has no sense of urgency, and a po-faced gravitas even Mr Sandler cannot penetrate. The marvellous Carey Mulligan is entirely squandered in a minor role – talk about bringing a bazooka to a pillow fight. ​I was much taken with Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, a soaring space epic charting the adventures of Paul Atreides (a windswept Timothee Chalamet), heir to a now-decimated warrior kingdom, who ends up stranded on the baking desert planet of Arrakis. Possessed of magic powers inherited from his witchy mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul is taken in by the Fremen, a hardy tribe of desert fighters, some of whom reckon he might well be their long-awaited messiah. Arrakis is much fought over because of its prime resource — ‘spice’: a drug-like substance that enables space travel and prolongs life. As a result, the Fremen have long been oppressed by the Empire. In Dune: Part Two, Paul leads a growing rebellion aided by the schemes of his mother, who has become a kind of blessed virgin, as a crucial battle looms. It all looks very nice, though deserts have a wearisome colour palate, and Mr Villeneuve fairly flogged the giant worms to death in the first one. It’s all a bit up itself, though Javier Bardem provides sly Life of Brian-style humour as the messiah’s biggest fan. There will, I fear, be more of all this. A nostalgic comedy inspired by 1980s films like Teen Witch and Weird Science, Diablo Cody’s Lisa Frankenstein has more in common with the writer’s much-maligned 2009 horror Jennifer’s Body. Lisa (Kathryn Newton) is a lonely teenager who’s just shifted town and school after her mother was killed by an axe murderer. Her bovine father (Joe Chrest) has quickly remarried and seems not to notice that his new bride, Janet (Carla Gugino) is a harpy of the first order, who cruelly denigrates Lisa at the expense of her own daughter, Taffy (Liza Soberano), a mentally negligible cheerleader. Lisa is gloomy (who can blame her), and spends most of her free time mooning about at an abandoned cemetery. There, by accident, she summons a monster (Cole Sprouse), a mute Victorian man with a missing hand and soulful eyes. His presence releases the inner Madonna in Lisa, who begins dressing shabby chic and hunting down the various body parts her creature lacks. I know it’s a comedy but this film has no inner logic: Lisa is deeply dislikeable, her creature is no Heathcliff, and I ended up rooting for the cheerleader."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Duna: parte dos (Dune: Part Two, Estados Unidos/2023). Dirección: Denis Villeneuve. Guion: Denis Villeneuve y Jon Spaihts, basada en la novela de Frank Herbert. Fotografía: Greig Fraser. Edición: Joe Walker. Música: Hans Zimmer. Elenco: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux y Anya Taylor-Joy. Duración: 166 minutos. Calificación: apta para mayores de 13 años. Nuestra opinión: muy buena. Duna: parte 2 no es exactamente una secuela en el sentido habitual de una historia perpetrada ad hoc que continúa o expande otra ya concluida, sino el final del relato que había quedado inconcluso en la parte uno: retoma la adaptación de la extensa novela de Frank Herbert -704 páginas en su edición en castellano- exactamente donde había sido interrumpida. ¿Qué hay que saber o recordar de la primera entrega? La Casa Atreides, una casta de nobles benévolos, llega al planeta desértico Arrakis con el fin de tomar el poder bajo el comando del duque Leto. Arrakis había sido sometido a una despiadada explotación colonial durante 80 años por la brutal dinastía Harkonnen para obtener la especia Melange, un psicotrópico que expande la conciencia y es la mercancía más valiosa del universo. La retirada de los Harkonnen no es un gesto magnánimo sino una trampa para eliminar a los Atreides, cuya creciente influencia es percibida como una amenaza. Intuyendo una traición, Leto busca una alianza con los Fremen, el misterioso pueblo del desierto que conoce los secretos del planeta, pero antes de que pueda concretarla es sorpresivamente atacado por los Harkonnen. Los Atreides son exterminados, con la excepción de Paul (Timothée Chalamet), el hijo del duque, que logra huir al desierto en compañía de su madre. Los Fremen creen en una profecía que anticipa la llegada del Lisan Al-Gaib, un mesías que declarará la guerra santa y liberará al pueblo de sus opresores. La primera parte concluye con la incorporación de Paul a una tribu Fremen. Duna: parte 2 narra su camino hasta convertirse en el líder anunciado por la profecía. Herbert escribió la novela en los antiautoritarios años 60. Su historia sobre el surgimiento de un líder religioso nos dice que hay que terminar con los líderes religiosos, que todos los mesías son falsos y que del encuentro de fe ciega y política surge el totalitarismo. Por eso tiene un héroe complicado: Paul combate al mal en estado puro, el fascismo encarnado por los Harkonnen, pero lo hace al frente de un ejército de fundamentalistas –cuya cultura está inspirada en la musulmana– sobre los que ejerce un mando mesiánico. Su principal batalla es contra la tentación del poder absoluto, de la que no sale victorioso y por eso es un personaje fracturado. En la película, estas contradicciones se potencian porque, a diferencia de Herbert, vivimos en la era del choque de civilizaciones, entre el Occidente democrático y el Medio Oriente teocrático. Si hubiera que decidir a cuál de los dos representa mejor el protagonista de Duna: parte 2, a pesar de sus dudas y su liderazgo renuente, habría que decir que al segundo. Es un logro del film haber preservado los rasgos de este antihéroe complejo que, en lugar de una admonición contra la tiranía, pueden ser apresuradamente tomados como una justificación del fundamentalismo islámico. Si bien esta segunda parte se muestra más dinámica que su predecesora o, al menos, está más densamente poblada de batallas y peleas a muerte, no constituye un despegue demasiado radical de lo que ya habíamos visto: comparte muchos de los méritos y desperfectos de la anterior. Estos últimos pueden resumirse en una grandilocuencia operística que quiere convalidar la dimensión épica de la historia pero que también puede sentirse pomposa e impostada. Reiteradamente, la narración se vuelve demasiado pausada para una película de acción y aventuras. Al mismo tiempo, a pesar de los 166 minutos de duración, hay transiciones demasiado bruscas o elipsis que provocan saltos narrativos desconcertantes. Además de un elenco descomunal, su mayor virtud es también el atributo más notable de la filmografía de Denis Villeneuve desde que, tras múltiples dramas y policiales, se reinventó como un realizador de ciencia ficción: no hay nadie mejor para conjurar el exotismo y singularidad de una cultura desconocida. Junto al diseñador de producción Patrice Vermette (quien ganó un Oscar por la primera parte), inventa mundos alienígenas genuinamente extraños, que sobrepasan las ideas o descripciones de sus fuentes. Por ejemplo, el planeta Giedi Prime, hogar de los sádicos Harkonnen, en la novela es un paisaje industrial contaminado. Villeneuve lo muestra como una combinación siniestra de arquitectura brutalista e imaginería nazi tomada directamente de El triunfo de la voluntad, con maquinarias que parecen insectos gigantes y alumbrado por una estrella negra, cuya luz hace que los colores se desvanezcan en el punto medio entre un monocromo y un negativo. La imaginación visual de la puesta en escena hace de Duna: parte 2 un espectáculo deslumbrante, de una escala que se está perdiendo en la era de streaming y que impone verla en la pantalla grande. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Robert Horton is a Scarecrow board member and a longtime film critic. This series of ""critic's notes"" is chance to highlight worthy films playing locally and connect them to the riches of Scarecrow's collection. How do you get off a sandworm? It is all very well to show a person ""steering"" a giant sandworm and riding it daredevil-style through the deserts of Arrakis. The act of worm-riding is a bravura gesture in a couple of big sequences in Dune: Part Two, where they operate like much of the rest of this adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel: They conjure thrilling visual spectacle, even if one is not entirely sure how everything on screen actually works, or why. (I don't remember if getting off a sandworm was explained in Dune: Part One, but I just Googled it and the Frank Herbert books give an explanation of how a sandworm ride ends—still, it was something I worried about. And since I wrote this, somebody put the question to Denis Villeneuve, who was coy about it.) 	The first part of Villeneuve's sci-fi opus set the table without generating a lot of excitement on its own: a movie clearly made by intelligent people, but demanding a great deal of patience. Part Two is not merely an improvement but almost a different film. Villeneuve's imagination is unleashed here in a way that frequently thrills, even if the actual storytelling is sometimes dutiful; it's more Jodorowsky than Lucas. From the opening moments—a tense sequence in which Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his Fremen pals are pinned down on the slanting orange sands—Villeneuve finds new ways of seeing a potentially monotonous landscape. Villeneuve's eye is especially tuned to finding the epic quality in every scene, the precise way that a person might take the high ground as a vast backdrop stretches behind him. And that epic quality need not rely on hugeness; it can be a glance across a crowd of people. Rebecca Ferguson (as Paul's canny, mysterious mother) has a sustained camera stare-down that is the best such thing since Stanley Kubrick died. 	Villeneuve is a sober filmmaker, which is probably one reason I have somewhat resisted his undeniable talent. There are some funny moments in Part Two, notably the Monty Pythonesque business of how each time Paul denies being a Messiah, it only further convinces Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) of the kid's divinity. Villeneuve's heart and mind are in the right place, and Part Two conveys a sure sense for the dangers of hero-worship and of ends justifying means. The visual language of Chalamet's gawky leader, dwarfed by the landscape and somehow cribbed in his body, like a Richard III in the making, is great shorthand for how the movie distances itself from our nominal hero. Most of the film's moral weight is loaded onto the narrow shoulders of Paul's companion Chani (Zendaya), a character not quite filled out enough to seal the deal. 	The genuine epic quality is also baked into the rhythm of this beguilingly paced 176-minute movie; the action feels unhurried at least until the final half-hour, which does get a little rushed while cramming the climaxes. This includes the confidence with which Part Two heaves its narrative over onto a parallel track for a looong passage involving the grotesque villain Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his hairless, psychotic nephew (Austin Butler, unveiling an amusing Stellan Skarsgård impersonation). This section eventually leads us back to Arrakis, where things will be wrapped up—and yet not wrapped up, as loose ends and new faces point us to an inevitable next chapter. 	Does it really all work? Probably not. But at least Part Two serves up cinema in its basic elements—not so much storytelling as delirious mood-making. This film would not be out of place as a head-trip picture from 1971, and that is a compliment."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE," Rejoice. The winter of our discontent with such movies as “Argylle” and “Madame Web” is made glorious by the sun of “Dune: Part Two.” Denis Villeneuve’s follow-up to his somewhat less satisfying “Dune: Part One” (2021) is spectacle of the highest order, even if the source is a somewhat silly, if also classic 1965 science-fiction novel by Frank Herbert. Like its predecessor, also shot by Oscar winner Greig Fraser, you not only see the immensity of “Dune: Part Two,” you also want to wear it for Halloween. Plus, there are giant worms that you can ride. Timothee Chalamet, who is still on screens as a bland Willy Wonka, is better this time, although he and Austin Butler of “Elvis,” playing Harkonnen “psychopath” Feyd-Rautha (in a bald cap in a role played by Sting in David Lynch’s 1984 version) are upstaged by their elders: Javier Bardem as devout Fremen lead fighter Stilgar, and Stellan Skarsgard as the vile Jabba the Hutt-like Baron Harkonnen. The 1965 novel and the films derived from it are basically “Lawrence of Arabia” transported to Outer Space. Paul Atreides, (Chalamet) a pale-faced royal from the House of Atreides of the watery planet Caladan, is also the “Chosen One” of the tribal people the Fremen of desert planet Arrakis. Also in the mix are the mysterious women of the witch-like sect the Bene Gesserit, including Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who carries Paul’s unborn sister and has conversations with her. The Fremen fight against the outsiders over a thing called spice, a drug that the Empire needs for space travel. “Dune” is not so much science-fiction as it is space opera crossed with Shakespeare’s history plays with their plotting, skullduggery, titles, blood lust, costumes and wigs. “Dune” also shares a lot of tropes with that other space opera “Star Wars,” something made laughable when Dave Bautista’s – ahem – Beast Rabban goes all Darth Vader on an underling. But the chief “Star Wars” connection is between Paul Atreides aka Muad’Dib and Luke Skywalker. They are both high-born heroes in hiding, who become the leaders of outgunned rebel forces. Luke has “the Force;” Paul has “the Voice” which sounds like a nun I once had in grade school. The idea that Paul is a “white savior” to the swarthy Fremen is addressed again in “Dune: Part Two.” Even his love interest, the Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) needs convincing that he is the One. Charlotte Rampling is happily back as scheming Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam. The Fremen dress in “stillsuits.” Women’s costumes sometimes suggest both bondage attire and burqas. Preening Feyd has the damnable habit of stabbing ladies-in-waiting. Battle scenes are a high point. But “Lord of the Rings” auteur Peter Jackson achieves a more mythic effect with his nightmarish parade of orcs, oliphants and trolls. CGI is rampant in “Dune 2.” Florence Pugh looks perfectly natural in her outlandish costumes as Princess Irulan. Christopher Walken brings a “King of New York” swagger to the Emperor. Josh Brolin is back as Paul’s beloved instructor Gurney Halleck. Herbert has a weird way with names. I believe Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer has added a fire engine to the horn section. Super-charismatic Bardem steals every scene he’s in. Kwisatz Haderach? Gesundheit. Ride this worm. “Dune Messiah” is next."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," There’s a simple reason why one of the most popular science fiction books in the history of popular literature has struggled to find a worthy film adaptation. It’s not exactly accurate to say that Dune is unfilmable, but the book and its sequel are exceedingly heady philosophical exercises that don’t play well to adaptation. Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune took an admirable stab at the novel’s first half, often succumbing to the unwieldy weight of exposition and the sheer scope of the cast. The back half of Dune is a bit more of an intimate affair. With Leto (Oscar Isaac) dead, the exiled Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) find a new home among the Fremen, who dedicate their lives to disrupting the spice production now returned to House Harkonnen after they usurped House Atreides. One of the Fremen leaders Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul is their messiah, quickly inserting Lady Jessica into the mechanics of their political world as the new Reverend Mother. Dune is a very dense text. Villeneuve does an excellent job breaking the material down for casual audiences, even if much of the nuances of groups like the Bene Gesserit is lost in the pacing. The women of the film, particularly Lady Jessica and Chiani (Zendaya) provide most of the emotional backbone of the narrative, often exposing the flaws of the White Savior trope in the process. Herbert’s writing spent a lot of time focusing on prophecy that a film doesn’t really have time to explore. The book has the luxury of presenting Paul’s ascendency over hundreds of pages as a matter of fate. The abridged runtime makes for a far more awkward presentation of a young teenager as the messiah of this rich world. Villeneuve shows off his confidence with a relaxed sense of pacing, leaning heavily on the exceptional cinematography to carry the narrative instead of Herbert’s densely packed plotting. Part Two cuts a lot of stuff out, often to the point of making you wonder why the first film spent so much time on unnecessary exposition. There is something beautiful about the way Villeneuve focuses on the beauty of Arrakis instead of trying to cover as much material as possible. The film does buckle under its obligations to function more like a blockbuster film than an exercise in philosophy. The limits of its 165-minute runtime are quite exposed when the narrative leaves Arrakis for a bit to focus on the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and House Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha is a flimsy, underdeveloped villain, a shame given Austin Butler’s obvious enthusiasm in the role. Stellan Skarsgård does an admirable job as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, making the most of a limited runtime, but there’s an obligatory sense to the villainy that the film never quite shakes. The action sequences are a bit of a mixed bag, much like the first film. The individual fight choreography is quite good, but the broader battles leave a lot to be desired. The cinematography of the actual fighting pales in comparison to the simpler frames showcasing the planet. The sandworms themselves aren’t given the same beautiful care and attention as they received in the first film. Many popular science-fiction films have riffed off Dune’s basic premise over the years. Paul suffers from the weight of so many who came before him. Villeneuve never truly sells his lead as this necessary messiah figure, a reality exacerbated by the excessive amount of parental figures he has in the film, including Lady Jessica, Stilgar, and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin).  All three work hard to sell Paul as a figure of destiny, but Chalamet is rarely given much space to run with the ball. Zendaya is a much more satisfying emotional care of the film, an awkward reality that the source material can’t really compensate for. Villeneuve spends so much time capturing the feel of Arrakis that he sometimes forgets that the audience needs to feel something toward Paul, perhaps the weakest character among the principal cast. It’s not necessarily Villeneuve’s fault that audiences are bound to be familiar with the Luke Skywalker’s and the Neo’s of the world who owe so much to Herbert’s work, but the headiness of Paul’s character is quite lost in the shuffle. One has to wonder if some of the time spent on characters who only appeared in the first movie might have been better allocated to the newcomers in Part Two whose introductions feel quite rushed. Dune probably needed three movies to get everything right. As it stands, Part Two is a very good film. Casual moviegoers may find themselves checked out at times, especially when Florence Pugh’s Irulan swoops in for what’s essentially an important extended cameo, but Villeneuve delivered a worthy adaptation of Herbert’s work. Some of the material’s inherent flaws are products of its time, as well as Hollywood’s reluctance to invest in newer work. Paul’s weaknesses as a messiah somewhat reflect the reality that our society has moved beyond some of the confines of Herbert’s sandbox. Villeneuve has crafted a beautiful film that will likely go down as the definitive take on the franchise, while also exposing many of the flaws that demonstrate why it took so long to get made in the first place. Thanks for the usual erudite and well-written ITM review.  My reaction was that Part II virtually had to be better than Part I, which I’ve tried to watch a number of times over the years, usually in bits out of ennui, but I thought it was ponderous, slow moving and mediocre story-telling. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," All the best movies take you on a journey through an intriguing world full of sights and sounds unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. Even if you’ve read the books that inspired them, these films add compelling layers and dimensions to their stories. You leave the theater feeling deeper, stronger, moved, perhaps even fulfilled, knowing that you have just seen a special film. It’s good to know right up front that even if you’ve forgotten a lot about its predecessor, (2021’s Dune), and even if you can’t remember a lot about the books that intrigued you when you were younger, you’ll still be able to enjoy this spectacular sequel. But a little brush up on where we left off will add to your enjoyment. Frank Herbert’s Dune series is basically an epic focusing on powerful “families” warring for control, not unlike Isaac Asimov’s Foundation, or George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones. But these battles are based on the desert planet called Arakis, or Dune, where gigantic land worms dwell, making it the only source of “Spice,” the most valuable commodity in this universe. The family that controls Spice has ultimate financial and political power. In the second installment, we find a number of factions, vying for control of Dune and the Spice it produces. There’s the brutal and vicious House Harkonnen, led by the repulsive Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), and defended by Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler, as you’ve never seen him before). Also on Dune is the family and entourage of Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), and his regal daughter Princess Irrulan Corrino (Florence Pugh). They have theoretically come to Dune to oversee the transfer of Spice production to House Atreides, but the House Harkonnen has quite different opinions about that. The House Atreides was lead by Duke (Oscar Isaac) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who had a very promising heir, Paul (the riveting Timothée Chalamet).  But the Harkonnens killed Duke in the first film, sending Paul and Lady Jessica, who has powers of her own, fleeing into the desert. While there, Paul’s Spice induced visions seemed to be leading him toward the resolution of the Spice conflict, which would involve leading the Fremen, the native people of Dune, to retake control of their own planet. As Dune: Part 2 opens, we see Paul and Lady Jessica cautiously negotiating their way among the Fremen and becoming particularly close to a leader known as Stilgar (Javier Bardem), and a fierce warrior named Chani (Zendaya). Paul will make decisions that will ultimately effects on all their lives. Now that you have the setup, you can sit back and be dazzled by the world that writer/director Denis Villeneuve has so thrillingly created.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," This world is beyond cruelty. How do we rise above?  Do we stay complacent or embrace the capacity to adapt, change, grow and even settle for what may possibly be next on the horizon. Set thousands of years in the future and picking up where “Dune” left off,“Dune: Part Two” again follows the mythic journey of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a young man propelled by fate into an intergalactic power struggle. The son of the murdered ruler Duke Leto Atreides and mystical Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul was given the ultimate test in “Dune”: to conquer his fears when fate—and powerful unseen forces—pull him into the sands of the remote planet Arrakis. Exploring themes  from romantic and and maternal love to globalism,loyalty, revenge and catharsis, this visual cinematic feast furthers author Frank Herbert’s ecological ideology in this tale about humanity versus nature. At the core is a timeless conflict between the forces of good and evil. On one side are the Fremen, a representation of humanity fighting for the collective survival of the native people and of planet Arrakis. On the other side lie the Harkonnen, a manifestation of corruption, violence and greed. Where they meet is the conflicted story of Paul Atreides, leaning into Chani’s (Zendaya) fierceness and Stilgar’s wisdom to gain the trust and support of the Fremen people, while the Harkonnens continue to ravage the sands of Arrakis for spice—though their efforts do not go unopposed,
further enraging them and leading to an all-out war. Sounds alot like our current political climate doesn’t it? With insane imagery, the plot takes a second to kick in, but once it does the film goes full throttle action and adventure complete with sandworm rides, crawling ants action sequences that will leave audiences on the edge. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya reprise their roles with a charisma and attentiveness to detail reminiscent of old Hollywood stars.  Their onscreen presence and chemistry are undeniable and a pleasure to behold.  Witnessing Chani experience heartbreak in it purest form will surely invigorate the young at heart with raw emotion.  Yet, it is an unrecognizable Austin Butler that will have tongues wagging.  Just as he did with “Elvis, ” Austin takes total command of everyone and every scene he inhabits with an unbridled bravado worthy of the villain he becomes.  A duel to the finish with Chalamet is a highlight, proving these actors are armed with the physicality and emotional skills to endure such a grueling scene on every visceral level. Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica is quite stellar, brilliant artist, whose many colors and moods enhance the plot with a bold creativity only enhanced by Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan.  Pugh is steely, calm and strong beyond her years.  Qualities that are on full display between her and Zendaya as they share one intense glance within the only scene they share onscreen.  It says so little while saying everything. Ultimately, Dune:  Part Two will leave audiences with the question of wondering what one would do once you see their past or their future? What allows us as humans to embrace the capacity to adapt and navigate from one day to the next is the capacity to endure all knowing that fear is all we have."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Few theatrical experiences&#44; this year or any&#44; will be more dazzling&#46;
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," After a three-year wait, the sci-fi cinematic event from Denis Villeneuve is here! I’m a huge fan of Part One, which was my #1 film of 2021, so I couldn’t wait for Part Two. Because this is a continuation of the first, not a sequel per se, I knew I could safely expect the same kind of epic filmmaking and immersive theatrical experience as Part One, and thankfully, Villeneuve + Co. did NOT disappoint. While Star Wars was the defining space opera fantasy of the 70s-80s, Dune is easily the sci-fi epic of this generation. The French-Canadian visionary filmmaker is an unabashed fan of Frank Herbert’s dense novel, and he’s been quoted as saying that ‘the first audience member I wanted to please was myself’ His passion and extensive knowledge of the book pays off in a big way as he clearly pours everything into the project he’d surely be remembered for in his illustrious career. As I sat down in the IMAX theater earlier this week, I was giddy with anticipation, for once I’m actually glad Part Two is 2h 46m long, which went by really fast. I commended Villeneuve for how well-paced the first film was, and that’s the same with Part Two. The movie is immediately immersive as it opens with Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan voice-journaling that Paul Atreides might still be alive. Meanwhile, her Emperor father (Christopher Walken) is in a somber mood over the destruction of the House of Atreides. The movie then picks up where the first one left off in the desert planet Arrakis where Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) with the Fremen, including Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya). The sense of tension is palpable as Paul is hellbent on revenge on the House of Harkonnen for killing his beloved father, while there’s something quite sinister as Paul is touted as the messiah by the Fremen zealots such as Stilgar. As an unbeliever, Paul himself knows he’s NOT the savior that’s been [falsely] prophesied, but he’s willing to let himself be seen as one if it serves his purpose. Given the political climate we’re in today, that storyline is eerily familiar. I prepared myself by watching a few recap videos of the first film as I didn’t get a chance to rewatch it before the promo screening. Shout out to Quinn’s Ideas YT channel, I find his deep-dive videos helpful as I haven’t read the book. The fact that I’m already familiar with the overarching story makes the second part much easier to follow. One key thing I gleaned from those videos is that Herbert’s DUNE novel isn’t so much about a hero’s journey, but a cautionary tale against charismatic leaders and messianic figures. The theme of hero worship and what it could mean to society is very much ingrained in the film. We see Paul’s transformation from a principled, reluctant leader to a ruthless, power-driven man consumed with ambition and power, even if his initial motive was to save others. Bardem’s Stilgar becomes sort of a tragic character with his blind faith in Paul… the line ‘I don’t care what you believe, I BELIEVE!’ gives me chills, given that the messianic prophecies are planted by the secretive matriarchal order the Bene Gesserit. I have to say though, even amid all the heightened exchanges, Bardem becomes quite the comic relief I never expected. Josh Brolin‘s Gurney’s brashness is quite funny as well, and the humorous moments are a welcome respite as the whole movie is mostly solemn and ominous. Meanwhile, Chani remains skeptical of Paul, even as their romance blossom. I find the interaction between the two even more compelling here as the stakes are so high, especially for the Fremen people. As for the Bene Gesserit, which some rightly call witches, it’s been established in the first film just how powerful they truly are. Somehow that notion didn’t quite sink in until part two, for me anyway. Let’s just say that Léa Seydoux’s Lady Margot conversation with Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother following Margot’s encounter with Austen Butler‘s Feyd-Rautha drives that point so clearly that while the powerful houses in the DUNE universe are led by men, it’s the Bene Gesserit women who have the ultimate control. The colossal scale of this film deserves a staggering top-notch cast that ought to be a shoo-in for SAG’s Best Ensemble in a Motion Picture award. If I ever had any doubt about Chalamet’s casting as Paul, he squashes it here as he really comes into his own as a conflicted anti-hero. All the returning cast are fantastic, but out of those actors, the clear MVPs are Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson. Chani’s journey is especially moving, as she clearly loves Paul but remains steadfastly defiant against all the manipulative machinations at the expense of her own people. Ferguson’s Lady Jessica is truly put in the wringer in this one, her physical performance takes my breath away, especially in the blue-liquid drinking scene. I’ve been a fan of the Swedish-born actress since seeing her in The White Queen miniseries, I hope to see her in more leading roles as she’s terrific in everything she’s in. Out of the newbies, Butler proves that he’s no one-hit-wonder as he filmed Part Two right after Elvis. He’s got such a commanding presence as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha and he’s believably scary with a shaved head and brows. Feyd’s fight scene with imprisoned Atreides’ soldier (Roger Yuan) is reminiscent of Ridley Scott’s Gladiator. It gives us a taste of the pivotal mano-a-mano knife fight between Feyd and Paul that’s exciting to watch. On a technical level, DUNE simply can’t be beat. The experience of watching this is so visceral you can practically feel the desert heat on your skin and the sand in your hair. Costing a reported $190 million, it’s even more expensive than the first one ($165 mil) and you can see why. Phenomenal production designer Patrice Vermette already won an Oscar for Part One, but I think he deserves another nomination for Part Two. Same with cinematographer Greig Fraser and composer Hans Zimmer, both of whom have won Oscars for Part One but they could very well be nominated again for their astounding work here. I love Zimmer’s mythical-sounding score which suits the desert terrain perfectly. I enjoy hearing the fictional language called Chakobsa, developed by Villeneuve and linguist David J. Peterson who also developed the Dothraki language used in Game of Thrones. Ferguson’s way of speaking Chakobsa is most impressive but most of the actors sound quite fluent after weeks of training. Villeneuve promised a more action-packed second part and he made good on that front, as there are definitely more fight scenes, shoot-outs, aerial attacks, explosions, etc. to satisfy action fans. I mentioned in my Part One review how much I adore the Ornithopter, those four-winged, dragonfly-like chopper, I still enjoy watching those aerial scenes as the Ornitopher is constantly used by the Harkonnen’s army. One of the most memorable moments for me has got to be Paul’s sandworm-riding moment, it’s a glorious rite of passage to belong to the Fremen that’s so incredibly well-staged. It reminds me a bit of the iconic chariot scene in William Wyler’s 1959 Ben-Hur. I’m glad that Villeneuve takes his time in making DUNE, allowing him and the crew to really immerse themselves in the story. It’s truly a masterclass in worldbuilding, every single detail is meticulously crafted to submerse us in its mythology. Villeneuve doubles down on illustrating Arrakis’ liquid scarcity—Stilgar practically drinks Lady Jessica’s tears, and Fremens insert siphon tubes on a dead body to ensure not a drop of precious fluid is wasted. The only other franchise with such painstaking attention to detail is Peter Jackson’s original trilogy of the Lord of The Rings. I know it’s often a cliché to use the word epic or vast to describe a movie, but it’s no hyperbole for DUNE. I’m amazed just how tight the script is, written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, as hardly any moment in the nearly 3-hour running time is wasted. I’m glad I got to see this in IMAX, the way it’s intended, and I find it even more glorious and mesmerizing than Part One. As with any well-written sci-fi, it’s an escapist entertainment in which the theme still resonates with what’s happening in the world today. That’s how I feel about DUNE and it’s Villeneuve’s pièce de résistance, his magnum opus he’ll be remembered for decades to come. I’m really hoping there’ll be DUNE 3 coming in the next few years! I was going to see this on Dolby Atmos this coming Saturday but I’m not well enough to attend as I’m sick with the flu.  Fandango refuses to refund my ticket. I’m a fan of the first film too, it was my fave movie released that year. Yet somehow Villeneuve managed to surpass it with part two! Hope you get to see it soon! I’ve never been to the Middle East (aside from a brief transit in Dubai) so it’s good to hear of the authentic depiction of the region. Glad you enjoyed this one, amazing that Villeneuve managed to top the first film. Thanks for the feedback! Yes, it was an incredible film for sure. I was amazed with how Villeneuve was able to top the first film. “Incendies” is definitely worth watching. It’s an important film that put Villeneuve on the map as a filmmaker with immense talent. Just saw it at Dolby Cinema a couple of hours ago and I’ll probably see it again later this week. Lol! It’s quite an achievement for Villeneuve and the crew. My only minor complaint is that big battle at the climax was edited down too quick. I wanted to see bigger action scenes but Villeneuve decided to cut most of the action out and jump to the indoors scene. But the mano-a-mano between Paul and Feyd-Rautha was well shot and I’m glad it was a bit longer than the climax fight scene in part 1. Now, I really wish we still have the IMAX theater at the zoo. This film would’ve been amazing to see on that 7 stories screen. Yeah, I’m still bummed the IMAX at the zoo closed! Ahah I actually think there’s plenty of action already here, Ted, and all of them were amazingly-shot. I thought Butler was great as Feyd-Rautha too, he’s definitely got that leading man charisma. Yeah, there’s definitely more action in this one than the first film but I wanted to see more battles during the climax. You can tell some scenes were cut out when you see Paul’s outfit is covered with blood when he came inside the dome thing to confront the Emperor. Maybe they’ll include those cut scenes in the 4K disc. I’m still not sold on Butler as a leading man, even though he’s great here as the villain. But I started watching Masters of the Air and he’s not as commanding as the lead as I thought. Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," La novela original de Frank Herbert no es fácil de leer. Y no por su prosa, sino por ese rosario de nombres, idiomas, planetas, lugares, cargos, dinastías y relaciones entre personajes. La película original de Denis Villeneuve, correspondiente a la primera mitad del libro, tampoco era fácil de ver, con sus 155 minutos de gravedad, su aplastante solemnidad, sus tonos marrones y grisáceos, y su total ausencia de efervescencia y de sentido de la frescura. Sin embargo, el volumen de Herbert, completado después con cinco novelas más, ha ido aglutinando a una legión de fanáticos de varias generaciones alrededor de su universo, y la adaptación del director canadiense, sobreponiéndose al fracaso de Alejandro Jodorowsky en su formación y a la fallida traslación de David Lynch de 1984, se convirtió en un éxito de público (400 millones de euros en todo el mundo), de crítica y de premios (diez nominaciones a los Oscar y seis galardones). Ambos triunfos con moderado merecimiento. De modo que, después de la prudencia inicial en la producción (solo se haría la segunda entrega si se daba bien la primera), llega Dune: parte dos, con semejante sabor cinematográfico y casi exacto tono de suntuosidad. La ciencia ficción adulta es (casi) siempre así. Pompa y circunstancia. Y aquí hay mucho de ambas en sus quizá injustificables dos horas y tres cuartos de duración, sostenidas por la capacidad visual del autor de las magníficas Sicario, Prisoners y Enemy, por el excelente reparto, carisma en todas sus esquinas, y por los matices políticos y religiosos de un relato en el que solo algún guiño interpretativo de Javier Bardem añade unas gotas de sentido del humor. Sus naves espaciales rotundas como catedrales, el golpeo desgarrado de las cuerdas y la percusión de la banda sonora de Hans Zimmer (en el pase de prensa en la pequeña sala de Warner temblaban las butacas, literalmente) y el peso de sus intrigas palaciegas no dejan apenas lugar para el bostezo. A la contra, como también le ocurría a La llegada y a Blade Runner 2049, pese al esfuerzo técnico y artístico, Villeneuve sigue sin legar imágenes perdurables para la historia del cine con Dune (como sí lo es su araña de Enemy), en parte porque a veces da la impresión de que le faltan imágenes a sus mejores creaciones de planos concretos (el manejo del tempo en montaje), como por una cierta impaciencia, y en parte también porque algunas de las más fascinantes quedan emborronadas por la obstinación digital, y ahí la multiplicación de multitudes en la secuencia de la lucha del personaje de Austin Butler en el coliseo ejerce de paradigma. El poder de Herbert y de Villeneuve y sus coguionistas para sellar frases como lápidas sigue intacto (“El sentido de la vida no es un problema a resolver, sino una realidad a experimentar”, se decía en la primera entrega). También los interesantes paralelismos entre Jesucristo y Paul Atreides, el rol de Timothée Chalamet: ese mesías que en la primera parte estaba a punto de rebelarse por su condición de elegido y que ahora, más consciente, debe pasar por una serie de pruebas en las dunas al igual que el hijo de Dios en la soledad del desierto, tentado por el Diablo. Y aún más, las sugestivas concomitancias entre los Fremen del planeta Arrakis del año 10191 y cualquier pueblo oprimido de la historia de la humanidad, que en nuestra contemporaneidad llevarán a no pocas mentes del público hasta Gaza. Una sensación agudizada además por los nombres de matices árabes y por esos túneles secretos para defenderse ante el opresor, que también pueden retrotraer incluso al Vietcong frente a EE UU (recordemos que la novela es de 1965). Dune: parte dos es de una severidad a veces excesiva y entre las pruebas en el desierto y la batalla final le sobra metraje por varios flancos. Pero también es sólida, atractiva y más emocionante que la primera entrega. Villeneuve parece que quiere seguir adaptando las novelas de Herbert. Tiene para toda una carrera y hasta para las de sus herederos. Y ojo porque la siguiente novela, El Mesías de Dune, convierte al oprimido en opresor. Y eso suena también a nuestra contemporaneidad en la zona de Oriente Próximo."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE," Dune: Part Two arrives with all its pomp and circumstance to rival other big productions. The gobsmacking visual effects and majestic cinematic score easily inspire awe. But for all its accessories, it’s essential a white savior film. The question is whether Dune: Part Two will freshly address its hero’s identity because there are only so many “you are the one” movies from a white man’s perspective I can watch before it gets tiresome. Production-wise, Dune: Part Two is a film that delivers stunning desert vistas alongside dreary empires of destruction, but its runtime and same-old perspectives feel like been there done that. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Villeneuve, John Spaihts, and Frank Herbert, Dune: Part Two continues from the end of the first movie. Starring Timotheé Chalamet as Paul Atreides, it shows him now stranded in the endless desert alongside his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), after the Emperor’s machinations led to a surprise nighttime massacre. While in the desert, Paul encounters the woman of his dreams, Chani (Zendaya), along with the rest of the Fremen. So begins the lengthy journey of Paul and Rebecca’s infiltration into this society, as Paul plots his vengeance against the parties responsible for his father’s death and the fall of his house. Along the way, the film touches up, but never goes into, themes of white savior, colonialism, religious manipulation of native people, and working-class uprisings. Zendaya as Chani is one of the best performances in Dune: Part Two. Although her transformation from distrusting acquaintance to love interest feels rushed even in the bloated runtime, her performance conveys all the emotional peaks and valleys. Buffering her more open performance comes Rebecca Ferguson’s more restrained work. As characters go, they seem as different as night and date, with Chalamet’s Paul caught between them. In any other context, he’d be a “momma’s boy” and Chalamet pulls that aspect off. But he does not feel believable as a person who suffered loss or as a savior set on vengeance. He struggles to retain the center, as his co-stars draw our attention. He and Zendaya lack heat, seeming more like friends than soon-to-be lovers. Javier Bardem, as Stilgar, is fantastic, feeling wise yet foolish as he leaves his people’s survival to an outsider’s heroism. Florence Pugh’s performance as Princess Irulan feels wooden, while Christopher Walken as the Emperor lacks believability. Keep in mind that many of these cast members decimate previous film roles. But for whatever reason, the sparkle, the it-factor is not here. Visually, Dune: Part Two is a wondrous experience to witness There’s never a creature in those dusty landscapes that feels unreal. It builds an authentic world that feels possible and present, outside the viewer’s reality and within their grasp. Details, from the gigantic sandworms to the adorable mousy creatures travailing the landscape, show a skill and reverence for filmmaking that deserves notice and praise. Although, how many stylish slow-mo walks can one have before thinking, “Enough?” Dune: Part Two is this year’s epic akin to the scope of famed films like Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments. It deserves heaps of praise for how the different characters look, the clothing, the way the lore unfolds, all of it except maybe the Fremen’s footwork to traverse the desert, which appears and disappears depending on the movie’s needs. Cinema has done to death tales of white saviors. The epic movies I referenced above are over sixty years old, yet beyond looks, little has changed. These tales prize the lives of white men as more valuable than others. While it’s a fictional movie, it reinforces arguments that white men have the most value. Those same talking points arise in court cases when a white man commits a violent crime, especially against a woman. It’s “think of what he can offer to society,” not what she has lost. A white man’s potential trumps all else. The most significant issue is that aside from the cinematic breadth of Dune: Part Two and a couple of performances, the movie isn’t entertaining enough. It’s standard fare in a phenomenal setting. Additionally, the colonialistic aspects tied with its depiction of religious indoctrination feel like propaganda to normalize atrocities. Dune: Part Two is a stunning film to behold. But it’s almost three hours long, and its lead cannot should the weight of its thematic ambitions. Chalamet’s dialogue with the Emperor and his evil Kylo Ren look are cringeworthy but it’s not just his fault. Other movies explore these themes entertainingly; some even contribute food for thought. That is not the case here. After all, Jet Li did it better in The One – entertainment-wise – and the title didn’t mince words. Game of Thrones explores similar themes while entertaining viewers. Dune: Part Two might have more to offer on repeated viewing, especially if they make another film, but it’s uncertain if – aside from the dynamite effects – viewers will want to sacrifice that much time again."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL," To feel truly transported by a science fiction movie is to find your brain racing to keep up with your eyes, as every frame offers new evidence that you’ve crash-landed somewhere wholly new. That’s the sensation provoked by Dune: Part Two, the closing installment of Denis Villeneuve’s monolithically massive, cleanly cleaved adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert novel. Like its predecessor, this is a blockbuster of chiefly cosmetic appeal — a triumph of world-building whose visual imagination extends from the biggest details of its brutalist production design (giant ships, giant buildings) to the smallest props. Just look at the helmets. Josh Brolin’s spaceman-spiffy astronaut gear. The top piece of an army’s beetle-black armor, complete with doodad whirring in the back. The crescent-moon demon horns sported by a colosseum’s staff, a company-issue uniform extravagant enough to get the flashbulbs bursting at the Met Gala. If one needed further evidence that Dune was laser-gunning to supplant Star Wars in the public imagination — to steal the title of America’s reigning space opera from the franchise its source material helped inspire — the sheer variety of Mandalorian-shaming headwear will do the trick. Mighty statues should be built in costume designer Jacqueline West’s honor. Watching Dune: Part Two, there’s little denying that Villeneuve, the Québécois art house auteur gone full Hollywood hitmaker, has tamed the unruly deserts of Arrakis. He’s done what Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch couldn’t, and converted a supposedly unfilmable cult object into a popular, populist entertainment — a humungous moviegoing event for the multiplex masses. Yet, his Dune remains satisfying almost exclusively as spectacle, as something to merely gawk at. Its effect is rather crushingly narcotic, an awe numbed by the dry, plodding feudal intrigue of Herbert’s story. Who knew it was possible to be so amazed and so bored at the same time? Give Part Two this: It’s more nimble and exciting than Part One. Slicing the 800-plus-page story in two was probably the only way to faithfully and coherently bring it to the screen. (Lynch’s 1984 Dune, which covered the whole book in just over two hours, wasn’t exactly a model of narrative sense.) But Villeneuve’s approach resulted in a prelude of a blockbuster, a glorified opening act that devoted most of its 155 minutes to table-setting. It existed only to introduce the Tolstoy-scaled cast of characters; the jargon-heavy mythology; and the central location, an inhospitable desert planet whose native people, the Fremen, have been psychologically and physiologically transformed by a natural resource, the mysterious, highly coveted substance known colloquially as spice. One could spend a whole review recapping the expository events of that inconclusive opening chapter. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts waste little time doing so, instead picking up where their “To be continued…” cliffhanger left off, with teenage scion Paul Atreides (Wonka‘s Timothée Chalamet) and his witchy zealot mother, Jessica (Silo‘s Rebecca Ferguson), forced into the arid wilds of Arrakis. They are the lone survivors of an ambush by their sworn political rivals, the Harkonnens — tyrannical mutant aristocrats who have been pillaging the planet and harvesting its spice for decades. To avenge his father, Paul may have to accept his role as the messiah of legend and prophecy, and unite the Fremen around a common cause — the annihilation of their shared enemy. That’s not the half of it. Dune‘s plot is as dense as a phonebook. But out there in the sand, away from the palace politics of Part One, the story sparks to life a little. There’s an undeniable hook, however familiar, to Paul’s hero journey, which rests on his half-willing assimilation into the native population — a classically involving melodrama that clarifies Avatar as another sci-fi vision born of Herbert’s influence. Some blessed humor pokes its head out of the dirt in the form of Javier Bardem’s tribe leader, Stilgar, a skeptic-turned-true believer whose enthusiastic cheerleading is an oasis of levity in a desert of poker-faced prophecy. And though Zendaya’s performance as Fremen warrior Chani, the woman of Paul’s premonitory dreams, has a distinctly contemporary cadence — is it possible for a film set eons in the future to seem anachronistic? — the puppy-love courtship lends a welcome human dimension to this stone-tablet material. For all its state-of-the-art effects work, Dune: Part Two has the scale and grandeur — even the slightly pokier pace — of an Old Hollywood epic. Some of that comes down to its star-studded cast, the kind that used to fill out Biblical and disaster movies. As if to compensate for the big names lost in Part One’s midway-mark massacre, Villeneuve floods the margins with new characters, like the galactic emperor (Christopher Walken, silent for half his time on-screen, as if fearful his famous, much-imitated dialect will spoil the otherworldly verisimilitude) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Chalamet’s Little Woman costar, Florence Pugh). And joining the prosthetically burdened Harkonnen clan is Elvis star Austin Butler, whose pasty Game of Thrones-grade sadist Feyd-Rautha adds a touch of agreeably campy villainy to the proceedings. He gets a great entrance, a rigged gladiatorial showdown shot in ghostly black-and-white. But the film might have introduced him sooner than halfway through this long sit. Herbert conceived Dune as an allegorical vision of the Middle East, ravaged by oil-hungry invaders. On-screen, it remains an uneasy mess of contradictions: a critique of colonialism that bends all too easily into the shape of a white-savior story, a kind of deep-space Lawrence of Arabia. Villeneuve complicates that popular reading in tangible ways, making Chani a spokeswoman for a hypothetical audience’s objections — she’s the secular voice of reason here, explicitly calling out the way the Bene Gesserit dogma can be used to control and exploit the Fremen — while emphasizing Paul’s nagging doubts and the insidious manipulation of Jessica’s conversion campaign. (As in Doctor Sleep, Ferguson’s regal, classical beauty gains a mystical predatory quality.) On the other hand, there’s something rather colonialist about how these Dunes populate a world symbolically Arab in dress and language with non-Arab actors. And that’s to say nothing of the accidental real-world echoes of an adventure that pits an oppressive occupation against a revolutionary jihad. Even those uncomfortable with the optics of Dune may fall under the sway of Villeneuve’s majestic execution. The action is mythic, coherent, and, above all, heavy: When Paul leads the Fremen in an assault on one of the Harkonnen mining vessels, you feel the weight of the infernally colossal machine in your bones. And when a sandworm of lore rises from the deep, ready to be broken like a stubborn horse by the interloping Paul, the whole auditorium shakes and quivers. The composer, Hans Zimmer, has never found a more perfect visual match for his deafening sonic assaults, the rumbling Dolby bombast that’s become his signature. There may be more expensive or more thrilling Hollywood movies released this year, but don’t expect one more huge. Still, the director is a frustratingly literal dream weaver. He plays Dune impossibly straight, like gospel. That might be one key to the project’s success; after years of irony-poisoned superhero frivolity, the thunderous self-seriousness of this two-part vision holds a certain novelty, an exotic flavor. But sci-fi as unapologetically weird as Herbert’s maybe deserves a more psychedelic interpretation. For all its borderline incoherence, Lynch’s version tapped into the stoner-rock “whoa” factor of Dune. Villeneuve turns the text into left-brain pageantry, a sci-fi movie whose mysteries are all right there on the surface. But what could one expect from the expert craftsman who looked at Blade Runner and decided that the endless replicant debate was where its interest lay? To Villeneuve, what’s cinematic about Dune is all in the scope and the texture — the opportunity to visualize a vast universe of natural and technological wonders. That the characters, even (or perhaps especially) Chalamet’s Tiger Beat chosen one, have the personality of chess pieces is a bug the filmmaker treats like a feature. Dune may be a foundational classic, but many of the sci-fi adventures it inspired had the good sense to introduce a Han Solo (or at least keep around a Duncan Idaho) to undercut the solemn religious debate and endless jockeying for power. Dune: Part Two doesn’t want to undercut any of that. It’s comfortable playing out a giant game of chess — or, given the bifurcation of Herbert’s hefty story, half a game. At least the board is beautiful. The first two months of 2024 have been slow at the box office. There have been far more misses than hits. It's a bad sign when Madame Web is the most memorable film of 2024, but for all the wrong reasons. These negative feelings are about to change with Dune: Part Two on March 1. The sequel to Denis Villeneuve's Dune continues the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mission to unite the Fremen people of Arrakis in a war against the Harkonnens. The renowned French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is one of the most popular and best filmmakers working today. Villeneuve has been making movies since 1998, but really burst onto the scene with 2013's Prisoners, which was soon followed by one blockbuster after another. The 60th anniversary of Frank Herbert's Dune will arrive in 2025, but the real party begins this week with the premiere of Dune: Part Two. Almost all of the advance reviews and reactions have been extremely positive, and the box office has been starved for a hit movie since Timothée Chalamet's last film, Wonka, was an unexpected success in December. Having two hits in a row is going to do a lot for Chalamet's reputation as a box-office star. But the real attraction of Dune: Part Two is the film itself, which is a masterful sci-fi spectacle from director Denis Villeneuve, who finally has the blockbuster numbers to go with his breathtaking genre movies. Villeneuve has often said that he wants fans to see Dune: Part Two on the biggest screens possible. But for movie lovers who don't want to go out to the theater, we're going to tell you whether Dune: Part Two is already streaming.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is that rare sequel that totally crushes expectations and bests its successful predecessor. Writer/director Denis Villeneuve transports audiences to Arrakis, delivering an enthralling experience through flawless special effects and the exceptional cinematography of Greig Fraser. The performances match the breathtaking visuals, making Dune: Part Two a captivating and immersive cinematic experience. The film picks up immediately after the events of Dune: Part One. The year is 10191, and House Atreides has been wiped out, leaving House Harkonnen in control of the spice mining operations on Arrakis. The corrupt and greedy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) stands in stark contrast to the murdered Duke Leto Atreides. Under the Baron’s watchful eye, “Beast” Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) hunts the planet’s native population, the Fremen, determined to exterminate every last one. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have now become allies with the Fremen, fighting together to ensure the survival of Arrakis. However, not all Fremen are accepting of these other worlders, but Stilgar (Javier Bardem) stands resolute and unbending in his support of Paul, convinced that he is the prophesied savior. This is despite Paul’s desire not to fulfill the prophecy and instead become one of the Fremen and fight the evil Harkonnens. Dune: Part One revealed Paul had visions of Chani (Zendaya) before the two even met, and as Dune: Part Two begins, the two are getting to know each other. Chani’s initially wary of this stranger but soon discovers he’s sincere in his desire to join the Fremen and unwilling to accept the mantle of savior. With Chani teaching him the Freman ways, Paul becomes an integral player in the battle against the Harkonnens. Yet, even as he pushes away any attempts by Stilgar and the more religious southern Fremen to anoint him as “the one,” his actions and abilities tell a different story. With each new skill, Stilgar insists Paul is following what was written and is the one. While Paul grapples with his fate, Lady Jessica eagerly embraces her own remarkable metamorphosis into Reverend Mother. Working diligently from her new elevated position, she, much like Stilgar, strives to win over the Fremen and convince them that her son is the promised one. Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet has grown as an actor since first tackling the role of the conflicted future leader in Dune: Part One, demonstrating a newfound depth and complexity in his performance. In Part Two, Chalamet captivates with his impeccable portrayal of Paul Atreides (or, as he’s chosen to call himself, Muad’Dib), as he skillfully depicts Paul’s evolution from a mere student to a reluctant leader, ultimately accepting his true calling. In Part One, Zendaya’s Chani had a brief introduction, and now in Part Two, her strength and determination confirm that she’s a fierce fighter. But more than that, Zendaya portrays Chani as the only person who sees Paul for the man he is – not “the one” or the scion of a royal family. As Paul and Chani’s relationship deepens, Chani provides Paul with a genuine connection to Arrakis, its history, its people, and its beauty. Javier Bardem’s Stilgar provides the film with its comic relief, but not in an intrusive or jokey way. It’s Stilgar’s sincerity, his unwavering hope, and conviction that his people have found the one to lead them to a better life, that makes his earnestness occasionally comical. Bardem’s terrific as a leader of the Fremen and an old-school true believer in the promise of a messiah to lead his people in their fight for a free Arrakis. As Lady Jessica, Rebecca Ferguson brings a whole new level of intensity and authority to her character in Part Two. Ferguson’s Lady Jessica undergoes an incredible physical and spiritual transformation, and Ferguson’s riveting in scenes in which she carries on conversations with her unborn daughter. Oscar nominee Austin Butler (Elvis) brings one of Dune’s most iconic villains to the screen, portraying Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen as a cruel and twisted psychopath brought in to wipe out the Fremen. Director Villeneuve describes Butler’s take on the power-hungry Feyd-Rautha as a psychotic killer who’s a cross between a sword master and Mick Jagger. Almost unrecognizable under a bald cap, pale skin makeup, and blackened teeth, Butler delivers a standout performance that’s one of the best of his career. Feyd-Rautha is evil incarnate, and Butler makes him a character that commands the screen. Obviously, you’ll root against him, but inwardly you can’t help but want him to make more appearances. Villeneuve’s assembled an incredible supporting cast that includes Oscar nominee Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban, Oscar nominee Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Oscar winner Christopher Walken as Emperor, Léa Seydoux as Lady Margot Fenring, Souheila Yacoub as Shishakli, and Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen. Dune: Part Two is really just one more example of why the Oscars need to add a Best Ensemble category. Dune: Part Two features stunning visuals and massive action sequences, as well as intense hand-to-hand fight scenes. But, as expected, it’s the sandworm riding scenes that are the coolest and most jaw-dropping. They’ll make you believe sandworms exist. Honestly, the world Villeneuve and his remarkable team have created will make you swear Arrakis is an actual planet. It’s that immersive – especially in IMAX. Prepare to be transported to a mesmerizing sci-fi world with Dune: Part Two, a film that has earned its place among the genre’s all-time greats. Filmmaker Villeneuve has taken Frank Herbert’s iconic novel and made it accessible to a new generation, bringing to life a timeless tale of greed, love, corruption, and loyalty, set against the backdrop of an epic battle between good and evil."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Despite veering from the content of the novel&#44; and forgiving the lack of menace Austin Butler created&#44; this was a phenomenal movie filled with glorious action&#44; magnificent visuals and special effects&#44; and passionate and dynamic performances&#46;
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,Any pointed critique might get lost here in the spectacular sunsets&#44; sleek knife fights&#44; opulent wardrobes and blockbuster power&#46; &#46;&#46;&#46; It grinds the rough edges off the source material in favour of symmetry and spectacle&#46;
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL," Denis Villeneuve’s stunningly realized film adaptations of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi saga Dune take an epic leap forward in Dune: Part Two, the sequel to the Oscar-winning first film starring Timothée Chalamet as possible Chosen One, Paul Atreides. Last seen at the end of Dune trekking into the desert like a twink Lawrence of Arabia, Paul is still a refugee on the desert planet Arrakis. Following the massacre of his father and the House of Atreides by savage Harkonnen forces, he’s hiding among the native Fremen, plotting to avenge his House, while also evading death or capture by his clan’s universe of enemies, including ruler of all, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken). The first film felt mostly like a long-winded setup for a protagonist who took little action. This installment plants Paul in the driver’s seat for a spicier tale of revenge, and, as it turns out, religion. The Fremen, as discussed in Part One, await the arrival of a messiah who’ll free Arrakis from the rapacious Houses who come to mine the planet’s all-important element, Spice. All signs point to Paul being the One, with Fremen tribe leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem, in the film’s most amusing turn) especially convinced that Paul’s presence proves the prophecy.  Paul’s wily mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a sister in the mystical order of Bene Gesserit, sees the prophecy as a clear path to power. As her son leads revolts against Harkonnen forces commanded by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård, excellent as always), Lady Jessica eagerly fans the flames of spiritual fervor among the Fremen, intent on converting all nonbelievers. The compelling moral quandaries behind Paul’s ascent, as either the foretold messiah or a false prophet, present Chalamet with a much richer part to play this go-round. He succeeds in painting Paul in intriguingly opaque tones, the rising leader’s true motives and beliefs veiled behind the heroic mantle of freedom fighter. Fighting alongside him as Fremen warrior Chani, Zendaya — who had six minutes of screen time in the 155-minute first film — also has a more textured story to tell here. Chani is chief among nonbelievers in Paul’s purported destiny, but, witnessing his valor in battle, and his humility in embracing the Fremen and their ways, she falls for him. Chalamet and Zendaya don’t spark a cinema romance for the ages, but Paul and Chani’s dalliance adds a thread of sorely needed sentiment to the slow-turning plot and cool visual splendor. Again, Villeneuve and Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser capture the otherworldly scale of the landscape, creatures (those sandworms), and machinery on Arrakis. Filmed for IMAX, the action sequences — like a gladiator contest that features Harkonnen warrior Feyd-Lautha (Austin Butler) battling before a bloodthirsty crowd — pump the adrenaline, while also evoking the saga’s thornier themes on brutal colonization, and fighting wars on foreign soil. And, just like the first, the movie is aurally amazing, especially during the awe-inspiring scenes of sandworm riding. Those who dare, stand atop the massive monsters and hang on for dear life as they barrel through the sand at frightening speed. The sound of it is tremendous. As a moviegoer who wept with Frodo and Sam all the way up Mount Doom in the Lord of the Rings series, Villeneuve’s trips to Arrakis, while audio-visually enthralling, have yet to offer characters and circumstances that inspire the devotion this franchise seems to demand.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," “Dune: Part Two” contains a potentially meme-worthy performance by Christopher Walken, who plays the all-powerful Emperor of the Known Universe. The oddness, the humor, and the absurdity of this casting decision demonstrate director Denis Villeneuve’s command of the sprawling material upon which his film is based. This movie, more than the first part, is entirely on author Frank Herbert’s wavelength. What was thought unfilmable is now captured with a keen knowledge and understanding of the groundbreaking science fiction bestseller. And Villeneuve’s “Part Two” subtly teases the possibility of more installments in the future. I say, bring it on! On the critical planet of Arrakis (aka “Dune”), a battle rages between the indigenous Fremen population and the Emperor’s handpicked Harkonnen occupying forces. The guerilla-style war threatens to disrupt the spice mining on the planet. Spice is the crucial fuel that permits interstellar space travel. Any disruption could bring down the great ruling houses in the universe. The Emperor focuses his ire on the main thorn in his shoe: a mysterious leader known as “Muad’Dib.” Walken’s skillful way with words turns Muad’Dib into an expression of frustration, a nagging question, and a statement of fear. And to hear the Emperor repeat the odious name of his adversary (in the most Walkenesque way possible), you can’t help but chuckle uncomfortably. It’s the awkwardness that reveals the messiness of the entire affair. Secrets won’t be kept, power cannot be consolidated without much bloodletting, and religious fervor will likely outstrip logic and reason. Such is the complicated universe that Frank Herbert introduced in his award-winning 1965 novel. The success of Villeneuve’s “Dune” two-part adaptation is in the combination of a great many choices. Casting Walken, a move that seems almost antithetical to the material's tone, is a pleasant surprise. A more Herbert-friendly casting was in Stellan Skarsgárd, as the hulking, ruthless, and depraved Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. By casting the more aloof and amusingly reserved Walken, we see two extremes of leadership architecture. In this universe, the ruling class is equally cunning, brutal, and recklessly stupid. Blinded by the quest for power and their arrogant sense of entitlement, the Emperor and the Baron seem headed for a crash. However, if he is successful, Maud’Dib might find that pulling the levers of power will be more challenging than riding atop a giant sandworm. This second part of Villeneuve's stunning adaptation of Frank Herbert's groundbreaking science fiction tome is grander, more thrilling, and better than 2021's “Part One.” But I suggest that “Part One” suffered because it was incomplete, and these two halves should be viewed as one five-and-a-half-hour epic movie. The somber, some may say dull aspects of the first installment are all but eliminated in this one, as contextual humor creeps in to alleviate some of the dreck associated with the heavy story elements. Villeneuve and his co-writer Jon Spaihts preserve the core Herbert narrative, subtly improving on the shape of the nearly 900-page book while capably adjusting some of the gender politics that were reflective of the time in which the novel was written. Timothée Chalamet is terrific as the older, more mature, and battle-hardened Paul Atreides, who takes refuge with the desert people known as the Fremen. At his side is Chani (a convincing and fierce Zendaya). Paul is given the Fremen name of Usul and later Muad'Dib. As he helps the Fremen violently push back against their Harkonnen occupiers, Paul's mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), becomes the Fremen's reverend mother. The film's religious aspects add narrative heft, as shown in the Fremen's internal struggle with the fundamentalists among them. While remaining true to Herbert's vision, Villeneuve smartly saddles right up to the familiar connections to our world’s dangerous confrontations with radical elements. The conflict between zealots and men of cold scientific calculation is a recurring theme. Dave Bautista returns as Rabban Harkonnen, the ogre-like nephew of the Baron. He’s charged with crushing the Fremen rebellion. His instincts cause him to violently ignore the logical suggestions of his supporting staff. This impulsiveness leads to his failure to bring the planet under Harkonnen control. The Baron then turns to another nephew, Feyd-Rautha (“Elvis” star Austin Butler, sporting a frigidly pale complexion and a completely bald head). The insane Feyd brings in the big guns, but these genocidal tactics only serve to harden the resolve of the zealots. The complicated ballet of planetary and universe-wide politics is one that bombs and mass murder cannot resolve. And to be sure, “Dune: Part Two” has plenty of action sequences. However, as the movie draws to a close, these elegant and exciting scenes are compressed and arguably rushed. This compression artificially brings characters quickly together in a somewhat unconvincing fashion. The scale of the battle is reduced to one-on-one fights that seem more for the viewer's benefit than to reflect the confusing, chaotic progress of the war accurately. So, we get inevitable face-offs between various adversaries culminating in the final showdown with the Emperor, the Baron, and others participating in the palace intrigue. And we get Walken. The Emperor may be in charge, but his grip on power is tenuous. Walken infuses the Emperor with a conniving worminess that is worthy of the character, but the way he says “Maud’Dib” is an added delight. It’s hard to think that the humor he brings and other comical moments throughout the film aren’t all intended. It’s partly due to the weirdness of the narrative but also the result of expert decisions, such as casting Walken. Denis Villeneuve is remarkably adept at bringing science fiction stories to the big screen. His films, like 2016’s “Arrival” and the surprisingly terrific “Blade Runner 2049,” display an intimate and confident understanding of how to combine immersive special effects with pitch-perfect characterizations. And his one-two punch at Frank Herbert’s closely guarded “Dune” is another rousing success that cannot be easily dismissed as accidental."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,DUNE-heads unite&#44; &amp; props to dir Denis Villenueve &amp; his team for properly delivering Frank Herbert&apos;s illuminating sci-fi story of courage and prophecy&#46; Everything you want &#46;&#46;&#46; epic battle&#44; romance and loyalty&#47;betrayal is in this incredible film&#46; Perfect&#33; 
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL," The most startling moment in Denis Villeneuve’s continuing slog through distant deserts – a project that lives to startle – comes with an accidental (maybe) allusion to Monty Python’s Life of Brian. We shan’t spoil, but you can probably guess it has something to do with the pressures of being appointed Messiah. Though Javier Bardem, back as the Freman bruiser Silgar, is allowed his moments of levity, Dune: Part Two is freighted with more self-importance than you met in the biblical epics Python satirised. Those had colour, zest and Gina Lollobrigida peeling grapes erotically for half-naked Yul Brynner. Dune: Part Two has near-monochrome, piety and Zendaya, wrapped up in fatigues, pounding the desert with a similarly martial Timothée Chalamet. (No harm to Zendaya, who is fast emerging a star of the old school.) As the earlier films sought to smuggle smut into sacred texts, the current project looks to be attempting the reverse journey: turning high-end pulp into holy writ. Just look how madder fans have already reacted to a lone negative review of Part Two – traduce not the Book of (Frank) Herbert! This is not quite a negative review. Villeneuve has a singular flair for enormousness, and it would take a weary brain not to revel at the confidence of his achievement here. We hardly need to reprise the plot in detail. Paul Atreides (Chalamet), exiled duke of the house that bears his surname, is now among the desert people known as Fremen. He has learned how to ride their giant worms. He has made friends with Zendaya’s plucky warrior. Elsewhere, a host of stars – some returning, some signed in the transfer period – are plotting at the court of Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken). Florence Pugh is unsmiling as the emperor’s daughter. Charlotte Rampling is back veiled as the reverend mother. Léa Seydoux is barely there as the Wodehousely named Lady Margot Fenring. “The Bryllis ran swiftly on five legs, using the other two to send out crylon vibrations,” Raymond Chandler famously wrote in his satire on contemporaneous science fiction. Whether you care or care not about all this space-opera hoo-ha, it can’t be denied that Villeneuve has devised dazzling visual signatures for the contrasting worlds and warring societies. One may not emerge whistling Hans Zimmer’s meteorological score – part hurricane, part malfunctioning car alarm – but one is tempted to hum along to that achingly elegant design, even if it is impossible (and I honestly tried) to avoid the cliche that compares such things to perfume commercials. Don’t you see Zendaya and Chalamet on screens as you walk through duty free on the way to the gate? Well, you damn well should. The chatter and intrigue are aimed at arranging a showdown between Paul and the intergalactically malign Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. The distinction between how that role is handled here and how it worked in David Lynch’s much-maligned 1984 Dune says much about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the projects. Sting was funny in underpants. Austin Butler, speaking in an eerily impressive impersonation of Stellan Skarsgård, who plays the character’s uncle, finds a mean place between ice and electricity as he slices his way through errant underlings. Butler relishes the opportunity, but his creation is more of an inorganic energy than a sentient being. Ultimately, we end up with an abundance of craft and a forest of lore wrapped around personal narratives too flimsy to sustain marching feet. Chalamet is a good actor. He was perfect as the fraught cannibal in Bones and All. But he doesn’t have enough gears to shift from confused dauphin to compromised tyrant. His hero is more than a very naughty boy, but he’s not yet the Messiah (or Napoleon, for that matter)."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," After all, Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi novel, a mythopoeic, quasi-religious, desertpunk, anti-colonial, anti-demagoguery, speculative history masterpiece, was long deemed pretty much unfilmable. Simply making a cohesive movie out of it is the Hollywood equivalent of splitting the atom — and others have tried. Already saddled with a faithful but bloated 2000s miniseries, one self-described ""failure"" of a David Lynch movie and another from surrealist director Alejandro Jodorowsky that was somehow so terrifyingly bizarre it was cancelled when his other 1970s desert nightmare, El Topo, made it to theatres, adaptations of Dune carry some bad blood. Which is why Villeneuve's Dune: Part One was an act of movie magic: racking up over $400 million US at the box office, pulling in six Oscars and making an unlikely leading man out of Timothée Chalamet. And it was all based on the director's ability to ignore an impulse to condense and instead spread a single story over two films releasing years apart. In the sequel, finally out this week, Villeneuve managed to do it all over again. Dune: Part Two is a towering achievement of artistic vision, clearly crafted by a man with both a deep love for the source material and mastery over his craft.  The only problem is, like Part One, the only way to accomplish this was to make something that is, for all intents and purposes, not even really a movie.  Focusing on a single planet caught in the crosshairs of an interstellar feud, Dune follows the powerful Atreides family as it attempts to govern the desert world Arrakis. The position is particularly valuable to patriarch Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac in Part One) and his son Paul (Chalamet), as Arrakis is the only known source of ""spice."" Both a drug and sort-of-but-not-really fuel (forgive me Duneheads, I have a word limit), that substance happens to be the most important resource in the universe.  The Atreides management of the planet, which was previously controlled by the decidedly more evil Harkonnens (led by Stellan Skarsgård's fantastically disgusting Baron Harkonnen), is hampered by threats that more than warranted the first book's four appendices and 30 page glossary. Paul is up against everything from the indigenous ""Fremen,"" to the witchlike ""Bene Gesserit"" sisterhood, Sardaukar, slip-tips, shigawire and, of course, Shai Hulud — the gigantic sandworms that are the source of both spice, and the film's uncomfortably familiar tie-in popcorn bucket. The background is a hugely complex and, to the uninitiated, potentially impenetrable wordsoup. But Villeneuve's genius way around that wasn't to simplify or substantively change Herbert's plot; instead, he went the other way. Even before he got confirmation that he'd get a sequel, the Québécois director split the novel in two — and the first movie was marketed as simply Dune, without the ""part one"" that would indicate to audiences that it was part of a franchise. Dune: Part One, though beautiful and made with obvious intention, operated more as a primer for a hypothetical future film than a self-contained story of its own. Dune: Part Two doesn't close the loop. Instead, it kicks the can down the road once again — calling for a sequel that might finally tie the whole breathtaking thing together.  In Part One, the stumbling block was simple: a singular focus on exposition. Because of a need to get movie-goers up to snuff on whose crysknife pierced which Mentat's stillsuit, we eventually arrive at the end with a better understanding of the characters and world — but at the expense of any fully realized character arc. Part Two feels similarly awe-inspiring but not quite finished, though for a different reason. It begins with Paul wandering the desert after a violent coup and attempt on his life by the Harkonnens. Forced to take refuge with the Fremen, he falls back on an old trick.  Having predicted a situation like this, the mystical Bene Gesserit had already seeded the planet with fabricated prophecies of a coming messiah from beyond their world. Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), take advantage of this, positioning Paul as the fabled Lisan al Gaib, come to bring freedom to the Fremen and turn their planet into a lush paradise.  That gives Part Two a much more cinematic track to follow: the Avatar, Pocahontas, Fern Gully or Lawrence of Arabia (a direct inspiration for Herbert's Dune) formula of a turncoat colonial hero come to identify with and save a persecuted population. But a large reason why Herbert's novel eventually found such a wide audience is because of a fundamental misunderstanding of its intent. In fixing that, Dune: Part Two now brings a subtext to the fore that demands more closure than it gets. ""Dune Messiah is the most misunderstood of Frank Herbert's novels,"" Frank Herbert's son, Brian, writes in the introduction to Dune's sequel — initially hated for the same reasons the original was loved.  ""The second novel in the series flipped over the carefully crafted hero myth of Paul Muad'Dib and revealed the dark side of the messiah phenomenon that had appeared to be so glorious in Dune. Many readers didn't want that dose of reality."" Villeneuve, a lifelong Dune fan who carved Paul's Fremen name into his graduation ring, understood that message: the theme so cleanly following the Bertolt Brecht quote ""Unhappy the land that needs heroes,"" it's seemingly echoed in the text as, ""No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero."" ""People were thinking Paul was a hero, [Herbert] wanted to be the opposite. He wanted Paul to be [an] anti-hero,"" Villeneuve told CBC at the Montreal premiere. ""Me, knowing that, I decided to make my adaptation to be more faithful to Frank Herbert than to the book."" But this is also the movie's saving grace. Because Villeneuve subtly darkens Paul's choices and gives vastly more agency to many of Dune's women — like Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan and most vitally Zendaya's Chani —  Dune: Part Two sets a future movie up to more cleanly, and explosively, confront its major theme. If and when a sequel — or sequels — stick that landing, Villeneuve's Dune franchise could be viewed as a flawless triumph. But how do you judge a story without an ending? It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Maybe you're eager to see ""Dune: Part Two"" for the multiplex-shaking spectacle and thunderous sound that remain spectacular in every sense of the word. Or maybe you think costars Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are just the cutest coolest screen couple in, like, ever. Either way, you'll get your money's worth from director Denis Villeneuve's sequel to his futuristic 2021 blockbuster, based on Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi novel. Not since David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" have we seen a desert vibrate with such mesmerizing beauty and terror. There's not an ounce of hack work in it. There's also a dynamite new villain in Feyd-Rautha, played by a brilliant and scarily hairless Austin Butler, and battle scenes to die for that demand to be experienced on the biggest screen. That should be easy since unlike ""Part One,"" released during the pandemic, there won't be a streaming option for quite some time. Expect a ""Barbenheimer""-level rush on the box office. Setbacks? There are a few worth a mention. At nearly three hours, all that shifting, swirling sand can be a dreary drag on the pacing. And Herbert's timeless themes of colonialist economic, political and racial persecution suffer from a dispiriting lack of development. Subtexts tend to go out the window in the face of thrilling attacks from giant sandworms. And yet the narrative, constructed by Villeneuve and cowriter Jon Spaihts, exerts a gravitational pull that cannot be denied. Add a propulsive Hans Zimmer score and camera miracles from Graig Fraser -- both won Oscars for the first ""Dune"" -- and it's a feast for the eyes and ears. The plot picks up exactly where ""Part One"" left off. Chalamet is still a skinny marink as Paul Atreides, the young duke and maybe future messiah, but his father's murder has beefed up Paul's resolve for revenge against freaky Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his two psycho nephews, Butler's cunning Feyd-Rautha and Dave Bautista's beastly Glossu Rabban. The prize for all this in-fighting -- provoked by the Emperor, played by the emperor of weird, Christopher Walken -- is found on the desert planet of Arrakis (Dune to you) in the form of a spice that can expand consciousness and life. Everyone wants a hit off this wonder drug. This leads Paul and his pregnant, widowed mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), to form an alliance with the Fremen, an indigenous tribe of desert guerilla warriors led by Stilgar, played by Javier Bardem with a sense of humor this movie needs more than any spice. Bardem is a riot. Stilgar thinks Paul is the messiah, though his chief soldier Chani (the incandescent Zendaya seizing a richer, better written role than she had in ""Part One"") is not so sure. But her hot love thing for Paul comes through as legit, giving ""Part Two"" the romantic rooting interest it needs amid all the mystical mumbo-jumbo that script keeps laying on us. Is ""Part Two"" really the end of the ""Dune"" story? Don't bet on it. Hollywood rarely lets go of a franchise as long as it keeps laying golden eggs. Villeneuve has already hinted he's up for another go. And he's gifted enough to make that sound less like a threat than an exhilarating promise that we ain't seen nothing yet."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," If co-writer/director Denis Villeneuve's Dune
took too much time getting to the point, the filmmaker's sequel is, perhaps, in
too much of a rush to actually consider the many points it wants to make. Dune:
Part Two begins with such confidence that Villeneuve's decision to split the
Frank Herbert novel in twain seems like a smart decision. Now, the first movie
feels even more like a prologue than a self-contained story, and this payoff,
while certainly an improvement in terms of the narrative and the visual
elements, might end up seeming like a prologue for whatever the filmmakeror
his successor, perhapshas in store for what comes next. No, this one ultimately doesn't quite feel
complete, either, and that's not simply because of the movie's cliffhanger
ending, in which the stakes of the journey of Paul (Timothée Chalamet), the
last living heir of House Atreides and the possible messiah for the native
inhabitants of the desert planet Arrakis, expand beyond this dry slice of the
galaxy. It's also because the story's best and thorniest ideas, which have to do
with religious prophecy and faithful fanaticism and how both are so easily
exploited or created to serve the powerful, are constantly teased but kept
sidelined for a whole host of new characters, conflicts, and expansions of the
already-established ones. After whittling down the number of characters
and the focus of the conflict in the first movie, Villeneuve and returning
co-screenwriter Jon Spaihts immediately introduce us to more and more. Indeed,
""more"" seems to the central philosophy of the storytelling here,
whether that be in seeing and understanding more of Arrakis and its inhabitants,
as Paul partakes in and begins to lead a campaign of guerilla warfare against
the industry of Spice mining on the planet, or in bringing us to a couple other
worlds, in order to meet a collection of new characters. The story is so busy
with introductions and exposition that the core of the actual plot feels
hurriedeven within the movie's nearly three-hour run time. The heart of it, as the first installment
established generally and made clear was pretty simplistic, is a tale of revenge
from multiple angles. There's Paul, whose father and most of whose noble house
were massacred by the nefarious House Harkonnen during the predecessor's climax. He wants to kill Baron Harkonnen (Stellan
Skarsgård), the floating blob of villainy who organized the slaughter, and any
other member of that house, such as Harkonnen's right-hand man Rabban (Dave
Bautista) or Austin Butler's sociopathic nephew Feyd-Rautha (a character who
gets a lot of hubbub for as on-the-nose as he is and as little purpose he
finally serves), who gets in Paul's way. Paul is also convinced the galaxy's
Emperor (Christopher Walken) had something to do with the murderous plot, so
that guy has to go, too. The early strength of the material here is in
how Paul's plan, which is to join the local Fremen people in their attacks on
mining operations, is primarily an excuse to learn about and explore the culture
of the local tribe, who essentially want revenge for decades of colonization and
resource-plundering. Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who also
wants revenge and decides to use her religious sway as an indirect means of
achieving it (and her ability to control minds as a more direct means), have
been taken in by a band of Fremenseen with suspicion by some and with
reverence by others, who are quickly convinced that Paul is the fulfillment of a
messianic prophecy. He learns their ways, tries to stay as
anonymous a part of the collective as possible (leading the clan's chief and
true believer Stilgar, played by Javier Bardem, to become even more convinced
Paul is their savior), and starts an understated romance with Chani (Zendaya).
She's weary of the outsider at first, but the two form a mutual respect that
gives this installment a degree of humanity the previous one lacked. All of this, of course, is mainly a
justification for spectacle, and from the ground-level assaults on massive
pieces of mining equipment to a largerand, at times, transportiverole for
the sphincter-like sand worms, the movie delivers in a way that's regularly
impressive. The opening sequence set against an eclipse alone makes the first
movie look even aesthetically blander by comparison, and a scene of gladiatorial
combat on the Harkonnen home world is striking in the way a black moon turns
everything monochrome (Maybe Villeneuve has a sense of humor about how the
abundance of shades of beige gave the previous movie a different hue of
monochromatic sameness at times). The centerpiece sequence of Paul attempting to
ride a sand worm eliminates any inkling of silliness by turning it into an
intimidating, up-close-and-personal push through walls of sand. Eventually, the many other threadssome of
them, such as characters played by Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux, unmentioned
until right now and others, such as Jessica's religious rise and how much is
devoted to Feyd-Rautha, only suggestedoverburden the narrative. The result is
that every element of the story of Dune: Part Two feels undercooked.
Whether that's an issue of adapting everything from a significant tome or
shortchanging too many of those things is irrelevant. The resulting movie
doesn't come across as if it's telling the whole story it wants to tell.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Two particular sentences capture the essence of Dune: Part Two, and one cannot exist without the other. The first: “Frank Herbert’s legendary novel continues its reputation for being unfilmable.” The second: “Denis Villeneuve is more than capable of pulling all the right strings and pushing all the right buttons to come admirably, if only relatively, close to the feat.” Indeed, in trying to improve upon just about everything that Dune: Part One had to offer, the highly-anticipated sophomore entry in Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic film series takes one of the biggest cinematic swings we may see all year. And while that’s resulted in its thematic reach exceeding its grasp on far more than a few occasions, the director’s eye for earth-shattering set pieces, a slew of piercing performances (particularly that of Austin Butler), and Greig Fraser’s hypnotic cinematography ensures that Dune: Part Two brings home the proverbial spice. Now, let’s get something straight; had I viewed Dune: Part Two on an IMAX screen with top-of-the-line sound, this movie could have very well gotten a perfect score. But, if you’re like me and millions of other people who don’t have access to such a luxury, the visuals — spectacular as they are — have that much more of a ceiling on their overall contribution to the film’s quality as a whole (which, as James Cameron’s Avatar films are well aware of by now, have a pretty notable ceiling in the first place). Such is the bed you make when you prioritize spectacle above anything else, which the film is not shy about doing in any way, shape, or form. That being said, the masterful visual craftsmanship on display here is fundamentally undeniable; whether it’s a sand-dusted calm before the storm, watching an army of Fremen warriors unleash their dazzling potential for violence, or, of course, Paul’s goosebump-inducing acclimation to the title of sandworm wrangler, Dune: Part Two commits hard, fast, loud, and proud to spectacle filmmaking, and even the most academic audience members will likely find themselves tipping their hats to the film’s immersion goals, even if they don’t ultimately buy into it. Speaking of which, Villeneuve’s Dune films have done an extremely impressive job of stripping away the more turgid, academic ideas of the original novel, focusing instead on the more widely-resonant themes that remain. The philosophical framework of Dune: Part Two, while still solid, doesn’t match up to the success that Dune: Part One achieved in this realm. Much of this has to do with the ideas that Dune: Part Two seems to want to grapple with; namely, the push and pull of determinism and free will, colonialism, and the role that religion and nature plays in both of those conversations. In other words, it’s no easy task to explore what Dune: Part Two wants to explore, and the whole of the film’s execution exemplifies the dilemma; everything is bigger, including its personal thematic goalposts, which the film struggles to reach in a consistently cohesive manner. Still, the fact that those goalposts are very clearly visible is also a victory in its own right. Which leads us into the strongest individual piece of Villeneuve’s ambitious puzzle: Austin Butler’s turn as the wickedly sadistic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen who’s tipped as the successor to the Harkonnen throne. Long-gone is the charming Southeastern swagger of Elvis Presley, and in its place we find Butler at his most unrecognizable yet, crackling in every scene with a barely-contained penchant for spontaneous bloodshed, and a demeanor that simultaneously makes you want to punch him in the face and fall through a hole in the ground, lest it’s your jugular that ends up on the floor next.  And perhaps this has to do with his shorter amount of screentime relative to the rest of the characters, but it’s Feyd-Rautha who’s served the best by Dune: Part Two‘s script. Thematically, it’s not Feyd-Rautha’s ruthlessness that makes him captivating; no, it’s that he takes such tangible action in a world obsessed with destinies and messiahs, and unabashedly embodies the otherwise thinly-veiled, structurally heinous nature of the Great Houses and the Empire of the Known Universe, all while functionally inhabiting the headspace of a true freak of nature. Indeed, there’s perhaps no more nutritious cog in the Dune: Part Two machine than that of Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. In no way does Butler entirely carry the show, however; Timothée Chalamet’s marks his return to the role of protagonist Paul Atreides with a strikingly haunting energy befitting of such an intense inner and outer journey, and his fellow returnees Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson together boast an entire spectrum of incredible intensity across Chani and Lady Jessica, respectively. Florence Pugh, in the little time we see her as series newcomer Princess Irulan, stamps her impact on the film just as effectively. All four, however, are only given so much room in the script to truly reach the heights of their individual power; this makes the highs very high, but infrequent enough that some may be left wanting, especially as we mostly struggle to buy into the interpersonal chemistry and tension between these otherwise excellently-realized characters. When all is said and done, Dune: Part Two is sure to leave audiences determined to get another viewing in, for all the right reasons and a few of the wrong ones. The sheer technical achievement of the film is worthy of the utmost respect on its own, and the epic nature of its presentation, production, and storytelling will, on some level, guarantee willful captivation for just about anyone, to say nothing of the applause-worthy kineticism on display from its cast. Unfortunately, the scale just isn’t quite tipped enough in the other direction — that of typically less-verbose cinematic aspects like theme, plot, and sense of chemistry between the characters — to reach the level of uniquely soft cohesion that the film probably would have preferred, in order to complement the louder part of its personality. Another viewing, then, might see one head back to get gleefully swept away in Arrakis once more, or conversely, to dedicate themselves to the toil of parsing of the film’s thematic nuances — to what will likely be very, very limited success. Be that as it may, the two sides of this aforementioned personality still get along more than well enough to make Dune: Part Two the second sure victory in Villeneuve’s film series, and I’m sure number three is right around the corner."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL," Dune: Part Two is an improvement over Part One, a maximalist sci-fi epic with an impressive sense of scale. Director Denis Villeneuve uses his vast setting, the desert planet of Arrakis, to show the miniscule size of humanity against giant machines and monsters. His sense of spectacle puts most special-effects blockbuster cinema to shame. That visual panache could also be found in Part One, so what’s new here? Unlike the 2021 film, which suffered from being an incomplete half a movie, there is a more of an arc to Part Two. It has a proper climax, and while the final minutes set up yet another film, Villeneuve and his co-screenwriter Jon Spaihts needn’t rely on the exposition and world-building that defined the first film. He trusts his audience to keep up. Even with all those positive changes, however, the improvement over Part One is modest. After the momentum of the first hour, there is a languid middle section where Villeneuve adds intrigue because the plot requires it, not because it interests him. Throughout Villeneuve’s career, the director has had a marked disinterest in humanity. He would rather explore heady ideas, letting his characters and actors serve as vessels for his grandiose themes. Part Two is like that, to the point where character pivots are sudden, and the actors fail to add a personal dimension to explorations of war and fanaticism. No matter the triumph or setback, each plot development and inflection point is as dry as the sands where film takes place. Set shortly after the events of Part One, we catch up on Paul (Timothée Chalamet), a Duke’s son who escapes annihilation and now ingratiates himself with the Fremen, the indigenous people of the desert planet. Paul wants revenge on the Empire, who he sees as responsible for the siege on Arrakis that took his father’s life, and his birthright. Most of Part Two follow his journey to overthrow the empire, a goal that can only be accomplished by becoming a warrior prophet to the eyes of the Fremen. Two people are instrumental to the propaganda campaign: Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who becomes a reluctant zealot, and the Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a true believer who thinks Paul will return lush greenery to Arrakis. This macro-scale manipulation does not sit well with Paul – or his Fremen lover Chani (Zendaya) – until it becomes the most convenient path forward. Chalamet’s performance is thankless, and to his credit, he does not shy from the dark implications of his character’s conduct. Once Paul drinks the proverbial Kool-Aid – in this case, a bright blue poison distilled from the bowels of baby sand worms – he thinks nothing of committing atrocities or betraying those closest to him. The script offers little sense of Paul’s interiority, so Chalamet accomplishes this transition through nonverbal acting, whether it’s how he steadies his gaze or loses his youthful exuberance. The trouble is in the journey, not the result. Villeneuve includes so many Fremen sieges on Arrakis, so many scenes of spectacle, that all the character development is sudden. Jessica abandons all her maternal instinct at the drop of a hat, while Chani’s affection for Paul is almost arbitrary (Zendaya and Chalamet do not have much physical chemistry – not that it would interest Villeneuve if they did). These character problems may seem minor, but they add up, especially when a film with a scope this massive needs something to ground it. What is spectacle, anyway, if not action without the emotional involvement of suspense? There are images in Part Two that viewers will never forget, like a grotesque, black-and-white tournament where the psychopath Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) slaughters people in a Romanesque colosseum, or when the Fremen ride sandworms into battle. The sound effects and music are also ear-piercingly loud, an auditory onslaught on thumping bass that adds to an overwhelming sensory overload. As breathtaking and pulverizing as the technical qualities may be, they lose their meaning without a meatier connection. To use a simple counterexample, Star Wars connects with legions of fans because – between the space opera with laser swords – there is space (pun intended) for the viewer to care about the characters as individuals, rather than hollow metaphors. It barely registers when Paul gets his revenge, and Villeneuve does not seem to have the wherewithal to understand that empty feeling should be at least partially intentional. In recent comments, Villeneuve has discussed his distaste for movie dialogue. The sentiment makes sense on one level, as the most memorable moments in Dune: Part Two are callbacks to silent filmmakers like D.W. Griffiths and Leni Riefenstahl (there is a touch of Triumph of the Will to how the film depicts fascistic ritual and rallies on the planet of Paul’s enemy). At the same time, Villeneuve’s statement is ironic, since his best film, Arrival, is dialogue-driven, and is quite literally about the need for communication to push humanity forward. The sensibility of “image over dialogue” is the greatest strength to Part Two, and its greatest weakness. In an era where many special effects are muddled computer-generated slop, Villeneuve practically stands alone as a Hollywood director with genuine specificity of vision, and the capital to achieve it. What also defines that same era is a failure to create any meaningful, lingering emotion – except perhaps for the joy of fan-service recognition – and in that sense, our most visionary genre director is also too typical of what passes for ordinary."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," DUNE: PART TWO. With Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin. Written by Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some suggestive material and brief strong language. 166 min. In theaters. DUNE: PART TWO instantly goes on the very short list of sequels that equal or surpass their originals. Indeed, combined with its 2021 “Part One,” it becomes the most significant cinematic epic of the modern era. Think of it as “Lawrence Of Arabia In Space.” When we last left Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), his family had been assassinated by House Harkonnen with the approval of the Emperor (Christopher Walken). Only Paul and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) have survived, seeking refuge among the nomadic Fremen of the desert planet Arrakis. There are two intertwined stories that play out. One is the coming battle against the Harkonnens who want Arrakis because it is the planet that produces the powerful “spice” that makes all space travel possible. The various weapons involved range from swords to missiles, but whomever is fighting with whatever, the battle scenes fill the screen with excitement. Clocking in at nearly three hours, there doesn’t seem to be a wasted moment. The other story is just as important, and that is the transformation of Paul from the well-meaning young son of a noble family to a military and political leader who can inspire the skeptical Fremen, who view him as an outsider. Among the Fremen he has the support of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and develops an intimate relationship with Chani (Zendaya) but will have much to do in order to prove himself worthy. It’s this combination of the epic and the personal that makes the film work. There are a variety of agendas at play, and there are surprising revelations as the hidden hand of the all-women order of the Bene Gesserit comes into play. Director/co-writer Denis Villeneuve is again helped by having a solid story to work with, based on the classic novel by Frank Herbert. So when Harkonnen son Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) has to prove himself in a death match in a huge arena, Villeneuve is able to indulge in the visual spectacle because it’s also integral to the plot. Chalamet takes us on Paul’s journey to manhood and leadership, so that when he stands up to the great powers in the final act, he’s earned it. Zendaya provides a strong contrast as Paul’s lover – and a fighter in her own right – who becomes increasingly concerned as to what he’s turning into. The large cast also includes Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård, and Charlotte Rampling. All get their moments, but it is Pugh who seems to have a key role ahead. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books. His latest book is a film criticism parody, Can Your Heart Stand the Shocking Facts? exploring “Plan 9 From Outer Space.” He is the 2018 recipient of the Skylark Award given by the New England Science Fiction Association.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Digging up the sandworms on the desert planet of Arrakis and continuing the saga of Timothée Chalamet’s prophet in the making, Paul Atreides, “Dune: Part Two” see’s filmmaker Denis Villeneuve stunningly best his 2021 entry at every spice-dusted turn. Based on the sprawling, dense, and expansive Frank Herbet novels that challenge both “Lord of the Rings” and “Game of Thrones” in terms of depth, “Dune: Part Two” rectifies most of the issues “Part One” suffered from. The pace is more steady, the stakes have been considerably raised, and the exploration of this sweeping universe yields some jaw-dropping discoveries. It also has the added benefit of a maniacal Austin Butler performance who stands among one of the best on screen baddies in recent memory.  Instead, Villenevue has crafted this generation's version of “The Lord of the Rings,” or, in some respects, “Star Wars.” He steers the ship with immaculate detail, right down to the gargantuan sized sandworms the characters ride as if they were horses in a western. He was methodical and concise in “Part One,” but that laid the pathway for where “Part Two” eventually lands and it never disappoints. The film is outfitted with a stunning visual palette, incredible special effects, and a deeper thematic examination of the bridges between colonialism and religion.  “Part One” did a solid job getting its beak wet in the desert planet of Arrakis, or better known as planet Dune. Just as young Paul (Chalamet) was on the path towards his birthright as leader of the Atreides house, an attack was executed by the sniveling Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his massive army. Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the shady sisterhood known as the Bene Gesserit, barely made it out alive and are now living and fighting alongside the Indigenous Freman population, which includes Chani (Zendaya) a woman who Paul has seen in several of his visions.  Everyone thinks Paul is the messiah they’ve been reading about for centuries, though conflicting parties suggest otherwise and that’s the driving force behind “Part Two.” Freman leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem), with the help of Chani, teaches Paul the ways of being one of them. From corralling sandworms to surviving in harsh desert conditions, slowly he begins exhibiting signs of his destiny, but there are others who question if he is the chosen one. His ascension brings forth new challengers, including the sadistic nephew of the Baron, Feyd-Rautha (Butler) who is appointed as the governor of Arrakis.  There are bigger games at play and ulterior motives hurled behind closed doors as Paul and Feyd-Rautha battle for ultimate supremacy of ruling the universe. While we did get our fair share of political gambits in “Part One,” it becomes the most gripping aspect of “Part Two” and Villeneuve manages to seamlessly interweave new characters into the mix without overwhelming an already long 165 minute runtime. There’s Christopher Walken hamming it up as the aging Emperor, Florence Pugh is lively playing his daughter Princess Irulan, and Leo Seydoux’ stars as Lady Margot, a member of the Bene Gesserit.  Villenevue doesn’t mince words when getting into the trenches of up-close blade fights (one of them executed in pristine black-and-white) and gorgeous space battles. The Canadian-born filmmaker lets the images linger and keeps us invested by delivering a story that’s fleshed out. Chalamet understands Paul as a conflicted leader who is caught between two worlds, and the actor’s chemistry with Zendaya keeps things grounded as he contends with fate and an evil governor who will stop at nothing until his head is on a pike. The lore and mythology of the novels notwithstanding, we’ve seen how “Dune” can be handled in the wrong hands or with studio meddling. It’s a bold risk for any company to fork over large sums of cash on a franchise that’s far from a sure thing. And it’s a refreshing change of pace in a year that’s been riddled with mediocre content that a bold, visual interpretation of a sci-fi novel with sandworms stands tall. I always worried that whenever a major series ended (or gave the illusion they were ending) ala “The Matrix,” “Harry Potter,” or the aforementioned “Lord of the Rings” films, that we might never see a comparable franchise. With this second installment, “Dune” has now etched its place next to those films in the throes of cinematic history. "
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,I wish this film had grabbed my head and heart more&#46; But I recommend that you see it &#8211; preferably in Imax &#8211; and let the visuals and the entrancing score by Hans Zimmer wash over you&#46;
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Following the destruction of House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are taken in by the the desert Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a believer in the prophecies the Bene Gesserit have seeded upon the planet Arrakis. The Harkonnen still search for anyone who might have escaped the massacre while resuming spice harvesting for the empire. The Fremen have not-so inexplicably become more capable of interrupting the harvest, earning the ire of the Baron (Stellan Skårsgard) and the concern of the Emperor (Christopher Walken). Trained and encouraged by Chani (Zendaya) while trying to outmaneuver his mother’s wishes, Paul gains skills and earns leadership among the Fremen to seek something his father would never contemplate: revenge. Director Denis Villeneuve unleashes the slightly delayed follow-up to his vision of Frank Herbert’s saga, promising a third installment in the near future. Part Two is upon us, introducing new characters and expanding the sweeping narrative established in the first film. For those who remember or have seen the 1984 David Lynch film, Part Two appears to build toward an end matching up with the duel against Feyd Rautha, previously played by Sting and now reimagined with Austin Butler in the archrival role. Part One felt as big as the universe while only touching on tiny corners of it, so it’s expected the sequel will not only meet that expectation but push beyond it while setting up the end of the proposed trilogy. Fans of the original novels may be less enthusiastic knowing how the later books end up, but the more limited scope of these films might redeem some of those later missteps by simply stopping at a better point… but is something missing? Viewers made comparisons to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers following early showings, and while there’s some truth to that, Dune: Part Two goes further, confronting kismet and karma head-on. If the path forward is inevitable, even one dictated and planted by false prophets, is choosing one’s destiny or avoiding it what brings it to fruition? Embracing the core elements of the fable “Appointment in Samarra,” the part of Death is played by Paul Atreides himself, making it clear why Chalamet is more than just this generation’s Willy Wonka, evolving from the son of an assassinated duke into a force of nature. When the dust settles and the bodies are counted, there’s no longer a question of whether Paul can be stopped… but whether he can stop himself. Possibly done for time or maybe to hold back for the inevitable Part Three, there are notable absences, especially for fans of the original novels and 1984 film. Jessica never has to defeat Stilgar to prove her worth to him; the weirding ways taught to the Fremen and the need to create modules to channel them are nowhere to be found. While the director made claims of going “by the book,” the details of the current incarnation of Dune has been boiled down to statecraft, religion, and court politics with a hint of romance. With no signs of the Spacing Guild driving home the importance of spice or much representation of the all-important Mentat, it can’t help feel like when Star Wars tried to reduce the Force to midichlorians, choosing hard science fiction over fantastic and beloved story elements. Oppenheimer can go right on bragging about their practical special effects; in an age where three seasons of “The Mandalorian” television rivals most visuals of the Star Wars films, this Dune sequel fills every inch of IMAX screens with believable spectacle on a nigh impossible scale. At the same time, the personal stories and rivalries giving meaning to all the digital destruction are portrayed by an incredible cast. The edit wastes no time on minutiae, making 166 minutes go by as if it were half as long. This isn’t Peter Jackson’s King Kong where it’s practically identical to the original but bigger; while Lynch’s compressed version of Dune had its charms, Villeneuve’s vision takes as much time as it needs to work and keeps the fat trimmed, but it would have been nice to embrace more of the unique trappings of the novels. It’s no secret Herbert’s inspiration for the Fremen was rooted in Arabic culture, but Hollywood continues to play it safe describing Paul’s “holy war” as anything but the novel’s very specific  jihad, a word historically demonized over the more odious term “crusade.” Roughly set 20,000 years in the future, the author was quoted that his idea was to share what was carried with humanity out into the universe. While it’s all well and good to wish Paul Muad‘Dib Atreides a fulfilling retribution, the true test for both the character and his director is what yet lies ahead: sticking the landing. Dune: Part Two is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some suggestive material, brief strong language, and doing it simply and directly — nothing fancy."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The world is a confusing place right now. We believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs. Do you believe that too? Help TGC bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work. The emergence of a “messiah” figure is a common trope in sci-fi, fantasy, and superhero narratives. Whether Harry Potter, Aragorn, Neo, Luke Skywalker, or any number of superheroes, the messianic hero usually rises to prominence in a period of war or oppression—often fulfilling prophecies along the way—to address injustice and defeat an evil regime. It shouldn’t be surprising that audiences find messianic narratives irresistible. They’re downstream from the Greatest Story of Jesus Christ—what Tolkien called the “true myth.” Frank Herbert’s Dune novels are a prime example of the messianic narrative (the second novel of the series is titled Dune Messiah), and they’re rife with religious themes that draw from Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. This is vividly apparent in the new Dune films from director Denis Villeneuve, one of today’s most thoughtful and gifted filmmakers. Villeneuve’s follow-up to 2021’s Dune is a messiah story of incomparable cinematic scale. Dune: Part Two’s family drama is Godfatheresque, its ruling-class politics Shakespearean in scope. The world-building detail is unparalleled. The immersive experience of sight (has blockbuster cinematography ever looked so gorgeous?), sound (Hans Zimmer!), and sandworms is utterly epic—especially on an IMAX screen. There are several moments of cacophonous triumph that left me awestruck. Dune Two is among the most impressive sequels I’ve seen. Yet this isn’t a rousing, feel-good messiah story. And as much as the film pulled me into its world and gave me a bravura moviegoing experience, I left the theater ready to exit that world—and especially grateful that this messiah story isn’t the messiah story. The sequel’s narrative focal point is simple enough: the messianic rise of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Heir of House Atreides (which has Davidic overtones), Paul comes of age among the Fremen people on the desert planet Arrakis, a sort of “holy land” of immense strategic importance, frequently invaded or occupied by this or that regime. There are clear echoes of the imperial-occupied Holy Land where Jesus’s messianic rise took place. And the biblical parallels don’t end there. Paul is a humble and reluctant messiah, at least at first. And like Jesus, he dignifies the marginalized, including women, in stark contrast to the male-centered imperial culture of the day (especially the misogynistic, gladiatorial men of House Harkonnen who evoke pagan Rome). We see echoes of Jesus’s testing in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1–11) when Paul goes through a time of preparation in the sandy wilderness of Arrakis. He later has a “death and resurrection” moment that cements his messianic status. And when a religion starts to form around Paul—who the Fremen come to see as the long-prophesied Lisan al Gaib (or off-world prophet)—imperial leaders take notice and ponder how to deal with this problematic source of regional instability. Far from a self-denying savior, Paul becomes increasingly motivated by fleshly desires and tempted by world-conquering ambition. He takes a lover, for example—the Arrakis warrior Chani (Zendaya). And his treatment of her throughout the film deteriorates. In a moment that nods to the Genesis 3 temptation of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Paul drinks the “Water of Life,” a poisonous blue liquid that—if it doesn’t kill you—purportedly gives you superhuman knowledge. “You’ll see the beauty and the horror,” his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), tells him after she partook of the drink herself. In more stark contrasts, Paul embraces militancy and revenge. He seeks greater power. The oppressed Freman people want a conquering militant messiah, and Paul gives them what they want. Many of Christ’s Jewish disciples also expected and desired a conquering militant messiah. But Christ was a nonviolent servant king, who gave his life as a ransom for many (Matt. 20:20–28) and declared his kingdom “is not of this world” (John 18:36). While watching the final act of Dune Two, part of me delighted to see Paul lead the Arrakis Revolt against the evil imperial forces, culminating in the deaths of top Harkonnen baddies, the submission of Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken), and Paul’s consolidation of power. But Villeneuve wants us to feel conflicted watching it, and I certainly did. Paul hasn’t turned out to be the unstained, virtuous messiah we instinctively desire. The look on Chani’s face in the film’s final shot is a proxy for many in the audience—and indeed, many in our secular age who resent institutional religion. She feels betrayed and manipulated. She never bought into the “Paul as messiah” narrative, but she’s mad so many of her people did. Above all, she’s mad Paul himself did. Dune Two feels like an artifact of a post-Christian age, and Chani represents religious skepticism (in contrast to Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, who represents sincere-if-naive belief). Chani gives voice to the questions and doubts of a growing number of “nones” who see religious faith as a feel-good smoke screen for nefarious power grabs. The film portrays Chani as a more “progressive” denizen of Northern Arrakis, in contrast to the “Southern fundamentalists” who are all too eager to acknowledge Paul as messiah and fight for him in a holy war. Chani sees how religious narratives can serve the interests of those in power by reinforcing hierarchies and encoding behaviors in the name of faithful devotion. Certainly, given the track record of so many power-hungry and abusive religious leaders in history, some of the skepticism Dune Two raises is warranted. Chani’s nemeses are the Bene Gesserit, a mysterious magisterium of women who perpetuate narratives, manipulate bloodlines, and make “plans within plans” to move chess pieces around the table, always to their advantage. “We don’t hope,” says one Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. “We plan.” This cynical admission is all the more damning because “hope” is exactly what they sell to the masses. The Bene Gesserit epitomize religious hypocrisy: pushing a narrative that benefits them, even if they don’t believe it themselves. This outwardly pious order of “sisters” has clear Catholic overtones, and in the Dune universe, they’re arguably the most sinister villains. They perpetuate prophecies concerning the “Kwisatz Haderach”—a superhuman they hope to breed into existence, thus giving them an ever-tighter grip on power. In the name of doing humanity a service, the Bene Gesserit are wielding religion for colonialist aims. As Chani says, “This prophecy is how they enslave us.” As much as Dune Two plays with religious archetypes and the universal appeal of “messiah” narratives, it adopts a decidedly skeptical posture toward the religious enterprise. Is the messiah narrative of Christ—indeed, the entire New Testament—merely propaganda to inflame religious fervor and consolidate power among religious leaders? Are the writings of the apostle Paul, like the machinations of Paul Atreides, less the product of divine orchestration than of fleshly opportunism? Christians might have good answers to these contemporary questions, but we should know they’re in the background of a film like Dune Two, because they’re on the minds of a growing number of people. Dune Two’s skepticism of religion is nothing new. It’s the familiar Marxist critique that religion is a means of social control, a narrative apparatus used by the hegemony to entrench its authority and subdue the restless masses (“the opium of the people”). But the critique gets a post-Christian, contemporary spin. Because at least in Villeneuve’s rendering of Dune’s world, the beauty and transcendental power of religious tropes are on sincere display. There’s a conflicted, almost contradictory posture here. It recognizes—even relishes—the beauty, mystery, and galvanizing hope of faith in a supernatural messiah. But it also sees behind the curtain, recognizing—and rejecting—the power structures harnessing religion for power-seeking ends. This is why I call Dune Two a “post-Christian artifact.” It captures something of what I’ve called the “push and pull of post-Christian culture”—the simultaneous attraction and revulsion of faith, the desire to retain religious aesthetics and some habits while discarding religious systems of authority. I’m not sure if Villeneuve has a Christian faith. Having grown up in Quebec, the French-Canadian filmmaker was likely influenced by Catholicism to some degree. Certainly, theological ideas are often front and center in his films, particularly Prisoners (2013) and Arrival (2013). Dune Two reveals the director engaging faith more directly than ever. It’s interesting that, similar to the pro-life bent of Arrival, a significant character in Dune Two is an unborn baby who spends the film in her mother’s womb. In a culture that often refuses to grant personhood to preborn babies, it’s refreshing to see a movie so directly depict the humanity of a child in the womb. Still, whatever interest Villeneuve has in Christianity is clearly conflicted, as the Dune saga leads audiences to question “messiah” mythologies and be wary of religious narrative gatekeepers. Christians can find an opportunity in this film. Widespread longing for a true, good, and beautiful messiah is real. This is a starting place for evangelism in a post-Christian age. But warranted skepticism about manipulative messiahs and hypocritical religious leaders is also real. And so the opportunity comes with a challenge: to model a Christianity that doesn’t feel phony or suspicious. How do we do this? By focusing always on Christ’s glory and his kingdom rather than our own. If we go down the Paul Atreides path, falling in line with worldly patterns of power and glory, the Chani-type responses will grow. But if we instead model a countercultural kingdom, decreasing so Christ might increase (John 3:30), then the “true myth” of Messiah Jesus will be harder to ignore.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," When it was announced back in 2020 that director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) was tackling the project of bringing the novels of Frank Herbert’s Dune odyssey to the big screen science fiction fans right across the world waited with baited breath. Herbert’s work is considered a masterpiece within the sci-fi realm and previous attempts to adapt it for the screen had, in the eyes of hardcore fans, failed. But then, after some mild Covid interruptions, in 2021 Villeneuve’s first Dune film landed in cinemas and the verdict was that not only had Villeneuve down the unthinkable and made a watchable Dune movie he too had now delivered something that also deserved the masterpiece tag. Not surprisingly the studio behind the film quickly signed contracts to see Villeneuve and his cast continue the odyssey with Dune: Part Two, but then came another nagging feeling for fans – what if Villeneuve could not capture the brilliance of the first film for Part Two. Well if that has been your worry than you can be re-assured because Dune: Part Two is sensational and lifts this sci-fi franchise into the rare air normally reserved for the original Star Wars trilogy. Dune: Part Two begins with Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet – Wonka) trying to fit into life with the Fremen people with mixed results. On one hand the warrior, Stilgar (Javier Bardem – Skyfall), believes that Paul is the foretold Messiah although Chani (Zendaya – Spider-Man: Far From Home) and her friends believe that is just an old wive’s tale. Her friends don’t even believe that Paul should be allowed to stay with them. However the spiritually gifted Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson – The Greatest Showman) is pushing the idea with the religiously minded Fremen that Paul is the Messiah while Chani is battling her romantic feelings for Paul. Meanwhile, the Emperor (Christopher Walken – Catch Me If You Can), is trying to hide the fact from the rest of the universe that he is responsible for the genocide of the Atreides family, while Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard – Good Will Hunting) is frustrated that Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista – Guardians of The Galaxy) is making no headway in getting rid of the Fremen people so has turned to Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler – Elvis) to take on the deadly mission. As you can probably tell from that plot description the story here is pretty in-depth but somehow Villenvue and fellow screenwriter Jon Spaihts (Prommetheus) manage to bring it to the screen so that it is completely understandable and surprisingly easy to follow. The way the story plays out on the script makes it feel like a cross between Game of Thrones and Star Wars and that mix seems to work amazingly well. What sets the Dune franchise aside from other films in its genre though is that Villenvue and his cinematographer, Greig Fraser (The Batman), are willing to take some pretty big risks with the way the film is presented. In the first film we saw their decision to portray the Fremen’s planet in a near washed-out yellow haze for most shots and this time around they take that even further making the scenes set on Feyd-Rautha’s planet almost black and white. While it may not seem like much it is one of the reasons why when you watch the film the audience feels like they have transported to these planets and they’re part of the action. There are very few films that are such an immersive experience for their audience as these two Dune films are. When you add that to the fact that Villenvue is a talented enough filmmaker to be able to get every ounce of suspense out of a scene whether it features an epic battle or two characters having an important emotionally filled discussion and you start to realise what a talented storyteller he really is. More of that genius is also on show when it is revealed that he is not frightened to time jump with the script – characters will be talking about doing an event and then the film will jump to after the event and somehow he manages to do it in such a way that the audience don’t feel like they have been ripped off by not seeing it play out on the screen. The other key to Dune: Part Two working so well is the perfect casting that this franchise has. Timothee Chalamet was born to play Paul Atreides and his range of acting easily allows him to pull off the films more dramatic dialogue scenes just as well as his action sequences. At one point he yells at Jessica to make a point and such is the power of his performance and voice it made every person in the cinema jump. He is also surrounded by actors and actresses who pull off brilliant portrayals of Herbert’s characters. Javier Bardem and Zendaya are brilliant this time around while Austin Butler takes his acting to a whole new level in his unrecognisable performance as this film’s major villain. Then there are the likes of Florence Pugh (Lady Macbeth) and Charlotte Rampling (Melancholia) who may have smaller roles this time around but still bring their A-Game to the screen every time they appear. Dune: Part Two not only continues the brilliance of the first film but is a film that certainly sets a new bar for just how good sci-fi films should be. With stunning visuals, an engaging story and a cast at their very best this is a film that even the most critical film goers will want to watch over and over. Dune: Part Two is truly a masterful piece of work. The Fremen who live on the desert planet Arrakis may be sceptical at first, but Paul puts paid to their misgivings with acts of bravery. Director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve’s mastery of his craft is magnificent to watch and the big names in the cast are up for all the action and subterfuge in the plotting. I recall saying this after the first instalment, but it is well worth repeating. If you are lucky enough to have the chance to see Dune: Part Two at IMAX, please do. It is genuinely an immersive experience. In short, it is the best way to see the film.  Regardless, I would urge you to view it on the biggest screen possible, with the greatest sound quality. Dune: Part Two is even better than Part One. I wish I could see Part Three tomorrow."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," I won’t be the first or last person to say DUNE: PART TWO joins the pantheon of elite movie sequels, right there with STAR WARS: RETURN OF THE JEDI, THE DARK KNIGHT, ALIENS… you get my drift. Throughout the film, I caught myself looking at my watch, not because I was bored and wanted to see how much time was left, but quite the opposite; I was dreading the film ending. Writer/director Denis Villeneuve provides the best cinematic experience I have had in a long time, from the stunning visuals that seamlessly combine CGI and practical sets, to the edge-of-your-seat action, and of course the masterful performances from an all-star caliber cast. DUNE: PART TWO is going to be talked about for decades to come and is a powerful reminder that the theatrical experience is the best way to experience films, especially ones as beautifully shot as this. Picking up soon after DUNE ended, the House of Atreides has fallen at the hands of the Harkonnen, who have reclaimed the lucrative spice production on Arrakis. The emperor (Christopher Walken) is alerted to this shift in the balance of power. However, his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), suspects the Atreides heir may still be alive. Back on Arrakis, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who narrowly escaped their own deaths, are attempting to ingratiate themselves to the local Fremen. Some of the Fremen believe Paul and Jessica are spies, while others, particularly Stilgar (Javier Bardem), believe Paul is a leader foretold in their prophecies. Over time, Paul begins to fall for Chani (Zendaya), who helps him better understand the language and local customs, including riding sand worms. There are no weak moments or performances in the film. But Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler are the true standouts, with the latter being a more showy villain role and the former having a measured intensity that jumps off the screen. Butler’s arc as the sinister Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is a showcase that actors dream about. The fact that he went from charismatic crooner Elvis Presley to a dark-souled villain like Feyd-Rautha in the matter of a year is one for the ages. Ferguson, on the other hand, is more restrained; you never know exactly what her character is going to do next. With her new power as a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, can she be completely trusted? Something maniacal is lingering under the surface, with Ferguson’s blue-tinted eyes threatening to pierce through your soul and decimate anything in her path. Chalamet does an incredible job fully coming into his own as Paul Atreides. It’s amazing how much epic-level character development is fit over the two DUNE films, but by the closing scene, Paul is a completely different person than he was when we first met him, and that is a testament to Villaneuve’s script and Chalemet’s multi-layered performance. I also loved that the script enabled Paul and Chani’s relationship to come to the forefront without getting bogged down in melodrama. Apart, they are strong, independent, ambitious warriors. Together, they are the beating heart of the film.  You will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not see DUNE: PART TWO in the biggest, loudest theater you can. Shot in part with IMAX cameras, the film is best experienced in true IMAX, but because there are so few theaters that are able to screen the film in 70mm, a local IMAX or Dolby theater will still do the trick. I saw it at a Dolby theater and could literally feel the reverberations of the thumper, as well as Hans Zimmer’s score rippling through the theater. And honestly, you are going to want to be in a loud theater so your fellow audience member’s oooohhhs and aaahhhhsss will be drowned out by the incredible sound. This is not a movie you should wait to watch at home. It is one you should fully take advantage of and see several times in theaters to revel in a perfect cinematic experience. I imagine this film will have staying power and you will be excited to brag to your kids/grandkids that you were at the opening weekend of DUNE: PART TWO!"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two commences mere hours after the events of the first film where we follow the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), the former Duke of House Atreides. He has united with the Fremen people after his people (including his family) were destroyed by the Harkonnen. Alongside his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), he vows to fight alongside the Fremen to bring down the Harkonnen and bring peace to the Fremen people. However, behind closed doors lies secrets, deceit, and fervour. There are secrets within the Atreides family bloodline, deceit that could change allegiances, and fervour for a higher power that could drastically forecast a future of impending doom. Adapting Frank Herbert’s imposing novel would be a mammoth task for any filmmaker. Yet thanks to the talents of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve and a jam-packed crew of riches in front of and behind the camera, the first film (which adapts the first half of the novel) was a financial and critical success. Dune: Part Two is not only one of the most anticipated sequels in recent years but one of the most anticipated blockbusters of 2024. Do Villeneuve and co. pull off what most sequels fail to do: improve on the original film? One of the flaws of the first film is that it spent large amounts of its runtime establishing the world the story entails. It left audiences examining and mulling over swathes of details to understand the ambitious storytelling. Thankfully in the sequel, the worldbuilding is more relaxed and even keel. It leaves room for more character development as well as cinematic catharsis in terms of action and spectacle. Villeneuve follows through all the thematic set-ups from the prequel, including family bloodlines, messianic leanings involving Paul, broiling tensions through both opposing sides as well as in-house, romantic tensions, but with a more assured hand this time around. Unlike the first film, the exposition is delivered behaviourally and organically as opposed to just being delivered for the sake of the audience. Even with the dense exposition, Villeneuve delivers thematic power and character through action. It also helps that a lot of the world was established beforehand, allowing Villeneuve and crew to let loose with more action, cinematic panache, and character drama. The action is also stronger this time. With the massive-scale war battles and the smaller-scale, character-based intimate knife fights, they are all chaotic and emotionally rousing with all the effective goodwill behind them. A huge credit goes to the establishing of character stakes, even if the film abides by simple themes, such as there are no winners in the game of war as well as those who are not willing to utilise power are the most capable of wielding it. With hidden depths to uncover in terms of environments (through both Fremen and Harkonnen eyes) as well as characterisations (particularly through the burgeoning relationship between Paul and Chani), co-writer/director Denis Villeneuve, cinematographer Greig Fraser, and composer Hans Zimmer up the ante in terms of tension and pathos. With their immense contributions, they manage to convey the scope and especially the stakes of the storytelling; all whilst conveying the otherworldly feel that audiences found immersive in the first film. Huge praise should go to the ensemble cast of rising stars, acting veterans, and Villeneuve regulars. The supporting cast of film newcomers, including Christopher Walken (who takes the expression “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” with remarkable ease), Lea Seydoux (knowingly and subtly seductive), Florence Pugh (displays intelligence and sympathy with shades of grey), Austin Butler (wildly psychotic and sadistic, with a great resemblance to Skarsgard) and Souheila Yacoub (amusingly roguish) all make a great impression. While the cast reprisals of Rebecca Ferguson (once the emotional anchor, now the wild card game-changer), Javier Bardem (the grizzled commander, now the immovable zealot), Josh Brolin (whose shell of unapologetic hatred hides shades of loyalty), Charlotte Rampling (whose permanent scowl hides any shade of humanity), Stellan Skarsgard (gluttonous and literally slimy) and Dave Bautista (desperate for validation and making a mark within the Harkonnen legacy) step up a notch with their roles that escalate the stakes to new heights. However, the emotional core is ironclad thanks to its leads. Only being an extended cameo at best, Zendaya steps up to the task of Chani with much-needed heart and conviction. Her voice of reasoning, warmth, strength, and understated chemistry with Chalamet lends a strong emotional core to the film that makes the drama effective. The relationship also strengthens and motivates the arc that Paul undergoes as he desperately tries to avoid his path to becoming a messianic figure. As the lead character, Chalamet carries the film with an amazing presence, effective nuance, ample charisma, and a vivid portrayal of a man who carries a huge burden, governed by his inner conflict concerning revenge and a righteous resolve for the good of all people. Overall, Dune: Part Two delivers mightily on the promises set in the first film with bountiful aplomb. With a more massive scope, more satisfying payoffs, richer characterisations and more confident performances, it sets an incredibly high bar not only for blockbusters in 2024, but for sequels in this century. Highly recommended. Summary: Dune: Part Two delivers mightily on the promises set in the first film with bountiful aplomb. It sets an incredibly high bar not only for blockbusters in 2024, but for sequels in this century."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," As is often the case with origin stories, there’s a great deal of world building and character establishment that has to play out before we can even get to the actual plot. Such was the case with filmmaker Denis Villeneuve’s first chapter of what is apparently going to be a Dune trilogy, and the result was a movie vast in scope but a little slow in pacing. To my recollection, the film didn’t really kick in until the story re-located to the harsh desert planet of Arrakis, and Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joined up with the local people called Fremen and began plotting revenge on those who destroyed the rest of his family. And that all happens damn near at the end of Dune: Part One. Now that Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) is done building his universe (or more precisely, bringing to life the Frank Herbert novel, Dune, along with co-screenwriter Jon Spaihts), we can get to the good stuff. What results is Dune: Part Two, a sweeping, emotionally driven and sometimes disturbing epic science-fiction tale that has everything from beautifully realized action set pieces to a messiah story that takes a turn some might not expect. The villains are more interesting (both the ones we already know and the new one introduced in this chapter), and there is a handful of characters whose allegiances we still aren’t quite clear on, which makes them well worth keeping an eye on. Back are Fremen characters like Paul’s guide and love interest Chani (Zendaya) and the leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who turns out to be something of a religious zealot and believes Paul is the Fremen's spiritual leader. Others—like Chani—don’t believe in messiahs and feel that any leader of the Fremen should be one of their own, which Paul tends to agree with. We also get the return of Paul’s mentor, Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck, who survived the wars of the first film and has been something of a spice smuggler since, hiding in the desert with other outcasts. He’s not only thrilled Paul is alive, but sees his ascension as a means to put the Atreides family back in power. Meanwhile, mother Jessica flexes her witchy upbringing and becomes the Fremen’s reverend mother after drinking a poison that only certain women can survive ingesting; any man drinking it will die instantly, or so we’re told. Jessica is also pregnant and is able to communicate with her unborn daughter in an advisory capacity, guidance that influences much of the film's direction.  As for the villains, we see the return of Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Harkonnen, head of the House Harkonnen and architect of the destruction of House Atreides, and his primary henchman and nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista). Beast Rabban has been tasked by the Baron to clear Arrakis of the Fremen who are constantly destroying the spice harvesters that the Baron sends to Arrakis on behalf of the Emperor (Christopher Walken), who allowed the destruction of House Atreides in order to increase the spice business and keep Paul’s father from gaining any more power. Our introduction to the Emperor brings with it his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who is clearly a gifted leader and strategist despite also being used as a pawn by those currently in control. Perhaps the most interesting of the new characters is the Baron’s other nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), in easily the best work I’ve seen him do, playing an absolutely psychotic warrior who is brought in to replace Beast Rabban when he can’t get done the job of quelling the rebellion on Fremen. Since the film is rated PG-13, we only get hints of what this maniac is capable of, but it’s clear that his primary fetish is pain, both giving and receiving it. Many of the scenes in which Feyd-Rautha is shown battling people to the death are in black-and-white, as if seeing what he’s doing in color might be too shocking. The entire film builds to a showdown between him and Paul that is about as brutal and nasty as is possible in what is meant to be a family-friendly movie, and that makes it all the more believable and gripping. It's clear that the entirety of Dune: Part Two is a build toward something bigger. The scale of the battle scenes gets larger, and after teasing them in Part One, we get so many sand worm appearances in Part Two that audiences may get a bit blasé about them (insert your popcorn bucket joke here). But also, the emotions and stakes feel more impactful this time around. It’s clear that Paul and Chani are in love, but the universe (and his mother) have bigger plans for Paul, and as much as he resists the call for him to become a religious leader to the Fremen, circumstances may leave him no other choice. Still, his transformation is not a gentle, gradual one. When Paul turns, Chalamet shows us why he was chosen for this role, as he displays a fury of righteous indignation that I was not expecting. And Chani is not eager to simply stand in line with her fellow Fremen. I think for many, Dune: Part Two is the Dune movie they have been waiting for from Villeneuve. Splitting the films now makes sense in terms of telling this story properly and patiently, and this feels like the payoff for our patience. And the fact that things once again end on something of a cliffhanger only makes it more exciting that there’s seemingly more to come. At one point, Paul makes it clear that he sees his fate and the fate of the known universe as only a true prophet can. Here’s hoping Villeneuve has the same clear vision moving forward. It’s evident he worships this material, and I think he’s done something bordering on miraculous with this second chapter. Did you enjoy this post?

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," You have to marvel, as ""Dune: Part Two"" thunders across the teeming IMAX screen, at the way director Denis Villeneuve manages to keep the movie's many moving parts under control. Juggling an endless succession of vast sprawling crowds, insectoid airships and blazing aerial explosions, Villeneuve lets nothing escape his grasp — even the densely entangling story, which is a handful all on its own.  With ""Dune: Part Two"" — or ""D2,"" let's say — finally upon us, it's clear that Villeneuve's first swing at Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, the 2021 ""Dune,"" was the merest warmup. In that film, manipulating hypnotic geometries of light and shadow, the director patiently laid out his many plot elements — the contending great houses of Atreides and Harkonnen, the rebellious desert tribe of Fremen, and the planetary homeworlds of Caladan, Giedi Prime and Arrakis, the latter also known as Dune.  Herbert's story is a warning about the danger of placing power in the hands of a charismatic leader, and in ""D2"" we see Paul — borne aloft on a wave of Fremen adulation — beginning to drift into megalomania, downsizing his values to accommodate the possibility of a ruinous interstellar war. Chalamet gives a nicely shaded account of this character, playing him as a wispy idealist in the picture's early innings before morphing into a man of stony will as the story gathers power. His performance also gives Zendaya something substantial to play against — Chani's love for Paul, while real and deep, is slowly being corroded by his descent into political intrigues. The movie is still a grand romance — the two leads have real chemistry — but it has unusual emotional layers. Villeneuve has drawn top performances from his large cast, especially by Ferguson (who's pretty much never not excellent), Charlotte Rampling (returning as the spectral Reverend Mother Mohiam, a Bene Gesserit hardliner), and Dave Bautista (back again as the Baron's sadistic nephew, Beast Rabban). The standout, however, is Austin Butler, who brings a loathsome, serpentine spirit to the role of the psychotic Feyd-Rautha (a part played by Sting in the 1984 David Lynch version of ""Dune""). With his shaved head, black-washed mouth and eyes sunk deep beneath a ridge of browless bone, Butler fully projects the unsettling lunacy of a man who enjoys reaching out and killing anyone who might be at hand, for no reason whatsoever. Butler has two great scenes — one a tightly choreographed knife fight with Chalamet, the other a stunningly designed gladiatorial contest in an enormous arena (a monument to digital production). But this is a movie with no shortage of painstakingly conceived scenes and images. The sight of Fremen soldiers siphoning off precious water from battlefield corpses. An eerie shot of Ferguson surrounded by a clump of black-robed Bene Gesserit crones with glowing blue eyes (an effect of spice ingestion). A ride atop a giant sandworm that's not totally ridiculous. And, at one point, a closeup of a dead man's ear crawling with ants (an image from Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" — Villeneuve has acknowledged his mixed feelings about Lynch's ""Dune,"" but expressed only the highest regard for the director himself)."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," They say that the spice of Arrakis is highly addictive. Prolonged exposure to the famed melange of planet Dune reportedly heightens the senses. One can therefore assume that after spending so much time swirling in the sands of Dune and basking in the essence of Frank Herbert’s popular sci-fi world, Denis Villeneuve and company are regular spice fiends. So too is anyone, really, who’s committed themselves to being immersed in this world. Dune is a drug, but it has never delivered a high quite like it does in Part Two. This epic follow-up to Villeneuve’s 2021 Dune adventure offers bigscreen blockbuster entertainment of the highest order. Everything is bigger and better in this follow-up. Villeneuve and his team know that the stakes and expectations are high after the first Dune won six Oscars and raked in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office. But Dune: Part Two offers a rare case in which a sequel does more than flex its muscles. Yes, the action scenes are bigger and the set pieces are bolder. But alongside the beefed-up entertainment value are some of the best characters and political subtext of recent genre films. This exhilarating adventure probably benefits from the longer production that saw Villeneuve and company return to set on the heels of the first film’s success. Rather continue as films shot together economically, Dune: Part Two is richer for the time with which everyone has immersed themselves in the spice of life. If side effects of the spice include greater vitality and a longer lifespan, may it be a step towards another cinematic universe. Dune-heads will rejoice, but cinephiles looking for a gateway drug might best take another hit of the first Dune before visiting Part Two. The second instalment picks up immediately where the predecessor left off. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have made safe passage with the Fremen, the people of the desert. Moreover, the Fremen, or most of them, believe Paul to be their saviour. After earning their respect in combat, they see Paul as their saviour. Fremen leader Stilgar (a fun Javier Bardem) especially interprets all of Paul’s actions through a prophetic lens. Yet the sandstorms continue to brew on Arrakis as the Fremen thwart the spice production. They seek to weaken the supply, the Harkonnen who guard it, and the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) who derives power from the harvest. Dune: Part Two is just as dense the second time around, but there’s a cadence to all the newfangled lingo that seems less alien than it did the first time. The adaptation by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts dispenses with any exposition, though, without missing a beat. Much of the clarity comes through the performances as they actors seem more comfortable in their characters’ skins. Despite the escalating war, the young Atreides resists playing the Messiah. He evades Stilgar’s premonitions. He sides with his Fremen ally, Chani (Zendaya), with whom he’s clearly falling in love. Neither Paul nor Chani think it’s best for one person to lead them all. Paul’s visions, moreover, foretell of a giant slaughter if he leads the Fremen into war. The thrill of Dune frequently resides in the challenges that Paul endeavours to prove his worth, while resisting the temptations that leadership entails. If spice is a drug, then power is the most potent of narcotics as Paul, like his mother, grows darker as his comfort leading the crowds evolve. As he adopts a new name, Maud’Dib, to denote his Fremen leadership, he learns more truths about his family and his father’s death that motivate him to fight. Chalamet gives his best performance yet as the weary reluctant hero. The white saviour cloak Paul wears in the first Dune has blown away in the wind. Chalamet creates Paul as strong, yet hardened by his exposure to the sand. The anti-hero befits the billowing sand dunes, too. Paul finds his strength by taming the giant worms that guard the spice (another prophecy that makes Stilgar wide-eyed). Yet he also harnesses their power for hiding, lurking, and attacking unexpectedly. Ferguson, meanwhile, affords Dune an edge with this darker take on Jessica. Bewitched by powers of her own, and possessed by the Water of Life and the young child within her, she tests Paul’s fortitude and tempts his lust for power. Dune: Part Two gives Ferguson a robust character arc and she tackles the many shades that make Jessica a shape-shifting enigma that Paul must decode to understand his place among the warring houses. The houses bring new characters to the fold, including some of Herbert’s most iconic figures. Among the few faces is a perfectly cast Christopher Walken as the Emperor behind the downfall of the House of Atreides. Why fewer sci-fi movies have made use of Walken’s deadpan weirdness remains a mystery, but he brings the right balance of authority and aloofness to complement the film’s consideration of power. Stepping into the role of the Emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan is Florence Pugh, who also embraces the many dimensions that the adaptation affords a character whose voice is so essential to the Dune universe. Part Two also brings a worthy baddie in the Baron’s kin, Feyd-Rautha, an unnerving sociopathic killer. Elvis’s Austin Butler steps into the role—but, unfortunately, not the futuristic loin cloth that Sting rocked in the David Lynch Dune—and amplifies the Harkonnen’s psycho-sexual bloodlust. Like Chalamet, Butler straddles the duality of star and character actor extremely well. His presence leaves a strong impression, even making Dave Bautista’s beefy killer Beast seem cowardly by comparison. And while Zendaya appears briefly at the ending of the first installment, she proves herself a worthy co-star to Chalamet here. Her performance demands subtlety alongside showier work. The balanced ensemble affords more dimensions to the world-building that Dune: Part Two realizes so masterfully. The strength of the cast and the substance of the storytelling shows that Villeneuve hasn’t forgotten his roots while going bigger. Instead, he leans into what makes movies like Incendies, Polytechnique, and Arrival so intensely compelling. He understands that audiences need to be invested in the characters to go along for the ride. And what a ride it is. Grand set pieces are thrillingly and breathtakingly realized. The sheer scale of filmmaking here is extraordinary. Villeneuve and his team build a world from scratch and take audiences on a literal roller coaster ride through the sand dunes as Paul et al latch onto the worms and careen into battle. Every aspect of the impeccable standards set by the previous production—costumes, production design, sound, and score—all up their game here. Greig Fraser’s cinematography surpasses its Oscar-winning work of the original film and beautifully captures the eerie warmth generated by an eclipse to suggest a planet in limbo. So too does Dune simply exceed its standard as an adaptation. Often cited among the “unfilmable” novels, Dune the movie achieves a rare feat. It creates on screen images that Herbert can only describe in words and a world that readers can only loosely visualize. It’s an astonishingly complex world faultlessly realized in vivid detail. On the grand IMAX canvas, Villeneuve’s Dune remains faithful to Herbert’s vision, but it also makes the world wholly its own. What began with an unfilmable novel is now one of the best double bills ever made.

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," When we last saw Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides, his father’s empire was in ashes. The boy and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) had been left for dead on the desert planet of Arrakis following a bloody, intergalactic coup by the grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, issuing edicts from a bathtub full of black slime) at the behest of a shadowy, unseen emperor. But, as was foreseen by the psychically gifted Paul and his witchy space nun mom, the last survivors of House Atreides were rescued by the Fremen, an oppressed tribe indigenous to Arrakis whose elders have prophesized a messiah that sure looks and sounds a lot like our protagonist. Paul has been seeing visions of the young warrior woman Chani (Zendaya) in his dreams since he was a child. She’s the love of his life but also the key to a terrible destiny, one he’ll spend the rest of the movie trying desperately to avoid. Director Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 “Dune” was a grandly pulverizing spectacle picture, adapting the first half of author Frank Herbert’s 1965 eco-fable with bombastic brio. The sequel is even bigger and louder, answering a first film full of table-setting with one gargantuan set piece after another. “Dune: Part Two” is a massive movie, made to be seen on an enormous screen with the most immersive sound system you can find. I must admit that in the past, I’ve found Villeneuve films ponderous and over-inflated, so dour that they teeter on self-parody. (He’s the humorless technician Christopher Nolan is often wrongly accused of being.) But the Quebecois auteur’s stentorian sensibility is perfectly suited to the stakes of this particular space opera, and he’s one of the few Hollywood directors today who can conjure a truly awe-inspiring sense of scale. With rare exceptions, franchise filmmaking has become a drearily televisual affair; lots of medium shots of actors standing in front of greenscreens in Georgia warehouses. Filmed on gigantic sets built in locations around the world, these ”Dune” pictures look and feel like gosh darn *movies,* referencing famous shots from “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Apocalypse Now” not just as homages, but as aspirational markers. To Villeneuve, size does matter. Arrakis has been plundered for centuries by warring clans from other worlds fighting over a precious, psychotropic mineral called “spice” that facilitates space travel. The fantastic first hour of “Dune: Part Two” finds young Paul learning the ways of the Fremen, sabotaging Harkonnen’s spice mining efforts with heroic guerilla raids, explicitly coded as terrorist attacks, complete with Islamic singers wailing over Hans Zimmer’s Middle Eastern-tinged score. (The Fremen have been cast with actors of color, as opposed to the white European space colonists and the explicitly Aryan Harkonnen. The political discourse around this movie is going to be a mess.) Javier Bardem’s Stilgar serves as a hearty mentor to the boy and becomes a staunch believer that this kid is the Chosen One. Lumbering across the desert resembling the second coming of Anthony Quinn, Bardem gives a droll performance in a movie that could use a few more like it, his blind faith teased in scenes that sometimes feel as if “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” took place in another galaxy. Paul’s willing to play along with all this divine prophecy business for as long as the Fremen are willing to help him avenge his father’s assassination. The trouble arises when it starts looking more and more like what was foretold is turning out to be true. Even scarier than the giant sandworms in “Dune: Part Two” is the world-destroying power of religious fundamentalism. In the south of Arrakis, there are thousands of Fremen who’ve been wasting their summers praying in vain for a (white) savior to rise from these streets. It doesn’t help that Jessica and her cult of witchy space nuns have been down there spreading the gospel of Paul’s exploits. (Though to be fair, what mother doesn’t think her son is God’s gift to the universe?) What follows is something like “The Last Temptation of Timée,” with our young messiah glimpsing the horrific consequences of his destiny and learning to accept it anyway. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts have largely discarded the psychedelic aspects of the source material that previously attracted more abstract filmmakers like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky. These new “Dunes” are extremely literal, explain-y movies, which is a valid enough approach, even if the solemn uniformity of tone started to wear on me a bit during the movie’s middle hour. It may sound like a strange thing to say about a picture in which the principal cast contains seven Oscar nominees, but I missed Jason Momoa. He brought a swashbuckling flair to the first film that’s lacking in this all-business sequel. The wispy Chalamet acquits himself better than expected with the heavier stuff — after suffering through “Wonka,” I’d given up on the actor entirely — though I noticed Villeneuve very cleverly has Paul speaking in the movie’s made-up Fremen language every time he needs to sound like a hardass. There’s some ghoulish comic relief in the form of Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha, an animalistic Harkonnen adversary for Paul. He’s introduced in a stunning black-and-white sequence modeled after Leni Riefenstahl’s “Olympia,” the implications of such a reference being entirely intentional. (There’s also something funny about seeing Elvis in a role played 40 years ago in Lynch’s adaptation by Sting.) Butler goes full ham with the monstrous physicality, replicating Skarsgård’s slurry Swedish accent with the same studied fidelity he brought to the king of rock ‘n’ roll’s drawl. He’s a hoot. The aforementioned emperor of the universe finally shows his face in the form of Christopher Walken. And while their ages don’t quite match up, there’s still something sublime about the casting of Florence Pugh as Walken’s daughter — they both carry themselves with a slightly alien, aristocratic disdain. Alas, Pugh doesn’t get much to do in this picture. Neither does Léa Seydoux, who disappears after a killer cameo as a witchy space nun seductress. The marketing campaign for the 2021 “Dune” was justly criticized for hiding the “Part One” of it all in an opening credit crawl, and while “Dune: Part Two” has what feels like a more conclusive finale, the film still leaves a lot of doors open for a third installment. I’m assuming that’s how Villeneuve got away with such a grimly foreboding, downbeat final scene. Given the circumstances and the state of the world right now, it’s probably the only responsible way to finish the film. After all, holy wars are like Hollywood franchises. They never really end."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," The delay is over Dunatics. Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic “Dune: Part 2” has finally arrived on the big screen and it’s a sweeping saga that arguably tells Frank Herbert’s intricate messianic tale better than any of the previous film and TV adaptations. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are back on planet Arrakis battling an evil empire, harsh deserts, and a very dense storyline. The dazzling visuals and intimate moments help to compensate for the movie’s sometimes plodding pace. And if you haven’t guessed, part three, “Dune Messiah” is looming just beyond those sandy hills. If you didn’t get enough sand from “Dune,” then check out “Io Capitano,” one of the nominees for this year’s Best International Feature Oscar. Two naive teens from Senegal decide they’re going to migrate to Europe to become pop stars. Their treacherous journey across the Sahara to Libya is beyond harrowing as they are forced to face death at multiple points from the harsh environment as well as corrupt police and greedy smugglers. While it’s overlong and repetitious, “Io Capitano” is a compelling drama and should be required viewing for anyone contemplating such a perilous journey. The main question surrounding the Netflix drama “Tyler Perry’s Mea Culpa,” is this: Is it bad enough to be unintentionally funny or campy enough to be a guilty pleasure? Sadly, no. It’s just plain bad. In this steamy erotic thriller, Destiny’s Child alum Kelly Rowlands plays an attorney who gets intimately involved with her client, an artist accused of murder. It’s all goofy, but the wheels completely fall off in the third act. Perry needs to plead “Mea Culpa” for his absurd script."

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two succeeds on its many storyline levels, big and small. Passion, power, corruption, oppression, romance, intimacy, and revenge all get their time in this sweeping spectacle.” Okay, it’s been awhile since Dune (well, only a few hours in elapsed cinematic time), but the wait is over and Dune: Part 2 extends the epic organic-futuristic sci-fi adventure tale that began back in 2021, adapted from Frank Herbert’s acclaimed 1965 novel. Driven by grand intentions, an intensely constructed storyline, an immersive design, and fierce performances, genius director Denis Villeneuve boldly continues the adventures of Paul Atreides, whose family was mostly obliterated at the end of the first chapter, betrayed by the mercilessly malevolent Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, again dressed up as a bad uncle of Jabba the Hut). Revenge awaits. As does, in a few more cinematic seconds, a third, final film.  Villeneuve, from a screenplay with Joe Spaihts, one of his co-writers on the first installment, draws this adventure on a huge, sprawling widescreen tableau, taking the viewer deeper into the saga of the unsteady boy-man turning into a ferocious rebel leader. He’s the central piece in a prophecy that involves his family and the Fremen, the indigenous people fighting the evil overlords that are strip-mining Arrakis of Spice, a drug found on this mostly desolate planet. Most of the characters whose lives did not take a fatal turn earlier, are back, Timothée Chalamet, as Paul, and Zendaya (upping her game considerably), as Chani, a Fremen fighter, are slow-stepping their relationship, realizing they have more important things that demand their attention, like the fate of the universe. Rebecca Ferguson is back as Paul’s mother, the mystical Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, follows her own spiritual path. Among other returnees are Skarsgård, Josh Brolin (Gurney Halleck, trusted advisor to Paul’s murdered father), Javier Barden (as Fremen leader Stilgar), Dave Bautista (as the brute “Beast” Rabban Harkonnen, the Baron’s nephew), and Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam, an Imperial Truthsayer). New cast members to the big show include: Oscar nominee Austin Butler, shorn of his Elvis looks and locks, as the psychopath Feyd-Rautha, another of the Baron’s nephews, his voice full of crazy and sounding much like Sarsgård’s. Much of his performance is shot in contrasty black-and-white by cinematographer Greig Fraser. Oscar winner Christopher Walken offers a non-laughing role as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, the universe’s inscrutable ruler). His daughter is the brooding, calculating Princess Irulan Corrino (Oscar nominee Florence Pugh, who worked with Chalamet in Little Women). the protégé of Reverend Mother Mohaim. Léa Seydoux of James Bond fame plays Lady Margot Fenring, another Bene Generit sister who, like so many of the characters here, and plays out her agenda in broad chess moves. And speaking of chess, Anya Taylor-Joy has an uncredited cameo as one of Paul’s future visions of the sister his mother is currently pregnant with. As a follow-up film to the well-respected original, it’s easy (and well deserved) to make favorable comparisons to other legendary second installments, especially in the Godfather, Star Wars (The Empire Strikes Back), and Batman (The Dark Knight) sagas. Make-believe worlds never looked so impressive, thanks to the expansive depth of Oscar-winning or -nominated talent, returning from the initial eye-opener. Aside from Fraser’s camerawork, there’s production designer Patrice Vermette, editor Joe Walker, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert (making the sand worms truly majestic creatures), costume designer Jacqueline West, and Hans Zimmer with another impressive score that totally relates to the grimness and magnitude of the film. All should be in the running for a statuette at next year’s Academy Awards. Like the original film, delayed by the Covid epidemic, this continuation was also postponed, by the writers’ and actors’ strikes of last year. Unlike Part 1, relegated mostly to the streaming world, this exhilarating beast is best enjoyed on a big screen. And yes, it’s best to watch (or re-watch) the first episode ahead of the new film. Positive word of mouth aside, drain thy bladder and get thee to an IMAX cinema for the near 3-hour booming undertaking that awaits you! And boy, is it LOUD! Even beyond its sheer, jaw-dropping grandeur and the well-directed cast, Dune: Part Two succeeds on its many storyline levels, big and small. Passion, power, corruption, oppression, romance, intimacy, and revenge all get their time in this sweeping spectacle. The one very personal gripe I have? This peeve, while not specific for this film, happens when there are several closeups of Timothée Chalamet’s hands… and his nails are manicured! Not perfectly, but enough to wonder does Paul Atreides carry a nail clipper in the dystopian future of Dune? Maybe he uses sand worms to trim his digits? Perusing the credits, no “manicurist” is listed. OK, I’m overanalyzing, and let’s just call those cuticle edgings creative license. It joins those other things we rarely see in similar movies…people going to the bathroom, their hair nicely coiffed, and men with clean-shaven faces while going weeks in a world of chaos.

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," The 56-year-old Quebecois director’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s trippy 1965 novel concluded its first part just as Paul Atreides, the intergalactic regent played by heartthrob Timothée Chalamet, survived an attack that all but wiped out his family line. Atreides embeds himself with the Freman, an indigenous community on the desert planet Arrakis, which has been occupied for decades by colonial forces extracting its precious spices. He arrived on Arrakis as ambassador for those colonial forces but is instead eager to learn the Freman ways and utilize their desert power to fight another day. He also entertains the possibility that he might be their saviour during a rebellion against the very oppressors with which his family was in league. The plot could, at first glance, come off as very Dances with Wolves meets Avatar, to name a couple of other Oscar Best Picture nominees about colonialism that shamelessly embraced white saviour tropes. But Villeneuve laces his hero’s journey with an anxiety that truly comes into focus in Part Two, as does the influence of the landmark movie that the director acknowledges as having a big hand in shaping his filmmaking: Lawrence of Arabia. Like David Lean’s majestic 1962 film about British archaeologist T.E. Lawrence, Dune, the 2021 film, and the sequel Dune: Part Two (in theatres March 1), boast serene plumes of sand, blood orange sunsets and tiny specks of people captured across these spacious vistas on breathtaking large format film. But the shadow Lawrence of Arabia casts across Dune goes beyond aesthetics. Both are rousing spectacles about rebellion and warfare trip-wired with a deflating and purposeful cynicism. The earlier classic, easily among the greatest films of all time, is based on T.E. Lawrence’s accounts of his role during the century old Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence, a brash and eccentric British archaeologist and soldier, played magnificently in the movie by a then–barely known Peter O’Toole, embeds himself with Bedouin rebels in the Palestine and Sinai regions. He’s thrilled to learn the indigenous community’s ways and proves a formidable leader when melding their tactics with his own. But as Lawrence of Arabia patiently unfolds, the soldier who some describe as having “gone native,” loses his way, gives in to an inherited sense of entitlement, believes himself to be the saviour who could liberate the community from oppression and ultimately reinforces the very colonialism he claims to be fighting.  Lawrence of Arabia wasn’t a white saviour narrative but a sweeping and critical view of how such destructive, self-styled saviours are deluded by a mirage of their own. And the character happened to be an influence on Herbert when he was writing Dune. Call Paul Atreides “Lawrence of Arrakis,” which is the point Villeneuve’s 2021 Dune teased at and that his ambitious and thrilling sequel finally gets around to making.  If Villeneuve’s first movie was spectacular, it was also spectacularly thin, luxuriating in the scenery (both real and digital) and carefully setting up the elements needed for Part Two but barely giving us enough story to justify its more than two-and-a-half-hour runtime. Instead of marching steadily towards the conflict and decisive turns packed into Dune: Part Two, it felt like we were doing one of those circuitous Freman sandwalks – taking a step forward, sliding to the side, avoiding any sense of rhythm. Dune: Part Two, with its imposing and meaningful payoff, retroactively makes the earlier film’s patience worthwhile. The movie rises to the occasion when it comes to awe-inspiring action – those riveting displays of tactical combat and sandworm surfing – and also engaging in the politics that hold up a mirror to history and current events. The sequel lands with uneasy tension and fury and an understanding of how colonial forces co-opt everything from religious fanaticism to the struggle against violent oppression, ultimately serving their own agendas. That’s such a winning note to end on (in how it embraces moral failure) that I can’t help but hope Villeneuve pulls the plug on a planned third instalment. Dune: Part Two doesn’t just feel like a rewarding conclusion to all the attempted screen adaptations of Herbert’s novels, but also the fullest expression of ideas, themes and aesthetics Villeneuve has been working towards throughout his career. Incendies was also a family melodrama rooted in Middle East tension. Sicario was also about a white saviour whose moral compass gets lost in a harsh desert landscape. Arrival was another sci-fi movie about learning an alien language and wielding newfound prophetic powers for strategic advantage."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Released in 2021, Dune took famously troubled source material and turned it into an unlikely success. Dark sci-fi doesn’t always work at the box office, as Blade Runner 2049 proved despite rave reviews. Yet that film’s director, Denis Villeneuve, managed to entrance audiences with his Shakespearean vision of interplanetary revolt, establishing Timothee Chalamet as a megastar and proving that you don’t need superheroes to be successful. Almost three years on, it’s time to return to Arrakis for Dune: Part Two.  Picking up right after the first film, Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, who has joined with the native Fremen on the planet Arrakis, earning their trust through a series of trials. Bonding with Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), he plots vengeance against House Harkonnen, the family behind his family’s murder. However, visions of a dark future leave him torn between his passion and his fate.  The first film was a masterpiece of visual filmmaking, rewarding an emotionally fraught first half with spectacular set pieces and a rich conspiracy plot. Happily, this sequel builds on all those elements, taking things even further both on the screen and the page. Traversing Arrakis’ ocean-like wilderness with the Fremen is a delight, offering action that isn’t simply a mess of violence, but narratively satisfying as well.  Themes of religion, idolatry, and colonisation from Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel all come into the mix, with much of the world-building already taken care of in Part One. This time we spend a bit more times with the characters and it’s a joy. Few filmmakers would have the resources to make a film this ambitious, much less the skill to pull it off, and this feels like the moment Villeneuve joins the ranks of the most celebrated directors (if he hasn’t done so already).  Considering he was playing Willy Wonka a couple of months ago, Chalamet slips back into the lead effortlessly. A restless youngster last time, we see Paul grow as a warrior, conflicted by the Fremen’s belief that he is their messiah. Rebecca Ferguson is also terrific as his mother Jessica, torn between being the architect of this adoration and a concerned mother. It’s great to see Zendaya given a more established role, with Chani’s complex feelings toward Paul and her part in the revolution coaxing out her strongest performance yet.  Of the newcomers, it’s hard not to geek out at the sight of Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV, the puppet master of the colonisers alongside his daughter, Princess Irulan (the always-excellent Florence Pugh). This is the first time that cinema audiences will have seen Austin Butler since Elvis, and so his appearance as the hairless Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha will be jarring, but he shows there’s more to him than Blue Suede Shoes.  Dune: Part Two feels like the right film for this moment. In a post-Barbenheimer world, where big blockbusters can also have something to say, this is the perfect sandstorm of filmmaking, performances, and vision. It’s hard to imagine anything else this year having the same impact."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEUTRAL," George Lucas gets ribbed for starting off each Star Wars chapter with a big block of text about previous events. But at least it gave you something to latch onto if you hadn’t done your homework. In Dune: Part Two, based on the second half of Frank Herbert’s cult science-fiction novel, writer-director Denis Villeneuve dives straight in, trusting his audience will recall where he left off in 2021. I can’t be so sure. So here goes with the obligatory recap: following a massacre, youthful hereditary autocrat Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) has fled with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), to the desert of Arrakis, where they’ve been given grudging refuge by the semi-nomadic Fremen people. Arrakis lies at the centre of a larger power struggle, as sole source of the precious spice that makes space travel possible (and has mind-expanding powers when ingested). But is Paul truly the messiah prophesied in Fremen lore, destined to lead the locals to victory over their oppressors, the Harkonnens? If not, should he assume the role all the same, furthering his quest for revenge against the Machiavellian emperor (Christopher Walken) of the known universe? What of his disturbing prophetic visions, his sceptical Fremen love interest (Zendaya), or the unborn telepathic sister who counsels Lady Jessica from the womb? These are broad strokes, but hopefully enough to go on. As for the film’s style, Villeneuve is certainly no Lucas, any more than he’s the second coming of David Lynch, who directed a famously disastrous adaptation of Dune in 1984 and has lamented ever since not having a final cut. Neither a zippy adventure nor a metaphysical mind-bender, this Dune has the heaviness of an old-fashioned Hollywood epic. The characters speak in solemn half-whispers, all the better to contrast with Hans Zimmer’s booming score once the battle sequences heat up (typically for Villeneuve, the sound design is a major strength). That said, there’s no escaping the weirdness of the source material, even aside from the out-of-focus allegory for the Middle East or the emphasis on consciousness-altering substances that must have accounted for a fair portion of Herbert’s original 1960s success. Most spectacularly, there are the giant sandworms that patrol the Arrakis desert, which the adept can harness and ride the way a surfer rides a wave. Then there are the grotesque human villains, especially the obese, levitating Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), who survived an assassination attempt in the first film and spends much of his time recuperating in a tub of black oil and otherwise suggests an amalgam of Nosferatu and Fat Bastard from Austin Powers. The Baron’s nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is bald and pale like his uncle but more lithely built, resembling one of the War Boys in Mad Max: Fury Road. Indeed, the Mad Max saga is a clear influence on Villeneuve’s handling of the Harkonnen material, especially in an arena sequence shot in black-and-white – which also seems meant to evoke associations with Nazi newsreels, in a slightly pretentious way. As for the fragile-looking Chalamet, it’s fair to say he’s more persuasive as a product of his planet’s ruling class than as a warrior whose training lets him take on all comers: Villeneuve was wise to film his big one-on-one combat sequence largely in silhouette. Despite the all-star cast, this is not a movie to look to for dazzling performances or anything beyond the kind of corny but committed storytelling Hollywood these days pulls off less often than in the past. Where the Star Wars films always had a winking element, here, the actors who thrive are those who play their two-dimensional characters as straight as possible – like Javier Bardem as Paul’s most loyal supporter among the Fremen, whose dialogue consists mainly of variations on “The prophecy is fulfilled!”"
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,This is the Imax experience the Avatar movies wish they could be&#58; a spectacle with grand visuals and EQUALLY grand writing&#46; 
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," 
""No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a hero."" The ""hero,"" in this case, is Timothée Chalamet's young Paul Atreides who holds the vast world of Dune: Part Two in his mind. However, the quote belongs to the late Washingtonian author of the Dune series, Frank Herbert. Born in Tacoma in 1920, Herbert would go on to craft one of the most foundational sci-fi novels. Amid all the sandworms, Dune is also a skeptical parable. The author, a man of many contradictions who worked in both journalism and politics, grew disillusioned with the leaders who govern the world. Of the many ideas in his writing, a central one concerns the danger of false prophets.
 
The question has always been whether a film adaptation could capture this. With Dune: Part Two, director Denis Villeneuve not only comes about as close as one could hope to doing so, but he also surpasses the already significant achievement of the first film. This sequel, which covers the latter half of the book, picks up with Paul on the run in the vast deserts of the planet Arrakis as the forces of House Harkonnen attempt to destroy the Fremen and mine the valuable spice melange. An effective early action scene reveals the Harkonnen are no match for the warriors that have made the inhospitable desert their home. As the bodies fall and pile up on the sand, more death is soon to follow.
 
For Paul, his life has become defined by death. His father was murdered, and he has just recently taken the life of another for the first time. Simultaneously, his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is pregnant with his sister and begins to use her abilities as a Bene Gesserit to convince the Fremen that Paul is their messiah. Where some like the longtime Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem with a delightful yet tragically humorous disposition) are willing to do anything to have this be true, others are not so sure. Chani (Zendaya, in her best film performance to date) is wary of the way the Fremen are being led by Paul even as she also develops a fraught affection for him while they fight the Harkonnen.
 
The film is then about this march toward what may be the immense destruction wrought by a supposed savior. Many other players are trying to direct the battle on Arrakis, but the core of it remains the descent of Paul. For all the awe the film creates with the scope of its world and the magnificent visual effects, all of it is being increasingly poisoned by the dark path the characters are going down. Paul is aware of this, initially saying he does not want to lead because he knows what will happen, but still he does so — which is the point. What could feel like a sudden about-face is a haunting demonstration of how little a push it takes for those with power to throw all their supposed morals away.
 
There are brief parts of this that prove a little blunt in hammering home how Paul is becoming lost, yet there is also something authentically terrifying to seeing how the more and more a figure is rallied around, the worse he gets. Just as Zendaya delicately captures Chani becoming the film's moral conscience, there is little her character can do to stop the coming storm. The film boasts breathtaking visuals — from a gladiatorial fight commanded by Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha (the film's antagonist of sorts) to the climactic battle for the future of Arrakis — but Chani gives the film its emotional heft.
 
If it wasn't already clear, a more open-ended conclusion shows Villeneuve is hungering to make at least one more film to complete what has become his feel-bad sci-fi trilogy. Regardless of whether there is more to come, this latest chapter emerges as one of the most well-crafted works of cinema you'll see this year. With both spectacle and soul, it is a work that puts all other projects of this scale to absolute shame. It's faithful to Herbert's ideas while remaining refreshingly willing to reshape the story.
"
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part 2 picks up right where the first left off. Co-writer/director Denis Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts set up the chessboard in Dune: Part 1. Now, they start making moves. Yes, Bobby Fischer, there’s going to be a third. At the end of Dune: Part 1, the House Atreides has been vanquished. The sole heir, Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and his Bene Gesserit mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have met a band of Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Paul’s future love, Chani (Zendaya). The Harkonnens have returned to resume spice harvesting, but the Fremen have made it almost impossible to restart production. Upset with the situation, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) sends his nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to do the job his cousin Rabban (Dave Bautista) could not. He proves quite effective and sadistic, to boot. With the Fremen still unable to trust Paul, he and Jessica concoct a scheme for Paul to fully embrace his role as Arrakis’ Messiah to free the planet’s people and restore paradise once again to the desert planet.  My thoughts on Dune: Part 2 start with the fact that I’m just a normie who had a good time. Having not read the books, I can’t gush like many of my friends. But this represents the return of the sci-fi epic, the likes of which I haven’t seen since Avengers: End Game. However, Dune as a story is dense, meaning it could be easier to follow. I didn’t mention all the other houses led by the Emperor (Christopher Walken), who planned the destruction of House Atreides. Then there’s the religious aspect, told through the Bene Gesserit’s Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) and her very fertile followers Princes Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux). Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Austin Butler, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, etc. There will always be a warm place in my heart for David Lynch’s adaptation in 1984, despite it being horribly undermined by meddling studio executives and financiers. But Denis Villeneuve’s project will forever be THE definitive adaptation. Watching “Part 2” the other day, I was uttterly mesmerized. It was a rich, finely crafted, and magnificent film. In addition to being a film critic for Film Threat, I'm an astronomer, TV host (check me out right now in Killers of the Cosmos on Discovery+), and... So with the David Lynch and John Harrison's SyFy mini-series fresh in my head, where does Denis Villeneuve's version of Dune stand? Real quick —...

"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE," “Dune: Part Two” evaporated from my memory 10 minutes after I walked out of the screening room. It just simply disappeared, like one of the film’s massive sandworms burrowing into the ground. Like those famous creatures from Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, writer-director Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic made a lot of noise. Then it retreated back to from whence it came, leaving no trace in my mind. I did not like “Dune: Part One” (2021), but I begrudgingly gave Villeneuve credit for taking a chance on a nearly-60-year-old novel whose first disastrous adaptation was made 40 years ago by David Lynch. Unsure of whether the second half would even get made, Warner Bros. and its director kept the faith and proceeded with the first half of the story. The gamble paid off: “Dune: Part One” received 10 Oscar nods, including one for best picture, and it won six. More importantly, the first film was a financial success ($433,796,625 worldwide) and earned Herbert’s universe a lot of new fans. The audience I saw it with at Alice Tully Hall during the New York Film Festival cheered and applauded loudly during the closing credits. The room vibrated mightily with clapping hands. Those vibrations continued as I made the long walk up the aisle and out of the venue, shaking my head at the rapturous reaction to something I considered mediocre. My recollections came in handy, as “Dune: Part Two” makes no attempt to situate new viewers or give them a CliffsNotes-style summary. I can’t complain about that decision; after all, this isn’t a sequel — it’s a continuation. And yet, “Part Two” meets all the expected sequel requirements: It’s bigger, louder, costlier, and not as good as the “original.” It’s the year 10,091 on planet Arrakis, and we’re reunited with Herbert’s hero, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). In the last film, Paul had visions of some kind of war after being exposed to a psychotropic substance called Spice. Those visions included a mysterious woman whom we discover is Chani (Zendaya), a member of the Fremen tribe that inhabits Arrakis and is led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, had been training him on how to use “the Voice” — think of the Jedi mind trick from “Star Wars” if it were merged with the voice of Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. One of the few improvements in “Dune: Part Two” is to make that voice sound less like a Muppet and more like the demon that possessed Carol Speed in the 1974 Blaxploitation horror movie, “Abby.” As “Part Two” opens, we are fully immersed in the lives of the Fremen. Stilgar believes that Paul might be the Messianic figure many of his people seek, though Chani isn’t one of those followers. “Dune: Part Two” tries to explore ideas about whether an outsider should lead and/or save a race of people, but the half-hearted efforts are almost as bad as if these notions hadn’t been interrogated at all. The first film hinted at more Chani in the follow-up, and fans of Zendaya won’t be disappointed with her starring role here. Unfortunately, she and Chalamet are saddled with a soggy, tepid love story and dialogue so bad that it recalls those cringeworthy scenes of Anakin Skywalker pitching woo in 2002′s “Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.” At least Villeneuve doesn’t make Paul compare Chani’s skin to the sands of his planet as George Lucas did with Anakin. “Dune” fans were also promised more appearances by the sandworms, and it’s here that Villeneuve delivers on the one memorable aspect of “Dune: Part Two.” I won’t spoil these scenes, but the sandworms are the true stars of the film. These creatures are so popular AMC Theatres has created a hideous-looking popcorn bucket with their likeness that makes the idea of eating popcorn as terrifying as sticking one’s hand into that box the Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) used to test Paul in “Part One.” Rampling reprises her role here, as do many of the original cast members, including Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista. Bautista, an actor who has always made the movies he was in better, disappoints here with a one-note performance consisting entirely of yelling. It’s not his fault as the script (by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts) paints most of its characters as two-dimensional entities in service to the supposed visual spectacle. The only time the look of the film syncs with the characters is in the rendering of the sociopathic, white-faced Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Cinematographer Greig Fraser gives his scenes a garish black-and-white look, with the character’s bald head standing out in shocking contrast to his environment. “Dune: Part Two” also introduces us to Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken, doing a walk-on cameo) and his daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh). Pugh and Walken are both pros at elevating terrible material and making it watchable, but their valiant efforts are for naught. Just as in the first film, I was put off by the white-savior narrative (Stilgar’s fervent belief quickly becomes grating), and the Hans Zimmer score that sounds as if Arrakis were in the Middle East rather than space. No matter. “Dune: Part Two” will be celebrated for the repetitive action sequences and the visuals, which are often so brown (it is the desert, you know) they invoke Michael Cimino’s epic 1980 box-office disaster, “Heaven’s Gate.” No wonder I blocked the movie out of my mind."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Considerando lo espectacular que fue “Dune Part 1″, de Denis Villeneuve, no debería sorprender el que la segunda parte, que llega a los cines de la isla este jueves, esté al mismo nivel y, de muchas otras formas, logre ser una oferta superior y mucho más memorable."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEUTRAL," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two” arrives almost 2 1/2 years after its predecessor came out in the thick of the pandemic. Although “Dune” was simultaneously available for viewing online, the opportunity for many to witness an intergalactic epic on the big screen – or anything on the big screen – was still something of a rarity. I found the movie middling, but the long-awaited bigness of the theatrical experience may have contributed to its popular success. “Dune: Part Two” picks up where “Dune” left off. The visuals are still immense, but this time around, the film must stand on its own, without the benefit of pandemic-era bonus points. How does it compare? It’s still big, that’s for sure. With the possible exception of “Lawrence of Arabia,” I’ve never seen so much sand in one movie. (Of course, the sand in David Lean’s film wasn’t CGI.) I’ve also rarely seen a movie packed with so much plot. Keeping track of the storylines derived from Frank Herbert’s eco-visionary 1965 sci-fi tome is a full-time job. That’s one reason the material had long been deemed unfilmable. Several directors before Villeneuve tried anyway: There was David Lynch’s misbegotten 1985 fiasco and a forgettable 2000 TV miniseries. Alejandro Jodorowsky tried for over a decade to finance a multipart version that was supposed to star Salvador Dalí and Orson Welles! “Dune: Part Two” arrives almost 2 1/2 years after the first installment. With the possible exception of “Lawrence of Arabia,” film critic Peter Rainer writes, he’s never seen so much sand in one movie. Villeneuve’s “Dune,” which takes place in the year 10191, covered about half of the novel. The new film, co-written by Jon Spaihts, still doesn’t make it all the way through. We pick up with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) on the desert planet Arrakis, where the oppressed, nomadic Fremen are at war with the brutal Harkonnen. Besides grunting a lot, the Harkonnen also control the prized spice substance that can propel a person through space and time. The older generation of Fremen, led by tribal leader Stilgar (an amusing Javier Bardem), believes Paul is the much-prophesied “chosen one” who will deliver them to a green paradise. (Arrakis is virtually waterless.) The skeptical younger generation, personified by Chani (Zendaya), thinks Paul is just ... Paul. Paul himself is not so sure who or what he is, but he earns the respect of the Fremen by acing all their required tests, including an excitingly filmed high-speed ride atop a giant sandworm. If nothing else, Chani appreciates Paul’s desire to learn the ways of the Fremen. He doesn’t act like a messiah, at least not around her. A sort of love story develops involving a few chaste kisses. The unsightly nasal tubes worn by the Fremen actually look good on them – it’s an intergalactic fashion statement. There is quite a bit more to the plot, but suffice to say, it all boils down to a mythic struggle powered by prophecy. Along the way, all sorts of familiar faces pop up. Some are repeaters from “Dune,” such as Rebecca Ferguson as Paul’s creepy mom, Lady Jessica, or Stellan Skarsgård’s bloated Baron Harkonnen. Others, such as Christopher Walken’s Padishah Emperor, are new. I welcome Walken any time, in any galaxy. He’s naturally otherworldly. The best addition is Austin Butler as the baron’s bald-pated, hypervicious nephew. It’s official: Butler no longer looks or sounds like Elvis Presley. Villeneuve is adept at staging grand-scale battles, but the movie’s best set piece is the climactic tooth-and-nail face-off between Paul and this grinning gargoyle. Like the first installment, “Dune: Part Two” ends abruptly, with much more story to tell. And once again, Chalamet doesn’t quite seem up to the task of portraying a rebel-rousing savior. Perhaps if they keep making these movies, he will finally grow into the role. Zendaya’s gutsy Chani, on the other hand, seems fully formed right now. If there is to be a “Part Three,” Villeneuve should depart from Herbert and make her the savior. Maybe Chani can’t save the galaxy, but she just might carry the franchise. Peter Rainer is the Monitor’s film critic. “Dune: Part Two” is rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some suggestive material, and brief strong language.  Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15.

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," The first Dune belonged to Timothée Chalamet. Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, the son of one of the aristocratic houses controlling the known universe, as well as an unenthusiastic contender for the position of genetically engineered, holy-war-waging messiah. It was, and still is, inspired casting, and not just because Chalamet has the patrician bone structure of an imperial hemophiliac. Chalamet, Hollywood’s chosen prince, has been navigating the crumbling path toward movie stardom like someone who’s aware there are more mistakes to be made than rewards to be had, which gives an extratextual charge to his performance as someone trying to avoid being corralled into the parts others would like him to play. He’s good in that first film, a boy-man dwarfed by galaxy-size power games, and even better in its follow-up, which finds his character fighting alongside the indigenous Fremen, giddy with revolution and new love. But Dune: Part Two isn’t his movie — it belongs firmly to Zendaya, who gives the second half of Denis Villeneuve’s Frank Herbert adaptation an emotional tangibility that the first, in all its exotic majesty, eschewed. Science fiction is Villeneuve’s genre, and has been even before he started making movies about extraterrestrial communication or desert planets being mined for an interstellar travel-enabling drug. He can’t help but render the world as otherworldly onscreen, turning the Toronto of Enemy into a jaundiced alternative reality in which hostile doppelgängers made perfect sense, and the Arizona suburbs of Sicario into a pre-apocalyptic wasteland. This remove has been his most consistent quality as a filmmaker, even when it has undermined the actual stuff of his films, and one reason the Dunes are so terrific is that they provide the ideal material for his unshakable aesthetic. The macrocosm of his Dune movies is supposed to feel forbiddingly distant, populated by a mankind that’s iterated itself into sisterhoods of space witches, societies of goth fascists, and orders of human computers (though, alas, there is no Stephen McKinley Henderson in the sequel) amid a hierarchical structure of suspicious clans. Villeneuve’s facility with this stuff doesn’t just come from his talent for spectacle, though there are set pieces in Dune: Part Two that aim to blow the top of your skull off. The sequence where Paul tries to prove himself to the Fremen by riding a sandworm for the first time is staged like someone attempting to hook themselves to a high-speed train. The camera keeps by the character’s side as he tumbles disorientingly through an upended ocean of sand, only to find himself clinging to the armored hide of the giant creature as rushing air whips him around. But the filmmaker’s real gift is his ability to treat this strange futurescape as fully inhabited. The script (which he wrote with Jon Spaihts) skips awkward paragraphs of expository dialogue, expecting that viewers can keep up with what they might not fully understand. We see a lot more of Giedi Prime, home planet of the vicious Harkonnen family, in order to meet Baron Harkonnen’s (Stellan Skarsgård) sadistic nephew Feyd-Rautha (a scene-stealing Austin Butler, smiling around blackened teeth). Why bother going over the niceties of local succession traditions when we can just watch the young noble celebrate his birthday by slaughtering slaves in front of a crowded arena chanting his name, with the light of the black sun draining whatever color might be left on a planet that’s already near-monochromatic? Dune: Part Two isn’t any more compromising than the first film when it comes to the conflicts and stratospheric intrigues that result in piles of corpses to be incinerated on the ground. The secretive Bene Gesserit, a matriarchal society whose superhuman company includes Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and emperor’s daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), are still carrying out a horse race between the respective results of their eugenic labors. Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), a senior member among the Bene Gesserit, prefers the sociopathic but controllable Feyd-Rautha over the rebellious Paul. The emperor (Christopher Walken, the only actor unable to get into the film’s vibe) is revealed to have engineered the Atreides’ downfall, to Irulan’s frustration. And Jessica, having sampled a poisonous, prescience-enabling sandworm by-product in order to become a Reverend Mother herself for the Fremen, seems to have become a true believer in all the prophecies her order strategically seeded, and walks around having conversations with the newly awakened fetus she’s carrying. We haven’t even gotten into the real freak shit of the later Herbert books, and this is already thrillingly strong stuff. Rather than soften the strangeness of its source material, Dune: Part Two shifts its perspective to one on the ground — to Zendaya’s character, the Fremen warrior Chani. She was more promise than actual presence in 2021’s Dune, a figure from Paul’s visions who’s only encountered in the flesh after the Harkonnen family ambushes and wipes out most of the Atreides forces. But she’s the soul of the new film, skeptical of all the messiah talk she rightfully believes was planted to control her people, and skeptical of this off-world upper-cruster who comes seeking refuge, swearing he’s not like the others and that he only wants to learn the ways of her people and help them. (Chani’s fundamentalist cohort Stilgar, played by Javier Bardem, meanwhile, is certain that Paul is the prophesied leader meant to free them.) The beats of Paul’s time with the Fremen echo ones from Avatar and Dances With Wolves, only here they’re a calculation. Paul may be sincere in falling in love with Chani and wanting to take up the Fremen cause, but he’s also trying to decide if he wants to use them to fulfill the destiny he’s been avoiding. Zendaya’s fierce, open-hearted performance provides a counterpoint to all the high-level machinations of the plot. As someone who understands that the interests of this charismatic outsider aren’t actually those of her and her community, she can’t help but be swayed by him anyway. “Your blood comes from dukes and great houses,” Chani says to Paul at one point. “Here, everyone is equal.” His response — “I’d very much like to be equal to you” — is the perfect kind of howler, a reminder that shrewdness is no match for when you want to believe. In the maelstrom of wariness, hope, and betrayal she projects in the final act, Zendaya shows us that emotions can be universal, even in a context that’s anything but."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Having press-screened it in an IMAX theater with the Dolby cranked to 15 and the seats apparently wired for Sensurround, I can say this with certainty: You don’t watch “Dune Part 2” (⭐ ⭐ ⭐ , in theaters Friday March 1). You get Rolfed by it. But I guess if you’re willing to be pummeled by Serious Blockbuster Cinema, Denis Villeneuve is your man. The sequel to the 2021 sci-fi epic – heads up, “Dune 2” ends with matters only partially resolved and a third film in the works – completes the director’s ambitious adaptation of the first novel in Frank Herbert’s classic series set on the desert planet Arrakis, where warring clans vie to control a valuable spice and a young princeling emerges to lead a rebellion. If Villeneuve ever had to make a comedy, he’d probably puncture a lung, but as a creator of gargantuan wide-screen sagas – action choreographed with grandeur, originality of vision, and intensity of purpose – he’s unrivaled. His “Dune” movies make the “Star Wars” universe look like a Lego kit, which is fitting, since “Star Wars” took a lot of Herbert for its own building blocks. Still, there are dissonances in the new film, some of them put there on purpose and others not, and it’ll be curious to see whether mainstream audiences pick up on the ones they’re meant to. Paul Atreides, the young off-world hero played with sleepy-eyed vigor by Timothée Chalamet, is taken as a messiah, the “Mahdi,” by the indigenous Fremen of Arrakis, and the real drama of “Dune 2” – aside from exploding juggernauts and massive battle scenes and those excellent big-ass sandworms – is how, exactly, Paul feels about that. Whether he’s serious when he tells his lady friend, the feral Fremen warrioress Chani (Zendaya), “I’m not the Mahdi; I’m here to learn your ways,” or whether he’s conning her and/or himself. By the end of this two-hour-and-forty-seven-minute lollapalooza – it feels like twelve years while you’re sitting there, and for once I don’t mean that as a jab – Paul seems to have decided that maybe being a messiah isn’t such a bad idea. But Frank Herbert thought it might be, and I think Denis Villeneuve does too. By that point, Paul has completely morphed into Muad’Dib, a rebel leader named for the hardy kangaroo mouse of the Arrakeen desert. No longer is he the cast-off heir to a dynasty destroyed by its evil interplanetary rivals the Harkonnens, a Hamlet aching to avenge his father (Oscar Isaac, killed off in Part One). Under the goading of his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the powerful galactic matriarchal order the Bene Gesserit, and noodged by his Fremen mentor Stilgar (Javier Bardem in what’s basically Anthony Quinn’s role in “Lawrence of Arabia”), Paul feels the pull of destiny. Meanwhile, his duty to dead dad and love for Chani – cue the charming if dusty love montage – tug him back toward the human end of the scale. (If the preceding sentences are incomprehensible to you, you might be better off with a good book.) I don’t invoke “Lawrence of Arabia” lightly. Herbert had been working on “Dune” since 1959, after a visit to the Oregon Dunes planted the seed of Arrakis in his head, but whether through influence or coincidence David Lean’s 1962 Oscar-winning epic seems to have set the cultural stage for much of the novel’s themes: A parched, inhospitable landscape getting carved up by colonial interlopers; a fiercely nomadic guerilla army of locals; a blue-eyed outsider figure gone reluctantly native and leading the locals into battle. The Fremen even speak a bastardized interstellar Arabic, and Chalamet’s Paul is only slightly less intensely neurotic than Peter O’Toole’s T.E. Lawrence. At least at the beginning. It’s unclear, though, whether we’re meant to cheer on Paul’s assuming the mantle of divine leadership as the film progresses or see it as encroaching monomania. And the lack of clarity is itself unclear: Is this dramatic nuance or just muddled storytelling? Because the rest of “Dune Part 2” is so compelling as world-building – as a concrete place filled with vivid two-dimensional characters – its central figure registers as a slightly opaque blur rather than an emotionally conflicted hero we can relate to and invest in. And that serves to further muddy the cliché of the white savior at the heart of this story, a cliché Herbert took at (somewhat) face value and Villeneuve simply doesn’t seem interested in engaging with. And why should he when he’s attending to so much other business: The creation of a planet’s entire anthropology and the office politics of the known universe, to name just two? The jostling subsidiary characters, each with his or her agenda, are breathed into life by actors who bring their own personas to the party. Ex-wrestler Dave Bautista as the equivalent of a failed Harkonnen middle manager, howling “KILL THEM ALLLL!” like a comic book baddie. Austin Butler as his replacement, the frighteningly eyebrow-less psycho albino Feyd Rautha – Butler makes the transition from playing Elvis Presley with ease and puts to shame Sting’s codpieced version of the character in the 1984 David Lynch “Dune.” Stellan Skarsgård as the grossly corpulent Baron Harkonnen and Charlotte Rampling scowling and scheming as the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. Gruff Josh Brolin as gruff Gurney Halleck, Paul’s mentor in warcraft, and France’s Léa Seydoux as a seductive court witch. Wide-eyed Anya Taylor-Joy, all too briefly glimpsed as – there’s no other way to put this – a fetus to be named later. But I can say no more. Well, maybe I can. Off in a corner of the film is a person the production notes call Shaddam IV, the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe, but who in “Dune Part 2” is referred to only as The Emperor and who is played in a splendiferous bit of miscasting by Christopher Walken, an actor who always and endearingly seems to be slightly confused to find himself in any particular room, let alone running the entire galactic show. Florence Pugh plays his daughter, the Princess Irulan, and their scenes together, cut off from the scenes on Arrakis, have a nicely dotty quality that I might mistake for comedy if I hadn’t known the director were medically averse. Walken, beloved and befogged, remains one of our great untapped resources, a deep, deep well of quixotic expressions and intentions who’s somehow too remote to be fully accessed. When the Emperor finally joins the rest of the cast in the climactic scenes, “Dune Part 2” ironically threatens to become a less majestic but more interesting movie. That said, if you want spectacle, here’s your Saturday night special, and I strongly recommend you take it in on the big screen, whether you’re wearing the hazmat suit or not. The giant sandworms alone are worth the ticket price: Gargantuan beasties that the Fremen hop onto and ride like an F train to Brooklyn. Zendaya's badass desert fighter is pretty great, too. Elsewhere, Villeneuve goes the whole Riefenstahl in the scenes on the Harkonnen home planet, arraying the villains’ army up past the horizon like so many extras in “Triumph of the Will,” and he brings us in close for the infighting among the Fremen as they bicker over what to do with Paul. “Dune Part 2” is state-of-the-art commercial cinema as it exists in 2024: It takes you someplace far away and brings it up close, with broad archetypes, nods to Big Ideas, and every bit of its vision dotted down to the last pixel. What it doesn't do is breathe with the funk and flukiness of actual people. If Villeneuve is a compleat filmmaker, he lacks only the humility, the humor, and arguably the human touch to be a great one.

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," In 1965 a science fiction novel by author Frank Herbert, titled Dune, was first published.  Since then, there have been a few attempts to turn it into a movie with no results.  Then in 1984, the David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) film premiered in theaters but was panned by critics.  In 2000, a three-hour, television miniseries ran on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Almost a decade later, Paramount Pictures launched plans for a remake to be directed by Peter Berg (Patriots Day) but after three years of pre-production, the film was scrapped.  Ten years after that attempt, Legendary Entertainment hired French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) to once again adapt the novel into a movie.  The result was 2021's box office hit, Dune, and the forthcoming, Dune: Part Two which makes its way to theaters this Friday. Dune: Part Two picks up exactly where the first film left off (I recommend rewatching the first movie to refresh your memory), with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet; Wonka) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson; Mission: Impossible - Fallout) winning favor with the Fremen - desert people who have learned to survive in the harsh climate of Arrakis. Watching from the shadows the Fremen learn that the House of Harkonnen murdered the House of Atreides as per the emperor's order and are now harvesting the lucrative salt mines on Arrakis.  However, the Fremen have other ideas and eventually teach Paul how to sabotage the Harkonnen, leading to an all-out war between the two factions. Villeneuve has done two things incredibly well that lends to the success of Dune: Part Two.  The first is choosing a wonderfully talented cast that meshes well together.  From Chalamet and Zendaya (Spider-Man: No Way Home) to Austin Butler (Elvis), Florence Pugh (Don't Worry, Darling), and Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men), everyone brings something unique to their role while blending with the group to make a cohesive team.  Sadly, Christopher Walken (True Romance) does a great Christopher Walken impression but pretty much plays himself as the emperor. The second is the special effects and cinematography.  The beautiful stillness of the desert, as it lays silently, is in sharp contrast to the violent battles that take place.  Also, the visualization of the sandworm cutting through the dunes and the CGI design of the huge creature as it is being ridden by Paul are painstakingly detailed and gorgeous. Villeneuve seemed to have a clear vision of what he wanted and was given the budget to make it work. Villeneuve also realized early on that the 896-page novel was too juicy and detailed to be shortened to one two-hour movie, as evidenced by the failure of the 1984 film.  By breaking the story into two movies, each over 180 minutes in length, he had ample time to tell a coherent tale cohesively while setting the stage for an additional movie called Dune Messiah. He also managed to make both movies entertaining and enjoyable without adding too many superfluous moments. When the trailer was released for Dune back in 2021, I was neither excited for nor dreading the film but once I finally saw it, I thought it was well done and it left me excited for Part Two.  However, two years later when the trailer for Dune: Part Two came out, I once again had a sense it might not be as excellent as I had hoped.  Luckily, Villeneuve proved me wrong once again., as the second installment, while a little long overall, tells the epic story about life, love, and obligation. Since it is rumored that Villeneuve is now working on adapting the next novel, Dune Messiah, into a movie, I have one thing to say...I can't wait!!!!

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," You know he’s the one because he’s a movie star with piercing eyes, floppy hair, goth vulnerability and untapped strength all in one. He’s Prince Hal making good. His name is Paul Atreides. It’s the name his parents gave him, but not the one he’ll be remembered by. Names are important in Dune, be they taken, given or blasphemed. Paul takes the name Muad’Dib on the sands of Arrakis, also known as the planet Dune, where the melange, or “spice,” is harvested for the rest of the galaxy. Who controls the spice controls the power. That’s why Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), are on Arrakis: The house Atreides was responsible for overseeing spice production until the Emperor (Christopher Walken) eradicated the Atreides — save for Paul and Jessica — and installed the House of Harkonnen, led by the grotesque oil-loving Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), in their stead. That’s about all the backstory you get for Dune: Part II. Director Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal sci-fi novel hits the sand running with no catch-up or flashbacks. Not that you really need any: Dune traffics in so many archetypes and story conventions that it connects far-reaching dots through familiarity alone. Paul’s conversion to Muad’Dib on the sands of Arrakis certainly rhymes with Saul’s conversion to Paul on the road to Damascus. But when Dune’s Paul enters the Fremen’s sacred temple and announces, “I am the way!” he becomes more messiah than apostle. Though, considering his royal heritage and encounters outside the palace walls, maybe a parallel to Prince Gautama Buddha is more apt. All of this is part and parcel of the hero’s journey or monomyth — an ancient story that has been replayed and revised countless times. Some of the most successful storytellers in the history of civilization have either cribbed from it or borrowed it in totality. Shakespeare knew his way around the monomyth, so it shouldn’t be surprising when Paul turns the corner from messiah-in-training to warrior king and Villeneuve’s movie enters full-blown Henry V territory. Familiar? You bet. Exciting? Absolutely. Dune is huge. The whole movie thrums with bombastic images and sound. Hans Zimmer’s score rattles your seat — unless you see it in 4DX, and then the seat will rattle itself — and Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser craft a canvas so vast it engulfs you.  The sheer scale of the sandworms, the expanse of desert and the throngs of Freman surrounding Paul as he finds his voice makes Arrakis feel as tactile as your neighborhood. The home of the Harkonnen, where a black sun bleaches skin tones into a ghostly white, transforms Giedi Prime from sci-fi hokum into artistic wonder. And then there’s the Edenic garden where the elderly Emperor putters around with such metaphorical obviousness that it feels silly to scoff. It’s all so bombastic, so impressive and so deadly, deadly serious. Oh, for the want of chuckle on the sands of Arrakis.

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," 
When it finally touched down in theaters three years ago, the most notable characteristic of Denis Villeneuve's first Dune film was probably the fact that it existed at all. A properly monumental adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel had been something of a cinematic white whale (or worm, if you will), defeating filmmakers as illustrious as David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky. After several decades' worth of failed and abandoned attempts, Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) and his collaborators pulled off an impressive achievement, bringing the cherished literary science-fiction tale to life in grandiose and relatively faithful fashion, all without sacrificing that essential blockbuster currency: spectacle.
 
 Dune: Part One proved to be a thrilling and visionary work of epic sci-fi, although it had to shed some of the thematic sophistication of the book to attain such lofty heights. The feature hinted at the source material's weighty social, religious and ecological themes, but it was generally more focused on introducing the audience to the indelible, neo-feudal universe that Herbert created. The most notable thing about Dune: Part Two, then, is that it brings these themes to the forefront in a way that the first chapter could never quite manage, while also still delivering plenty of visceral action and awestruck world-building.
 
Picking up almost exactly where the previous feature (somewhat abruptly) left off, Part Two finds exiled-and-presumed-dead noble scion Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) warily accepting the hospitality of the Fremen, the native people of the desert planet Arrakis. Both mother and son quickly find their place in this new world. Paul learns the ways of the Fremen guerilla warriors who sabotage the spice-extraction efforts of Arrakis' colonizers, the brutal House Harkonnen. Meanwhile, Jessica — a member of the enigmatic witch cabal the Bene Gesserit — assumes an esteemed spiritual role, exploiting the messianic myths of the Fremen and paving the way for her son's ascendency. This doesn't sit well with Paul, who is more focused on assimilating with his new allies and winning the affection of the hard-edged fighter Chani (Zendaya).

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Visionary director Denis Villeneuve returns for the highly anticipated second instalment of the two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 seminal novel Dune. Even grander in scale than the first, Dune: Part Two joins the ranks of excellent second instalments, with multiple comparisons to the iconic The Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight well earned. With higher stakes, Shakespearean power dynamics and rich visual worlds rivalling Lord of the Rings, it’s safe to say that you can believe the hype. Events pick up straight after the end of the first instalment following the massacre of House Atreides, with Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) undergoing their initiation with the Fremen, as both parties fight back against the oppressive rule of House Harkonnen. As his relationship with Chani (Zendaya) deepens, Paul faces a tough choice between his love and his destiny, with the fate of the universe in the balance. Following the extensive world-building and introduction of the major houses, factions and power structures in Dune, Villeneuve wastes no time delving straight into the action. There’s gripping guerilla missions targeting Spice production, sand worm riding a-plenty, and a grandiose desert battle sequence. With prescient visions of the Lisan al-Gaiba leading a holy war woven throughout, the dramatic intensity has certainly been notched up a gear too, along with the impressive non-stop pacing.  Villeneuve ambitiously juggles the blockbuster spectacle with the exploration of weighty (and often cold) themes such as the corruption of power, environmentalism, oppression and the cost of revenge. With so many plates spinning and even more cruel antagonists introduced, it’s no mean feat that the directors’ expansive vision comes to fruition, predominantly due to the outstanding performances and staggering spectacle. Despite the grandiose (and often psychedelic) narrative, there’s surprisingly heartfelt and humourful moments courtesy of Javier Bardem’s Stilgar and Paul and Chani’s love story, which proves the epicentre of the film. Chalamet undoubtedly grows in the complex and conflicted Messianic role, delving into both the charisma and knotty morality of Paul. He shines in the quieter, more romantic moments alongside Zendaya’s excellently resolute Fremen warrior Chani, who finally gets an extended role this time round (and a number of brilliant ‘if looks could kill’ moments!) Newcomers Florence Pugh and Léa Seydoux also impress as Princess Irulan and Lady Margot Fenring, giving us a greater glimpse at the complex machinations of the sinister Bene Gesserit sisterhood. However, it’s the transformative Austin Butler who steals the show as the lethal Feyd-Rautha, displaying an absolute visceral ferocity with the Gladiator-inspired introduction, along with his thrilling and excellently choreographed combat with Chalamet’s Paul. The franchise continues to be incredibly large scale sci-fi and a true audiovisual spectacle, complete with exhilarating action sequences and an outstanding score. Production designer Patrice Vermette, cinematographer Greig Fraser and costume designer Jacqueline West have crafted a distinct and unmistakable universe, with the black and white sequences on Giedi Prime proving a real standout. Hans Zimmers’ electric score (with highlights including the delicate interwoven motif throughout “Beginnings are Such Delicate Times” and “A Time of Quiet Between the Storms” and the outstanding “Worm Riding”) is paired with incredibly immersive speaker shaking sound design. Dune: Part Two is undoubtedly one of this year’s biggest cinematic experiences as Denis Villeneuve and co. dive deeper into the desert. Outstanding on pretty much all levels, the sequel is visually thrilling and narratively epic, sowing the seeds for a potential adaptation of book two, Dune Messiah.

"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE," I was fairly disappointed in the first installment of this Dune adaptation, feeling as though we had spent a long time in what were essentially the opening chapters of the story. I was hoping to see much of those weaknesses improved in Part Two, but seeing the second half was equal parts frustrating and affirming in my diagnosis of the first film. This installment covers a lot more time and a lot more ground, but also suffers from some of the same choppy and abrupt pacing that David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation does, despite being twice as long overall. There is certainly a lot to appreciate in Villeneuve’s Part Two, but the material in the second and third acts of Herbert’s story would have benefited from being as decompressed as the first act was. Not that this needed to be a trilogy either, but misplaced priorities kneecap some of Villenueve’s better instincts. Part Two picks up shortly after the end of the 2021 film, offering no recap. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are following Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and his band of desert-dwelling Fremen back to their home. Chani (Zendaya) watches Paul, suspicious of the outsiders, and wary of Silgar’s growing belief that Paul is a promised messiah. Much of the film follows Jessica fanning the flames of belief in Paul as this mythical savior, Paul’s relationship with Chani, and the Fremen’s struggle to take their planet back from the hostile, monochromatic Harkonnens.  Much of Dune involves diatribes on leadership, the art of war, ecology, and religion. Villenueve’s take on the material, at least on first viewing, feels akin to that of Zack Snyder’s Watchmen: a faithful translation of the plot of the source material to the screen, but without a larger understanding of what it means. While Part Two sees Paul wrestle with his desire to take power for himself, Villenueve seems so convinced that Paul must be the hero that he also ought to be the hero of the story, with little actual interrogation for what it means for a white-coded outsider to lead an indigenous-coded people to liberation. Once again, there is so much focus on the material world within Herbet’s Dune that the world of the mind–and Dune is a highly psychedelic work–feels almost entirely forgotten. While aiming for the look of Lawrence of Arabia and Apocalypse Now, the images lack meaning because basically each character is assigned a role and is destined to fulfill that role perfectly, without challenge. While the entire cast performs admirably–including Dune newcomers Austin Butler and Lea Seydoux–there are three performances that manage to elevate this epic beyond the too-dry confines of their predetermined arcs. Zendaya alone salvages much of the film, as her doubts about Paul’s leadership despite her personal love for him is by far the most interesting conflict in the film. She wants him to succeed because she cares about Paul the person, not the mythical “Lisan al-Gaib,” and she worries he will ultimately sell out the Fremen while he attempts to get his revenge for his father against the Harkonnens and the Emperor. There is more tension in her face than there is in most of the action scenes, and her final moments of the film are more moving than anything that has come in the previous five hours of this adaptation.  On the other side of the ideological divide, Javier Bardem is incredible as Stilgar, the Fremen leader and true believer in Paul’s ascension to godhood. His enthusiasm is rendered by Bardem as a mix between fatherly affection and worshipful admiration, and Bardem conveys both so earnestly it will make you believe in these prophecies. It is a powerful performance and one of the most nonjudgmental depictions of religious fervor ever brought to screen.  The most welcome addition to the cast of characters is Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan. Trained by the Bene Gesserit (the same order of psychic space nuns that Jessica belongs to), she is a scholar and has a deep understanding of political machinations. Her commentary and outside view adds scope beyond the planet at the center of the story, and Pugh brings a much needed ethereal and grandiose vibe to the otherwise too-physical epic. Irulan is mysterious and removed, but allows for some of the bigger ideas in Dune to finally break through Villenuene’s sometimes overly stark production design. While I have some major complaints about the overall direction and feel of this Dune adaptation, the execution feels largely incontestable with one exception: Hans Zimmer’s score. There are no soaring strings or mournful phrases, just the gnashing of loud machinery causing tonal issues throughout the film. Zimmer’s music, as tracked to the film, does little to create the sense of sweeping epic or planetary romance. And it is work Zimmer is capable of doing, but here, he treats the entire orchestra like a blunt instrument.  Dune: Part Two is the kind of failure that comes so close to the mark as to make the gaps between the adaptation and the source material feel like canyons. There is plenty to enjoy about what made it to the screen, but it also feels like it only scratched the surface, a book report of a dense and thoughtful novel. The spice expands consciousness–I wish Denis Villeneuve had at least experimented with it before he decided to navigate the spaceways of this science fiction epic. "
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," After 2021’s “Dune” was relegated to the small screen in the wake of pandemic related theatre closings, this weekend, the long awaited “Dune Part 2” brings the thunder, debuting on screens suitable for the story’s epic scale. The sci fi saga starring, well, almost everyone, in a sprawling cast headed by Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya and the giant sandworms who are literally and figuratively the film’s biggest stars, will play exclusively in theatres. Wrestling novelist Frank Herbert’s expansive story of a psychedelic drug called Spice and reluctant messiah Paul Atreides, into a comprehensible movie has confounded filmmakers for decades. Most notably, David Lynch adapted the 1965 novel into a noble 1984 failure. The story is complex, with many characters and big, brainy concepts. As a result, the spectacle of “Part 2,” on its own, isn’t for casual viewers. The last movie ended with Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) saying “This is only the beginning,” which means the new film isn’t a sequel, or a reboot. It’s a continuation, the second part of the story director Denis Villeneuve began in 2021, and to understand the story, you have to see the first film. Equal parts action packed and philosophical, “Part Two” picks up where “Dune” left off. Set 8,000 years in the future, Atreides (Chalamet) son of an aristocratic family, and once heir to the planet of Arrakis, a desolate, almost inhabitable place, but rich in the lucrative, and psychedelic Spice, that is home to the Indigenous Fremen people. Betrayed by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), the former steward of Arrakis, the family is all but wiped out, with Atreides and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), left in the desert to die. If they are to survive it will be with the help of the Fremen—including Chani and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), leader of the Fremen tribe at Sietch Tabr—who call Atreides “The Chosen One” and believe he is a prophet with the power to bring peace to their world. “Part 2” sees Atreides embedded with the Fremin in a mission of revenge against the House Harkonnen, the treacherous Baron, his sinister nephews, the brutish Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), who Atreides holds responsible for the death of his father. Fighting gallantly alongside the Fremin, he’s mostly unconcerned with their belief that he is their messiah. His feelings for Chanti and his thirst for creating a conflict that will place him within striking distance of Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), and Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the Emperor’s Truthsayer, Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), are top of mind. There is so much more, but that is essentially the peg on which Villeneuve hangs his epic vision of Herbert’s tale. The director gives voice to the author’s study of vengeance, spirituality, fanaticism, liberation and conquest, articulating the story’s humanist nuances in the framework of a film that can only be described as a spectacle. It’s a bigger, wilder vision, an answer to the stately elegance of the first film. The action sequences fill the screen. Villeneuve overwhelms the senses with grand images of desert warfare and Atreides sand surfing courtesy of giant “grandfather sand worms.” It’s blockbuster filmmaking writ large, exciting and laced with high stakes. Perfect for IMAX screens. But the action sequences wouldn’t mean much if the film’s world building and characters didn’t set the stage. Arrakis is a sand swept hell, so immersive you’ll think you have sand in your underpants by the time the end credits roll. The vision of the planet is aided considerably by Greig Fraser’s gorgeous cinematography. The devil, though, is in the details. On an arid planet, the Fremin syphon water from the bodies of their vanquished enemies to use in their cooling systems. Minutiae like this, and more, give the story depth, creating an exciting world for the characters to inhabit. The stacked cast of a-listers deliver. Chalamet’s character comes of age on his hero’s journey, shedding any boyish traits Atreides may have had, to become a worm riding warrior and leader of armies. Also making a mark is Butler as the eyebrow-challenged Feyd-Rautha (the part played by Sting in the Lynch’s adaptation). He maintains the rock star swagger of Elvis, his best-known role, but brings the danger as the sadistic nephew and heir. What Villeneuve isn’t good at, are endings. His first “Dune” film left audiences hanging, finishing up with no definitive ending. The end of “Dune Part 2” doesn’t dangle in quite the same way, but tensions are still unfolding as the end credits roll. Looks like we’ll have a “Part 3” coming in a couple years. Despite the open-ended conclusion, however, “Dune Part 2,” with its stunning visuals, deep emotional core and good performances, suggests “Part 3” will be worth the wait.

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune&#58; Part Two is a true cinematic experience&#46; It needs to be seen on the big screen&#46;
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE," Long live the fighters. After over two years of waiting, it’s time for audiences to return to Arrakis in Dune: Part Two, the latest sci-fi epic from director Denis Villeneuve. This movie adapts the second half of Frank Herbert’s classic novel. It once again stars Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, getting revenge on the people who destroyed his family. This is one of the most widely anticipated movies of 2024, and for good reason. This is a cinematic, monumental film that is sure to blow audiences away with its pure spectacle. It’s amazing how Dune: Part Two expands the world of the original. We saw glimpses of Chani and the Fremen in the first Dune film, but that film holds off a lot for the next film. This movie gives us the story we were waiting for, developing Chani more as a character than simply a person in Paul’s dreams. Not only do Villeneuve and his production team perfectly translate the world from Herbert’s novel to the big screen, but they truly immerse you in this breathtaking landscape of Arrakis, with space worms and conflicts and all of the things fans of the book can hope to see. Dune: Part Two expertly develops the lore and mythology that was established in the first film. It enriches the characters in ways that we had not seen before, progressing them to new places. Paul’s character has a stronger motivation, drawing him forward in this movie. He is after revenge after his father was killed in the previous movie. Although this is the goal that drives him forward, it does not always feel like the goal that drives the story forward. It can feel like an afterthought in a movie that has so many characters and story threads going on at once when that goal could have benefitted from being at the forefront. However, this film shines during its thrilling action sequences. While the Dune movies are not your traditional action films, they feature grand, masterful stuntwork and visuals that Villeneuve handles perfectly. He does an excellent job of framing the explosions and danger in the same shot as the characters to really sell the power of these scenes. The sound design is also sublime, building tension at all the right moments and grabbing your attention. This film features the most incredible spectacle of the year. The performances Villeneuve pulls from his actors are also quite impressive. Dune: Part Two features a career-best performance from Chalamet, who manages to be a morally ambiguous character that gets you on his side while also performing acts that are not traditional for a typical hero. Zendaya gets much more screen time in this movie, and she is as spectacular as always in this role. Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgård reprise their roles from the first film, and they are all magnetic. This is one of the strongest ensemble casts we’ve seen in a movie in a long time. However, Dune: Part Two also features a few newcomers. The most notable is Austin Butler. When the first Dune came out, Butler had not yet made his Oscar-nominated turn in Elvis. However, now that he has reached superstardom, he’s the perfect choice for a role in this film. He plays Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, and he is nothing short of magnificent. Those complaining that he has stuck too closely with the Elvis voice have nothing to worry about with this role. He transforms once again. Not only does the makeup make him unrecognizable, but his villainous performance is also creepy and unsettling. It’s amazing to see a handsome star shake it all off and allow his pure talent to speak for itself. He’s marvelous in this movie. We also have Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken joining the cast this time. They are two excellent actors who give superb performances here. Walken gives the best performance he’s given in years, and Pugh’s accent work is fantastic as usual. Although the performances are great across the board, one of the weaker elements is the romance between Paul and Chani. It’s in the marketing, and it’s what we expect from the two leads of the film, but there isn’t enough chemistry for the romance to feel organic. It happens, and we just accept it, but I can’t help but feel like if we weren’t watching two incredibly popular young stars like Chalamet and Zendaya perform this romance, it would not be very compelling. Dune: Part Two features some incredible shot choices, and you can see Villeneuve’s passion for the source material in every frame. He wanted to make an adaptation worthy of that novel, and he succeeded. It pays off everything the first movie sets up, throwing the characters into action and pushing Paul to more interesting, darker places. The story runs out of steam during the second act, but the final act is so mesmerizing that it makes up for it. It features a finale for the ages while being a feast for the eyes. Greig Fraser’s breathtaking cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s powerful musical score complement an unforgettable sci-fi experience worthy of the big screen. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 7 equates to “Good.” A successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out, but it may not appeal to everyone.

"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,&apos;Dune Part Two&apos; is another stunning sci-fi achievement from director Denis Villenueve&#46;
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two wraps up his vision for the adaptation of the first book in Frank Herbert's Dune series in an epic action film with complex themes that delivers on the promise of 2021’s Dune.  There are battles, dark enemies, hidden agendas, betrayals, issues of fate, and a coming-of-age love story, here all played out against Villeneuve’s gorgeous visual canvas.  Dune part one focused on the royal Atreides family, sent by the emperor to run the spice operation on the planet, and who were ultimately betrayed.  Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) was murdered by a rival family, the brutal Harkonnens, who want to take back control of Arrakis.  Leto's son and heir Paul Atreides (Timothée Chamalet) and Leto’s consort (and Paul’s mother) Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) escaped with their lives and fell into the hands of a group of Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Dune: Part Two picks up a few hours later. Paul and Lady Jessica have been grudgingly taken in by the Fremen.  Then there's Chani (Zendaya), a young warrior who represents a different generation and who rejects these beliefs as superstition. Paul has been having visions since before coming to Arrakis, and in particular of Chani. The two have a deep connection that feels like fate, and ultimately fall into a romantic relationship.  But war — led by the brutal Beast Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) — comes to the north and to the Fremen. Despite Paul's apocalyptic visions, the Fremen must make choices about whether they’ll move to the south.  As well, Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica, who is already a secretive character, becomes more so. She is a Bene Gesserit, part of an order of women trained to master significant mystical powers, under the command of a powerful Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling).  Stilgar, who has threatened her life, forces her to become the Reverend Mother of the Fremen in a dangerous and possibly deadly ceremony. Surviving it makes her deeper and darker. Unbeknownst to anyone except Paul, she's pregnant, and is communicating with her fetus who has strong prophetic skills. Behind the scenes, the emperor (Christopher Walken) pulls the strings, and with his daughter Princess Irulin (Florence Pugh) as his heir, considers how to hold on to their power by manipulating the various players.  As well, Villeneuve has created exciting action sequences, which are big sensory experiences, meant to be seen on the big screen, while simultaneously paying attention to details and small gestures. With so much going on it might benefit from a second viewing to take it all in.  But as it moves to its conclusion, what really hits are the undercurrents. The world of Dune is rife with secrecy and clandestine agendas.  There are power struggles in every relationship that we see; people vying for power, for wealth, all tied to deeply felt and long held belief systems that keep them in a perpetual state of antagonism and war. Both Paul and Chani, in their way, are seeing through each other the potential of a different way to live.  The action, the battles, the love story… all of this continues through the film, but as it progresses it subtly turns, leading us to some bigger, and heavier themes such as the pointlessness of war, the dangers of religious fanaticism, fascism, and the questions of people who find themselves swept up in fate.  It works as pure action, but with all of this, Dune: Part Two is a potent and layered film. Dune: Part Two. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. Written by Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. Starring Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautisa, Christopher Walken, Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, and Charlotte Rampling. In theatres March 1."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Saying that this film should be an hour longer sounds more loving that I intend&#44; though my intentions are positive&#46; As the conflict expands wider&#44; the movie deserved to have the time and space that it allowed everything else in the film&#46; 
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL," “This is only the beginning”, said Zendaya’s rebel warrior Chani minutes after being introduced during the abrupt conclusion of Dune: Part One. “This isn’t over yet,” she announces towards the end of Dune: Part Two, confirming that what was supposed to be the concluding part of this cleaved-in-two adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi door-stopper is nothing of the sort. It may pick up directly where the first film ended, but almost from the off it starts seeding a third instalment – something that will likely delight Dune diehards and dismay Dune agnostics. That Herbert’s gargantuan space saga has plenty of material to draw from is in little doubt (he wrote five sequels, after all). Still, it remains a little disheartening that for all director Denis Villeneuve’s technical mastery and startling compositions, the man behind modern classics Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 seems to have been infected by the hedge-your-bets, never-ending-movie approach of Marvel and latter-day Star Wars movies. Why have one comprehensive film when you can defer audience gratification indefinitely by setting up several more? Despite all the world-building of Part One, then, Part Two – awash though it is with spectacularly imagined battle sequences, giant sand worms and trippy imagery – still manages to get a little lost in the minutiae of protagonist Paul Atreides’ perilous journey towards fulfilling his “chosen one” destiny. The result is a film that feels simultaneously too long and weirdly rushed as it navigates all the political treachery, Machiavellian sorcery and religious zealotry involved in taming the spice planet of Arrakis while Paul (once again played by Timothée Chalamet) wrestles with the messiah complex forced upon him. But is he really the messiah or, as Monty Python might put it, just a very naughty boy? That’s the question driving the film and, though it’s harder than you might think to forget The Life of Brian while watching the big scenes directly debating Paul’s messianic bona fides, the film does deserve some credit for at least attempting to challenge its own white saviour narrative. The problem is that it doesn’t replace it with anything more interesting. Despite being built around Chalamet’s character, his arc feels oddly truncated – all the time spent setting him up as a noble ally and romantic partner for Zendaya’s mistrustful Freman soldier is, in the end, too easily reversed for the darker path he ultimately seems to be on to have the dramatic impact it should. The thrill of seeing Florence Pugh introduced in the film’s opening minutes, meanwhile, is promptly diminished by her disappearance from the action until well into the second hour – by which point her character’s centrality to Paul’s journey is relegated to a couple of underpowered scenes that hint at bigger stuff to come. Ditto a subplot involving a sentient foetus that later takes the brief, distracting shape of Anya Taylor-Joy at the very point things should be hurtling towards a proper reckoning with Paul. A-list stars are like wallpaper in this movie. There are highlights too, of course. A hairless Austin Butler, playing a psychotic member of the already grotesque Harkonnens, enlivens proceedings as the new nemesis cherry-picked for Paul by a coven of clairvoyant priestesses intent on fine-tuning their own hallucinatory prophecy. It’s easy, too, to get sucked into some of the amped-up spectacle of Villeneuve’s action sequences, especially the way he uses light and shadow to stage enormous battle scenes under the unforgiving glare of the desert sun. Yet more than five hours into this saga, and with no real end in sight, all that super-sized spectacle ends up like footprints in a sandstorm: barely leaving an impression beyond the end credits. Nevertheless, Villeneuve’s baggy epic is preferable to Spaceman, an existential sci-fi vehicle for Adam Sandler that quickly devolves into a specious tale of self-pitying male neurosis. Directed by prestige TV veteran Johan Renck, the film revolves around an astronaut (Sandler) in the final stages of a solo mission to Jupiter to investigate a cloud of space dust responsible for turning the sky purple back on Earth. We join Sandler’s Jakub just as the isolation is starting to take a severe mental toll, one exacerbated by his precarious marriage to Lenka (Carey Mulligan), now heavily pregnant and newly resigned to leaving him. The latter is information to which he’s not yet privy thanks to Isabella Rossellini’s head of mission control suppressing the Dear John video message Lenka has already sent him. Still, he knows something’s not right – a fact made boringly literal by the giant talking spider he discovers on board his ship soon after contact with Lenka is severed. Voiced by Paul Dano, said arachnid informs Jakub that he’s studying his memories to better understand humanity, which is really just a conveniently cutesy way for the film to force its protagonist to reflect on his relationship and his own self-involved part in its demise. Full of therapy-speak platitudes that repeatedly restate the not-terribly-deep themes, the script thoroughly undercuts itself by reducing Mulligan’s character to little more than a catalyst for the banal journey of self-discovery Sandler’s character goes on, which in turn diminishes Sandler’s performance, ensuring it comes off as a morose, shallow riff on the more complex roles he’s played in the likes of Punch-Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories. The film, meanwhile, jettisons the deadpan humour implicit in the concept in pursuit of some pseudo-profound yet heavily sentimentalised update of Solaris. It doesn’t work at all."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Given the absolute majestic, expansive nature of Frank Herbert‘s 1965 novel, it makes sense as to why director Denis Villeneuve insisted that his story be told across a necessary 5 hour split.  No doubt using David Lynch’s ambitious failure as something of a cautionary tale – the auteur continually rejecting his association with his own 1984 adaptation, which suffered as much through his own misunderstanding of the material as it did the studio insisting on a more accessible running time – Villeneuve has a grasp on pacing this epic slow-burn of a tale in a manner that honours the material and respects the audience’s patience and intelligence. After the original film, Dune: Part One, suffered pandemic-related delays from its original 2020 release, before releasing in late 2021 to positive reviews and Oscar glory (it ultimately took home 6 Academy Awards out of the 10 nominations it earned), Dune: Part Two is similarly coming off the back of an original delay, this time related to the writer’s strike, finally unveiling its glory after almost-4 months. Encapsulating the notion of being worth the wait – though purists are likely to flag missing characters and sequences from the novel – Part Two wastes no time in continuing on from its predecessor, with Timothée Chalamet‘s Paul (the actor effortlessly commanding), heir to the noble House Atreides, and Zendaya‘s Chani, a Fremen warrior native to the planet Arrakis, falling in with one another as he is brought in to her desert tribe.  Though the original film understandably utilised Zendaya’s presence in their marketing, her appearance was minimal (to say the least), serving as mainly a narrator and a figure within Paul’s prophetic visions.  Here, audiences can be rest assured that her role is substantial, with Chani emerging as the narrative’s moral center. Given the world building Herbert created, Villeneuve is taking on no small task with both chapters of his Dune vision, but the director’s visual prowess, and his ability to utilise the collective talent he has on board effectively, allows this very human story to transcend the pillars of spectacularity it could so easily fall on.  Part Two is perhaps a more action-driven effort overall, but Paul’s inner circle all representing alternate angles of war means the film centres itself thematically. Paul is ultimately caught in the middle of his surroundings, unable to accept the horrid visions he has of the future, whilst Chani, his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the Fremen leader, and Gurney (Josh Brolin), his former weapon’s instructor, all express their own desires and how they are best served by Paul’s loyalty.  It may come as a shock to some that Jessica and Gurney, arguably two fan favourite characters, are painted in a more sinister light here, but their motivations are clear and they are far from being billed as a simplistic villain in the most basic form of the word; Jessica, in particular, has the most interesting arc throughout as she attains the status of Reverend Mother in a bid to exploit the Fremen religion and realise Paul’s gifts in a stronger capacity than it would appear he cares for.  Ferguson has such a captivating presence, and the change between her nurturing temperament and something more sinister proves intoxicating throughout. Where the film is more black-and-white in its portrayal of villainy – and not just because there’s a sequence dedicated to these characters’ brutality in a monochromatic setting – is through the Harkonnen collective, overseen by Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård).  Skarsgård’s performance is heavily tied to his character’s disgusting physicality, but he never submits to the type of theatricality it could have easily given way to; similarly, Dave Bautista as his brutish nephew Rabban displays a restraint throughout.  The same can’t be said for Austin Butler.  There’s been considerable hype surrounding the actor’s appearance in the film, and he definitely adheres to a more scene-chewing mentality as Feyd-Rautha, and, when he isn’t speaking, it’s quite effective.  He does so much with his face that his monstrousness practically seeps out, and though not necessarily a slight on him as a performer, the vocal tone he has adopted for his speech proves far from menacing and, sadly, threatens to undo the imposing nature he quite naturally exudes. Ultimately though, it’s a minor qualm within a bigger film that’s bleakly beautiful to witness, and manages a sense of naturality in its exposition-necessary narrative.  Villeneuve is so masterful at making Dune‘s story appear comprehensible, both honouring the material the best he can for those familiar and creating an accessible point for the uninitiated; there’s certainly a political and topical relevance on hand too, with warfare, tribal destruction, climate change, and ill-equipped figures seeking power woven across the film’s dense 167 minutes. Whilst a Part Three isn’t necessarily guaranteed – and this concludes in a way that’s satisfying enough should we not earn a continuation – Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts (Dune: Part One, Passengers, Prometheus) certainly lay the foundation, with the character of Alia – Paul’s sister who we briefly see as an adult in his visions (and just in case you aren’t aware who it’s portrayed by, I won’t spoil the cameo) and predominantly as a fetus communicating with Jessica – possibly being set up as a future protagonist, akin to the novel “Dune Messiah”.  Her presence doesn’t clutter the film, but it’s a smart ploy on Villeneuve’s behalf to limit her presence and only tease her importance, with Part Two already a busy enough production; Christopher Walken (as a scheming emperor), Florence Pugh (as his analytical daughter), and Léa Seydoux (as a cunning seductress) all feeling the pinch of the stacked ensemble with limited screen time, but delivering regardless. Doing justice to Herbert’s vision was always going to be no small feat, and though it makes sense as to why Hollywood left it alone following Lynch’s misinterpretation, this reinvigoration is perfectly in tune with Villeneuve’s unmatched ambition and creativity.  Big, bold, and equally grim as it is amorous, Dune: Part Two inimitably balances its blockbuster psyche with an uncomfortable morality. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Twice the spice is twice as nice in ""Dune: Part Two,"" an electrifying sand-blasted epic, and an improvement in every way over 2021's kinda clumsy, kinda wonky ""Dune."" Or maybe that first ""Dune"" was just too much to take in, especially as it was released when we were still very much in a pandemic haze. Also, Frank Herbert's original 1965 novel is such a dense text that it would take an academic to set straight the inner and outer workings of the Houses Atreides, Harkonnen and Corrino, the planets Arrakis and Caladan, the origin of spice, the religious parallels on display and the overall vastness of its undertakings. Still, ""Dune: Part Two"" simply moves better than its predecessor, and what director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve does here is synthesize all his varying elements into a coherent package that, while still bursting at the seams, is quite a journey to behold. The experience of ""Dune: Part Two"" is about strapping on those goggles, jumping on the back of that giant sandworm and going along for the ride. At nearly three hours, ""Dune: Part Two"" is still a lot of movie, itself enough for two individual parts. Consider the fact that it opens with Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), who are not seen again on screen for an hour and 15 minutes, or that Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck pops up at around the two-hour mark after not being seen at all prior. (You're forgiven if you forgot that Brolin is a big part of Part One; Oct. 2021 feels like a lifetime ago.) You'd need more than two hands to count all the stars in ""Dune: Part Two"" — there's seven Oscar nominees in the cast, two of them winners — but let's start with Timothée Chalamet, who plays messiah figure Paul Atreides, the is-he-or-isn't-he question of his messiah status providing one of the backbones of the film. When we last left him, he had traveled to the desert planet Arrakis and was falling for Chani (Zendaya), who is part of the Fremen force of resistance fighters locked in a battle over control of spice, the enriching space dust, the power over which rules all. Paul may or may not be the savior the Fremen have long been waiting for, and as he learns the ways of the desert — including riding monster sandworms like he's big wave surfing — his destiny is becoming hard to deny. Meanwhile, on a planet that has been sapped of color and lies underneath the kind of Black Hole Sun that Soundgarden once mythologized about, a psychotic young fighter, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, is coming into his own. He's played by ""Elvis'"" Austin Butler, and if you didn't believe it then, believe it now: the 32-year-old is the real deal, and he's a terrifying presence under his bald head, shaved eyebrows and tar black teeth. He slits throats without a half a thought and the utter jolt of his menace makes the movie come alive. He's exactly the element the somewhat sleepy first part of ""Dune"" lacked. Simplifying things as much as possible — this is, after all, a 900-page book the script is working from — Chalamet and Butler's characters are the good and bad guy pitted against each other, as the fate of the universe more or less hangs in the balance. It's the year 10,191, the spice is hot, and Villeneuve cooks up some indelible scenes and bold imagery in his magnum desert opus, the nerd-out space-geek rock opera you've been waiting for. (Hans Zimmer's bellowing score aims to blow out your eardrums, and he nearly succeeds.) Across ""Dune's"" vast universe of characters, we also get Dave Bautista as Feyd-Rautha's seething brother, Javier Bardem as the noble leader of the Fremen, Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, Pugh and Walken as leaders from another planet, and still more characters — played by Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgård, Léa Seydoux, Anya Taylor-Joy and more — that all carry their own mythologies and could warrant their own chapters in the series. Yes, series: ""Dune: Part Two"" is set up for more, potentially lots more, and where that seemed like a daunting proposition after the first film it's now welcomed with open arms. If the ""Dune"" movies can be as smart, sound, faithful and handsome as this, it would be a shame to not keep going. Villeneuve's touch as a director, since he started going capital-B-Big with 2016's ""Arrival,"" has been blockbusters that are at once magnificent in scope and tethered in execution, mega-movies at human scale, which viewers can still touch and feel themselves inside. He's a stickler for visuals, and ""Dune: Part Two"" looks fabulous while remaining tactile; there is an army of CGI on display, no question, but it doesn't feel like one of those computer generated messes that are clogging multiplexes. Care has been taken to make it look as real as possible, and you're never taken out of the film by something that seems synthetic. The spell he casts is never broken. The 28-year-old Chalamet, so warm and lovable in ""Wonka,"" wears his hero status here well: He's a fighter, he's a savior, he's a dreamboat, and he's proving to be one of the most versatile young stars in Hollywood. Butler, meanwhile, nearly steals the show, but the movie is set up for him that way, and he answers the call. Together, the pair make up ""Dune's"" dynamite duo. This is quite a world Villeneuve has built, and the patience he practices in his storytelling pays off. It's exquisite big budget filmmaking at the highest level, rich and rewarding, with top-notch visuals, an incredible cast of actors and a story that is at once both grounded and out of this world. Your worm is waiting, jump on and hang on tight."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Because watching Dune 2 you really and truly feel as if an entire fucking world has been built right in front of you. An entire fucking universe. And it feels so much bigger and more consequential than anything Marvel has ever accomplished because there are actual ideas at work here -- ideas about religion and politics and not just ""I gots bad Daddy issues, wahhh."" Although yes there's some Daddy issues too, for good measure.  Though its Mommy Issues are more exciting, given how Rebecca Ferguson basically walks away with the entire film. Everything Villenueve is saying about religion here is absolutely vicious (and, you know, spot on) and Ferguson (and to a less seen but no less vicious extent Charlotte Rampling) relishes the shit out of it -- like she did in Doctor Sleep she's so good at being so cold-hearted and weird and cruel! I bow down, really and truly. She is the queen we demand. Speaking of, Timothée is good -- like he did in The King he surprises me every time he can muster a genuine sense of command; that the waif-like frailty we all know and love doesn't snap under the pressure of screaming orders at enormous crowds. That said I found it hysterically funny how big his hair got in the last act as Paul gets more powerful -- I guess Damian in Mean Girls was right. But it's a real Sigourney in Ghostbusters Gatekeeper type glow-up, volume-wise. He got a blow out. Power blow!"
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Hay un gesto en Dune 2 que es una declaración de intenciones. Este instante ocurre al final y ni siquiera aquellos familiarizados con la novela de Frank Herbert lo anticipan. A simple vista, parece una acción sencilla: un personaje se da la vuelta y abandona una habitación. Sin embargo, esta aparente simplicidad está cargada de grandeza y fuerza.  Dune 2 destaca por varias razones, pero todas convergen en un punto central: Denis Villeneuve. El director no teme desviarse del material original (el libro de Herbet publicado en 1965) cuando lo considera necesario. El gesto mencionado antes es solo un ejemplo de su saber hacer. Es su reconocimiento de que ciertos aspectos de la novela ya no encajan con nuestra época y, por lo tanto, es necesario tomar un camino diferente. Es dirigirse al personaje y decirle: ""Eres importante y quiero que lo sepas. Tanto tú como el espectador"". Esto es aplicable a todos los aspectos de la película: la interpretación, la dirección visual, el desarrollo de personajes, el sonido y la narración.  La secuela empieza donde terminó Dune (2022). Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) y su madre Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) se han unido a los Fremen, los nativos de Arrakis -planeta codiciado porque en él se encuentra la preciada especia melange- liderados por Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Entre ellos se encuentra también Chani (Zendaya), la chica que Paul ve en sus sueños. El protagonista va adaptándose a vivir como un nativo más mientras el emperador de la Galaxia y los Harkonnen le dan por muerto.  Hay nuevos añadidos en Dune 2. Christopher Walken da vida al emperador y Florence Pugh a su misteriosa e inteligente hija bene gessreit Irulan. Austin Butler, por su parte, debuta como el sádico Feyd-Rautha.  A oídos de todos llega la noticia de que una figura mesiánica está entre los Fremen. Ese es Paul, quien representa el choque religioso en los Fremen. Por un lado están los adultos creyentes del sur. Por otro, los jóvenes terrenales del norte que creen que ese mesías del que hablan las profecías no va a salvar a su pueblo de la opresión. Para ellos, los Fremen salvarán a los Fremen. Siltgar es de los primeros. Chani de los segundos.  Hablando de Chani. Ella es uno de los personajes que más se desvía de la obra original. Su cambio es radical y arriesgado, alejándola del destino que Herbert le asignó. Esta audaz decisión resulta efectiva y, para quienes han leído el libro, anticipar el futuro que el director le reserva a Chani es emocionante. Aquí radica gran parte de la épica de la película. Dune 2 no solo va de emocionantes secuencias de acción, también residentes en ella un profundo sentimiento poético que contribuye a ofrecer su mejor versión. Dune 2 es una experiencia cinematográfica excepcional, rara de encontrar en una sala de cine. No se repetirá, pero dejará huella en el futuro. Cuando la ves, como espectadora, te sientes valorada y completamente satisfecha. Cuando ves Dune 2, no tienes dudas: estás frente a una obra maestra de la ciencia ficción."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE," The second part of Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s spice opera, “Dune: Part Two,” is bigger and bolder than the first installment, with sequences that range from beguiling and creative to brutal and commanding. Yet, he finds himself making some of the same mistakes that injured his 2021 feature. This culminates with a disorganized and messy storytelling procedure. For each step forward the visionary French-Canadian filmmaker makes, he takes three steps back.  Putting my reservations about the French-Canadian filmmaker aside, I believe Denis Villeneuve is a visionary filmmaker with many tricks up his sleeve. He has put the textured dramas and thrillers (“Polytechnique”, “Sicario”) aside for a broader, more luxurious scope in the sci-fi genre (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049”). However, he still finds a way to provide some of his latest pictures with the elements that make his features intriguing, at the very least: placing the viewer inside the world of characters who feel lost in their respective environments. Some more effective than others, he has managed to build a massive career for himself due to his imagination and intuition, following the steps of Christopher Nolan and James Cameron.  Although he has already crafted films based on source material, his latest project is definitely the biggest challenge of his career: adapting Frank Herbert’s influential novel, “Dune.” He isn’t the first director to step up to the plate. There have been some that try to put the acclaimed book onto the big screen. Legendary (and far better, if you’d ask me) filmmakers like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky have tried to adapt it. However, they failed to do so for various reasons—loss of creative control, budgetary reasons, and a vision lost in the translation from page to film. But that isn’t going to stop him. And, if any other filmmaker working today could have managed to create something worth and equating to the scope it warrants, it would be Villeneuve.  In-between spectacle and mediocrity lay Villeneuve’s first “Dune” film, which feels like a curtain raiser rather than a fully-fledged project. As it ran its course, nothing actually happened, and it dared to end with the line: “This is only the beginning.” It was a baffling experience, if I’m being candid. Yet, I still hoped for whatever he would bring to the table next time. And so the spice opera continues, with the much-anticipated sequel, “Dune: Part Two” finally arriving in theaters after multiple delays due to the actor’s strike.  This time, Villeneuve’s vision is more significant in scope and bolder in his stylistic decisions. The world Paul Atraides (Timothée Chalamet) and the Fremen inhabit feels more defined than ever before. The Fremen and Paul’s relationship with them is given more focus this time around. In terms of narrative, there are far more tangibilities in the cursed relations between “the messiah” and “his people.” The sands of Arrakis sway through the atmosphere. It covers the cinema in spice as the kaleidoscopic yet monotone color-wise visuals hold the viewer in a trance. However, he made the same mistakes that cursed his first film in 2021. For every step forward Denis Villeneuve makes, he unfortunately takes two or three steps back. It makes this spice opera sequel lack the necessary tension, melancholy, and dread that arises from the malevolent rise of Paul Atraides—whose rancor and malice will be seen in ‘Dune: Messiah’ if the director decides to tackle it. “Dune: Part Two” picks up immediately after the first one, where we see Paul (Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) learning the costumes and traditions of the Fremen. They have recently joined Chani’s (Zendaya) group and are on their way to meet the elders. This comes after plenty of drawbacks from the people. The divide themselves into two sections: the ones who believe that Paul is the messiah and those who don’t. Curiosity and suspicion arise among the people. There’s no evidence that Paul is indeed “the one” who will save them. Some even believe they are spies for the Harkonnen or another blood-seeking empire. But that’s why he is being tested and constantly watched. These first few interactions are some of the film’s most interesting scenes, where the division arises discourse amongst the Fremen. Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is trying to make most of the crowd believe in the arrival of the Kwisatz Haderach, later given the name of Muad’Dib—the one who, as the prophecy states, will “lead the people to true freedom and the Promised Land,” a place with life and nurture. As all of this transpires, the Harkonnen have regained control of spice production on Arrakis due to Baron Vladimir’s (Stellan Skarsgård) genocidal attacks. And the rise of a new heir to the planet covered in spice, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), is coming for blood. This first act shows plenty of montages and collages as if we were in a Terrence Malick film.  This is meant to be a time lapse between Paul learning the customs and Lady Jessica evolving into the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. She will be the one who will later give birth to the sacrilege “Abomination”. Accompanied by the narration of Princess Irulan Corrino (Florence Pugh), these montages are used a bit much, and Villeneuve cuts too many corners in the process. I understand this is way better than doing a bunch of exposition dumps concurrently. But the overreliance on this method is what bothers me a lot. The one thing I did enjoy is the scenes in which Villeneuve uses “2001: A Space Odyssey” as inspiration. The unborn baby of Lady Jessica speaks to her as if the creation is manipulating its succubus.  Everything involving Rebecca Furguson’s character managed to intrigue me. Not because of how she portrays the character or her astonishing performance but because of how Villeneuve depicts this inner consumption of the mind, body, and soul. That’s when I finally thought that Villeneuve was nailing it for once, managing to create substance out of a source material difficult to grasp in the cinematic language. In those moments, I found myself entirely moved by the story itself. There’s also a vision scene that has some of the best lines in the film. It spoke about fate versus free will. The inescapability of the latter is in contrast with how the former can lead to significant obstructions in the future. We saw how the characters were challenging themselves with mental bouts.  Denis Villeneuve’s bolder ideas are coming to fruition so that you can sense both the passion for the source material and the impact of the narrative’s development. But that feeling doesn’t last for long. As it runs its course, the storytelling decisions become less than the sum of its parts. Another issue I have is how the Fremen’s religion is given an occasional comedic angle. This is seen through Bardem’s character. It takes the seriousness of the source material’s notions. Coincidentally, it takes the viewer out of the experience.  Another element that does the same damage is the performance by Austin Butler. He graces his brutal character with an utterly ridiculous Southern Elvis-like accent. Butler doesn’t feel like he is acting in the same film as the rest of the cast. If he were a menacing antagonist, it would be fine. But his aura doesn’t ooze malice; he just stands out because of his poor decisions acting-wise. With his pantomime line-reading, Christopher Walken is far more of a threat than the vicious character Butler is playing. Almost hitting the three-hour mark, “Dune: Part Two” still feels incomplete when looking at the whole picture.  In each act, you think that bits and pieces are missing to get a proper multidimensional adaptation. You can make the case that everything in the book isn’t going to fit into that runtime. “Dune: Part Two” needs more time and a broader canvas to ensure it is a pure adaptation. Yet, the problem is that it feels like it is running out of story. And that’s why we see plenty of action set-pieces for the modern-day demographic sparse throughout each act. It wouldn’t bother me if these were shot with verve or brio. However, the misguided, fragmentary nature of this adaptation makes the final battle sequence lackluster. It is hasty, anti-climatic, and vacuous when considering the scope and canvas attached.

"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Villeneuve aptly weaves the disparate threads of family&#44; power&#44; mysticism&#44; religion&#44; politics&#44; and love in this second part of a strikingly visual film&#46; Climb into the sandbox for this one&#46; &#10;
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Paul Atreides, the central figure of the Dune series, is a very special boy. This is something the audience is told over and over, both in Frank Herbert’s first, totemic sci-fi novel and the Denis Villeneuve film adaptations that bifurcate its intricate narrative into two sand-swept epics. The first installment of Dune was all about Paul’s potential, surrounding him with vague prophecies of his future as an almighty conqueror while making him a refugee on the hostile planet Arrakis. Dune: Part Two sees that potential realized, transforming Paul from a stranger in a strange land into its messianic ruler. This journey is appropriately triumphant—and, just as important, tragic and terrifying. That’s what Villeneuve has consistently understood about Herbert’s books, which prior adaptations of Dune struggled to surface. Dune does follow a typical hero’s quest, with Paul surviving against all odds to become a great warrior and exact revenge for the death of his father. But through it all, Paul is conscious of the loss of humanity that comes with such victories, and the grievous human calculations demanded by the politics of war and resistance. Villeneuve’s film is a grand success, working on an even broader canvas than the first Dune—but it’s tinged with deep mournfulness, a quality that sets it apart from its blockbuster contemporaries. Dune: Part Two picks up right where the previous film left off, with Paul (played by Timothée Chalamet) and his mystic mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), joining a group of guerrilla warriors called the Fremen in the arid landscape of Arrakis. His family and allies have otherwise been annihilated by a rival aristocratic house called the Harkonnens, a hairless, pitiless cadre of fascists. So Paul assimilates into the Fremen world, learning to survive in the desert, ride the gigantic sandworms that populate it, and eventually gain enough local cred to woo Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen woman tasked with mentoring him. The first Dune was intent on laying out the complex royal intrigue of House Atreides’ arrival on Arrakis, but much of Dune: Part Two is about the nuances of Fremen life. Villeneuve is a director who cherishes the little details; he imbues his movies with an environmental fullness that rewards repeat viewings, and the joys of this film mostly come through Paul’s gradual understanding of a world so unlike his own. Javier Bardem brings some gruff humor to the role of Stilgar, the Fremen leader who takes Paul in, but it’s Zendaya who gets the plum role here, with Chani’s status greatly expanded beyond her function in the novel (where she is largely a secondary character). Chani and Paul’s romance is the emotional core of Dune: Part Two, but it’s also Villeneuve’s route for smuggling in skepticism about Paul’s growing power—something Herbert’s book only hinted at before expanding on it in future volumes. As the viewer is repeatedly informed, Paul is the alleged “Kwisatz Haderach,” a long-prophesied savior blessed with staggering psychic abilities. As Paul’s authority expands, however, Chani foresees doom at the end of his vengeful path, and wisely realizes that messiahs are often just another form of dictator. Zendaya has always overflowed with natural charisma, and this is the best performance I’ve seen her give on-screen. Chani balances her genuine affection for Paul with her terror of what he’s becoming, essentially functioning as the film’s beating heart as its supposed hero becomes more and more of an alien overlord. Chalamet is equally prepared for that challenge—although perfectly winning in the first Dune, he leans here into Paul’s remoteness, and unleashes waves of arresting magnetism where necessary. Dune: Part Two is about the burden of leadership, and it demonstrates that by having Paul feel relatable as the film begins and completely inscrutable by the end, better at commanding a crowd of thousands than talking to his closest allies. Where later, inspired-by works such as Star Wars smoothed Herbert’s novels into something more predictably heroic, Dune is filled with menace, even when the “good guys” start winning. Still, it’s hard not to root for Paul given the state of the bad guys. Stellan Skarsgård continues to have grumbly fun as the imposing Baron Harkonnen, with Dave Bautista barking madly as his despotic nephew Glossu “Beast” Rabban. The worthiest new addition is Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, a knife-wielding princeling who fancies himself to be Paul’s archenemy. Villeneuve shoots the Harkonnen-home-planet sequences in intensely contrasted black and white, lending a brutal starkness that makes Arrakis’s deserts seem almost welcoming. Butler brings a lot of psychotic joy to the proceedings, never letting Villeneuve’s seriousness overwhelm a bit of B-movie villainy. There are plenty of other eye-catching additions to the cast—Christopher Walken as the taciturn emperor, Florence Pugh as his chain-mail-wearing daughter. But the biggest star of Dune: Part Two may be its immersive environment: the giant ships landing and taking off, the colossal sandworms that rampage without a care in the world for imperial politics. Anytime the viewer might get tripped up by the proper nouns, Villeneuve is there to strike them with the power of Herbert’s universe. If there’s a film that can justify—and satisfy—such absurd storytelling scale, it’s this one."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," When Denis Villenueve’s remake of Dunedebuted in 2021, it was widely praised for its cinematography and grand-scale vision. But it also featured a complex story not helped by the fact that Villenueve had split the original book into two parts. Dune: Part Twohas finally arrived, and with it brings both the good and bad of the first film. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mom, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), having survived the attack by the House Harkonnen, are now embedded with the native Fremen in the vast desert on the planet Arrakis. Some Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), are suspicious of the newcomers, but Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul is the long-prophesied messiah, viewing everything he does – even renouncing the idea that he’s the messiah – as worthy of adulation. Part Two also introduces a host of new characters, including the elderly Emperor (Christopher Walken); his doting daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh); Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), the ambitious nephew of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård); and Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux), a scheming member of the highly-religious Bene Gesserit. All of these people and more play a part in either helping or hurting Paul’s rise to power. There is no argument that Villenueve knows how to create a visually-stunning film, even one that is as CGI-heavy as this. He and cinematographer Greig Fraser (who won an Oscar for Dune: Part One) bring out all the tricks this time around, showcasing a landscape that could otherwise be monotonous in myriad interesting ways. A switch to black-and-white makes a mid-film fight sequence pop, and scenes with hundreds or thousands of people in them feel appropriately epic. But once again, all of that visual splendor is in service of a story that is less than enthralling. Even though the nearly three-hour film would seem to give Villenueve and returning co-writer Jon Spaihts enough time to properly lay out the plot, they still choose to skip over seemingly key parts of certain characters’ arcs. This is especially true of the new characters, most of whom fail to make an impression, and even those who do are stuck with one-note journeys. This seems to be because Villenueve is more interested in setting up future Dune movies than dealing with the one at hand. For those who may not know, Frank Herbert wrote six Dune books (with 18 more written by his son after his death), so a full-blown Dune Cinematic Universe is possible. There are a lot of allusions to things that will come in the future, including the life of Paul’s unborn sister (seen in flash-forward form as Anya Taylor-Joy), but they come at the expense of understanding the here-and-now, most notably Paul’s transition to a god-like figure. Despite the story lack, Chalamet is a compelling presence in the lead role, ably demonstrating why he’s become one of the go-to young actors in Hollywood. The same goes for Zendaya, who finally gets a chance to shine after barely appearing in the first film. Butler goes over-the-top in a good way for his role, but Pugh is given next-to-nothing to do, a shame for someone with her talent. Bardem, Ferguson, and Josh Brolin make sure the older adults come off well, too. There is no shortage of sights and sounds to wow the senses in Dune: Part Two; the gigantic sandworms alone are worth the price of admission. But when the accompanying story becomes borderline incomprehensible, that visual feast winds up feeling hollow. 1. Dallas neighbor shines as the 2nd happiest city in the U.S., report finds.

CEO Elon Musk detailed the plans in a memo sent to employees. The layoffs could affect about 14,000 of the 140,473 workers employed by the Austin-based company at the end of last year. 5. Gen Z Dallasites will spend $149,000 on rent before they hit 30. Gen Z adults have proven to be huge fans of moving to Texas, but the price of housing in a big city like Dallas is taking a large bite out of their wallets. A new housing cost analysis from RentCafe, published March 26, has revealed Gen Z adults living in Dallas are likely to spend a total of $149,163 on rent by the time they are 30 years old."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Now we know: Frank Herbert’s Dune can be filmed successfully. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One, released in 2021, ended with a challenge: “This is only the beginning!” So it has proved, for, despite its release being delayed by Covid, the film was a box office success, grossing $402m on a budget of $165m. Nominated for ten Oscars, it won six, for score, sound, cinematography, design, editing and effects. So here is Dune: Part Two, an immediate continuation, picking up the story an hour or so from where it left off, so it would be wise to see or re-see the first part, before attempting this whopper. Our hero, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet, world’s most winsome wuss), is lost in the desert with his witchy mother, Lady Jessica (fabulous Rebecca Ferguson, 40 to Chalamet’s 28, so she had him young), after the invasion of the sandy planet of spice Arrakis (arid Iraq?) by their deadly rivals, the brutal baldies of House Harkonnen. Paul, ducal heir to House Atreides and also the inheritor of special powers from his mystic mum, has just defeated and killed a top warrior of the indigenous people of the desert, the blue-eyed, quasi-Bedouin Fremen, in a ritual knife fight. This has much impressed the leader of their tribe, Stilgar (Javier Bardem, the only actor here playing it tongue-in-cheek), who now believes Paul to be their messiah. Whenever Paul shows himself at home in the ways of the desert, Stilgar reverently says: “As written!” The tribe’s top girl, Chani (Zendaya), whom Paul has long been seeing in his visions of the future, is less convinced by the claims of this typical white saviour, despite their burgeoning romance. So Paul and his mother must prove themselves worthy of acceptance by the Fremen, she by drinking electric blue juice, the Water of Life, thus absorbing “centuries of pain and sorrow” and becoming their Reverend Mother, he by joining their guerrilla war against the Harkonnens and proving his mettle by riding a sandworm. Sandworms, which can reach more than 400 metres long, charge around under the dunes engulfing in their massive spine-studded circular maws everything that makes a sound, like monster lampreys (in David Lynch’s catastrophic 1984 adaptation of Dune these mouths were less symmetrical, more labia-like, but Villeneuve is no perv). The Fremen get around without attracting their attention by skating erratically over the sand, and calling them with metal bangers when they do want them to come. For the Fremen bravely use the sandworms as transport, sticking prongs into their leathery backs and being dragged along by them in a form of sand-skiing, an Instagram-worthy extreme sport. In one of the biggest scenes here, Paul fearlessly summons one of the biggest ones ever seen and scoots along on it to the ever-pounding music of Hans Zimmer. Meanwhile, the baddies have not been idle. The Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe (Christopher Walken, hopelessly miscast, much too refined) and his impressive daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) may be directing operations, but the fighting is being done by the frankly fascist Harkonnens, led by hugely obese Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård and a ton of prosthetics). Becoming impatient with the ineptitude of one slaughterous nephew, Rabban (Dave Bautista), the baron has commissioned another, more murderous, to take over, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (a muscular, depilated, whiter than white Austin Butler, fresh from Elvis). “He’s psychotic!” “That’s irrelevant!” This is not a film that will be savoured by sufferers of alopecia. In Dune: Part Two’s grand closing scene, after many battles, Paul and Feyd-Rautha duel to the death with special daggers. They are watched by the extremely cross Chani, for, though she and Paul have already plighted their troth on many sand dunes at the magic hour, she knows that he plans a dynastic alliance with Princess Irulan, also watching. To be continued! Villeneuve and his crew orchestrate this spectacle skilfully, without a trace of self-consciousness, let alone humour. (You wonder: when are French and Saunders coming? I did, anyway.) It is perhaps the only way to treat Herbert’s pulp fiction. The question remains why futuristic fantasy is always so very backward, not just swords and sorcery, but abjectly obsessed with tribes and feudalism, emperors, palaces, uniforms and robes, noble houses and aristocratic bloodlines. Perhaps it’s obvious but we’re too polite to say. “Babies do not want (said he) to hear about babies; they like to be told of giants and castles, and of somewhat which can stretch and stimulate their little minds.” (Samuel Johnson.)"
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL," On the positive side, it’s better than the first one. Yet this bigger, starrier sequel, after an unexpectedly sprightly first act, eventually grinds down into a leaden, repetitive and po-faced political sermonising. The director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve has taken the worst and most preachy bits from Avatar, about how imperialism is fuelled by the exploitation of natural resources, and seemingly repackaged them with an orange Instagram filter and a couple of dozen heavy brass “braaaaam”s from Hans Zimmer’s overblown score."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve regresa a Arrakis en 'Dune: Parte dos', secuela que agudiza los aciertos y errores de la primera entrega entre gigantescos gusanos de arena. Que la industria nos haya acostumbrado a los rodajes solapados de colosales producciones no significa que sea el mejor modo de afrontar una saga. Así lo han demostrado Legendary Pictures y Warner Bros. que, al hacer que la existencia de 'Dune: Parte dos' (2024) dependiese del éxito de taquilla de 'Dune' (2021), ha permitido a Denis Villeneuve enfocar la secuela como un nuevo proyecto, manteniendo la homogeneidad del conjunto bajo la excusa de la adaptación de la novela original de Frank Herbert, pero distinguiendo ambos títulos con los elementos suficientes para que no pareciese una mista travesía de más de cinco horas. Solo así, con el espíritu renovado del que ha tenido tiempo para preparar el rodaje individual tras lo aprendido en el primero, se puede llegar a la desbordante imaginería visual que Villeneuve y su equipo han plasmado en 'Dune: Parte dos', un film exorbitante en cada uno de sus elementos y el mejor ejemplo posible de la necesidad de la supervivencia de las pantallas grandes. Gigantes, a ser posible. Todo en esta entrega es más imponente, exagerado y rimbombante, elementos imprescindibles en un cuento de hard science fiction que pedía a gritos un compromiso valiente con la parte más hortera de este culebrón intergaláctico. Los folletines familiares, los vericuetos religiosos y las turbulentas diatribas filosóficas del héroe convertido en mesías pasan al primer plano de un capítulo que nos muestra a los Harkonnen más desequilibrados, las tramas políticas más crueles y los gusanos más grandes. Envuelto en el dulce abrazo de la música de un Hans Zimmer que se cree el verdadero Kwisatz Hadarach, Timothée Chalamet se eleva al convencernos de su conversión en Muad'Dib, soportando incluso los planos que comparte con Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya y Javier Bardem, los tres pilares fundamentales sobre los que se sostiene este Nuevo Testamento al que, por muy rotundo que sea su clímax final, le han vuelto a arrancar el Apocalipsis. Villeneuve, desesperado por no abandonar la arenosa Arrakis, ha sido incapaz de cerrar el relato. Con 'El mesías de Dune' ya en mente, ha supeditado una conclusión satisfactoria al futuro regreso a un universo que podría ocurrir, también, con este arco ya liquidado. Es precisamente esta condición de narración discontinua lo que hace de 'Dune: Parte dos' un título más irregular de lo que los amantes de las salas repletas de aficionados podríamos desear. Como ya ocurrió en la primera, las casi tres horas de metraje se toman todo el tiempo necesario en regalarnos imágenes poderosas, pero son incapaces de contar lo que está ocurriendo sin dejar de parecer renglones subrayados de un libro elegido únicamente por los dibujos.  Por mucho que la 'Dune' (1984) de David Lynch huela a teatrillo cada vez que el soñador intenta dirigir a más de diez actores en la misma escena, aquella producción sí trataba de desenmarañar la parte humana de lo propuesto por Herbert. Con menos épica en pantalla, sus magnéticas noches coloreadas y la brillante sonrisa de Kyle MacLachlan subrayaban una idea fundamental que se ha convertido, cuarenta años después, en el mayor problema de la ocre sucesión de milagros fotográficos de un Villeneuve que no se atreve a dotar de vida a los elementos en plano: ""Fear is the mind-killer"".

"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Imagine a world devoid of color or warmth, foundering amid environmental catastrophe and tribal factions that threaten to bring humanity to the edge of fatal fanaticism. In this big, basso profundo follow-up to 2021’s first installment, we catch up with Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides and Zendaya’s Chani on the arid planet of Arrakis, fighting off a Harkonnen ambush and making their way to a redoubt of the Fremen, the ragtag group of freedom fighters trying to protect their homeland from invaders greedy for their most valuable resource: the universally coveted substance known as spice. Paul and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who is pregnant with his little sister, have joined the Fremen after the assassination of Duke Leto Atreides, played by Oscar Isaac in the first film; now, Paul is grappling with some Fremens’ belief that he’s the leader sent to save them, while others — including the tough, skeptical Chani — consider him a false prophet. If you’ve already lost the plot, worry not: With “Dune: Part Two,” filmmaker Denis Villeneuve does a smooth job of bringing the audience back up to speed, even if some viewers will have to remind themselves of the difference between a T-probe and a crysknife. Those who need no refreshing will want to hasten to their nearest multiplex to plunge once again into novelist Frank Herbert’s wildly imaginative universe, brought to expansive, very sandy life by Villeneuve. If it all leaves you colder than a dying ice planet, “Dune’s” thundering insistence on its own importance might begin wearing thin after the first two hours — at which point, cheer up! You only have 46 minutes to go! As he did in “Dune: Part One,” Villeneuve brings passion and detail to a project steeped in cinematic legend and lore. Alejandro Jodorowsky’s abandoned 1970s “Dune” film remains a tantalizing what-if; David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation of Herbert’s sci-fi epic was an ambitious but largely dismissed good try. It didn’t help that George Lucas seemed to lift much of the book’s plot and overall vibe to create “Star Wars,” slathering it with generous dollops of nostalgia and playful humor. Villeneuve’s “Dune” movies deserve admiration if only for their fealty and ambition; the filmmaker’s respect for Herbert’s source material radiates from every frame of movies that feel as massive as they are minutely orchestrated. What’s more, he has done a brilliant job of casting: Chalamet is the perfect actor to play a character who begins as something of a callow princeling, only to morph into someone more charismatic and sinister; Zendaya, mostly grim-faced, still exudes convincing moments of tenderness while teaching the tender-footed Paul the ropes of mercenary warfare and survival on Arrakis. There’s a lot of fancy desert-walking and sandworm-riding in “Dune: Part Two,” as well as a fair amount of blue-eyed glaring; while Ferguson’s Jessica goes off the deep end when it comes to Paul’s messianic future (donning some spectacular costumes and makeup in her role as a newly minted Reverend Mother), Javier Bardem provides the movie’s only genuine laughs in his warm and funny portrayal of Fremen leader Stilgar, whose insistence that Paul is The One borders on “Life of Brian”-esque goofiness. Newcomers to the cast are all first-rate: Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken slip easily into their roles as Princess Irulan and her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV, and Austin Butler thoroughly banishes Elvis — at least for now — in his bald, blank-eyed portrayal of the psychotic Feyd-Rautha, whose gladiatorial exhibitions for his uncle Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard, returning in all his prodigiously padded glory) are staged with fascistic precision. Heavy with biblical themes of prophecy, sacrifice, redemption and resurrection — with Shakespearean grace notes of fate, family and revenge — “Dune: Part Two” manages to be busy and oddly inert at the same time. Things happen for sure in a plot wherein Paul must decide whether he’s an all-in revolutionary or a reluctant demigod; Villeneuve stages the requisite number of fights and battle scenes, which grow ever more incendiary with each confrontation. The audience is treated (subjected?) to more shots of a baby in utero than might be entirely comfortable, all in service to a subplot involving the sister who will presumably be joining Paul in the next chapter. It’s all meticulously conceived and impressively staged, but becomes repetitive and monotonous, devolving for anyone not completely steeped in the “Dune” universe into a hazy orange-and-ocher soup of dust, smoke, flames and sand. So much sand. Like its predecessor, “Dune: Part Two” builds a world that’s undeniably spectacular, compressing a sprawling, borderline incomprehensible story into an efficient narrative-delivery system (Villeneuve’s perfunctory editing style takes getting used to, but it keeps things moving apace). For “Dune” fans, it gives them the majestic treatment their beloved novels have long deserved; everyone else might need to fight their way through the fog of canonical arcana and the Arrakis elements to find a grain of escapist pleasure. It’s in there somewhere, even if we have to wait for “Part Three.”"
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Nerds, sandworms, sci-fi fans, lend me your ears: I come not to bury David Lynch but to praise him. Now, it’s not like he needs much of that – the era of Lynch doubters came to a swift end once the Internet united the disparate collection of amateur and professional aesthetes that saw his masterpieces for what they were – but his Dune gets an unfair amount of shit. It’s a grimly gorgeous movie whose idiosyncratic qualities make it stand out in the glut of post-Star Wars cash-ins, mainly because it vaguely detests the entire genre it is uncomfortably slotted in. If Lynch had wanted to direct a proper Star War, he would have directed Return of the Jedi, and perhaps the Walt Disney Company would have been without one of the feathers in its cap today. The ending is the one area in which that movie gets a lot of well-deserved criticism, and enough of that comes from the fact that it is rushed, attempting to tie a messy tangled narrative web into a bow, regardless of whether or not it makes any sense (the Fremen may have their water raining from the sky, but the universe is fully and wholly fucked by this development). The missing ingredient in Lynch’s take on this story is dread.There wasn’t a desire, either on the part of Dino De Laurentis or Lynch, to preserve the meaning that separates Frank Herbert’s saga from the traditional “hero’s journey” plot archetype as delineated by Joseph Campbell. Kyle MacLachlan’s Paul is a traditionally bratty hero struck from the Luke Skywalker mold when he’s something much closer to what George Lucas would realize with Anakin 15 years later: A tragic figure. We rejoin Paul and Jessica as they make their way to the Fremen’s main base of operation, where the former is begrudgingly accepted into their society following his trial-by-combat, in which he struck down a Fremen warrior named Jamis, but this isn’t as endearing as one might hope. Jamis is mourned, his body’s water added to a massive reservoir hidden underground that doubles as a memorial and a mass grave, and Paul remains an outsider, whom the Fremen are right to be skeptical of. He and his mother are scheming, but to different ends: Paul wants to be accepted so that he can lead a guerrilla campaign of revenge against the Harkonnens, while Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, sees ways that she can get her son to power through weaponizing the religious beliefs of the Fremen – seeded by her sect eons ago. They have one faithful believer in Stilgar (Javier Bardem), an older warrior and leader who holds enough clout to ensure that his men don’t kill the kid and his mom on site for their water. His belief in Paul enables the Duke’s son to exist in the Fremen’s secret spaces and allows him to begin his campaign against the Harkonnens. Paul proves himself in battle and adopts the Fremen’s ways as his own, even if he remains skeptical that he’s their Muad’dib. He’s even skeptical of his skepticism, as the visions he receives from the spice, premonitions of a future that very well may come to pass, show him leading the Fremen on a jihad that will kill untold billions of innocent people. Perhaps the only person standing in his way is Chani (Zendaya), who has grown close to him, and as the pair fall in love, she starts to notice how this war is changing him – and how Paul is slowly growing to believe in his mythos. I’m not particularly worried about spoiling a 60-year-old novel for any readers who haven’t had the chance to read it yet, but I’m not going to share any more story beats. Really, they aren’t as important as you might think – Dune suffers from the same malady that John Carter did, where enterprising minds strip-mined its narrative and detail before it could make its way to screen (if you ever want to read a fun literary burn, read what Herbert described as a “Three-P-O” in the later Dune books) – but Villeneuve has no interest in the familiar, beyond what he’s beholden to preserve the text’s meaning. He and Lynch are united in more than one aspect, but their aesthetic ethos is almost parallel in how they take the incomprehensible alienness of Herbert’s future world and translate it to the screen by altering the textures of contemporary sci-fi cinema. Star Wars was ugly, so Lynch’s film was disgusting, and Villeneuve’s science-fiction era is defined by a kind of cinematic slickness, with the jagged machinery of the X-Wing replaced by the smooth curves of a smartphone. What he does to pervert this style is by making it feel spectacular or, more precisely, impossible. Sure, the details are rich when they matter – the absurdly thrilling scene in which Paul finally takes to the back of a Sandworm and hitches hooks into it so he can ride atop it is only made all the more compelling by how thoroughly rendered the animal’s anatomy is – but Villeneuve’s embrace of psychedelic mysticism and what its accompanying toolkit enables him to build is the key difference-maker here. Kubrick comparisons are pretty passe because everyone always gets him wrong, but it’s telling that, out of all the things that one could walk away from something like 2001: A Space Odyssey with, Hollywood took the style and story beats of the segments on Discovery One as his chief innovation, rather than the flight into an absurd, gorgeous metaphor that overwhelms an audience in the final half-hour. Beyond the imagery of in-utero fetuses, which both films share in bizarrely gorgeous quality, Villeneuve is perhaps the closest out of his contemporaries to reach that level of psychedelic face-melting within studio sci-fi genre filmmaking. There are downright beautiful moments in which, alongside cinematographer Greig Fraser, the director simply just sheds any notion of appropriate realism and goes for pure mood-fueled fantasy. The most striking among these is a visit to the Harkonnen homeworld, which serves as an introduction to Paul’s mirror-image nemesis Feyd Rautha (Austin Butler, doing a Skarsgaard impression that’s so good it’s hard not to believe it’s one of the man’s sons). The planet is under a “black sun,” which, to Villeneuve’s credit, is a choice that directly informs everything about the Harkonnen style in an anthropological way, but the way he shows this to us is almost impressionistic in its quality: the world is rendered in a stark black-and-white, with anything the light touches quickly robbed of its color. It’s a fantastical showcase of artistic force that he somehow pulls off without a trace of self-satisfaction among the resultant awe-filled it generates inside the viewer. He’s just stunting on motherfuckers at this point, because this is just one of many gorgeous sequences that this film is stacked with. The usual accolades also apply: the cast is uniformly excellent, especially now that they’re able to exist more fully as characters, thanks to all of the groundwork that was laid in Part One, and the new additions are equally as good, with Butler, Pugh, and Walken slotting wonderfully into this established universe. Villeneuve remains one of the few filmmakers who know how to properly use post-Inception Hans Zimmer – as a part of the overall sound design, and not simply as a composer – and his music serves to punctuate on-screen action in a seat-rattling fashion (I’m not joking when I say that the screen in the Dolby-equipped theater was rippling like a pool of water during some of the action sequences). His production design team is absurdly brilliant, and his ability to stage a fight scene only gets more and more accomplished as the project scales up in scope. But I do worry about how people will react to the film’s ending, which is a deviation from Herbert’s book and potentially audience-alienating. Based on the sacrifices made to bring the text to the screen, it’s understandable why some of this happens the way it does – time compression is an important aspect in making this interpretation of events work – but there are a few things that might make some think twice, as well as the whole realization that this particular Hero’s Journey isn’t exactly one that anybody would want to follow. Villeneuve must have received assurances that he’ll be able to bring Dune Messiah to the screen; otherwise, I’d doubt he’d end it like this: it sets up a finale, and if you’ve read these books, it’s going to be difficult to bring Messiah’s anti-story to the screen. If anybody can do it, however, it’s Villeneuve, who has given science-fiction cinema a much-needed shot in the arm and has made the kind of Dune adaptation that makes everybody see what your cooler nerdy friends saw when they read the books back in high school."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Producers: Mary Parent, Cale Boyter,  Patrick McCormick, Tanya Lapointe and Denis Villeneuve   Director: Denis Villeneuve   Screenplay: Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts   Cast: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsgård, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Souheila Yacoub and Charlotte Rampling  Distributor: Warner Bros. When we last saw him, back in 2021, at the close of Part One of Denis Villeneuve’s sumptuous adaptation of Frank Herbert’s famous 1965 novel, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) had been victorious in a ritual swordfight-to-the-death with Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), a hostile Fremen warrior in the desert wastes of Arrakis.  Paul’s father Leo, who’d been assigned by Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken) to govern the planet, had been killed by the ruthless Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), who again assumed guardianship of the sole source of invaluable Spice.  Determined to exterminate the House Atreides, he had Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) dropped in the desert to die.  But they had made contact with the tribe of Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and, as a result of Paul’s success in defeating Jamis, were taken in by them as refugees, with Paul quickly attracting the eye of warrior Chani (Zendaya), as well as leading the religious Stilgar to suspect that he might be the desert people’s long-awaited chosen one. As Part Two opens, Paul has been accepted by the Fremen as a warrior, though the tribes are split about whether he is truly the prophesied savior.  Meanwhile the Baron has handed day-to-day operation of the mines on Arrakis to his brutal nephew Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), who is charged with restoring Spice production against Fremen harassment.  But his tactics have proven ineffective, and the rebellion continues.  Paul is intent on avenging his father, destroying House Harkonnen, and assuming imperial power himself.  To do so he debates accepting recognition as the chosen one despite his insistence that he is not the predicted messiah—a strategy his pregnant mother, a member of the priestesses known as the Bene Gesserit, encourages and the devout Stilgar supports, despite the misgivings of Chani.  Meanwhile the Baron, weary of Glossu Raban’s incompetence, plans to replace him with his more cunning, though no less bloodthirsty, younger brother Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler).  The outcome is a rebel assault on the Harkonnens while the emperor is visiting Arrakis, which culminates in another swordfight, this time between Paul and the well-muscled Feyd-Rautha, and an announcement by Paul involving the emperor’s daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who has served as a quasi-narrator throughout. Such in a nutshell is the narrative of “Dune: Part Two,” although there are other subsidiary characters like Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), the erstwhile general of the Atreides military who survived the Baron’s assault and reunites with his former student Paul, and other priestesses of the Bene Gesserit (Léa Seydoux and Charlotte Rampling) whose loyalty is to the imperial house.  Important subplots are also involved, like the mysterious Water of Life, which Jessica imbibes, awakening her unborn child and allowing her to converse with the fetus.  Paul’s decision to drink of the liquid, which is considered fatal for males, is also an integral element in the development of his mythic status.  Like its predecessor, this is less a popcorn “Star Wars”-like space adventure than a quasi-art film disguised as popular entertainment.  That doesn’t mean that it lacks exciting action sequences, both battles between armies and hand-to-hand combat, but that the emphasis is on mood and suggestion.  In that respect it’s not unlike the first Hollywood crack at the book, David Lynch’s woeful 1984 film, which reflected its director’s idiosyncratic vision but was hacked and undone by interference from its backers.  Villeneuve also represents a distinctive voice—notice, for example, how he achieves many of his effects through indirection, requiring viewers to fill in imaginatively things they’re shown only in part (Paul’s initial attempt to ride a huge sand worm, a sequence mostly shrouded in flying sand, is a good example)—but he benefits from a carte blanche apparently given him by Warner Bros., which seems willing to extend to him the free hand they once gave to Kubrick.  The result is an action film marked more by atmosphere and ambience than by conventional tent-pole moviemaking of the Marvel manner. The approach does have drawbacks.  It can, for example, lead to a curious indifference to clear transitions (there’s one point, when Paul is undergoing an initial survival test, when one might swear a reel has been dropped), or a lack of clarity (Paul’s strategy for the final battle is laid out briefly in a conference with his allies, but when it actually comes, it’s pretty much a moody blur).  But the narrative ambiguities that Villeneuve and editor Joe Walker contrive are turned into a virtue, accentuating the hallucinatory quality of the story itself.  And when it’s necessary for the movie to deliver a straightforward action moment—like the fight between Paul and Feyd-Rautha—it does so, though without setting aside its unusual look. Villeneuve has also chosen his cast wisely.  Chalamet’s slight stature might at first not seem right for Paul, but in fact he corresponds well to Herbert’s description of the character, and his physique emphasizes the unlikelihood of the character’s success; of course his soulfulness is entirely appropriate.  And though one might cringe at Zendaya’s shows of petulance, she gets by.  All the rest are fine, but one might single out Bardem’s scraggily loyal Stilgar, Skarsgård’s bulbously loathsome Baron, and Butler’s preening, sadistic Feyd-Rautha. The initial installment of Villeneuve’s “Dune” ended inconclusively, of course, but it was, after all, advertised as Part One (although, at the time, whether Part Two would be made was entirely dependent on the first picture’s financial success; after all, there had been plans for sequels to Lynch’s version, but they were quickly scuttled).  The close of Part Two will probably come as a letdown to viewers who are not familiar with the book franchise; it boasts a throne room sequence, but one whose mood is utterly different from the celebratory, heroic tone of the medal-award reception sequence that ends “Star Wars: A New Hope,” and is then followed by a postscript that points to division, not unity.  That’s the inevitable result of the fact that Herbert’s book pointed toward the further discord he planned for its sequels.  Whether Villeneuve will continue the narrative beyond this film remains up in the air, and even if he does, it will probably be rather far off.  For the moment, if one wants to follow the story without the onerous work of reading, your only choice is the 2003 continuation John Harrison made to his small-screen 2000 version of “Dune” for what was then called the Sci-Fi Channel: “Frank Herbert’s Children of Dune,” which combined the narratives of Herbert’s two follow-ups, “Dune Messiah” and “Children of Dune.”"

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. After Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune film ended rather unceremoniously near the middle of Frank Herbert’s novel, Dune: Part Two brings things home with a near perfect adaptation of the book’s back half. Which is to say, the film, like its source material, is a brilliant, breathtaking piece of worldbuilding with an alright story and some shoddy writing. But because this is cinema, the worldbuilding isn’t merely conceptual, and in the hands of Villeneuve and his talented collaborators, is instead a full aural and visual barrage — and what a beautiful barrage. The film opens with striking images of the devastation left by the last film’s major battle and a “last time on Dune” voiceover from new character Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). But it doesn’t take long to return us to protagonist Paul (Timothee Chalamet), now among the Bedouin-inspired desert-dwelling Fremen, the indigenous people of the all-important spice producing planet Arrakis. In the desert, Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) live and fight alongside the Fremen as they use guerilla tactics to repeatedly strike against the ruling Harkonnen family, the same family responsible for the murder of Paul’s father. The plot of Dune: Part Two is, at a glance, simple enough: Paul and his mother work with the Fremen to bring down a common enemy, and along the way Paul becomes a messianic figure for the Fremen. The world surrounding that simple plot makes the film a spectacle. Dune: Part Two revels in its meticulously created world; equal parts brutalist architecture and unending vistas of orange sand, set to an enveloping score from Hans Zimmer. Zimmer’s work here makes use of the now much-memed “Bwong” he made famous with his Inception score, but it’s part of a larger whole that’s full of propulsive percussion, heavily distorted guitar chugging, staticky drones that approach noise music, and some gorgeous, more classically adventurous and sweeping pieces. Those sounds work in tandem with Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser’s often larger than life compositions that show off just how grand the world of Dune is. Whether it’s aerial shots of a gladiatorial arena or point of view shots of characters witnessing others riding on the backs of the giant sandworms that live on Arrakis, the images are, for lack of a better word, epic. That impeccable skill with scale functions in the action sequences as well, with several firefights and battle scenes emphasizing the strategic moves of combatants, and offering up some of the most satisfying massive explosions recently set to film. Sadly, that doesn’t translate to the more intimate scenes of bladed combat, which are passable but far from the balletic bouts of the John Wick films or the brutality of something like The Raid. These smaller fights have some minor moments of drama and suspense, yet never succeed as thrilling pieces of action cinema. The major success of the monumental and the not-quite-failure of the small scale fight scenes is indicative of the film as a whole. The script is often clumsy and trips over itself to ensure that we understand plot points and character motivations. In fact, most of the changes from Herbert’s novel rob the story of its complications and ambiguities, essentially spoon feeding themes so there can be no misunderstanding or misinterpretation. Not all of Dune: Part Two’s problems are unique to the film, though. In fact, you wonder why some changes were not made, in both this and the first film, to the book’s cartoonishly evil characterization of the Harkonnen clan. Or why big bad Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is the only fat character in the film, retaining the book’s tying of fatness to evil. It also seems that some of the book’s pacing issues, shifting abruptly from a deliberate pace full of diversions and details to a rushed final act that blows through plot points, could have been fixed in this adaptation. Instead, there’s a distinct feeling of “we’ve gotta wrap this up” to the finales of both. Dune: Part Two succeeds where it’s most important for an adaptation of Herbert’s novel to succeed; in bringing the world of the novel to life. Arguably, it also succeeds in adapting the narrative of the book. But the book is a flawed work and instead of amending the book’s flaws, the changes made for the film add to them. Those flaws don’t make the film’s narrative a failure, but they make it pale in comparison to the images and sounds that surround it.

"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Audiences who loved his 2021 take on Frank Herbert’s “Dune” will be doubly pleased with the sequel. If this brand of visually magnificent, narratively sluggish storytelling wasn’t for you the first time, the sequel won’t win you over. Either way, it’s best to bone up on the first film, commit the galaxy of complex names and tribes (save our hero, Paul) to memory and find the sweetest IMAX screen possible. The indigenous Fremen mostly believe Paul is the chosen one/prophet/Neo stand-in, and he uses that status to guide the fight against Team Harkonnen. He’s joined by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), pregnant with Paul’s future sibling. “Dune: Part II: doesn’t lack for charismatic co-stars. Javier Bardem makes a sizable mark as Stilgar, a Fremen elder open to an outsider like Paul saving his people. Josh Brolin’s return to the saga as Gurney Halleck is equally welcome. Need villains? Christopher Walken gets too little screen time as the elderly Emperor, and Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan feels like a starry place holder for the promised third film. Villeneuve infamously distanced himself from dialogue in a recent interview, and a quick glimpse at the “Dune” saga shows he cares about spectacle above all else. It’s not a bad position given his status as our finest visual storyteller not named Nolan. The “Dune” films are stunning to behold, on par with anything James Cameron could uncork. “Part II” continues that spiky tradition. The opening sequence, a quasi-battle, is lush and inviting, its visual snap elevating it beyond a mere fight between warring forces. “Dune: Part II” smells and sounds like a blockbuster, but it never succumbs to formula or trite resolutions. It’s an arthouse popcorn movie, a contradiction that Villeneuve pulls off. He’s aided by another bravura score by Hans Zimmer, leveraging the theater’s speakers in ways that creep up and down your spine. Cinematographer Greig Fraser’s work is equally imposing, and while CGI trickery is afoot in every sequence Fraser and Villeneuve bring a tactile snap to everything on screen. So what’s the downside? Like the first installment, “Dune: Part II” feels heavy from start to finish. It’s never buoyant, even during its most arresting moments. It’s like listening to a story narrated by someone buried to his neck in the sand. Not every sci-fi adventure needs to be as light, as accessible as “Star Wars” or “Star Trek,” but a happy medium still feels out of reach for the saga. I watched the movie on the opening day. It is visually stunning with a few exceptions (why did the movie go black and white on Giedi Prime?). Acting was terrific. Hans Zimmer’s music was totally Zimmerish, including not a few BWAAAAHs.  I was disappointed with the script. Paul and Chani sort of hook up together, then the relationship falls apart because the writers felt the need to make Chani such a strong, independent woman, that she finds every excuse to dislike Paul for filling his inevitable destiny. The writers betrayed both characters because they have no idea what a relationship looks like. Hollywood writers can no longer create a leading woman because they must always channel their biases through her eyes. The writers also miss the mark because they don’t, and can’t, understand religion. Their heavy-handed approach to the Fremen’s beliefs led them to make Stilgar a mere zealot, instead of the powerful leader he should be. I Think its because the sun on Giedi Prime is black, so things illuminated by it are just black and white. That’s why when they were under artificial light the movie was back to full color. What?  You liked this movie too?  It got panned it a lot of circles, both of my kids hated it too.  Me?  I loved it. Christian, I’m curious if you’ve ever read the book. Not that you can’t have a take on the movie if you haven’t! It seems as though people who argue that the movie is a bit “droning” don’t usually mention how closely the film ties in with the original book. The book has a definite feel to it which doesn’t scream at the reader and doesn’t really cater to sloppy storytelling. The movie feels the same. Zimmer’s soundtrack is unreal. Looking forward to hearing it in the theater for the spine chills you mentioned! Arguably one of his best soundtracks ever."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Ever since the pandemic hit in 2020, studios, movie theaters and Nicole Kidmans everywhere have spent a lot of time trying to convince us that the only real way to experience a movie is via the Big Screen. Yet in an age of ubiquitous—if fragmented—streaming services and increasingly affordable home entertainment technology anchored by 75-inch TVs, it’s a hard sell to convince a family of four that dropping $100+ for the “magic” of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Dicks: The Musical or Cocaine Bear is worth it. And that’s not meant as a slight against those films—the calculus of whether the viewing experience is sufficiently enhanced by a giant screen and state-of-the-art sound system to offset the cost (and potential annoyance) of public viewing is seldom a question of how good the film is. For many, Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, Past Lives and Anatomy of a Fall are going to be just as enjoyable to watch in a darkened living room as in a multiplex. But Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two? Set aside the complicated calculus of food, shelter and family needs. It’s time to shell out the big bucks and head to the local IMAX. To borrow from Kidman’s AMC commercial more explicitly, though you might not be “somehow reborn,” there will be “dazzling images,” sound you can feel and you will be taken somewhere you’ve “never been before” (at least, not since Dune). As befits a Part Two, Villeneuve’s film picks up in medias res, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and the Fremen encountering and dealing with a murderous Harkonnen hunting party while trying to reach the Fremen stronghold. From this encounter, Villaneuve nimbly guides the narrative from one key moment to the next, a veritable dragonfly ornithopter of plot advancement (with a few slower moments to allow the burgeoning relationship with Paul and Zendaya’s Chani to breathe). In films centered on seemingly inexorable prophecies, there is usually some amount of dramatic suspense to be mined in how said prophecy will come to pass. A bit of a twist, a bit of surprised recognition that the fate so fought against or fled from turned out to be right where the story was heading all along, protagonist preferences be damned. In Dune: Part Two, there’s no such suspense regarding whether this prophecy will be fulfilled, no narrative sleight of hand allowing room for viewer doubt. The only uncertainty exists, fleetingly, in the minds of some of the film’s characters. Most of these micro-arcs can be summarized as variations of “I don’t think he’s the one. Never mind—I now believe he’s the one!” and “If he’s not the one, he’ll die doing this thing. Never mind—he lived!” This could be considered a flaw, except Dune: Part Two isn’t trying to be a Christopher Nolan-esque puzzle box for us to decipher and be surprised by. It’s space opera, the current chapter of which just happens to take place on a planet. The story might move dutifully from point A to point B, but the experience is all about the alphabet—or more precisely, about Arrakis itself. To that end, Dune: Part Two is an immersive experience on par with Avatar (but with a much better story), Interstellar (but benefiting from a much richer narrative tapestry) and Mad Max: Fury Road (no notes!).  There’s a reason Dune won Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects (and was nominated for Best Makeup and Hairstyling). Too often in science fiction films, the attempt to imagine whole societies and technologies yields a gasping plea for suspension of disbelief. In general, “good enough” can be considered great—if the costumes and sets do not distract from the story being told, success! Dune: Part Two’s production design is as much center stage as its star-studded cast. Villaneuve pummels the viewer with the sheer scale and brutal, industrial efficiency of the Harkonnen operation—well, it would be efficient if not for those pesky Fremen—yet all of it is engulfed in turn by Arrakis itself. Meanwhile, the sound design and throbbing aural cues evoke the weight and oppressiveness of a centuries-spanning empire, the suffocating cunning of “90 generations” of Bene Gesserit schemes and the inescapable gravity Arrakis and its spice-producing leviathans exert on both. None of this is meant to detract from the contributions of the impressive cast, they just are additional—if important—threads in an immense tapestry. Javier Bardem and Florence Pugh stand out even as their roles occupy a backseat to the film’s more central characters (Paul, Chani, Lady Jessica, etc.) and the (appropriate) scene-chewing of Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha. Bardem’s Stilgar just feels an iota more real than the rest, and Pugh brings the same fascinating presence to a Princess Irulan who, while beefed up here compared to her role in the book, provides quiet pools of respite in an otherwise frenetic, sensorially relentless epic. Bardem makes you feel like, “Hey, I know that guy.” Pugh makes you feel like, “Man, I want to know more about her.” (By now, it’s fair to consider this latter effect a signature ingredient of Pugh’s talent.) Villeneuve is scrupulously faithful to the source material without being slavishly so. Purists who desire every detail mirrored will find a solid listicle’s worth of changes to munch on, but I suspect even the most militant quibbler will acknowledge that Dune: Part Two has about the highest grade of fidelity one can find in the Book-to-Screen section of the movie marketplace. This overarching fidelity also means that anyone who has qualms about the original story will likely have those same qualms about the movie. A white savior leading a fierce but noble tribe of brown-skinned warriors in their fight against an occupying power may have felt fresh at the time of publication in 1965—though its popularity took a while to develop, Dune came out in the Academy Award-winning wake of Lawrence of Arabia (1962), after all—but some contemporary moviegoers have likely developed an allergy to this particular variant of the Hero’s Journey. For those who haven’t, and for those torn on whether it’s worth venturing forth to the multiplex, consider Dune: Part Two a compelling two-hour-and-forty-six-minute argument in the “for” column. And that “indescribable feeling” you get when “the lights begin to dim?” That’s cinematic escape velocity, instantly achieved. Next stop, Arrakis."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," The release calendar ruined a perfectly good lead. I was primed and ready to write that Dune 2 is the best science fiction film of the last twenty-five years. After fact-checking the release date of The Matrix, I discovered it was released on March 31, 1999. So, technically Dune 2 is “the best sci-fi film of the last 24 years and 335 days” which is not a pull quote destined to appear on the back of the Bluray release. (And I’ll likely receive emails telling me that Dune 2 is better than The Matrix, and those folks can make a good argument for that assessment.) As the film opens, House Atreidas has fallen, and its lone heir, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) is on the run, hiding among the Fremen in the barren expanse of the northern deserts of Arrakis. House Harkonnen, in league with the Emperor (played by a miscast Christopher Walken), led the slaughter of Paul’s entire bloodline in an effort to monopolize the valuable spice mined on Arrakis. As House Harkonnen moves to consolidate its power, tales emerge of a messiah rallying the Fremen into a powerful force capable of overthrowing the ruling Houses. The Harkonnens are concerned by religious zealots. Martyrs have followers, and nothing is scarier than someone fighting for a holy cause. The Fremen messiah must be stopped before the Fremen uprising grows beyond the Harkonnen’s control. It’s difficult breaking a film into two pieces, and then have the second piece delayed for four months due to the various Hollywood strikes. The first film felt like a lengthy set-up for the action to come. When the credits rolled on Dune, it became clear that we were hitting the pause button midway through the second act of a 330-minute film. Dune 2 is the much-anticipated pay-off, a vast improvement over the mythology-laden first film. Epic battles scenes, palace intrigue, romance and religious prophecies abound. We even get a new, younger villain from House Harkonnen, Feyd-Rautha, played by Austin Butler (Elvis). A Paul versus Feyd-Rautha showdown feels like an inevitability from the moment Butler hits the screen and shows off his character’s lethal fighting skills. Butler certainly shows his acting range, but I would’ve appreciated a Big Bad who can’t simply be written off as “psychotic”. Director Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) wisely expands his universe in this second film by providing an in-depth look behind the curtain of House Harkonnen. The production design of these segments plays like a 21st-century homage to the visionary black-and-white world of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927). The bleached look of the Harkonnen’s world contrasts brilliantly with the earth tones of the Fremen’s desert lairs. At times, however, the incessant black and white costuming makes you think that House Harkonnen made it’s fortune selling S&M gear and latex outfits. The novel Dune was written by Frank Herbert in 1965. Herbert’s sci-fi world-building is epic, embracing politics, organized religion, spirituality, sociology and more. For years it was considered impossible to adapt to film. David Lynch created an interesting misfire in 1984, and Alejandro Jodorowsky’s attempt at a cinematic adaptation of the Herbert novel resulted in an amazing 2013 documentary about the “impossibility” of bringing Dune to the silver screen. Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival) has clearly cracked the code, although the sixty-year-old story he’s adapting certainly has some flaws. At its core, Dune 2 is a white savior narrative. The image of a young white man leading people of color to paradise was a trope for decades before the 21st century decided to grant agency to the black and brown characters populating cinematic epics since the days of the silent Tarzan films and Charlton Heston playing Moses in The Ten Commandments. It may simply be my middle-aged film critic’s brain, but Chalamet is a bit of a lightweight physically and when it comes to gravitas. It’s a lot to ask the baby-faced actor to carry the full weight of the film. Veteran actor Javier Bardem sells Chalamet as the messiah Maud’Dib better than Chalamet himself. As the young actor strides through the desert with his cloak billowing in the wind, he occasionally looks like he’s advertising the Atreides Collection for Prada rather than single-mindedly freeing an oppressed populace. I couldn’t help but envision someone like Riz Ahmed (Sound of Metal) as Paul Atreides. The white savior and the gravitas issues disappear with a single casting choice, but the financial analytics would’ve knocked $ 30 million off the production budget without a young star like Chalamet to attract the Gen Z filmgoers of the world. Any negative observations or criticisms I’ve leveled at the film are truly just quibbles. I’m not the kind to complain that we never see original, epic science fiction on the big screen anymore and then nitpick the best sci-fi film of the 21st century. Hollywood rumor mills are suggesting that Villeneuve may head back to the science fiction well for his next film, an alleged adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s classic sci-fi novel Rendezvous with Rama. After the two Dune films and (to a somewhat lesser extent) his Blade Runner sequel, I’m onboard to go anywhere Denis Villeneuve wants to take me."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve brings the second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s cult 1965 sci-fi novel to the big screen in truly spectacular fashion. Epic in scope and astonishing in its world-building, Dune: Part Two combines jaw-dropping visuals with imaginative action and morally complex plotting to thrilling effect. The story picks up after the events of 2021’s Dune, following a handy recap from Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken), neither of whom were seen in the first film. After the near wipe-out of House Atreides (orchestrated by the Emperor), temporarily in charge of mining the resource-rich planet of Arrakis, surviving scion Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are hiding out with native desert warriors the Fremen, some of whom – notably Javier Bardem’s leader Stilgar – believe Paul to be the prophesied messiah, who will lead them all to freedom. As Paul gains the trust of the Fremen, he grows closer to Chani (Zendaya), the woman he foresaw in his dreams, but their relationship becomes complicated as she starts to doubt the prophecy, not least when it emerges that the entire thing may have been cooked up by supernatural space witches the Bene Gesserit (including Lady Jessica). Meanwhile, after learning that Paul is still alive, corpulent space bastard Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) tasks his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) with wiping the Fremen from the face of Arrakis. As with the first movie, Part Two proves a pulse-poundingly immersive experience, courtesy of cinematographer Greig Fraser’s stunning visuals, production designer Patrice Vermette’s wildly imaginative sets and some inspired sound design work. This is particularly evident during the film’s exciting central set piece, when Paul has to prove himself by riding a giant sandworm, a punch-the-air moment that was teased in the first part and pays off wonderfully here. Despite the film’s potentially punishing 166 minute running time, Villeneuve ensures that it never drags, striking a note-perfect balance between compelling character interaction and blisteringly inventive fight scenes. Additional highlights include a troupe of Harkonnen warriors gliding up a cliff-face and Paul and Chani mounting an explosive attack on the enemy’s insect-like helicopters. The cast are exceptional. Chalamet is compelling in his transition from naïve innocent to confident, assertive leader, playing it with just enough ambiguity to leave the audience uncomfortable with his ascension. To that end, Zendaya’s character is effectively the moral centre of the movie, and she plays it beautifully, albeit with slightly more scowling than is strictly necessary. Elsewhere, Butler delivers a deliciously nasty turn as Feyd-Rautha (signature move: gleefully licking knife blades), while fellow new additions Pugh (resplendent in chain mail), Walken and Léa Seydoux (as slinky, seductive Bene Gesserit Lady Margot Fenring) also make strong impressions, despite having relatively little screen time. If there’s an issue with Dune: Part Two, it’s only that the ending feels a little rushed, considering the near six-hour build-up over the past two movies. At any rate, the door is left wide open for a third instalment, and Villneuve has already indicated his willingness to continue with an adaptation of Herbert’s sequel: Dune Messiah, should Part Two rake in enough spicy space cash, so there may well be more to come. In the meantime, make sure you see this on the biggest, loudest screen you can find."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," DUNE: PART TWO **** (167 minutes) M
Not often do we get super-sized sequels that are better than what came before, so let us give heartfelt thanks to the Movie God that Dune: Part Two is bigger, deeper, louder and even more visually awesome than was 2021’s Dune: Part One, a space picture that redefined how good a sci-fi epic could look and how dramatically rich it could feel. In a nutshell Dune 2 film is outstanding, with great cinematography (again courtesy of Australian maestro Greig Fraser), astounding visual effects, enthralling battle sequences, a totally engaging story and – thankfully – a brisk pace that renders the hefty 167-minute running time a non-issue (provided, of course, that you visit the loo beforehand and go easy on the soft drink during.) Again directed and co-written by Denis Villeneuve – a long-time disciple of the classic 1965 Frank Herbert novel – this installment carries on with the dynastic saga of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). These include: the even-more-bloodthirsty Glossu (Dave Bautista); the overweight Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård); Emperor (Christopher Walken); and new kid Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), a chrome-domed, pasty-white Lex Luthor lookalike with an evil snarl and a hankering to dispatch Paul personally. He’s a real piece of work this guy. With his over-endowed forehead and Travis Bickle death stare, he’s a highlight of the top-shelf Dune 2 ensemble. The staggering scale of the film’s flawlessly rendered settings – whether it be the endless stretches of Arrakian sand or the oppressive Stalinist architecture of the Harkonnen homeland – is jaw-dropping, the brilliant cinematography, production design and visual effects conjuring the powerful impression that the cast and crew of Dune 2 actually flew off to another planet to make the film. Coupled to the film’s masterly use of landscape and raging battle scenes – starring those majestic giant sandworms that swim through the sands of Arrakis – is the story surrounding Paul Atreides and his ascent among the native Fremen fighters as he works hard for their respect and allegiance. For a film with so many sprawling wide shots, Villeneuve shows a deep love of intimate, Bergmanesque close-ups, the landscape of the face being as prominent a feature as the landscapes of the planet. It’s a great touch that immerses you deeper into the film. It also accounts for a surprising amount of quiet moments in a film that spends so much of its time being loud, whether it’s the sight of a kangaroo rat or Paul embarking on a training exercise. It’s a nice stylistic carryover from the first film. Given how Dune could so easily be seen as a space opera, the super-serious tone of the direction and the gravitas it lends the performances really give the film heft. Chalamet is terrific; Bautista is especially manic; and Austin Butler proves here how there’s apparently nothing he can’t do. Unsurprisingly, the film ends with a sandworm-sized pointer to a concluding third film, which has been planned and will be made on condition that Dune 2 delivers.  Aside from the obvious, fan-pleasing reasons, one of the major underlying motives people are going to flock to Dune 2 is that, as with the first one, it comes as high-quality relief to audiences fatigued by all the $200 million superhero comic book films that have pummeled them for the past 15 years. Footnote: The film was previewed at an Imax theatre and the use of the format is nothing short of sensational. It’s Christopher Nolan standard. So see it on the biggest screen you can for that all-enveloping sense of immersion."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part One, the first chapter of Denis
Villeneuve’s ambitious attempt to re-create Frank Herbert’s seminal 1965 novel
for a generation not scarred by David Lynch’s misfire, became the reason for
many shuttered individuals to venture back to movie theaters as the pandemic
waned in October 2021. Although the film’s box office receipts were tepid for a
would-be blockbuster, its through-the-roof performance on Warner Brothers’
streaming app, HBO Max (it became available for streaming simultaneously with
its theatrical release), convinced the studio to greenlight Dune: Part Two.
Now, nearly 2 1/2 years later, after a delay necessitated by Hollywood’s dual
strike (which made the cast unavailable to do publicity), Dune: Part Two
has finally reached theaters. Worth the wait? Unquestionably.  When the ink has dried on analyses of the year 2024 at the
movies, Dune: Part Two will stand not only near the top when it comes to
big screen spectacle but will be regarded as one of the best films to be
released during the twelve-month period. And, although director Denis Villeneuve
is already writing the screenplay for the third part of a projected Dune trilogy
(this one based on Herbert’s 1969 book, Dune Messiah), box office
performance will dictate whether that gets made. The wide-open ending of Dune:
Part Two argues in favor of additional motion picture installments but, if
none are made, at least Part Two completes the definitive adaptation.  There hasn’t been anything like this since Peter Jackson
tackled The Lord of the Rings some 25 years ago. At the time, many fans
feared the New Zealander had bitten off more than he could chew but his
three-film, eight-hour version turned out to be one of the most amazing success
stories in novel-to-movie transformations. Villeneuve’s Dune deserves
similar consideration. Unwilling to condense Dune into a single movie,
the director spread out the story over more than five hours, allowing him to
retain many complexities, side plots, and characters that might otherwise have
been eliminated or marginalized. Even considering the amount of breathing room
accorded the story by the manner of its adaptation, changes were still
necessary to create a better cinematic experience. And the uninitiated may be
baffled by a few things here and there.  Dune: Part Two, like its predecessor, does an
excellent job of taking some of the most fantastical aspects of the novel and
translating them to the screen in a way that seems organic to the story. When
dealing with elements like prophesy, mysticism, and hallucinogenic visions,
this is no small achievement. The great sandworms churning the desert seas of
Arrakis, superbly realized by cutting-edge computer generated special effects,
are far more readily accepted than some of these things, but Villaneuve makes
them work. The movie picks up where Part One left off with Duke
Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother,
Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), seeking refuge with the Fremen following the
massacre of House Atreides by House Harkonnen. Accepted by one of the Fremen
leaders, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul seeks to learn the ways of the desert
people. In the process, he begins an affair with Chani (Zendaya), while seeking
to distance himself from the growing sentiment that he is the Fremen’s prophesied
messiah. A war develops between the Fremen and the invading Harkonnens, led by
the Baron (Stellan Skargard) and his nephews, Glossu Rababan (Dave Bautista)
and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). At stake is control of the planet and its most
valuable resource, called “spice.” When Harkonnen victory is in question, the
Emperor (Christopher Walken) decides to become directly involved, traveling to
Arrakis with his daughter, the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), and the leader
of the Bene Gesserit, Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). In keeping with Herbert’s intentions regarding Paul’s
character arc, Villaneuve doesn’t shrink from allowing his protagonist to
travel a darkly seductive road. In Part One, Paul was unquestionably the
hero. Here, he begins a journey that will take him in a different direction. A
battle for his heart is waged by Jessica, who seeks him to achieve the fulness
of his powers, and Chani, who fears for his soul. It’s not hard to believe that
Paul became at least in part an inspiration for Anakin Skywalker – similarities
are hard to miss. Indeed, it’s apparent how many elements of Dune and Dune
Messiah (which were published at the time when George Lucas was becoming
interested in filmmaking) made their way into the first Star Wars
trilogy and its mythology (eventually fleshed out in the prequels). Three major new characters enter the fray during the course
of Part Two and Villaneuve
gives them sufficient backstory and screen time that they don’t feel like they
have been awkwardly dropped into an already-developed narrative. They are
Feyd-Rautha, the psychopath nephew of Baron Harkonnen (and his would-be heir),
who gets an entire 20-minute segment of introduction (mostly shot in
black-and-white). The Emperor, name-checked in Part One, appears in the
flesh in Part Two alongside his daughter, Irulan. Additionally, Anya
Taylor-Joy has a small role as Paul’s sister, Alia, whom he briefly meets in a
dream sequence.  The returning stable of actors - Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya,
Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgard,
and Charlotte Rampling – reprise their roles with conviction. The most
impressive turn belongs to Chalamet, whose character faces numerous
life-altering and personality-shifting changes. In a film where many of the
important men and women represent archetypes, Paul is unique. Chalamet’s
performance emphasizes not only Paul’s impetuousness and charisma but the growing
tragedy that underlies the embrace of his destiny.  As a big-screen spectacle, Part Two exceeds Part
One. The cinematography is grand and at times hauntingly beautiful. The
battles are bigger, more raw, and more intense. The desert is a character in
its own right. Hans Zimmer’s percussive score thrums and thrills. Villaneuve
makes a persuasive case for why movie theaters still exist post-pandemic.
Although the storyline is strong enough to preserve Part Two as a viable
streaming option, much of the experience will be lost outside of a venue with a
giant screen and sound-system to match. The film was made for IMAX and,
although it will play effectively in generic multiplex auditoriums, this is one
instance when the adage of “bigger means better” is applicable. Dune: Part
Two is a spectacle to behold with an underlying arc that makes it more satisfying
than a 2 1/2-hour bite of eye candy."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Theocratic authoritarianism, colonial violence, the pitiless economics of resource extraction: These subjects are present in Denis Villeneuve’s Dune movies, not as vague allegories gestured at between action sequences to add some thematic heft, but as the very substance of the story. With the release of Dune: Part Two, all the meticulous (some might say exhausting) attention Villeneuve paid to building out the first movie’s vast and complex world—an interplanetary empire governed by multiple competing families, each with centurieslong dynastic histories—pays off. More than any science-fiction epic I can think of in recent years, the Dune movies, each really constituting one-half of a full story arc, belong to the tradition of speculative science fiction that Frank Herbert’s original 1965 novel partook of and helped to establish: They are movies as much about mass belief systems and political power struggles as they are about characters and relationships, without sacrificing the specificity of the human stories at their center. I was not even a huge fan of Dune: Part One, which struck me as more visually and sonically hypnotic than it was narratively coherent. I was also among the critics who found its truncated ending almost comically abrupt. But to his great credit, Villeneuve has followed through on the task he set for himself in Dune’s moody, enigmatic, and expansive first chapter: He now returns to the world he so painstakingly established, ready to orchestrate the grand-scale conflicts that are about to tear it apart. Part Two dispenses with expository supplements like the scenes in Part One in which our young sort-of-hero Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) watches what are essentially 3D documentaries about the geography and culture of Arrakis, the planet where his family is about to be sent to command an occupying army. Instead of reviewing that material, Villeneuve dumps us directly onto Arrakis, the occupied desert planet where, at the end of the last film, Paul and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), found themselves newcomers among the planet’s native inhabitants, the underground-dwelling Fremen. Now that Paul’s father and most of his home planet’s inhabitants have been massacred by the Harkonnens, denizens of a fascistically organized planet ruled by the repellent Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), it falls to the still-inexperienced Paul to help lead the Fremen’s uprising against their colonizers. The substance over which all of these forces are fighting is the coveted mineral resource known as “spice,” a substance found only on Arrakis that has the capacity both to enable interstellar travel and to confer exceptional psychic powers to those exposed to it. Dune’s plot has no shortage of moving parts, making for plenty of scenes set elsewhere than the parched landscapes of Arrakis. An interplanetary sisterhood of soothsayers called the Bene Gesserit, in which Jessica is a powerful priestess, hovers behind the scenes, influencing the decisions of various characters through advanced practices of mind control, as well as other, more subtle methods of persuasion. The emperor himself (Christopher Walken), an elderly leader who keeps himself removed from the clashes between worlds he rules over, depends on the political savvy of his daughter, the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), herself a Bene Gesserit acolyte. And on the eerie planet of Giedi Prime, homeworld of the Harkonnens, gladiatorial games unfold as fascistic mass spectacles that recall Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi propaganda films, with battles to the death fought out in impossibly vast geometric arenas while all-black firework displays explode like inkblots against a chalk-white sky. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts do a good job of balancing the pacing among these competing story strands, but the heart of the movie’s action takes place in the sands of Arrakis, where Paul and the young Fremen rebel Chani (Zendaya), who appeared in the first film mainly as a fragmentary part of Paul’s prescient dreams, become first side-by-side fighters against the invading Harkonnens, then lovers. Part of what binds these two together is their shared resistance to the prophecy, encouraged and manipulated by the Bene Gesserit, that a messiah—in the eyes of the believers, Paul himself—would liberate the Fremen from generations of oppression by their various occupiers. Like Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars saga, then, Paul Atreides is a callow youth summoned by ancient augury to play a key role in a vast interplanetary struggle. But unlike Luke, an orphaned outsider from a remote moisture farm, Paul is a coddled son of the aristocracy, born into unimaginable privilege and educated since early childhood to assume the reins of power. Similarly, Timothée Chalamet, at 28 still convincing as a juvenile, seems to have been born to play this ambivalent prince. Chalamet’s detractors have been known to point out, sometimes accurately, that he can be unpersuasive in roles that require him to tap into a character’s darker depths, as with the wide-eyed younger version of future misanthrope Willy Wonka in the recent Wonka. But when Chalamet is well cast—as the lovestruck queer teen in Call Me by Your Name, the playful next-door neighbor in Little Women, or the reluctant prince of the house of Atreides in the Dune movies—it’s impossible to imagine anyone else in the part. And as Paul, the actor hardly shies away from confronting his own inner darkness; his recurring visions of himself as the leader of a crusade that will result in the agonizing death of millions are as terrifying as his slow but steady assumption of the mantle of power. There is something Shakespearean in the late scenes where Paul turns away from once-close relationships in the name of consolidating and augmenting his own political and personal power. His final duel with the notoriously ruthless Harkonnen Feyd-Rautha (a bone-chilling Austin Butler) is both thrillingly staged and persuasively high-stakes: In a culture as honor-based and violence-driven as the one we’ve been introduced to, it’s perfectly plausible that the fate of an interplanetary alliance might hang upon which civilization’s symmetrical-featured scion is handiest with a knife. Anyone who has seen the first Dune movie will come into the second with at least one of the same burning questions I did: When are we going to get some sandworm action? These giant invertebrates native to the planet Arrakis—I’m talking the length of at least a few city blocks—were the subject of much directorial teasing in Dune Part One but were rarely glimpsed for more than a few seconds at a time. In Part Two we are finally treated to several full-on worm-centric set pieces, including an absurd yet exalting moment when Paul gets the chance to ride one of the colossal burrowing beasts across the desert with a technique picked up from the Fremen leader Stilgar (an excellent Javier Bardem). In these and other scenes requiring computer-generated imagery—for example, in the rendering of this world’s organic-looking spaceships or the dragonfly-like “ornithopters,” which transport characters on Arrakis from place to place—the images have a solidity and texture that’s unusual in the context of the outer-space blockbuster genre. Combined with Hans Zimmer’s literally unearthly score—its booming, jagged chords seem to emerge from the same barren vistas as the dunes, the rock cliffs, and the building-sized worms—the geography and technology of this fictional world strike the viewer as genuinely new and strange, no easy task in an era when fictional space exploration is so common the outermost reaches of the galaxy can sometimes feel routine. The original Dune books have long been considered unadaptable, despite how many versions of the story have been told in the past five decades across many mediums. I haven’t read the books, only watched all extant movie adaptations (as well as the delirious 2014 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune, about the visionary director Alejandro Jodorowsky’s unsuccessful yearslong quest to film the novel), but I think I understand the consensus among their fandom that what’s unique about them translates imperfectly from page to screen; the same could be said of most truly great novels. Still, Villeneuve’s films, taken together as two halves of a single story, do effectively convey several key elements of the Duniverse: the books’ vast scale, the seriousness of their thinking about authoritarian politics and the danger inherent in religious mass movements, and their author’s rejection of the familiar trope of “the One,” a solitary (nearly always white and male) hero destined by fate to act as the savior for an (often nonwhite) oppressed population. Dune: Part Two deepens the first movie’s ambivalence toward messianic legend by embedding that ambivalence not only in Paul Atreides’ struggle to reconcile himself with his fate but in the audience’s struggle to know what outcome to root for. As the movie ends, the tone is not triumphant but ominous: After the long-desired prophecy is finally fulfilled, what rough beast slouches toward Arrakis to be born? Even those who, like me, came into the theater more or less Dune-indifferent may find themselves wanting another chapter to find out."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Without looking too closely, Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune Part Two” seems like a lot of epic sci-fi and fantasy films. A handsome young hero leads an oppressed people in rebellion against their evil overlords, fulfilling his destiny. But aside from being such an exquisite and overwhelming technical achievement, what makes “Dune Part Two” a masterpiece is that it’s always interrogating that same story, and why we need to keep telling it to ourselves in our art, in our politics, in our religion. What does it matter if you’re the Chosen One if someone else did the choosing? At the risk of sinking hip-deep into expositional quicksand, I’ll try to sum up 2021’s “Dune” here. Villeneuve streamlines Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel about a space-faring civilization where two Houses, the honorable House Atreides and the much-less-honorable House Harkonnen, are warring over the planet of Arrakis, rich in substance called spice that fuels both interstellar travel and psychic abilities. Parallels to colonialism and the exploitation of indigenous peoples and their resources are entirely intended. Except that the puppet masters of the conflict are the religious order known as the Bene Gesserit, who have set up Atreides to fail. Their prophecy states that young survivor Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) will survive and become a messiah to Arrakis’ native people, the Fremen. In striking back at Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), Paul will launch a holy war that plays into the Bene Gesserit’s murky motives. Also: big giant worms. “Dune Part Two” begins so immediately after the events of “Dune” that the body of the Fremen that Paul killed in a duel is still warm. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is all in on the messiah narrative, while young warrior Chani (Zendaya) is skeptical at giving such power to an outsider even as she and Paul develop feelings for each other. “This prophecy is how they enslave us!” she thunders to her fellow Fremen. What’s more, Paul’s mother (Rebecca Ferguson) is greasing the messianic skids by becoming sort of a Mother Superior within the Fremen, converting the ranks to believe in her son. (Moms can be so embarrassing around your new friends, right?) Meanwhile, Paul is having nightmare premonitions of the ruinous consequences of following the prophecy. What’s fascinating is that the inevitable logic of religion and of movies require that Paul walk down that path, become the hero of the story even if it means mass death and suffering. The familiar exhortations for a protagonist to “Embrace your destiny” and “Fulfill your purpose” have a sinister lure here, one that’s hard for Paul and the audience to resist even as we are told plainly where it will lead. When Paul realizes his quest for vengeance, it has less of the visceral thrill of drama and more of the impassive inevitability of history. Villeneuve wraps these unsettling uncertainties inside a beautifully made film where every grain of sand seems to have been thought out, with stunning wide-canvas action scenes, breathtaking visuals and luminous performances. Newcomers to the cast include Austin Butler as the sociopathic heir apparent to the Harkonnen clan and Florence Pugh as the Emperor’s daughter. As for the Emperor, he’s played by Christopher Walken in an effectively subdued performance, more patsy than king.  While “Dune Part Two” completes the story of Herbert’s first “Dune” novel, it would be almost gleefully perverse to end the story where “Dune Part Two” does, equivalent to ending the original “Star Wars” trilogy with a handless Luke Skywalker on the run. I don’t know where this story is headed. But I’m fascinated, thrilled and a little horrified to find out."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE," Having been delayed, amid the recent Hollywood strikes, from its original release date, in the fall of 2023, “Dune: Part Two” is understandably eager to get going. It’s off before we’ve even glimpsed the Warner Bros. logo, whose famous water tower is a helpful reminder to hydrate: we’ve got a long, dust-choked ride ahead. While the screen is black, a heavily distorted voice hisses something that we recognize as words only by the grace of subtitles: “Power over Spice is power over all.” The rare newbie to the Dune-iverse may be confused: is this a story of cumin bondage? But the meaning will be clear enough to readers of Frank Herbert’s 1965 science-fiction colossus or to those who have watched the 2021 adaptation, “Dune: Part One.” That picture—directed, like this one, by Denis Villeneuve—dropped us into an aggressively beige and brutalist version of Herbert’s cosmos and set in motion a saga of feudal conquest and environmental ruin. At the heart of the plot is the substance known as spice, capable of prolonging life, inducing prophetic visions, and enabling interstellar travel. (It’s good for any kind of trip.) Spice has long triggered fights and conspiracies among those seeking to control supply, because it exists only on Arrakis, a desert planet plagued by giant sandworms. “Dune: Part Two” opens where the previous movie ended, at the conclusion of an especially cutthroat game of thrones. It’s still the year 10191, and the bald-headed baddies of House Harkonnen, having vanquished the nobler, hairier lords of House Atreides, are now running Arrakis and its spice-mining operations. But hope springs anew in the desert, where the hero of the tale—Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), son of the tragically slain Duke Leto Atreides—has gone full T. E. Lawrence, taking refuge with blue-eyed, Bedouin-like desert dwellers known as the Fremen. Paul—fifteen in Herbert’s book—possesses extraordinary mental acuity, precocious fighting skills, luxurious windswept locks, and, as things proceed, more epithets than anyone under the age of twenty should be saddled with: Mahdi, Muad’Dib, Usul, Lisan al-Gaib, Kwisatz Haderach. You’ve heard of messiah complexes, but Paul’s case is uniquely burdensome. A faction of Fremen, led by the wry and avuncular Stilgar (a wonderful Javier Bardem), believes that Paul will lead their people to triumph over their Harkonnen oppressors. Paul’s noble mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, all fire and steel), belongs to a shadowy religious sisterhood, the Bene Gesserit, with its own twisted designs on her son. (To add a nativity story to this heady theological brew, Lady Jessica is pregnant, and Villeneuve, perhaps with a nod to Stanley Kubrick, grants us a womb with a view.) Is the prophecy true? Does it even matter, so long as Paul can weaponize his worshipful following in the pursuit of personal vengeance? Chani (Zendaya), the fierce and beautiful warrior who haunted his dreams in the first film, easily captures his heart in this one, and she tosses cold water—O.K., a drop of spittle—on his delusions of divine grandeur. Yet Zendaya, an actor of tremulous, often wordless nuance, also shows us the mounting alarm behind Chani’s skepticism. “Fear is the mind-killer,” Herbert’s text warns, and faith may be deadlier still. Paul harbors anxieties of his own. Even as the character gains in physical confidence and emotional stature, the swift and spindly Chalamet never fully sheds his boyish vulnerability. He and Zendaya get some brief moments of dunetop canoodling; were Villeneuve more of a sensualist, or Paul a bit more adventurous, we could be watching “Call Muad’Dib by Your Name.” Ultimately, though, he’s out to make war, not love. More than once, we behold his fiery visions of an apocalypse—a “holy war”—that may come to pass if he ascends. Herbert, steeping his Fremen mythology in details from Arab culture and Muslim precepts, used the word “jihad.” The apparent decision to avoid the J-word must have been made long before the most recent conflagration in the Middle East, but the movie, pitting Fremen fundamentalists against a genocidal oppressor, can scarcely hope to escape the horror of recent headlines. Yet if the movie is, among other things, a timely parable of Arab liberation, it’s at best a slippery and reluctant one, in which the politics of revolution feel curiously under-juiced. In retaining the material’s Arabic filigree, albeit with a glaring paucity of Arab actors in key Fremen roles, Villeneuve and his co-writer, Jon Spaihts, follow the text with a cautious, noncommittal blandness. Which is not to say that the picture has no mind of its own or that it sidesteps politics entirely. Villeneuve may be more cinematic logician than ideologue, but, in implicating Paul as a possible charlatan, the director shrewdly feeds our own uneasiness. He can’t fully refute the long-standing charge that “Dune” is just another white-savior fantasy, but with a measure of self-awareness he can keep it in check. In any event, he has bigger worms to fry. Paul, as part of his Fremen assimilation, must master the extreme sport of worm riding, which is a bit like windsurfing, a bit like rock climbing, and a hell of a thing to witness. Tellingly, it’s only in this glorious burst of spectacle, backed by the mighty surge of Hans Zimmer’s score, that “Dune: Part Two” rises above proficiency and flirts with transcendence. With Hollywood’s bulkiest coffers and most advanced technologies at his disposal, Villeneuve becomes a prophet in the wilderness, an evangelist for that old-time religion known as the movies. For a moment, at least, the worm turns. From the start, Villeneuve has told the story of “Dune” with exceptional lucidity, and I don’t mean that entirely as a compliment. Hollywood places a naturally high premium on narrative coherence, whereas Herbert’s text—with its abstruse tangle of names and concepts, its intricate layering of conscious and subconscious perspectives—demands otherworldly leaps of imagination. Villeneuve’s tendency, evident in the immaculate sci-fi riddles of “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017), is to streamline, to iron out every last kink of confusion or ambiguity. In “Part One,” the actors wrapped their tongues around the Herbert lexicon with po-faced conviction. (Some of them make welcome returns, including Josh Brolin, as the Atreides weapons master Gurney Halleck, and the ever-formidable Charlotte Rampling, as a Bene Gesserit reverend mother.) The actors’ skill felt of a piece with the austerity and occasional anemia of the visuals; striking as it was, the aesthetic seemed to have been imposed from without by some Marie Kondo of dystopian minimalism. “Part Two” marks an improvement, mainly because so much of it transpires not in sterile fortresses and hangars but in the vastness of the open desert, where we can better appreciate the life-or-death stakes, the hard shimmer of sunlight on sand, and the pleasing sophistication of the survival gear. When the Fremen insert siphoning tubes into their enemies’ corpses, insuring that not a single precious drop of liquid goes to waste, the world-building takes on a queasily intimate physicality. But the filmmaking loses some of that persuasiveness at scale: “Dune” is already drawing wishful comparisons to Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, but, for all the impressive pitch and frenzy of Villeneuve’s battle sequences, they don’t have Jackson’s pop-Wagnerian grandeur, his exultant B-movie flair. Villeneuve occasionally explores the universe beyond Arrakis, which only makes you long to return to Arrakis. An oasis of greenery surrounds the duplicitous Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), but the change of scenery is all but undone by the characters’ colorless solemnity. More pallid still is the dread planet Giedi Prime, where the cinematographer Greig Fraser makes a stark palette shift to black-and-white, as if to emphasize the vampiric quality of the Harkonnens’ fascism. Here, the rancidly evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) soaks in a tub of oily chowder, while his loathsome nephew, Feyd-Rautha, prepares to succeed him as Psycho-Villain-in-Chief. Feyd-Rautha is played, amusingly, by Austin Butler, who is shorn of eyebrow, Skarsgårdian of voice, and altogether unrecognizable as the star of “Elvis” (2022). What an arc: from wowing the crowds in Vegas to shivving gladiators in a monochrome replica of Caesars Palace. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Those were the last words between Timothee Chamalet’s Paul and Zendaya’s Chani after the former was impressed by the incredible sight of a Fremen riding one of the sandworms, which ended the first part of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. That was over two years ago and if it weren’t for Hollywood’s dual strike, we would have been able to see the highly-anticipated follow-up in November last year. The first Dune may have been far from the sci-fi masterpiece I expected, but it still improved over the clunky 1984 version. Of course, Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 version has its fair share of shortcomings including the visually distracting shield technology and mostly dimly-lit action sequences. Not to mention the pacing issue during the protracted third act after recently revisiting the movie. Now that the highly-anticipated follow-up is finally here, is it worth the long wait? The answer is a resounding Y-E-S. It’s as epic as it gets and Villeneuve sure delivers that promise. And what a visual spectacle, especially if you watch this on IMAX as it is meant to be. But before I continue with my review, here’s what happens in Dune: Part Two: The story picks up shortly after the events of the first film as Paul and his reluctant mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) choose to join the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). They continue their journey along the desert planet of Arrakis and from there, they face an imminent danger against the tyrannical Harkonnens ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), who was responsible for massacring the Atreides family. As the war rages on, the sequel also introduces plenty of new characters, namely Baron’s youngest nephew Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) and Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) as well as his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). Dune: Part Two runs around 10 minutes longer than the first film and unlike the latter’s admittedly exposition-heavy narrative approach, Villeneuve and returning co-writer Jon Spaihts successfully raises the stakes reminiscent of a war-movie structure. It helps that Hans Zimmer’s atmospheric and energetic score enlivens the film. The follow-up wastes little time giving us a taste of the battle between the Paul-led Fremen and the Harkonnen soldiers in the earlier scene, showcasing Villeneuve’s (thankfully!) better handling in the action department. He also shows a good sense of visual panache — a battle in the otherwise vast plain-looking dune of Arrakis contrasting with the sights of the crimson-orange sky. The action gets better as the film moves on. Scenes like Fremen’s tactical ambush against the Harkonnen’s battleship and ornithopter and some hand-to-hand combats, notably the violent knife fight between Paul and Feyd-Rautha are all visually captivating. Since Villeneuve stages Dune: Part Two like a war movie, he doesn’t forget to pull back his camera with Greig Fraser again in charge of the cinematography, allowing us to immerse in the widescreen view of exploding vehicles or properties. Fraser’s cinematography deserves equal praise for his excellent use of colour (the aforementioned earlier sequence is one of them) and so does the strangely monochrome visual palette taking place in the gladiatorial arena of Harkonnen’s homeworld, Giedi Prime. The latter evokes a surrealistic visual quality which also effectively introduces us to Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha (a role previously played by the red-haired Sting in the otherwise epic 1984 debacle), a bald and sadistic Harkonnen warrior whose stark-cold remorseless presence easily made him one of the best characters in Dune: Part Two. The sandworm, which was previously hinted at in the first film, is now prominently featured in this follow-up. And yes, there are more of these intimidating giant worm-like creatures and the IMAX screen certainly captures the monumental scope of their appearances. A crucial scene of Paul finally getting his chance to ride a sandworm is undoubtedly a sight to behold. Villeneuve may have been pulling all the stops in terms of the visual spectacle but he doesn’t forget to tell an intriguing story about a young man’s quest to lead the uprising with the Fremen against the Harkonnens. Kudos also go to Villeneuve’s crafty storytelling later in the film as the plot thickens and here, we learn more about some of the characters’ motivations. The story delves deeper into intergalactic politics and related themes of power and corruption. Sure, it’s all familiar stuff since Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune has already inspired many like-minded sci-fi films, notably Star Wars back in 1977. And yet, that doesn’t stop Villeneuve from turning the otherwise oft-told storyline into an engrossing cinematic experience. The cast, in the meantime, is a mixed bag. Timothee Chamalet is given a substantial character arc, moving away from an inexperienced Paul Atreides seen in the first film and has now become more confident in embracing his destiny. Many Fremen including Stilgar (Javier Bardem fares better this time around and even provides some of the movie’s unexpectedly much-needed comic relief) see him as a messiah a.k.a. the chosen one while others remain sceptical. Rebecca Ferguson delivers a solid supporting turn as Paul’s manipulative mother, Jessica. Zendaya’s role as the tough Chani, who eventually falls in love with Paul, is given more screen time and she does a good job here. Stellan Skarsgard’s Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, however, seems to be less effective in this follow-up while Dave Bautista’s impulsive Rabban is worth mentioning. As mentioned earlier, Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha is impressive but the same cannot be said for other franchise newcomers. Christopher Walken seems like an inspired choice to play the scheming Emperor Shaddam IV but he looks as if he’s sleepwalking throughout his role. Dune: Part Two also wasted the otherwise talented Florence Pugh in a thankless role as Princess Irulan. If there’s any consolation, at least she isn’t as bad as Virginia Madsen previously played the character in the 1984 version. Dune: Part Two ends with another cliffhanger and yes, there are more stories to tell since the late Frank Herbert wrote five more books between 1969 and 1985. Villeneuve is reportedly interested in making the third film and second book in the series, Dune Messiah. Here’s hoping he’s given the green light to go ahead sometime in the future. But until then, go watch Dune: Part Two on IMAX."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Jeanne: Positively mind blowing --- director Denis Villeneuve and his magnificent cast and crew have created a nearly three-hour colossal
achievement in filmmaking. DUNE: PART TWO excels in all areas, including writing, editing, set designs, cinematography, visual effects, music --- and especially acting. The screenplay by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, based on Frank Herbert’s acclaimed novel “DUNE”, is riveting and
thankfully easier to follow than one might expect from such a story involving a multitude of characters and various subplots. The adventure begins where DUNE (2021) left off, following the plight of
Paul Atreides (Timothée
Chalamet), after the murder of his father, Duke Leto Atreides. Paul, his mother, Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), the fierce, dedicated Fremen warrior, Chani (Zendaya), and
Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of the Fremen, are seeking shelter in the desert on Planet Arrakis. Stilgar is convinced that Paul is “the one” --- the savior. But Paul is more focused on revenge
for the murder of his father, though he realizes the ramifications of his actions could cause harm to many, chaos and
possibly war. Still, it is imperative that Paul prove himself to the Fremen, thus Stilgar puts Paul through a series of tests such as
drinking the Water of Life, which is blue --- and toxic, and then mastering the art of riding a sandworm. This particular sequence is one of the most exciting in DUNE: PART TWO, truly a marvel in the
visual effects department and one Chalamet worked on for three months. Meanwhile, the Harkonnens, ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), persist in mining the sands of Arrakis
for spice. Baron’s psychotic nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), is eager to stake his claim and is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way, which eventually leads to a spectacular
fight scene between him and Paul. DUNE: PART TWO reunites such pivotal characters as Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and
Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). New to the film are Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux) and Shishakli
(Souheila Yacoub), all of whom add to the splendor of Villeneuve’s triumph. Chalamet was impressive in DUNE, but here in Part Two he has grown into this demanding role with great confidence and
aplomb. His on-screen presence has matured, making it difficult to imagine anyone else playing Paul. That, and his chemistry with Zendaya is alluring. They are completely well-suited, with her
infusing Chani with all the intensity she can muster. The entire cast is superb. Butler is a brilliant addition as Feyd-Rautha, breaking out of his Elvis persona with an
inspired performance as that one insane family member who just can’t be controlled. His makeover renders Butler almost unrecognizable. And Bardem is once again reliably effective as he is in
any part he undertakes. This all could have gone off the rails for Villeneuve, though, had it not been for the script by him and Spaihts. It’s
always about the writing, especially when the story you’re telling is as intricate and as convoluted as DUNE. But they manage to keep the action moving without becoming bogged down in too many finer
points --- and thankfully not too many elongated battle scenes. As previously mentioned, the anticipated combat scene between Paul and Feyd-Rautha is incredible with amazing
choreography by the fight coordinator, Roger Yuan. DUNE: PART TWO is simply epic --- an extraordinary feat topped off by a phenomenal score from Hans Zimmer. And surprisingly, it’s not too long. David, despite his disdain for most films of this genre, did not fall

the areas of cinematography, production design, editing, sound, visual effects, costume design as well as music by Hans Zimmer. This sequel is a mere eleven minutes longer than the original, and I
had no problem staying involved and avoiding a brief snooze like some of these bloated epics do. First and foremost, in Chalamet’s capable hands, his character Paul Atreides is truly the savior Stilgar (Bardem)
imagined. One unforgettable scene has Paul perched atop a high cliff shouting encouragement to the citizens of the Planet Arrakis. It’s a signature moment in the
development and acceptance of Paul as their messiah. 
Another indelible sequence is an incredibly staged fight between Paul and the nephew of
Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgård), Feyd-Rautha, a portrayal by Butler that
is overtly menacing. Unlike so many other battle scenes, this one does not overstay its welcome, which greatly enhances its exceptionally high level of tension. Chalamet and Butler render
truly mesmerizing performances while the entire ensemble cast is flawless. 
The romantic scenes between Paul and Chani (Zendaya) serve as quiet relief from all the action --- and a supposition
that although this story is set approximately 8000 years from now, human interaction doesn’t change all that much. 
The marvelous set designs and visual effects are once again jaw-dropping. For sci-fi buffs, it doesn’t get any better than
the highly imaginative and immensely entertaining DUNE: PART TWO, which should be seen on the biggest screen available."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," Jeanne: Positively mind blowing --- director Denis Villeneuve and his magnificent cast and crew have created a nearly three-hour colossal
achievement in filmmaking. DUNE: PART TWO excels in all areas, including writing, editing, set designs, cinematography, visual effects, music --- and especially acting. The screenplay by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, based on Frank Herbert’s acclaimed novel “DUNE”, is riveting and
thankfully easier to follow than one might expect from such a story involving a multitude of characters and various subplots. The adventure begins where DUNE (2021) left off, following the plight of
Paul Atreides (Timothée
Chalamet), after the murder of his father, Duke Leto Atreides. Paul, his mother, Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson), the fierce, dedicated Fremen warrior, Chani (Zendaya), and
Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of the Fremen, are seeking shelter in the desert on Planet Arrakis. Stilgar is convinced that Paul is “the one” --- the savior. But Paul is more focused on revenge
for the murder of his father, though he realizes the ramifications of his actions could cause harm to many, chaos and
possibly war. Still, it is imperative that Paul prove himself to the Fremen, thus Stilgar puts Paul through a series of tests such as
drinking the Water of Life, which is blue --- and toxic, and then mastering the art of riding a sandworm. This particular sequence is one of the most exciting in DUNE: PART TWO, truly a marvel in the
visual effects department and one Chalamet worked on for three months. Meanwhile, the Harkonnens, ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), persist in mining the sands of Arrakis
for spice. Baron’s psychotic nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), is eager to stake his claim and is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way, which eventually leads to a spectacular
fight scene between him and Paul. DUNE: PART TWO reunites such pivotal characters as Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and
Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). New to the film are Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux) and Shishakli
(Souheila Yacoub), all of whom add to the splendor of Villeneuve’s triumph. Chalamet was impressive in DUNE, but here in Part Two he has grown into this demanding role with great confidence and
aplomb. His on-screen presence has matured, making it difficult to imagine anyone else playing Paul. That, and his chemistry with Zendaya is alluring. They are completely well-suited, with her
infusing Chani with all the intensity she can muster. The entire cast is superb. Butler is a brilliant addition as Feyd-Rautha, breaking out of his Elvis persona with an
inspired performance as that one insane family member who just can’t be controlled. His makeover renders Butler almost unrecognizable. And Bardem is once again reliably effective as he is in
any part he undertakes. This all could have gone off the rails for Villeneuve, though, had it not been for the script by him and Spaihts. It’s
always about the writing, especially when the story you’re telling is as intricate and as convoluted as DUNE. But they manage to keep the action moving without becoming bogged down in too many finer
points --- and thankfully not too many elongated battle scenes. As previously mentioned, the anticipated combat scene between Paul and Feyd-Rautha is incredible with amazing
choreography by the fight coordinator, Roger Yuan. DUNE: PART TWO is simply epic --- an extraordinary feat topped off by a phenomenal score from Hans Zimmer. And surprisingly, it’s not too long. David, despite his disdain for most films of this genre, did not fall
asleep once. He was thoroughly engrossed --- as was I. David: DUNE: PART TWO joins a select group of films wherein the sequel is superior to the original. Since DUNE (2021) raked in half a dozen

"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,&#8230;a true-blue&#40;-eyed&#41; triumph for modern mainstream cinema and an experience that can make even the biggest of projection screens feel even bigger&#46;
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE," In his follow-up to the masterful first chapter, director Denis Villeneuve barrels through a complex story line to offer a visual feast, serving up one of the most jaw dropping cinematic events in years. You can almost feel him say “let’s have some fun here” and, indeed, if you don’t look for a whole lot of story detail, you can gorge on the groundbreaking beauty in each and every frame. And you’ll be in on all that fun, too. Yes, there is a story. Paul (Timothee Chalamet) meets up with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, combining forces to revenge the death of his father. There are a lot of themes almost flirted with, everything from hero worship to the fury of war. And while there are moments of emotional depth, this is very much more a movie about art, both human and computer generated. Even at a length of 2 hours and 46 minutes, Villeneuve hardly has time for transitions. Instead, we pretty much leap from vista to vista, battle to battle. The few scenes that allow more traditional story telling, relying on words and actors to say them, work nicely. But at some point, I stopped trying to figure out how some things happened, or the particulars of why. I just sat back and enjoyed the amazing looking ride. Resistance, I learned, was futile. There’s star filled cast, also including a nifty Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Lea Seydoux and Charlotte Rampling. Two treats come from a surprising Austin Butler and an in-on-the-joke Javier Bardem. But the heart of this one involves Chalamet, at his best, stripped away from the cutesiness of some of his other work and a wonderful Zendaya, whose physical performance is every bit as compelling as are the computer generated goodies that surround her."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL," In this critic’s review of the first Denis Villeneuve Dune chapter from 2021, a two-pronged question was asked of can the melodramatic be made mythic and can the gaudy be made truly grand? Heart was a sizable absent element among the triumphant fury of its large-scale presentation. A little over two years and 166 more minutes later, that inquiry remains unsatisfied. While moderately better than the distended previous film at attempting grander essence, the screen-and-seat rattling power of Dune: Part Two’s erosive gusts of art and precision can only amass so high of crest before it loses itself within its own wind. Dune: Part Two begins in the aftermath of the first movie on the spice-mining planet of Arrakis in the distant future. The surviving Ducal heir Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet, newly gilded as a four-quadrant box office draw after Wonka) has bested a high-level Fremen warrior in ceremonial combat to safeguard escort for he and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of the Mission: Impossible series). His victory also earned the honor and respect of the Fremen field leader Stilgar (Academy Award winner Javier Bardem) and the suspicious attention of Chani (current cultural icon Zendaya), a female warrior he sees in his romantic dreams of the future. The royal mother and son are fleeing the forces of the despotic Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his militaristic nephew heirs Glossu Rabban (Guardians of the Galaxy strongman Dave Bautista) and Feyd-Rautha (Elvis breakout star Austin Butler) who are basking in their recent total decimation of the previously ruling Atriedes house. What Dune: Part Two and its celebrated source novel by Frank Herbert have an abundance of is elegiac spirituality. Stilgar sees goals, abilities, potential, and temperament in Paul that are different from other human outsiders. He believes Paul to be the Lisan al-Gaib or ""the Voice from the Outer World” and labels him the Mahdi, a prophet promised to the Fremen for centuries who will arrive to lead and drive out their invading oppressors. LESSON #1: THE POWER OF MESSIANIC CONTROL– The term of messianic control is simple and Paul is the linchpin of all linchpins for this epic struggle. Give the natives the promise of a savior and they will comply with fear and worship towards either their next liberator or, unfortunately, their next enslaver. Stilgar’s traditional half of the Fremen see all the current transpired happenings and victories coming from inserted leadership and involvement of Paul as answered prayers. Meanwhile, the more progressive and skeptical among them, including Chani, see the potential of a false prophet. As it turns out, their indigenous culture’s long-held belief in the Lisan al-Gaib and Mahdi is a manufactured one planted by manipulative outside colonizers– like Paul’s own ancestors of the Atriedes and Harkonnen houses– creating the multi-generational cycle of oppression and control on the arenaceous planet. With his prescient abilities increasing and his graduation to mount and control the massive sandworms of Arakkis, Paul avoids exercising his power to ascend to higher leadership as he assists the Fremen with attacks disrupting the Harkonnens’ mining operations, a strategic move to hit them in their corruptive greed for the planet’s valuable spice Melange. He would rather believe in himself and not some proverb to fight alongside the Fremen rather than over them. Paul’s mother– empowered to become the newly anointed Reverend Mother of the Fremen– actively works against her son’s neutral wishes by increasing the spiritual fervor surrounding him as a means to sway non-believers to their side. The ascension towards the ultimate ruling title of the Kwisatz Haderach is being leveraged the most. All of this is a path to war reaching the highest political positions of the galaxy, namely Emperor Shaddah IV (Oscar winner Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Oppenheimer’s temptress Florence Pugh). The foreboding saber-rattling of this clash is toweringly ornamented with some of the best technical and artistic production value you’re going to find from any major studio film. The desert sands and skies of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates playing the arid settings of Arakkis look impressively vast when shot wide and equally textured in delicateness up close through the lenses of returning Oscar-winning Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser. Through Fraser, Villeneuve replaced his arousal to dwell on establishing shots of ships taking off and landing (don’t worry; they’re still here and about as thrilling as watching a shopper park a fat SUV in a supermarket parking lot only with a better soundtrack and airborne angles) for punctuating transition ones of digitized crowds moving and chanting in perfect unison.  As with its 2021 predecessor, the Academy Award-honored departments for visual effects, sound, editing, score, and production design remain stupendously brilliant and applied to a more outdoor and kinetic picture than the first. Hans Zimmer’s exotic score in particular, while at times sounding like disturbing noises you wouldn’t want hear from a malfunctioning furnace in a haunted house, brings the serious energy to a fever pitch. Dune: Part Two is a more physical film, which elevated the necessary success required of the costume design department headed by 5-time and current Killers of the Flower Moon Oscar nominee Jacqueline West and the stunt and fight teams steered by coordinator Roger Yuan. Their work came ready to battle. LESSON #2: SPIRITUAL IMPACT VERSUS MYTHIC IMPACT– No matter how much inundating sensory coolness radiates from Dune: Part Two, the higher mythic eminence is still missing, bogged down by the excess reliance on spirituality. Here’s the problem with that. Spirituality is predominantly rooted in verbose talk, looming voices, hypothetical dictums, and faith-centered prognostications ranging from heavenly promise to the bleakest doom. Those qualities get the mind spinning on “what if.” On the other hand, the mythic is more substantial; born from legendary actions, empowering feats, binding passion, and shades of heroism. Those types of triggers get the heart spinning which, for many, is more powerful than the mental half. Short of lassoing a sandworm, for the second film in a row, the screenwriting of Denis Villenueve and Jon Spaihts cannot achieve that next tier of swell and it painfully shows. The closest Dune: Part Two gets is slight elevations in the performance platforms from some of the returning cast members. Timothée Chalamet’s lead protagonist becomes stronger and more untethered from previous fears as the film goes on, but that only constitutes a few extra decibels in his portending monologues and a yelled rally or two. He is paired across from villains, starting with Stellan Skarsgård, that, despite their makeup work and physical stature are frankly not scary or intimidating. It’s going to take more to haunt an audience and present the fanatical evil worthy of defeat than a few lightning-quick PG-13 throat slashes to nameless underlings, Dave Bautista’s two verbal gears of whisper and shout, and new arrival Austin Butler dropping “darlins” like he’s still working the Memphis droll from another movie. Feeling the wailing echoes of David Lynch’s campy take on all this from 40 years ago, more twisted weirdness could have gone a long way without sacrificing the stern edge sought by Villeneuve’s adaptation.  Thank goodness for Javier Bardem. He– more than Zendaya playing the love interest and spiritual skeptic reduced too quickly to the same furrowed brow scowl of torn feelings– is the intangible ticker of this movie as the truest believer of the overarching prophecy that fuels the saga’s importance. He’s the one person performing to a degree to portray being genuinely moved by what’s happening around him.  Even still, everyone else is cemented is moored stoicism. So much of the Dune: Part Two dialogue (a noted dislike of the director) that could be winning hearts and minds is delivered in hushed platitudes. It’s positively wild than one of the loudest movies possible utilizing the biggest film screens the industry has to offer can move someone so little where it counts. The crazy part is, Villeneuve and Dune still aren’t done. What began and was sourced from one interminably written ordeal could quickly become an interminable cinematic one as well. We had to bank on exertion and promise in 2021, and we will have to do so again."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE, An absolute behemoth of filmmaking&#46; A spectacular that truly serves the best cinema has to offer&#46; It&#8217;s gigantic&#44; epic&#44; and sprawling&#46;&#46;&#46; it engulfs your body and buries you in its immense scope and scale&#46;&#46;&#46; This generation&#8217;s &apos;Return of the King&#46;&apos;
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," In many respects, DUNE: PART TWO is very much like the middle films of those other great film fantasy trilogies of the last forty years – STAR WARS and LORD OF THE RINGS. Similar to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and THE TWO TOWERS, respectively, the second DUNE film here is well-executed on every level, yet still feels a tad incomplete as it’s only Act II. Director Denis Villeneuve’s latest is breathless in scope, action, and artistry, but holding one’s breath another couple of years to see things wrapped up in the third movie breeds impatience. All the more so because the film is firing on all cylinders making for a truly epic cinematic experience. DUNE: PART TWO pulls you immediately into its world, picking up right after the events of the first film. Once again, Paul Altreides (Timothée Chalamet) is at the center of things, flexing his new muscles as it has been foreseen that he will be the one to lead the indigenous Fremen out of bondage on their own planet of Arrakis. Their world is now being run by the nefarious overlord Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and Paul despises him further for assassinating his father (Oscar Isaac) in the first part of the story. Director Denis Villeneuve continues to bring all of the same skill and devotion to author Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 science fiction novel that he did three years ago, though in part two, the story of Paul accelerates as he steps up to lead and grows into an often surly and self-interested adult. It’s a fascinating character arc, and there is a deepening of almost all the players this time out which makes for a more intimate story despite the epic surroundings of the desert planet rendered wholly real vis a vis truly jaw-dropping special effects. While in that desert, Paul bonds with Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the leader of the indigenous people who is his greatest supporter. He believes that the young man truly is a Messianic figure who has what’s needed to challenge the brutal and greedy Harkonnen now harvesting their drug-like spice found within its sands. Additionally, rebel fighter Chani (Zendaya) is in Paul’s corner too as a fellow soldier, his teacher of the ways of the Fremen, and comely love interest. The scenes between Paul and Chani are charming if rather chaste, but it’s nice to see Zendaya stepping into the limelight here. (Her part in the first one was as slight as her lithe frame.) Still, writers Villeneuve and Jon Spaights imbue the scenes of the star-crossed lovers with heart and wit, especially when Chani teaches Paul how to navigate the sands on foot. Their in-tandem choreography, sashaying across the plains, plays like an arid Astaire and Rogers. Delightful. Both Stilgar and Chani also help Paul learn to corral the ginormous sand worms to be utilized as transports for great distances. This could’ve looked utterly silly and did in David Lynch’s misbegotten attempt back in 1984 with its painfully crude green screen effects. But here, Villeneuve and his CGI wizards make such scenes not only believable but mesmerizing. Even scenes later, when a number of sand worms seem to be called upon as desert Ubers, the effects and scale still dazzle. In fact, the CGI looks so utterly believable, you’ll swear it was all shot in a real desert. Paul has less success navigating the trust and alliance of his own mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). A prickly pear to begin with, the former royal only grows more mysterious and manipulative with each minute of her story. Ferguson is fantastic in the part, especially when she becomes empowered by taking over the role as Fremen high priestess. She’s even more formidable then, challenging Paul’s decisions and even trying to manipulate him via her newly discovered head games. The antagonism between these two protagonists make for the best character interactions in the film. New characters are introduced and two of them manage to make a great impression. Austin Butler plays Feyd-Rautha, the Baron’s psychotic son, and he cuts a truly terrifying figure – lean and lethal. Florence Pugh makes the most out of her smallish part this go-round, though her Princess Irulan, daughter of the less-than-honorable Emperor (Christopher Walken), will figure more strongly in the rest of the story. Pugh makes every gesture, pause and glower into something special, and she’s one of the talents working today who makes thinking on camera as fascinating as when speaking. Walken is so-so in his part as he looks more lost than malevolent. He should’ve played up the royal arrogance the way  José Ferrer did in Lynch’s take, one of the few comparisons that benefits the 1984 take.  A few other characters get short-changed this go-round, like Josh Brolin’s brusque warrior Gurney Halleck, and most amazingly, Skarsgård in the role of the primary bad guy. He cut such a slothful and repulsive figure in the first film, but for a villain of such heft, his part is demonstrably thinner here. As in DUNE: PART ONE, Villeneuve aces the action, enabling through-lines to come through clearly, and never using editing to mask short cuts in storyboarding or budgeting. Of particular note is the one-on-one combat scene late in the story between Chalamet and Butler. It wholly looks like the two stars are performing their own stunts, and the fight is shot like a dance number to show the full bodies engaging each other versus cutaways to hide the stunt people. But even as good as that fight is, or as all of the brutal battle scenes are between the warring parties in this chapter, this second installment is notable for how it shifts the focus more and more towards the fallout of its skirmishes. What are the societal consequences of Lady Jessica and her clairvoyant but unborn baby barking orders at the citizenry and plotting military strategy? Will Paul need to sacrifice his own personal happiness, and a potential marriage to Chani to keep intergalactic peace after his battle wins? And what maneuvers must he and the Fremon put on the table to ensure the entirety of the other planets in the galaxy  go along with the new shifts in power? It’s a lot of political food for thought, such queries that could make the third film the most fascinating and complicated of all. Villeneuve ensures that Herbert’s symbolism isn’t as heavy-handed as it often was in his prose. And he lets a lot of visuals speak louder than the dialogue, especially as echoes of character –  you’ll note how slyly Jessica’s transport carrier resembles a serpent’s head. The filmmaker doesn’t underline the Christian allegories too blatantly either. Still, the film is very sharp as it questions the role of a messiah in war and how power done in the name of righteousness can still be horrific and inhumane. DUNE: PART TWO is nothing if not quite pointed in echoing similar power struggles today, sharing characteristics of the fights going on in both the Ukraine and Gaza. Some may view this simply as epic filmmaking as good as it gets, or sci-fi that is both intellectual and invigorating. But look closer, and it plays as a shrewd dissertation on power and the sacrifices it takes to hold onto it. It’s not just eye-popping spectacle, it’s thought-provoking cinema. And both its look and scope are best observed on the big screen. DUNE: PART TWO truly deserves such a large canvas."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," Now that Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has not only been accepted by the Fremen, but thought by many, especially Stilgar (Javier Bardem), to be the Mahdi who will save the spice producing planet of Arrakis, he must choose between his own desire and the fate of the universe in “Dune: Part Two.” Now that Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has not only been accepted by the Fremen, but thought by many, especially Stilgar (Javier Bardem), to be the Mahdi who will save the spice producing planet of Arrakis, he must choose between his own desire and the fate of the universe in “Dune: Part Two.” If you haven’t seen Part One of “Dune” since it came out over two  years ago, you may want to revisit before viewing Part Two as cowriter (with ""Part One's"" Jon Spaihts)/director Denis Villeneuve jumps right back into the action where it left off with no exposition to allow one to catch one’s breath.  If the first part was full of intrigue, politics and betrayal, the follow-up is its ponderous playing out as Atreides fights against the Harkonnen ravishing Arrakis for Spice with the Fremen who live there while his expectant parent Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) defies tradition to become a powerful Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother.  Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), last seen disappearing into the fog of war reappears to Paul’s great delight and the Fremen’s distrust.  And once again, the film ends with a cliffhanger, a third installment all but guaranteed.
This one has two big things going for it.  Director of photography Greig Fraser has made the sand dunes of Arrakis truly stunning, the film far more of a visual feast than its predecessor (special effects are also notable, Villeneuve going for sweep with his Fascistic Harkonnen army and their massive firepower).  And in this one, Timmy surfs a sandworm, a rousing scene and great effect that cements his status with Stilgar and is repeated alongside multiple Fremen, including love interest Chani (Zendaya), near film’s end.  But while many may be impressed with the introduction of Baron Harkonnen’s (Stellan Skarsgård) sociopathic nephew Feyd-Rautha, as played by a bald Austin Butler (“Elvis”) he seems little more than a black and white special effect, albeit a visually interesting one.  More disappointing is our introduction to the Emperor, Christopher Walken’s slack-jawed, one note performance suggesting senility, his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), presenting as the real power behind the throne.
Another “Part Two” introduction is Léa Seydoux’s Bene Gesserit Lady Margot Fenring, sent to seduce Feyd-Rautha before his big arena scene against a slave gladiator.  Anna Taylor-Joy’s much commented upon cameo is one of Paul’s glimpses into the future.  In fact, most of “Dune: Part Two’s” intrigue involves its female characters, from Lady Jessica training with Reverend Mother Ramallo (Giusi Merli) and attaining power ingesting the ‘Water of Life’ to the big emotional moment involving Atreides, Irulan and Chani near film’s end.  Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) is in one foul mood indeed.
Fans of the Frank Herbert novels may be well pleased as punch, but despite this one’s cinematic grandeur, I found its story telling over two hour and forty-six minutes mostly tedious.

"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," Había dudas tras el final de ‘Dune’ de que la operación de adaptar una de las obras de ciencia ficción más influyentes de la historia se resolviera de una forma armoniosa con una segunda parte, pero realmente ‘Dune: parte dos’ no solo redondea el anémico final de la primera, convirtiendo la dupla en la mejor versión vista hasta ahora de la primera novela, sino que da un nuevo sentido al camino de Paul Atreides. Denis Villeneuve ha deconstruido el clásico camino del héroe en el equivalente a una épica bíblica de Cecil B. DeMille en clave fantástica, solo que aquí Moisés, quien también hace una visita al desierto que le transforma para liberar a un pueblo al que pertenece por adopción, no abre las aguas del mar rojo, sino que monta una lombriz gigante para demostrar que es el elegido. Lo interesante del concepto aquí es que Paul Atreides no es precisamente el modelo de figura de salvador al que nos ha acostumbrado Hollywood. Es bastante alucinante ver las dos películas seguidas porque se aprecia el radical cambio en el personaje, gracias en muy buena parte a un Timothée Chalamet muy preciso, capaz de mostrar la evolución del heredero de una forma bastante tenue, pero la diferencia entre el punto de partida y el minuto final es abismal, y no solo porque sea una carrera de aprendizaje, sino que nos muestra un lado oscuro que Villeneuve parece haber tenido más en cuenta que David Lynch, probablemente porque nos prepare para lo que se verá a lo largo de la saga de Herbert. Todo esta transformación fascinante ocupa el centro emocional de la segunda entrega, que transcurre sobre un impecable lienzo de pura ciencia ficción bélica, que en manos de la fotografía de Greig Fraser parece entrar en colisión con una gran instalación de arte moderno a escala brutalista. Y es que sigue resultando apabullante la forma de Villeneuve para manejar la geografía de Arrakis, haciendo parecer sencillas escenas muy complicadas, como “la doma de Shai-Hulud” que nos sumerge de forma que somos nosotros quien cabalgamos la lombriz gigante. La dirección de arte y la integración de efectos está a un nivel de excelencia apenas visto, que junto a ‘The Creator’ marca un estándar al que cualquier superproducción debería aspirar: creatividad espacial, uso narrativo de la profundidad de campo, planificación en localizaciones y una armonía cromática que alcanza un nivel casi experimental con una escena de coliseo llevada al blanco y negro más expresivo para aumentar la representación decadente, desagradable y oscura de la casa Harkonnen. El Feyd-Rautha de Austin Butler es como un ogro de pesadilla, con una representación casi de cine de terror que se apoya en un inspirado (y casi industrial) corte de un Hans Zimmer cuyos tics implementan la sensación maximalista de todos los grandes eventos del camino de Atreides. ‘Dune: parte 2’ es una verdadera epopeya de arena y sol al estilo de ‘Lawrence de Arabia’ en donde se filtran ideas de geopolítica, religión, superstición y el poder de los dogmas en un estado, un blockbuster adulto y plagado de zonas grises. Los paralelismos reales con el colonialismo y la lucha por los recursos que se atisbaban en la primera siguen hasta el punto que parece que Frank Herbert hubiera predicho los incendios petroleros de Kuwait, una dimensión fascinante que añade multitud de permutaciones a un film que no racanea gran espectáculo. Las escenas de acción y batalla no serán el factor más constante en la película, pero aparecen como resortes y claves de algo más grande, como representación de los tejemanejes imperiales y militares y no como puro fin de evasión. Y sí, hay mucha más Zendaya, pero también Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux y, sobre todo, una imperial Rebecca Ferguson. También, claro, vemos la prometida aparición Anya Taylor-Joy, en un papel no muy extenso, pero seguramente decisivo para lo que viene. Porque si una cosa deja claro su final es que viene más ‘Dune’, aunque esta vez sí, la novela correspondiente se cierra en el punto que debe, pese a que deje abierto el futuro como forma de una continuidad inabarcable, ¿podremos dejar de ver historias en este universo alguna vez? Hay hasta 23 libros para averiguarlo. Lo importante es que ‘Dune: parte 2’, pese a ser una expansión de todo lo bueno de la primera (más diseños, más humor sobrio) y poco de lo malo de aquella (esas escenas de acción cuerpo a cuerpo...), no deja de ser una pieza más del mismo puzle, plenamente continuista en tono y aspecto, por lo que no se deben esperar grandes cambios e intenciones respecto a su narración, aunque se puede esperar la división habitual en estos blockbusters de fantasía. De una forma u otra, si hay una película en lo que va de año que merece ir a verla en la pantalla más grande posible, es esta."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," It’s pretty awesome that Dune, a famously hard-to-adapt science fiction novel, is finally getting the proper film treatment commensurate to the amount of detail and mythology the weighty tome contains. No love lost to the David Lynch film (which, for all its flaws, I adore), and the 2000s era miniseries (which I haven’t seen, but would like to), but Denis Villeneuve’s two-part epic is likely the best adaptation we’ll ever get, both in terms of story and in terms of a budget that allows for the visuals to be properly developed.  In my review of Dune: Chapter One, I noted that one does not go see an adaptation of Dune to find out what happens, much the same way no one goes to see a production of Romeo & Juliet to find out what happens. We already know what happens! We just want to see what elements are brought to the story by this specific production. I stand by this assessment to a degree — Dune-heads will want to see how this version stacks up to the many others — but it occurs to me now that the popularity of Dune, specifically the NEW popularity of Dune, means that a lot of viewers will be coming to the story for the first time via this current iteration. Whereas the 2021 film, as excellent as it was, might’ve felt like inside baseball to newcomers, its sequel fills in the gaps and offers a strong ending to what felt, both to newcomers and hardcore fans, like an incomplete experience.  The truncated nature of Part One is not a demerit, per se — it comes with the territory. But with the second film now in my brain bank, one of the strongest markers of good science fiction has become apparent: trust in the audience’s intelligence. Overexplaining is a much worse crime than underexplaining, and really, when it comes to the Dune mythology, there are as many broad strokes as there are minute details, so even a passive viewer can follow the blockbustery beats, even if it causes them to miss the dense thematics packaged within.  Part Two picks up literal moments after the first film ended. The House of Atreides has been betrayed by Emperor Shadam, who sent the Harkonnen and Sardaukar soldiers to execute every last member of the noble house. The Harkonnens have resumed oversight of spice production on Arrakis, confident that the Atreides clan are all dead or close to it. What they don’t know is that Paul (Timothée Chalamebyyourname), heir to the Atreides throne, has escaped their grasp, and is now shacking up with the Fremen, Arrakis’ native people. Roughly half of the Fremen, along with Paul’s mother, Jady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) believe Paul to be the prophesied savior of Arrakis, but the other half, which includes Paul’s romantic interest Chani (Zendaya), reject the spiritual angle, viewing Paul as just another warrior among their ranks.  Meanwhile, the emperor is preparing his unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, who passed on the hilarious opportunity to do his Elvis voice the whole time) to become the new leader of Arrakis and bring spice production back to its pre-Atreides glory days.  Unfortunately for Rautha, and his big galoot of a brother, Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista), the Fremen have been very successful at hindering spice production via guerrilla style attacks on harvesters.  It’s a metric fuckton of story, but the script, by Jon Spaihts and Denis Villeneuve, makes it all pretty easy to follow. Fans of the novel will notice a few plot omissions, only one which is particularly glaring, but none are made at the expense of story or theme. Even at nearly three hours in length, there’s simply not enough room for every detail. Even so, it’s the most complete and functional adaptation we’re ever going to get. It is unmistakably Dune.  The script does suffer in a way that is inherent to such a dense mythology. The events covered in Chapter Two are supposed to take place over the course of multiple years. As it unspools on screen it only feels like a few weeks at most. This leads to a few instances where it seems like a character has knowledge that they wouldn’t have had a chance to obtain just yet, or makes a decision based on long-held notions that simply haven’t had the time to manifest. Only they did have the time to manifest, but we in the audience weren’t cued to feel the passage of time. It’s a tough line to walk, especially when you’re dealing with such a long run time. At this length, pacing is key. Villeneuve/Spaihts have correctly erred on the side of brisk pacing, but one does wonder if a few title cards or some dialogue that speaks to the timeframe could smooth this issue out.  Even so, it’s a small complaint rendered moot by the enormity of what’s been accomplished here. Visually, Dune: Part Two is considerably more ambitious than its predecessor. The color palette is more dynamic overall (which, in some scenes speaks to the perceptions of the Fremen — they see the beauty in the desert…and they’re high all the time), and almost every frame could be highlighted for its brilliant composition. One sequence, which takes place entirely on the Harkonnen home planet of Giedi Prime, is shot in crisp black and white (with subtle colorations throughout) that evokes Fritz Lang as much as it does Ingmar Bergman. Kudos to Villeneuve and team for taking this opportunity to flex beyond the requirements of “visually palatable blockbuster” and into the realm of “who says blockbusters can’t be high art?”  In a lot of ways, despite its modern sheen, Dune: Part Two feels like a classic Old Hollywood production. It’s here to wow us with craft, overload us with beautiful celebrity faces, AND tell a grand story to boot.  Success on all fronts.  As for the celebs, their performances are all terrifically unique, with each actor embodying their characters in such a way that we forget we’re watching some of the most famous and recognizable faces working today. It’s easy to forget we’re watching Javier Bardem, even when he infuses his portrayal of Fremen leader Stilgar with his recognizable cadence (played here for moments of grand humor). Austin Butler, with a face that only money can by, leans into his plasticine image, giving us the downright scariest take on Feyd-Rautha to exist. When we’re watching Christopher Walken chew scenery next to Florence Pugh, we don’t think of either presence being Hollywood royalty, but rather Harkonnen royalty. When Timothée Chalamebyyourname and Zendaya share the screen, it’s the stuff of marquee romance legend, but we can only think of them as Paul and Chani.  By the time we reach the film’s explosive and utterly gigantic final act, the intrigue, conspiracy, and hordes of clashing perspectives combine to fuel some of the most exciting and visually stunning sci-fi action ever put on film. It’s a breathless, percussive finale that utilizes everything which came before to deliver not just on popcorn thrills, but on the murky and complicated thematics of the source novel. If David Lynch’s take on the material has too clean a denouement relative to Herbert’s book, be assured that the power dynamics that the author commented on throughout the Dune series are kept very much intact here. It’s an ending to be sure, but there is plenty more to do in this world if the box office gods are good.  And since I’ve heard some CRAZY things about the later novels, you should go see this so we can let the powers that be know that there’s a market for epic, heady sci-fi.  Plus I really don’t want to read allllll of the books. It’s much too big a commitment, so I need them to keep making these movies. Do it for me!"
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," There’s no lack of ambition where Denis Villeneuve’s epic adaptation of “Dune” is concerned.  Instead of shrinking from the task of bringing a complete-as-possible version of Frank Herbert’s complex sci-fi epic to the screen, he rises to the task again and again, not only in his visual approach but in the way he tackles the dense, multi-layered narrative.  More “Lawrence of Arabia,” than “Star Wars,” “Part Two’s” examination of its worlds’ politics, economies, and religions are real-world reflections of a myriad of issues we continue to, and will always, struggle with.  Though it sags after the 90-minute mark, it’s unavoidable as further exposition is needed to set up the rousing third act finale.  Villeneuve’s production is a grand and convincing argument that films – at least of this sort- are required viewing in a theater setting, though even the vast IMAX screens upon which it will be shown will strain to contain this epic vision. You would be well-advised to watch the previous installment as this volume wastes little time picking up the narrative. Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have been taken in by the Fremen, the native people of the planet Arrakis, after escaping an assassination attempt by the Harkonnen. Their presence is welcomed by some, who have come to see Paul as the messiah they’ve been waiting for, while others see them as outsiders, intent on revealing their secrets. Meanwhile – and there are quite a few meanwhiles – Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), displeased with the way his secret plot to take out the Atreides family has progressed and the fact that his lackey Rabban (Dave Bautista) has failed to raise the harvesting of Arrakis’ precious resource Spice, has put his nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) in charge. This psychopath is intent on not simply pleasing his uncle but killing Paul as an act to put a definitive stamp on his family’s violent, fear-inducing reputation. However, before this confrontation can take place, determining whether Paul is in fact the chosen one takes up the bulk of the narrative. Taking out massive spice harvesters with a guerilla band of Fremen, he quickly builds a reputation as a fierce, intelligent warrior, his love, Chani (Zendaya) constantly by his side. Stigler (Javier Bardem), the leader of a religious sect within the culture is convinced he is their messiah. Others are more skeptical. One of the prevalent themes in the film is cultural appropriation, what with Paul marshalling the forces of a culture alien to his in order to exact revenge for his father’s death.  Perhaps even more egregious are Jessica’s actions, as the member of the Bene Gesserit assumes the role of the Fremen’s Reverand Mother, given and responsible for protecting the memories of their people. That they would cede such power to these two outsiders is a gamble that will ultimately have dire repercussions. The conflict that arises among the Fremen births a moral civil war as religious sects form, fundamentalists and zealots each interpreting Paul’s actions differently in order to support their respective doctrines. The dangers of religion when used to further political gains is one of Herbert’s main themes and serves as the primary catalyst where characters’ motivations and actions are concerned.  This, as well as the film’s examination of the corrupt nature of governments, the vagaries of imperialism, the abuse of the environment for financial gain and the corrupting nature of power make for a dense and rewarding narrative, elevating this saga above “space opera” status. Those who complained about part one’s languid world building will be pleased by the pace Villeneuve adopts here. The first 90 minutes playout with a sense of urgency, the viewer can’t help but be swept away by. The series of attacks the Freman conduct are genuinely exciting while the politics machinations undertaken by Reverand Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) point to the complexity of Herbert’s plotting, all of which ultimately insnares the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who will play a key role in the final segment of Villeneuve’s planned trilogy. It comes as no surprise that the veteran cast brings the proper conviction to their roles and are uniformly good. Of course, Chalamet is the key and while he isn’t cut from the traditional action hero cloth, the director’s casting of him is starting to make sense.  His somewhat slight physical appearance effectively underscores his character’s inability to control the circumstances he has set in motion. Though Paul does all he can to not fulfill the visions, which foretell that his rise to power will cause the death of millions, these events are beyond him. His lack of control over his fate is inescapable; that he is allowing the power he is attaining to corrupt him is the tragedy of the story and a scene in which the character glories in the control he has over his adopted tribe gives Chalamet the opportunity to show he’s capable of much more than brooding. Here’s hoping the third segment of the story will be produced in order to give the actor the opportunity to stretch himself further as Paul is elevated politically and is corrupted morally. Location shooting in Abu Dhabi and Jordan ground the movie, giving the entire production a sense of place and wonder that no amount of digital wizardry could hope to duplicate. As such, it’s reminiscent of the sort of grand filmmaking that has regrettably gone out of style, comparisons to its most obvious antecedent, “Lawrence of Arabia,” appropriate due to its visual grandeur, as well as its conflicted hero and complex narrative. Coupled with bracing action sequences and striking characters, “Dune: Part Two” is an impressive achievement, a film that reminds us of the power of the cinema and the necessity of being overwhelmed by productions of its sort in a theater setting."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," Durante su visita a México como parte de la gira de promoción de Duna: Parte dos, el director, Denis Villeneuve, no dudó al decir que “nació para hacer esta película”. Desde luego, la afirmación, en cualquier otro contexto, pudo haber sido usada como una simple herramienta para enganchar al público al proyecto; una frase prefabricada. No obstante, viniendo del realizador quebequense, la honestidad era incuestionable. La segunda entrega de esta magna saga de ciencia ficción es un evento cinematográfico en toda la extensión del término. Cada pieza que lo conforma es un testamento del crecimiento del cineasta. Estamos ante un blockbuster, sí. Pero es uno que no sigue lo que se ha establecido en los últimos años cuando se habla de la realización de superproducciones. Por mucho tiempo, se prometió que este regreso al universo creado por Frank Herbert, autor de la celebrada novela que es la base de esta adaptación, sería mucho más potente que la primera parte, en cuestión de espectáculo visual y narrativo. Vaya que lo es. Pero esa potencia no se incluyó sólo para asombrar a quienes están del otro lado de la pantalla. Tiene una justificación: la grandilocuencia del conjunto está al servicio de la historia y su desarrollo. Esta cinta tiene de todo. Se incluyen elementos de sci-fi dura, historia de amor, despliegue de acción, advertencia sobre los peligros del fanatismo religioso y, también, una protesta contra las constantes guerras que diariamente suceden en nuestro entorno por asuntos políticos. Sin embargo, entre tantas aristas, hay una que destaca y que tiene que ver con un tema esencial en el libro de Herbert. Se trata del poder y las formas en las que se puede, o no, utilizar para nuestro beneficio y el de los demás. Queda claro por qué el realizador se autoimpuso el reto de trasladar esta epopeya de las páginas a la pantalla grande. Su cine, por lo general, se ha guiado por la máxima de enaltecer aquello que nos vuelve humanos, aun en medio de situaciones caóticas. Y ésta no es la excepción. Después de todo, el viaje de Paul “Muad’Dib” Atreides es uno de descubrimientos. Como nuevo duque de Arrakis –tras la muerte de su padre, Leto, y la toma hostil de su territorio por parte de las tropas del Emperador (Christopher Walken) y la antagónica familia Harkonnen, sus rivales–, y adaptándose de manera renuente a su rol como mesías de toda una población, el joven hace un viaje que inicia como una venganza, pero se convierte en aceptación de su destino. Los Harkonnen, buscando hacerse de nuevo con el control de la especia, lo despojaron de todo. Ahora, el protagonista se propone recuperar lo que le pertenece. En el camino, liderará un movimiento de liberación para numerosas personas que por mucho tiempo fueron oprimidas. El largometraje funciona debido a la forma en la que se utiliza el lenguaje cinematográfico para adaptar una propiedad que parecía intocable e inadaptable. Filmada en formato IMAX con una elegancia que impone, la película Duna: Parte dos es un claro ejemplo de que, si los recursos ya están disponibles para ofrecer un visionado de alta calidad, no se deben desperdiciar. Se les tiene que sacar el mayor provecho.  Desde que las luces se apagan, la sala retumba, y el estruendo advierte que el tono de sci-fi que estamos a punto de presenciar es mucho más maduro que de costumbre. Villeneuve se aleja lo más que puede de aquello que vincule su trabajo con las características más especulativas del género. Es como si nos pidiera que nos asombremos y nos permitamos adentrarnos en su vasto universo suspendiendo la incredulidad, pero al mismo tiempo nos invite a aterrizar en la realidad. Para ejemplo de esto, dos escenas. La primera, que no es spoiler porque se incluye un fragmento en los avances, es aquella en la que Paul finalmente monta un enorme gusano de arena, también llamado Shai-Hulud. Lo que vemos es de no creerse: la criatura se cierne sobre nosotros salpicando arena, y el protagonista nos contagia su éxtasis. La emoción nos invade. No obstante, hay algo en la fotografía de Greig Fraser –duplicando la fastuosidad de las tomas deslumbrantes de la primera entrega–, y en las melodías electrónicas y melancólicas de Hans Zimmer que nos llena de paz y nos recuerda que somos muy pequeños en comparación a lo que llega a nuestros ojos. La segunda, que también ya se dio a conocer, involucra una estridente batalla en un coliseo de Giedi Prime, el planeta natal de los Harkonnen. Presentada en blanco y negro –el propio director ha dicho que este efecto se hizo directo en cámara con lentes infrarojos y no en postproducción–, todo lo que vemos en los encuadres provoca euforia. Desde el vitoreo incesante de una multitud enardecida, hasta los ataques con cuchillos de la pelea. Y nosotros mantenemos la calma. A pesar de que queremos gritar, las imágenes nos mantienen serenos. Los responsables de la producción nos llevan de la mano, presentándonos villanos y aliados que componen el ensamble y que también atravesarán muchos cambios. Está la decidida Chani, interpretada con intensidad por Zendaya, el brutal e intuitivo Feyd-Rautha, encarnado por Austin Butler, el carismático y divertido Stilgar, de Javier Bardem, la ceremoniosa princesa Irulan, de Florence Pugh, y la etérea y sabia Lady Jessica, traída a la vida por Rebecca Ferguson. El arco de cada personaje es importante para comprender mejor el embrollo que se desenvuelve frente a nosotros. No hay algo que no capte nuestra atención. Aunque la película Duna: Parte dos esquiva con eficacia las trampas de muchas propuestas comerciales, tampoco es como que Villeneuve no haya honrado la teatralidad y misticismo de todo el universo de Herbert. Vamos, hay un dejo de psicodelia sesentera con algo de surrealismo. También se percibe un intento por enmarcar el conjunto en una estructura operática. Las batallas y las explosiones se plasman con una escala que ya no se veía desde producciones épicas de antaño. Claro está, con una sensibilidad moderna. Así, es fácil comprender por qué el realizador afirmó que estaba destinado a levantar esta cinta. Todo está diseñado y calibrado para ofrecer una experiencia que da origen a lo que sin problema podría llamarse “belleza visceral”. Nuestros sentidos son atacados, pero estamos en trance y queremos más. Curioso que uno de los grandes estudios se atreviera a darle luz verde a algo que reconfigura el género en tantos aspectos. Una exploración honesta y abierta de las áreas grises del poder que, por si fuera poco, demuestra que los relatos en extremo ambiciosos siguen conectando con el espectador. Balance perfecto que quedará para la historia. Un sueño que para un cineasta comenzó hace años, pronto se convertirá en referente obligado para una nueva generación.

"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," There are countless moments in Denis Villeneuve’s sequel to “Dune” that will take your breath away, from the wide desert shots of the planet Arrakis, to the filled stadium of people in a landscape utterly devoid of color. In terms of technical artistry and ambition, it’ll be hard for anything to top “Dune: Part Two” this year.  But, more importantly, the sequel to the 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic will grab those who didn’t engage with the first installment. With a fast-paced, engrossing script, credited to Villeneuve and his cowriter Jon Spaihts, “Dune: Part Two” will have you eager to see where this franchise goes. Taking place in the aftermath of the assassination of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) in the first film, his son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is now ingrained with the desert people known as the Fremen alongside his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Jessica continues to hope that the planet will believe Paul is their savior, as laid out by her religious order the Bene Gesserit. Paul fears that being a messiah will only lead to war and starvation, but his path for revenge against those who killed his father compels him to use it for his own means. What’s most remarkable about “Dune: Part Two” is how, at 2 hours and 46 minutes, it has such a sense of momentum. Where the first film had to tackle so much exposition and establish multiple characters and the world it’s set in, the second film already knows its audience is aware of this history and just jumps right into the thick of things.  Villeneuve and Spaihts’ script is packed with story and dialogue that, at times, feels akin to “Game of Thrones,” particularly as Paul and Jessica go off on individual journeys to bring down the house of Harkonnen alongside the emperor (Christopher Walken) who requested Leto’s demise. But there’s an equal embrace for the weirdness of Herbert’s world. This is a film wherein people drink worm juice called “the water of life” and a fetus and its mother engage in open conversation. These moments may be strange on the surface, but they elevate the story beyond a turgid tale of war.  That elevation continues in the technical design of the film, which feels far more ambitious than the previous installment as there are more locations to visit. Starting in the Arrakis capital of Arrakeen, we see the desert homes of the Fremen, transition to the southern reaches of the planet and make stops in the Harkonnen capital. Each location has a distinct patina to it, all expertly captured by Greig Fraser’s camerawork.  The sense of scale is one thing — coupled with some epic sound design that will leave your entire theater rumbling — but it’s another to see how individual scenes are populated. The aforementioned fight scene on the planet of the Harkonnen’s is haunting in its use of black and white to showcase a landscape of uniformity. But it’s another seeing thousands of people all moving in unison in a group shot that may leave you wondering if it was accomplished with CGI actors or extras.  Chalamet remains front and center as Paul, this time not as young and in need of training. The actor crafts a character that’s more pensive, genuinely torn by his own desire for vengeance and the fear that his own identity is bound up in something that could lead to the devastation of millions. Much time is spent on him grappling with his decision to be a messiah, which ultimately makes his acceptance of it towards the end feel like an abrupt about-face.  Ferguson’s Lady Jessica is another high point, though that’s still because the Bene Gesserit plotline yields so much fascination, even though there seems to be so much more lurking underneath what little is revealed. Ferguson gets to have some fun with the character, becoming a religious icon as the Reverend Mother for the Fremen, as well as having regular conversations with her daughter in utero. At times it feels like Ferguson’s character is living in “The Exorcist” or “Rosemary’s Baby,” but it brings some levity to the overall film. The real standout is Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, the sociopathic nephew of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard). The “Elvis” star could have rested purely on the dramatic physical transformation for his character consisting of a bald head and no eyebrows, but Butler brings such a heavy air of menacing charisma to Feyd-Rautha. His ability to smile while saying “you fought well” as he kills someone is frightening and beguiling in equal measure. He’s worth waiting the nearly two hours it takes for his introduction, and his fight sequence opposite Chalamet is a beautifully executed piece of fight choreography. Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, has the potential for something, but as it stands in this film, she comes off as little more than exquisitely gowned set dressing (hat tip to costume designer Jacqueline West). Though Irulan is our narrator from the beginning of this tale, documenting what’s happening in a diary, she disappears for a large chunk of the first hour, only to return to move the Bene Gesserit plot along. It isn’t until the finale, when she makes a decision that threatens to tear Paul and Chani apart, that she feels integral to the narrative. In a way, she’s set up much like Zendaya was in the first film: a necessary character who’s plotline opens up later down the road.  For those already invested in the “Dune” franchise, “Dune: Part Two” is a sweeping and engaging continuation that will make you eager for a third installment. And if you were a fence-sitter on the first, this should also hold your attention with a taut, well-done script and engaging characters with whom you’ll want to spend nearly three hours."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," “Villeneuve creates a mesmerizing masterpiece, overflowing with serious eye candy. The film looks genuinely spectacular on a big screen, accompanied by a swirling and thunderous soundtrack that often rumbled the seats where I saw it at an ATMOS theater.” The key characters remain Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). They anchor the story, which follows them on two parallel threads.  Paul seeks to become fully enmeshed with the Fremen, the desert planet’s native people, who are led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Paul is befriended by Chani (Zendaya), a fierce Fremen warrior, and she helps him with his training to become a mighty warrior, and perhaps something more. For her part, Lady Jessica follows a path to become Reverend Mother, a powerful spiritual force on the planet.  Meanwhile, the rival House Harkonnen, led by the grunting Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) and the ever-obedient Rabban (Dave Bautista), wages war upon the Fremen. Rabban’s brother (?), Feyd (Austin Butler), stands ready to wage an even more destructive battle against the Fremen.  All the while, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) await, with another Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling) offering further, diabolical counsel. Somehow, Lady Margot (Lea Seydoux) figures into things as well, leading unsuspecting men astray yet further.  “Only the basic outline matters: rival royal houses, loyal families, mysterious powers, treachery, fierce battles, and giant sandworms, capable of swallowing people, places, and things of all shapes and sizes.” Director Denis Denis Velleneuve, who is credited for the script alongside Jon Spaihts, masterminds an adventure that is, once again, mesmerizing and sumptuous to behold on the big screen, a cinematic experience that respects Frank Herbert’s novel, while also becoming its own completely unique and distinctive creation. It’s fascinating to watch unfurl, as it shakes the house in a manner that is rousing and truly magnificent, even if it is often incomprehensible. Truly, it’s the best reason to get up off the couch at home and go see it for yourself, at the best movie theater you can afford. I don’t know what else to say.  The film opens Friday, March 1, only in movie theaters, throughout Dallas and Fort Worth.  For more information about the film, visit the official site.  Copyright 2010-2024 Peter A.

"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," Is that the theme of Denis Villeneuve’s second installment of the Frank Herbert sci-fi epic? A colonizer twists religion to convince a huge population to act in their own worst interests? Sounds more like modern times, but maybe the blandly named Paul (Timothée Chalamet) really is The One. Dune: Part Two is as breathtaking a vision as Villeneuve’s 2021 Part One. And it’s a better film, benefitting immeasurably from the freedom of exposition that weighed down Part One. The sequel rides intensity and action from its opening segment. Having taken refuge with his mother (Rebecca Ferguson, still the most interesting performance in the film) among the Fremen, Paul tries to understand his visions while fighting alongside Chani (Zendaya), the woman he loves, to take back the spice-rich planet Arrakis from the evil and extremely pale Harkonnen. Villeneuve’s world-building is again a wonder to behold. He immerses us in this world of sand and savagery, providing fully realized reminders of how much Herbert’s original vision has influenced iconic sci-fi tentpoles such as Mad Max and Star Wars. And, in turn, this Dune isn’t shy about its own inspirations. From the conversion of Paul to the schemes behind the throne, from the cries of “false prophet!” to the bloodline surprises, Villeneuve and returning co-writer Jon Spaihts bob and weave the narrative through a fertile playground of Biblical and Shakespearean roots. The ensemble is again large and mighty, sporting a litany of heavyweights (Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Charlotte Rampling, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgård, Austin Butler, Dave Bautista) who are all able to leave unique impressions amid the battle of screen time. And that tells you how many characters are populating this adventure, because there is no shortage of screen time. But while Part Two‘s 2 hours and 45-minutes eclipse the first film, you’ll also find more meat on the bone. Yes, the second act does bog down a bit, but the finale sticks a damn fine landing. Overall, there’s just more earned tension, more thrills (get ready for the worms!) and more character arc to keep you invested in this fight.  Part Two also feels like the complete film that its predecessor did not, and it begins to pick the scab off that “white savior” issue, although we’ll need to get to Part Three to really do it justice. Even if there is not a third installment (and let’s be honest, there’s going to be), Dune: Part Two delivers a satisfying and complete adventure all its own."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s Dune was my favorite film of 2021. It was a euphoric experience. Not because I have any special fondness for the source material (which I read in high school like most nerds) but because the director’s vision for the property produced one of the most immersive exercises in science-fiction world-building I’ve ever seen on screen. The first film had all the architecture, ship designs, costumes and Hans Zimmer’s score all working in tandem with a perfect all-star cast and a script that really felt like it understood the more dangerous aspects of Frank Herbert’s story about messianic folly. Most importantly, it was patient and committed to giving everything its due. I have friends who felt like it was cold and unfeeling; I never felt that way about the first movie. I don’t necessarily feel that way about Dune: Part Two, but I also don’t think Villeneuve achieves the level of epic emotion he’s striving for in the second half of his grand adaptation, and the whole picture suffers as a result. Dune ended with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), meeting up with the Fremen tribes of Arrakis and joining their tribe. The dreaded House Harkonnen, led by their Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his vile nephew, Rabban (Dave Bautista), had deposed House Atreides from its leadership of the desert planet, and Paul is determined to get revenge. Thanks to the multigenerational machinations of the Bene Gesserit (space witches, basically), the Fremen are primed to accept an off-world savior and Paul seems to fit the bill. The question is whether he’s willing to accept the role, given what his prescient visions foretell — namely that his leadership would result in a galactic holocaust at the swords of his followers. Whereas Part One took its time to set the stage and develop the political situation surrounding the Atreides and Harkonnen rivalry on Arrakis, Part Two jumps straight into the back half of the book — starting with Paul learning the ways of the Fremen and falling in love with Chani (Zendaya), his teacher and peer. She’s one of the few who refuse to believe in Paul’s religious significance, but she teaches him nonetheless and they fight against the Harkonnens as an effective unit. We’re also introduced to a whole host of significant new characters who factor heavily into the endgame of the story, as well as subsequent chapters of Herbert’s saga. These include the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). Alia, Paul’s sister, isn’t actually born in this telling but remains an important presence via in-utero communication with their mother (which is a reasonable change). Finally, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), the vile youngest nephew of Baron Harkonnen, is introduced as Paul’s rival in the Bene Gesserit’s power plays. All of these roles are as excellently cast as you could possibly ask. All are somewhat lost within the breakneck nature of this film’s plotting. Given my favor for the first film, it truly felt like a letdown to realize midway through Part Two that it just wasn’t doing it for me. For better or worse, the first film felt like Villeneuve’s expression of how reading the book made him feel and what he saw in his mind’s eye while growing up with it. Part Two feels very much like the product of a filmmaker determined to finish the story he started without the creative space to dig into how it made him feel. The plot adheres largely to the novel, and all the necessary beats are hit, but they feel as cold and passionless to me as the first film felt to its detractors. Paul is told he must do something, then goes and achieves it with little conflict or tension. It’s just excessively direct. The supporting characters are likewise straightforward. For instance, the Fremen character of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes in Paul … and that’s Stilgar’s personality for the entire film. A supposedly dead character from the first film is reintroduced as an unexpected ally, and there’s basically no drama to his reappearance. When Paul finally makes his fateful choice before the final act, it all feels pretty rushed. Perhaps more frustrating of all: The climactic siege on the city of Arrakeen is brief and without any real back-and-forth action at all. Our characters set forth a plan and execute it with no push and pull, no sense of danger. Compared to the first film, the visuals even feel small. The plot is executed faithfully but the story never feels sensational. Part Two also feels like a step down from the first on an aesthetic level, perhaps because it moves so quickly. We’re unable to grow attached to the spaces our characters inhabit. Save for some interesting choices on the Harkonnens’ home world, the movie lacks the “I can’t believe I’m seeing this” feeling that the first provided in spades. Additionally, Zimmer feels completely lost on how to score the picture. Whereas the first soundtrack was filled with incredible compositions, there’s only one memorable cue here. Even the reprised motifs feel like they’re unable to keep pace with the go-go-go nature of the scenes here. Most unfortunate of all is the central romance between Paul and Chani. I just didn’t buy it. There’s something missing here, and I think it’s just a sense of time. Like I said before, I’m no adherent to the source material, but the book gave the characters years to connect whereas the movie gives them mere months. Part Two moves at such a fast clip that I never felt connected to or convinced by the power of their romance. It’s supposed to be the emotional scaffolding of the entire film, and everything else falls flat without it. It’s not that Part Two is necessarily bad. It’s just a huge step down from the first movie, and as a fan of that one, I was disappointed. Villeneuve has been outspoken in his desire to take a break before the inevitable Dune Messiah, which would conclude his take on the series. One wonders if his lambasting of pre-set release dates and rushed productions is reflecting some unspoken feelings about his experience making this chapter. Given the diminishment of technical craft between films, it certainly feels that way."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," Adapting Frank Herbert’s seminal classic sci-fi novel Dune into a feature film was a lifelong dream of director Denis Villeneuve. After years in development hell and pesky pandemic delays, the filmmaker finally received his wish in 2021. The result was a film that broke the covid box office curse and netted $450 million worldwide and Oscars for pretty much every technical artisan involved in the film bar Villeneuve, who staggeringly wasn’t even nominated. Regardless, a sequel was all but assured and Villeneueve was the man to make it happen. As someone who found the first instalment technically brilliant and exhilarating but narratively somewhat cold and stilted, my anticipation was high for a sequel that could hit the ground running after the hefty framework established in the original. That’s precisely what you’ll find with Dune: Part Two; a grand cinematic spectacle that takes its place as one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. An almost overwhelming visceral experience meticulously crafted by a man whose love for the source material drips from every frame, it’s both an epic blockbuster and a shrewd character study that stands as the first great film of 2024. A word to the wise – if you haven’t returned to Dune since 2021, it might be sensible to rewatch the film or one of those YouTube recap videos. Villeneuve expects his audience to be well-versed in the first film’s lore, negating the need for summaries or re-introductions. The follow-up picks up shortly after the events of part one with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) relatively accepted as one of the Fremen, aka the natives of desert-covered Arrakis. After escaping the massacre of his House by the brutal Harkonnens, Paul seeks vengeance despite the protestations of his pregnant mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who cautions her son that revenge was something his late father never believed in. While Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) and some of her cohorts have their doubts, many among the Fremen believe Paul to be a prophetic messiah figure known as the Lisan al-Gaib, particularly their leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who has unwavering faith Paul is the one destined to bring prosperity back to Arrakis. Despite his mother’s insistence that Stilgar is correct, Paul refuses to accept the title, particularly given he’s plagued by spice-induced visions that show a potential future where his messianic destiny leads to unspeakable death and destruction. Meanwhile, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is growing frustrated with the failed attempts of his nephew Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) to exterminate the Fremen and installs his younger sociopathic nephew Feyd-Rautha (a sublime Austin Butler) as the new man in charge. As Paul fights against his fate and Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his niece Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) nefariously pull the strings from the background, a war between the Harkonnen army and the Fremen beckons and the very fate of Arrakis itself. With the benefit of a 2.5-hour preceding chapter in the rearview mirror, Dune: Part Two moves at a cracking pace not seen in its predecessor. From the opening scene, we’re taken back onto Arrakis and thrust straight back into Hebert’s expansive world where Villeneuve barely stops to take a breath over another running time that stretches beyond 160 minutes. As the above plot summary suggests, there are a lot of moving parts here (I didn’t even delve into the separate narrative strands of Lady Jessica, Chani, Irulan, and the Bene Gesserits), but Villeneuve is a master of control who keeps everything humming rather perfectly. Co-written with Jon Spaihts, Villeneueve’s screenplay successfully taps into the intergenerational feud and political machinations at the very core of this saga. As writers, they both understand an epic sci-fi or fantasy blockbuster is nothing without a gripping narrative bubbling beneath the surface. Think of franchises like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. They were more than just the sum of the parts of their bombastic action set pieces. They were all still intimately concerned with the characters at the centre of the chaos around them. For all its visual splendours (we’ll get there), Dune: Part Two succeeds because, at its heart, it’s a gripping political, social, and familial thriller. It’s now obvious that’s why Villeneuve spent so much time on character development and building narrative foundations in the first film. It truly makes everything much richer in a sequel. He’s just as invested in digging deeper into his characters in this sequel, particularly how Paul’s lust for vengeance and the morality battle between his head and his heart make his judgements unpredictable and even unsettling at times. With both Stilgar and Lady Jessica influencing his mind with messianic prophesies, it’s a fairly biting meditation on the intoxicating power of religious influence and the dangers such dogma can bring. Villeneuve is tackling some pretty heady themes here, but he has the confidence and intelligence to make it work. He’s not the first filmmaker to focus a film on a reluctant leader barrelling towards the precipice of either grand greatness or disastrous failure. But Paul feels like something completely new due to his genuine turmoil from the weight of making important decisions and accepting a fate that visions tell him is destined for failure. Villeneuve has long rejected the idea Dune is an example of the tired “white saviour” trope. And, without venturing into spoiler territory, he’s certainly proved that here. This is as close to a damning criticism of the very idea of a saviour you’ll ever see. At the centre of everything is Chalamet with yet another performance that proves why he might just be the next genuine bona fide movie star. Chalamet deftly crafts Paul as such a contradiction in terms. He’s both strong and vulnerable, intelligent and ignorant, inspiring and frustrating. In other words, he’s an imperfect hero and someone whose narrative arc is genuinely fascinating to watch. There’s a darkness to Chalamet’s performance that wasn’t present in the first film, offering the talented young actor the chance to dance with light and shade to create something so wildly different to his work in part one. He carries this film on his shoulders and never once falters. That’s a true star, folks. After a relatively brief appearance in the predecessor, Zendaya is undoubtedly Chalamet’s co-lead here and she runs with the chance to present Chani as one of the few voices of reason in this narrative. Chani desperately wants to believe in the good she sees in Paul but is fearful of what a messiah means for her people and how her burgeoning romance with their supposed saviour is clouding her judgement. In Zendaya’s capable hands, Chani is no doe-eyed damsel in distress. She’s the true heart of this film and her arc is every bit as captivating as Paul’s. While newcomer-to-the-series Pugh is rather underused (her time to shine will clearly come in the third chapter), Butler all but steals this film with one of the most menacing, intimidating, and vicious villains we’ve seen on screen for some time. Sure, he’s physically imposing with muscles galore and unsettlingly designed with a bald head, no eyebrows, and jet-black teeth. But it’s the dark soul and total lack of humanity at the core of Butler’s performance that makes Feyd-Rautha so powerfully terrifying in literally every scene he’s a part of. Butler understands the assignment and eats this film alive. Alright, and now to the technical aspects of this absolute colossus of a production. This is as grandiose and ambitious as blockbuster filmmaking gets. The scale is unimaginable. If you thought the first film was big, everything is bigger here. It’s a visual masterclass and one of the most technically impressive films you will ever see. It’s a dreadful cliche but it has to be said; this film was designed to be seen on the largest screen you can find. From the intense battle sequences to the anxiety-inducing “worm-riding” scenes and one absolutely stunning monochromatic segment (with Rorschach ink-esque fireworks, no less) on the Harkonnen’s home planet of Giedi Prime, every moment bursts from the screen to assault your eyes and ears in the greatest way possible. Amidst some of the best CGI wizardry ever created, you get typically impeccable sweeping cinematography from Greig Fraser, another booming score from Hans Zimmer that stands on its own two feet and doesn’t just lazily rehash the original film’s iconic soundtrack, sharp editing from Joe Walker, bone-rattling sound design, and stunning costume and set creations from Jacqueline West and Patrice Vermette, respectively. Calling this film a feast is an understatement. It’s staggeringly crafted and it shouldn’t surprise anyone if it runs away with the same six (or more) Oscars it took home in 2021. Villeneuve has delivered a cinematic achievement that’s unlikely to be rivalled in 2024. His ambition was mighty, but, dammit, he’s pulled it off. Dune: Part Two is a spectacular blockbuster but it’s just as impressive in its introspection of fate, religion, and politics. It completely turns the atypical hero’s journey on its head and subverts expectations in ways you will not see coming. With a third chapter a total certainty, this feels like the 21st-century equivalent of The Empire Strikes Back. Yes, it’s that good. Thrilling, emotional, impressive, and undeniably entertaining, it’s everything we go to the cinema for and then some. Distributor: Warner Bros.

"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Technically it&#8217;s phenomenal&#46; But also what it&#8217;s delivering is truly epic and made me appreciate and become more immersed in this world than the first film&#46; 
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE," A masterful melding of massive spectacle, heartfelt high-stakes performances, and astonishing visual artistry, “Dune: Part Two” expands the mythic hero’s journey to its full potential. After the global embrace of “Dune” in 2021 as a stunning adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 book, considered the best-selling science fiction novel of all-time, the sequel has been highly anticipated to complete the first book on screen. Part Two chronicles the novel’s second half, which follows a feudal interstellar society in a galaxy far, far away. At this time, while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) unites with Chani (Zendaya) and other Fremen. Forced to make either a personal choice or save the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. While it’s more riveting because of the whole picture, there could always be further character development due to its gigantic scope – nevertheless, the entire arc’s lucidity is much improved here. In the first’s attempt at world-building, the narrative was largely unwieldy. However, no one could deny its mesmerizing grand-scale wizardry. (A second viewing really helped sort out the planets and houses). Now that we are familiar with the desert wasteland Arrakis, the risks between the warring dynasties are made clearer. That is, for those of us who didn’t read Herbert’s first novel (or the other five in the “Dune” series). ‘Spice,’ the most precious resource in this universe’s existence, spurs the malevolent forces who want to control its extraction in Arrakis, because it is necessary for space navigation and its multidimensional awareness and foresight properties. By picking up where the first left off, this second part effectively ties up loose ends, and deepens what is at stake. The focus narrows on young Paul Atreides, who must grow from an unseasoned boy, without his royal father to guide him, into the man he needs to become. Sacrifices must be made, and he continues to manifest his future in visions/dreams. The religious and political implications of whether he is fulfilling a prophecy is what makes for propulsive viewing. The screenplay, co-written by director Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, contains requisite bombastic and brutal confrontations, but also includes sincere intimate moments that give the film its beating heart. To that end, all the actors in this finely-tuned sprawling ensemble bring their A game, but Chalamet discernibly takes the reins – and without question, has come into his own as Paul. It’s an emotionally charged turn, as he conveys a range of feelings, tormented by the burden of expectations and the challenge of learning ways to survive, especially conquering fear. As he notably rises above the pressures, his brooding Paul summons a strength that is exhilarating to watch. Chalamet is fully invested as the gifted heir of the noble house of Atreides, who saw nearly everyone he cared about massacred. As the Harkonnen sharpen their attacks, Paul, who escaped Caladan with his mother to find refuge in Arrakis, is aided by the Fremen so that his people, and his family, have a future. Whereas in the first, he was a blank slate “to the manor born,” and being groomed to take over. He accepted his duties, although reluctantly. But now, it’s urgent that he ascend into this pre-ordained role, and the question looms about his readiness. So far, he’s demonstrated heroic bravery and fierce loyalty, and must believably transform to meet the moment. His mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), becomes a Reverend Mother, and has a more fully developed role, steering her son towards his destiny and acting mysteriously as she prepares for the birth of her second child, a daughter. Ferguson is shrewdly alert and misses nothing as Leto’s widow. Zendaya is more prominent as well, as Chani, a devoted and fearless Fremen warrior. Paul, a nobleman, is everything she has previously despised, but admiring his derring-do, they fall in love. That, of course, is complicated, and the two become a dynamic duo. Now bona fide movie stars, the camera loves both actors. Also given more heft is venerable Javier Bardem as the courageous and wise Stilgar, who becomes a mentor and protector of Paul, fully believing that he is the next Messiah “as written.” In a spellbinding scene pitting man against “a grandfather” sandworm that is one of cinema’s most astounding ever, Paul wins over a majority of Fremen. This is the money shot folks will be talking about for a long while. Bardem is terrific, and so is Josh Brolin, who returns as brawny Gurney Halleck, the war master of the House of Atreides, who is one of Paul’s trusted advisors. Noteworthy, too, is Souheila Yacoub as Shishakli, a powerful Fremen sandrider. On the dark side, a hulking, menacing Dave Bautista rages as Beast Rabban, part of the ruthless Harkonnen House, never to be trusted, and Stellan Skarsgard is a slimy and treacherous baron, a grotesque cross between Jabba the Hut and Palpatine in the “Star Wars” universe. New to the story is a mind-blowing Austin Butler as the diabolical Feyd-Rautha, the baron’s cruel nephew and heir apparent. A cunning psychopath, the na-baron is imposing physically, and Butler’s transformation is startling. He proves that he is no one-trick pony after his breakthrough Oscar-nominated role as Elvis in Baz Luhrmann’s biopic last year. Another new wrinkle is Florence Pugh as savvy Princess Irulen, daughter of the scheming emperor, smartly played by Christopher Walken. Pugh is properly regal, and while she only has one scene with her “Little Women” suitor Chalamet, it’s a showcase for all – the battle royale. The cast serves the complexities of the characters well, we care more about their fates, and while the uninitiated might not understand all the elements at play, this trajectory is much smoother with this second helping. Villeneuve establishes himself as a true visionary here – while I’ve enjoyed many of his films (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Arrival,” “Sicario” among them), and he is a meticulous craftsman, this is the first time I understood his fully realized end game, how the storytelling rose to the level of the visual effects. If “Oppenheimer” is Christopher Nolan’s magnum opus, then “Dune: Part Two” is Villeneuve’s. What is impressive about both directors is their desire to create cinematic experiences, films that demand big-screen viewings because they fill the screen with wonder. It was also smart to delay the sequel’s release date from November because it becomes the first welcome and sorely needed blockbuster of 2024. Mark my words, if “Dune: Part One” won six Oscars two years ago (original score, sound, film editing, cinematography, production design and visual effects), clear the trophy case for this latest during next year’s awards season. The mythology’s epic scale is presented in a next-level, state-of-the-art artisanal way. Oscar winner Greig Fraser’s cinematography again dazzles with his panoramic planetary landcapes, scary sandworm eruptions, and grisly gladiator confrontations. Production designer Patrice Vermette has created eye-popping worlds distinguishing each planet and house. Hans Zimmer’s stirring music effectively underscores the action and enhances the moods. The first film was 2 hours and 35 minutes, and this follow-up adds 11 minutes, but didn’t detract. It certainly sets up an eager anticipation for “Dune: Part 3,” which is supposedly in the works, and will be based on the second novel, “Dune: Messiah.” Villeneuve’s “Dune” series is the most successful to date for the devoted fan base. Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted a film adaptation in the 1970s but was cancelled after three years in development. Then David Lynch made a complex adaptation in 1984, which was not well-received, although fans were receptive to a Sci-Fi Channel miniseries in 2000. “Dune: Part Two” is a 2024 science fiction action-adventure directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgard and Charlotte Rampling.

"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dune: Part Two is lightyears away from its predecessor, becoming a game changer for the science fiction genre. With powerful storytelling and a stronger cast, Dune: Part Two soars where most films dream of. "
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Denis Villeneuve delivers a massive&#44; epic sci-fi spectacle with Dune Part Two&#44; expanding the world and concepts first introduced in the books by Frank Herbert&#46;
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE," Arriving with much anticipation on the heels of Dune: Part One, Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited sequel brims with masterful technical workmanship and dramatic storytelling that keeps you at the edge of your seat with bated breath. Dune: Part Two will likely blow you away.  There is a lot to praise in Dune: Part Two that will most likely be repeated time and time again whenever it’s examined. There’s tension in every scene, pulsating throughout every second. The stakes are high and the scale is grand. The escalation gives way to an adrenaline rush of cinematic proportions. In all likelihood, Dune: Part Two will be revered in film history for years to come – it manages to be unlike anything we’ve seen before, yet comfortably familiar at the same time.  What Villeneuve and the Dune team have crafted pays tribute to the greats of science fiction, whether deliberately or not. Many moments carry echoes of Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017). There are also details in the production design reminiscent of The Hunger Games franchise’s unmistakable Capitol architecture. But then there are new awe-inspiring details – like the black sun that can invert and contrast black and white in the blink of an eye. The film uses light and sound with cunning prowess and exceeds every expectation. It elevates its story past Dune: Part One, outshining the first one effortlessly. (This is thanks in large measure to the film’s cinematographer, Greig Fraser.) Dune: Part Two‘s epic scale adds a touch of grandeur that is quite admirable from an artistic standpoint. Yet there is a vile nature to the praise Paul receives as a character. Beyond this, Chalamet does a superb job as the false prophet. Despite what people might say about the 2019 film The King’s lack of memorability, it’s nonetheless true that Chalamet carries an unforgettable presence as a privileged man with a great weight on his shoulders.  Beside him, Zendaya remains a standout in the franchise. Another incredible performance, and one of the actor’s most transformative to date, is Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha: he is equally terrifying and striking in his sadistic nature. Franchise newcomer Florence Pugh commands a regal air as Princess Irulan, though at times it felt like she was merely an actress playing a role instead of inhabiting a fully developed character. The fault here most likely falls upon the writing, which is perhaps overly ambitious for trying to portray so much within an already-elongated runtime of two hours and forty-six minutes.  Despite the grand affair, Dune: Part Two has one glaringly obvious detriment within our current sociopolitical climate. It’s impossible to ignore the resemblance of the film’s rebellious plot to what we’re witnessing in Palestine. The real-world parallel brings a sense of dread when viewing the film. You can’t help but be fully aware that, while this sort of act is praised on the screen, a ceasefire has yet to spare the Palestinian people further genocide. Dune: Part Two thus presents a complex example of the white savior trope. The film appears to be gratingly aware that the core of it is the danger of a colonizer’s influence over a civilization – but that awareness doesn’t keep it from falling into the same trap.  Ultimately, Dune: Part Two is a feast for the eyes and the ears. It features tremendous sound design by Dave Whitehead, an incredible score by Hans Zimmer, and expert editing by Joe Walker. It will quite literally take your breath away. It glorifies its main character’s journey even as it understands the horrible impact his victory will have. Through Chani’s eyes, we can see Paul’s descent into ruin. The most we can do is hope that the audience will share her vision and reflect upon how it mirrors our world. “White savior trope” – “glorifies its main character’s journey”. We are truly living in a golden age of literary analysis. “And herein lies the biggest fault of the film: Paul Atreides isn’t a savior; he’s a destroyer.” You’ve taken the whole point of the story, and presented it as your own opinion of what they should have done, while misrepresenting what is actually on screen as an example of “Paul is good and justified and should be praised.”"
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Denis Villeneuve successfully delivers on the setup established in Part 1&#44; crafting an epic and gripping sci-fi tale that will captivate audiences&#46;
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE," We return to the year 10,191 for Dune: Part Two, the cleverly named second half of Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal, beloved work of sci-fi literature. When last we saw Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), he’d survived an otherwise completely successful ambush attack on his family’s rule of the valuable desert planet Arrakis — the only place where the most valuable thing in the universe, a psychotropic substance known as the Spice Melange, is found — by sworn enemies the Harkonnens, which wiped out his entire clan and all of its troops. Paul escaped into the sand and took refuge with the planet’s native people, the Fremen, who adapted to Arrakis’ harsh conditions. And if you remember, Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who escaped with him, is part of a vast intergalactic religious sect whose eugenics programs and psychic powers have potentially come together to ensure that Paul is the prophesied Kwisatz Haderach, a super-being who will dominate the universe. Whether or not that’s true (spoiler: of course it is), Jessica is all too happy to encourage this belief among the Fremen, while Paul struggles with this potentially disastrous destiny even while he wields it as a weapon to control and use the Fremen to get revenge on his enemies and take back control of Arrakis. Got all that? Villeneuve’s first installment may indeed have been a marvel of adaptation, making the most of Herbert’s somewhat lugubrious prose and meticulous details by making them key ingredients of the film’s intense, gorgeous brutalist production design, and also by being generously faithful to the source. But it was still just half of a movie, ending rather anticlimactically smack in the middle of the story. All that world-building and setup has paid off handsomely here, though, as Dune: Part Two hits the ground running, managing to give the novel’s allegorical pawn characters more grounded emotional stakes while also ramping up the massive spectacles of combat and design. It seems like every new sequence delivers some eye-popping visual element or arresting image: baddies gracefully floating via jetpacks, giant sandworms, a stark black-and-white world of sadomasochism and torture, massive spaceships, nuclear explosions — it’s all here, filmed entirely in the IMAX format, with none of that switching aspect ratios stuff, necessary as it is to be seen big and loud. On a more intimate scale, Chalamet also is given the opportunity to lend Paul more dimension in this installment. Where there was once an impetuous, often naïve and overwhelmed teenager, now there’s a young man forced into making decisions that will affect not just his closest confidants but possibly every living thing in the universe. What’s more, his premonitions virtually guarantee that, whatever choice he makes, billions and billions of people will die. Herbert’s character has been often misdiagnosed as a White Savior, but the movie couldn’t be more clear about the dangers intrinsic to Paul’s power. His clashes with Ferguson in Part Two are genuinely prickly, laced with a sick tension. Their actual chemistry, unfortunately, has the effect of dulling Paul’s romance with Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya), which is built on scenes with two actors that lend more the impression of best friends in high school. Chani is thankfully given a much more sturdy and developed foundation here than in the novel, as she realizes Paul to be yet another colonizer despite his good intentions; Zendaya plays up her anger and mistrust quite effectively, but stumbles when it comes to selling their love story. Elsewhere, and probably having the most fun, are Dave Bautista as Rabban, a nephew to the big bad Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), and the hilarious Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, another Harkonnen nephew with a Nosferatu-esque appearance and Skarsgard-like voice — this duo constitute easily the most purely delightful slice of the film. Feyd in particular given to fucking, killing, and eating, usually all the same person. Make no mistake: Dune: Part Two is nothing if not appreciably bonkers. Which, working in aggregate with the film’s other strengths, makes for pretty unparalleled stuff so far as giant-budget spectacles go. Not since the Lord of the Rings movies has there been something this committed to its singular vision, this brash, and this handsome. In a time where we’re ceding the ground of what’s being called Cinema For Grownups to either meme-able predigested politics like Barbie or the three-hour tedium that is Oppenheimer, it’s refreshing to see something this dense, this overwhelmingly strange, and this sincerely pulpy and exciting.

"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve pulled off an astonishing coup de cinema with the release of Dune: Part One in the midst of the pandemic in 2021. First published in 1965, Frank Herbert’s dense sci-fi novel had earned the reputation of being unfilmable, previously defeating both cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky (whose projected 1970s adaptation never got off the ground) and David Lynch (whose 1984 version flopped). Yet back in 2021, Villeneuve’s gamble seemed greater still. He was only telling half the story — with no guarantee that he would get to complete it. Only if Part One turned out a success would studio Warner Bros. guarantee to greenlit a sequel. As we now know, Villeneuve’s daring paid off. His film was a well-deserved critical and commercial triumph thanks to its awesome intergalactic world-building, gripping action and stellar performances, not to mention the skilfulness with which it guided us through Herbert's labyrinthine plotting involving the cutthroat rivalry of feuding noble houses in a far-flung future, while making the story’s layers of complex mythology coherent and graspable. The immersive qualities of the film’s throbbing sound design and a booming Hans Zimmer score didn’t go amiss, either. Happily, Dune: Part Two builds on its predecessor's achievements. Returning us to the desert planet of Arrakis, source of the priceless, ruthlessly coveted hallucinogenic substance known as spice, it finds Timothée Chalamet’s aristocratic heir, Paul Atreides, still taking refuge with the indigenous Fremen people, while plotting revenge against the brutal Harkonnen dynasty, who are both the oppressors of the Fremen and the killers of Paul’s father, Duke Leto. Paul's mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the scheming Bene Gesserit sisterhood and another survivor of the Harkonnens’ savage coup, is also embedded with the Fremen, and seeking to stoke among them the belief that her son is the long-prophesied savior who will lead a holy war and liberate the Fremen. Javier Bardem’s Fremen tribal leader Stilgar quickly becomes a fervent believer in Paul’s messianic status, but Paul’s Fremen lover, Chani (Zendaya), remains a skeptic. Will Paul reject the role of savior or use it to seek personal revenge? The film’s early scenes show Paul leading his Fremen allies on thrilling guerrilla raids against the Harkonnens, disrupting their spice harvesting much as T.E. Lawrence (one of Herbert’s inspirations) led Bedouin tribesmen in desert attacks on Turkish supply lines during World War One. The parallel with Lawrence suggests another ""white savior narrative"" might be in store, but Villeneuve’s film — and Chalamet’s conflicted protagonist — are far more ambivalent and morally ambiguous than that.  So too is its representation of religion, with Jessica and the Bene Gesserit cynically using faith as a tool of manipulation while self-persuaded believers whip themselves into a zealous frenzy.  So far, so murky. What does come across clearly is the story’s allegorical depiction of the colonial exploitation of the Middle East for oil and its portrayal of environmental degradation — themes even more resonant today than they were when Herbert wrote his book in the 1960s. Striking too is another, more unexpected resonance — one that has become even more pointed since the release of Dune: Part One in 2021. The first name of the evil, merciless Baron Harkonnen is Vladimir. All this is a great deal for the viewer to take on, but Villeneuve’s construction of Dune’s bizarre universe is done with such conviction that we go along with the story’s portentousness, just as we accept the unlikely aerodynamics of the film’s dragonfly-like helicopters or the spectacle of characters hurtling atop giant sandworms like so many chariot-driving Ben-Hurs. We even buy the sight of Chalamet learning the desert survival skill of the ""sand walk"", which could so easily be as comical and silly as a music-hall sand dance routine.  Dune’s seriousness does have its drawbacks. Part Two hinges on the internal drama of Paul wrestling with his destiny and on the shadowy plotting of the Bene Gesserit — neither of which makes for immediate excitement and also means that the burgeoning romance between Chalamet’s Paul and Zendaya’s Chani never fully comes alive. Chalamet, however, continues to impress.  When we first met his callow hero in Part One, it looked as if a gust of wind would blow him over. As the saga has unfolded, his steely core has become more and more apparent.  And a good job too as the narrative builds towards Paul’s lethal confrontation with Baron Harkonnen’s psychotic nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Played with gleeful intensity by Elvis star Austin Butler, the albino-pale, hairless Feyd-Rautha is by far the most arresting of the new characters the film introduces.  Christopher Walken’s Emperor Shaddam fails to make much of an impression, but Florence Pugh’s brief but vivid turn as Princess Irulan, the emperor’s quietly calculating daughter (she’s another Bene Gesserit), leaves us eager to see more. A film critic for over 25 years, Jason admits the job can occasionally be glamorous – sitting on a film festival jury in Portugal; hanging out with Baz Luhrmann at the Chateau Marmont; chatting with Sigourney Weaver about The Archers – but he mostly spends his time in darkened rooms watching films. He’s also written theatre and opera reviews, two guide books on Rome, and competed in a race for Yachting World, whose great wheeze it was to send a seasick film critic to write about his time on the ocean waves. But Jason is happiest on dry land with a classic screwball comedy or Hitchcock thriller."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE," Returning director Denis Villeneuve’s sequel to his 2021 blockbuster certainly won’t disappoint fans of the acclaimed sci-fi franchise (which was also turned into a movie in the 1980s, and later two TV miniseries). It’s a spectacular, sprawling extravaganza that shows the remarkable effects, star-studded casting and thrilling big-screen world-building wallop a budget north of $120 million can get you. It looks epic and feels epic—mainly because it is epic, a gobsmacking, action-packed, emotionally stirring return to the characters and story based on author Frank Herbert’s 1960s novel about humanity’s future on a distant colonized desert planet called Arrakis, sometimes known as “Dune.” And it sounds epic too, thanks to another masterful soundtrack by Oscar-winning Hans Zimmer, whose grandiose orchestrations perfectly underscore the excitement, danger and drama onscreen. You heard of “dry counties.” Well Dune is even dryer, a dry planet where water is so precious, it’s extracted from dead bodies on the battlefield. The superheated desert air and relentless sun aren’t so great for humans, but they’re fine for the sandworms, monstrously large carnivorous alien creatures that burrow just underneath the surface. The desert dwellers on Arrakis use the gigantic worms as transport, summoning them with sounding devices then jumping aboard, clamping down and holding on, surfing the sandworm highway. And sandworms are fundamental to the reason anyone lives on Arrakis, where the nightmarishly inhospitable conditions favor a secretion of the worms called mélange, or “spice.” It was discovered millennia ago to be a psychoactive narcotic that can make life better for humans in many ways, including precognition, seeing what’s coming before it gets there. And the whole ecosystem of the planet depends on harvesting the sparkly sandworm stuff. The Duneverse, as it’s called, is dense with its own language, nomenclature, characters, history, mythos and symbolism; it might remind you of Lord of the Rings star-crossed with Game of Thrones and The Empire Strikes Back in a massive movie sandbox—and if you just happen to wander into it unaware, you may feel a bit overwhelmed and lost in the desert. It’s about nomads and royals, blood feuds and civil wars, enemies and allies, rebels and renegades, faith and hope, spies and traitors, and a world with a rigid, sometimes cruel caste system of slaves, barons and emperors. It’s about a love story that starts in a sand-swept cauldron of war, generational grudges and power struggles, and a people who’ve been promised “paradise” and look for a messiah to lead them there. Even though the story is set in the distant future, it has overtones and undertones of our past, and even our present—conflict, religion, politics, exploited resources, war machines on the move. One side dehumanizes the other as “rats” to be exterminated, refusing to acknowledge them as human. The desert setting gives a definite vibe of the Middle East, where “spice” could be seen as a metaphor for oil, and people have been in-fighting for, well, centuries. Dune: Part Two draws comparison to some familiar territory—Hitler’s rallies, the atrocities of the Roman arena, holy wars, and even modern geopolitical, genocidal situations. It’s a richly detailed, fine-tooled sci-fi depiction of a culture and a people in a faraway futuristic world that nonetheless looks and feels a lot like our own—what our world has been, and what it could again become. And the cast—wow. You probably won’t see more stars in one place this side of the Milky Way, with many of them reprising previous roles. Timothée Chalamet leads the ensemble as the heralded heir of a disposed royal house, continuing to seek revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. Zendaya is Chani, a young desert warrior who falls in love with the exiled duke. Austin Butler (above) is a million movie miles away from Graceland (and his all-American Elvis swagger) in the role of a psychotic, ghost-faced sexy-beast villain. Stellan Skarsgård is a fat-cat baron who’s often seen soaking in a tub of black ooey-goo goop. (Hey, this is Arrakis, not the Catskills.) And then there’s Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Charlotte Rampling and Léa Seydoux. It looks like everyone wanted to be in this movie. Even Anya Taylor-Joy makes a “surprise appearance.” It’s almost easier to name actors who aren’t in it. So, sci-fans, the wait is over. Come for the stars, stick around for the sandworms. And stay tuned for even more: Dune Part 3 is already in the works."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE," Chani (Zendaya) says this to Paul “Muad’Dib” Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as the climactic battle between the Fremen natives of Arrakis led by the remnants of House Atreides and the loathsome Harkonnens approaches. It echoes a line from Gurney Hallack (Josh Brolin) to Paul in the first movie: “You fight when necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now fight!” The point is simple: Plans are all well and good and peace may be preferable to war, but when a band of savages shows up aiming for your elimination, you have no choice but to meet them on their own terms. To the extent that fate exists, it is the world narrowing our options. To the extent that free will exists, it is the choice we make from those options. This is the central element of Paul’s internal struggle, and one that should be familiar even to those who have trouble getting past the mystic silliness—the space-and-time-bending “spice”; the generations of Bene Gesserit interbreeding that led to the emergence of a chosen one; the “water of life” that allows a fetus to communicate psychically with her mother and with her brother—inherent to Dune. We are, all of us, presented with choices. The path to survival—of a great house, or a great people, or a system of government—is sometimes narrow. Dune: Part Two picks up more or less right where Dune: Part One left off. After a brief reminder in the form of a diary entry by Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) that the Atreides clan was killed in the dark desert planet of Arrakis by the Harkonnens, we return to that desert. Paul, along with a handful of Fremen pallbearers, carries a body back to an underground Fremen village, where he and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), seek protection. The Fremen, on the other hand, seek a messiah. Or at least some of them do. Stilgar (Javier Bardem) has believed from the beginning that Paul is Lisan al-Gaib, The Voice from Another World. Stilgar and the southern fundamentalists believe in a prophecy seeded long ago by the Bene Gesserit, a sect of witches to which Jessica belongs. The Bene Gesserit have for generations served as powers behind thrones, cultivating a genetic line intended to bring about a man with the power to see beyond space and time. Chani is not a believer of such prophecies. She thinks them to be a lever of control, a tool to ensure compliance. If you keep the colonized waiting for a savior from the stars, they will patiently bow to their colonizers. Adding to the tension is Paul’s own desire to avoid going south; he has seen where this path leads, and the result is bloody. Death counts in the billions as the fundamentalists rally to his side and spread galactic jihad. (Sorry, “holy war.” The word “jihad,” used quite prominently and frequently in the books, has no place here. This is just a group of desert fundamentalists who believe so deeply in their prophet that they plan on spreading his word violently through the galaxy.) Dune: Part Two is at its best when it uses the epic vistas of the desert to its advantage. From fighters burrowing in the sand and springing up to surprise their victims to warriors standing on great sand dune ridges, a setting sun silhouetting their frames, the desert almost inherently projects scope and scale. Yes, this movie is a bit more monochromatic than the first, but the blue eyes of the Fremen and the sparkling spice out on the sweeping sands give everything a twinkle. Speaking of monochrome, we briefly sojourn to Giedi Prime, the homeworld of the Harkonnens. While here, director Denis Villeneuve chooses to shoot outdoor scenes—under the black sun of their planet—with an infrared IMAX lens. It gives the whole thing an ethereal, washed-out look. No wonder these alopecia-suffering goons are so comically wicked; they live in a world devoid of color. Austin Butler plays Feyd-Rautha, the heir to the Harkonnen throne, as though he’s channeling Stellan Skarsgård, who plays Vladimir Harkonnen. Just close your eyes during one of Butler’s scenes: he’s doing a spot-on vocal impression of the elder Skarsgård. The Harkonnens and their sponsor, the Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken), are the weakest point of the film. Whereas the first entry neatly interwove political intrigue and epic set pieces, everything political here feels perfunctory, as preordained as Paul’s visions. The partnership of the emperor and the Harkonnens is barely sketched; the emperor himself feels like a shell, impotent and powerless, buffeted by the winds of fate. As such, the final battle feels a bit underwhelming, almost anticlimactic. There’s nothing with the same epic, emotional scope as the moment in Part One when the slaughter of House Atreides begins, bagpipes screaming as ships explode and swords are crossed. The real struggle in Part Two is Paul’s and Paul’s alone. He must unite the Fremen. He must become their messiah. Yet he fears what will happen to the universe if he takes on that role. He fears that he will lose Chani if he does what needs to be done and marries the emperor’s daughter in a last-ditch effort to stave off intergalactic war. And it’s not just Paul at war with himself here: screenwriter Jon Spaihts, who shares a writing credit with Villeneuve, is clearly concerned with the optics of Chalamet taking control of this desert people; one can practically hear them muttering “white savior” while writing. Paul repeatedly says the leader must come from the Fremen people; the closing shot of the film is on Zendaya rather than Chalamet. And yet the greatest moment in Dune: Part Two comes when Paul finally makes his choice, going full Braveheart, telling the tribesmen that their traditions are foolish, that he knows best, commanding them to follow his lead as they embark on the first step of their holy war. As much as it pains me to admit,1 this is an “oh wow” moment for Chalamet, the first time I’ve ever seen him onscreen and thought “yeah, he’s definitely got it.” My favorite performance, though, has to be Javier Bardem’s. As Stilgar he brings both the gravitas of an elder warrior and the sort of infectious joyousness of religious belief that makes you understand both the power of prophecy and why his people would follow Paul. The boy can do no wrong for Stilgar: If he denies he is the messiah, it is because he is humble; if he rejects their traditions, it is because he is wise. Paul’s ascent to prophet only works if we see it in Stilgar’s eyes, and Bardem sells it perfectly. Dune: Part Two doesn’t end quite as abruptly as its predecessor, which felt distinctly like half a film. But it also doesn’t complete the story either. The end of this film signals the beginning of a galactic war. The oceans may one day return to Arrakis, but that is of less interest than the oceans of blood about to be shed. The holy war to come is what everything—the dynastic and political and familial and religious intrigue—has been building toward. One hopes we get to see it."

Anything helps keep the lights on for Rendy Reviews and my livelihood as an entertainment writer. These reviews are made possible by contributions from viewers like you. Thank you. Denis Villeneuve already successfully translated Frank Herbert's Dune to the big screen through a rich, contemporary lens. And while there weren't any doubts that Villeneuve's lightning would strike twice, Paul Atreides's epic tale is paved with higher voltage and Dune: Part Two shocked me to a crisp. After Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) defeats Jamis in combat, he and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), are taken under the Fremen's wing. Alongside tribe leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and the dubious warrior Chani (Zendaya), Paul learns the Fremen peoples’ ways, fighting amongst them against the Harkonnens’s occupation of Arrakis. As Paul becomes a fearsome warrior known as Muad'Dib, Lady Jessica takes the reins as the Fremen's new Reverend Mother, and she strategizes a plan to instill belief in Paul's Lisan prophecy into reality amongst the Fremen nonbelievers.  Meanwhile, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) fails him for the last time. So he hires his deadlier, psychotic brother Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to eliminate Muad'Dib.  Not to start a Dune review with a Star Wars quote, but I don't like sand. I'm a city kid who is not interested in desert-set flicks. With the Arrakis oasis, Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser made me reconsider my stance because this is some of the most gorgeous imagery I've ever seen in a studio blockbuster flick. From an early immersive sequence revolving around a Harkonnen soldier’s stealth operation to the battle of the two Hollywood “It” boys, Mexican stand-off style, the collaboration between the VFX and camera departments trump the already gorgeous predecessor's lavish quality, constantly throwing picturesque imagery that'll leave your mouth agape. I had a self-imposed “try not to squeal with glee” challenge over the awe-inspiring ""Paul riding the sandworm"" sequence and I failed. The phenomenal craftsmanship across the board ensures the “Best VFX” Oscar in next year's race.  While I can go on about its spectacular visuals, it's screenwriters Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts' layered concentration on the Fremen people's religious beliefs and power struggle between the hierarchy of the Known Universe that Paul takes center stage. That is where Dune: Part Two comes alive. There's a hindsight appreciation for the writers' restraint with the universe's hierarchy, where the predecessor stored away Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) in a toybox to prevent overstuffing the film. Villeneuve and Spaihts organically weave them into the fray with just enough focus. Irulan functions as a narrator and audience avatar, obtaining information from her planet's scheming Reverend Mother/Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), essential to Paul and the Fremen's fight. While Florence Pugh is fine as always, Christopher Walken's S-tier casting – specifically his natural voice – fits an Emperor position and matches the weirdness of Herbert's world.  While I found the first installment lacking thematic depth and an emotional layer, the attention towards the formerly underutilized Chani and Stilgar and their opposing ideologies influencing Paul's principles fills that void. Influenced by his Southern-based religion, Stilgar believes that Paul is the prophesized Lisan al Gaib, the chosen ""Voice from the Outer World"" that'll lead the Fremen to paradise from Harkonnen rule. Chani's northern-based Atheist-like beliefs lie in the idea that her people should be the ones to liberate themselves. Sound familiar, America? Stilgar, who lives in Delulu Land, takes the prophecy to heart, saying, ""IT WAS WRITTEN. PAUL IS THE LISAN AL GAIB"" if he does so much as sneeze. It doesn't help that Lady Jessica is in the background pulling strings with her new Reverend Mother position to ensure that prophecy becomes a reality.  That's not to say Paul doesn't have his plans for vengeance over his father's murder up his sleeve, but the conflicting morality between his heart and mind adds an immense emotional stake that was missing in the previous film. With all these cards at play, Dune: Part Two cultivates a staggering and close-to-home depiction of how religious influence and the power they invoke are as intertwined as they are flimsy. Those unfamiliar with the book who are too lazy to research, who left the first movie going, “I hate this white savior arc they’re setting up,” are due for a rude awakening. Dune: Part Two's first half plays as a war flick. Given the time spent with the Fremen, their film advances in deconstructing their culture. Witnessing Paul and Lady Jessica learn their ways lends to better characterization. Javier Bardem's Stilgar is a charming mentor type and a much-needed comic relief that adds fun to the setting's Shakespearean severity. Zendaya – whose previous lack of screentime has been rectified – is this sequel’s emotional anchor. She’s resilient, wearing her humanity and skepticism on her sleeve, having Paul earn her trust and then her love.  But the battle between the Hollywood white boys, Austin Butler and Timothee Chalamet, adds an extra layer of epicness well worth anticipating as they deliver the strongest performances in my eyes.  Dune is Timothée’s franchise, and he confidently holds the picture on his shoulders with conviction and surprising grit, unlike anything he's done in his career thus far. Much like the film's ambitious scope, there's a seismic growth in Paul's character impacted by his taste for blood. As Muad'Dib, Paul's judgments become increasingly unpredictable. Chalamet channels the darkness in his role, becoming a captivating force of nature that changes the entire trajectory of the film's tone. Undeniably, this is a career-best performance, and I am excited to see how he fares in Part Three.  I can't believe I'm saying, ""Austin Butler was terrifying,"" but his work as the intimidating Feyd-Rautha is worth the price of admission. He isn't doing the Elvis voice, as it's closer to Gray Fox from Metal Gear Solid, but his manic presence keeps you at the edge of your seat.  The natural charisma between Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet influences their respective characters’ bond and chemistry, but I would be lying to myself if I didn't think it felt a tad underdeveloped. I needed one more scene of the two getting to know each other or engaging in Fremen's cultural activities to strengthen their romantic beats.  Cooking with that mf savory spice – unlike anyone else has ever done with Herbert’s words – Denis Villeneuve's  Dune Part Two is a masterpiece. With added realization and meditation on religion and politics and an emotional centerpiece, it's a damn near-perfect second act that should be regarded as the golden standard of studio blockbuster filmmaking and storytelling. "
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE," On a personal level, I breathed a sigh of relief after the final frame. I’ve admired Herbert’s book since my teens and have never had faith that any screen adaptation could do the material justice. Look at the precedents: David Lynch’s 1984 feature boasted some incredible imagery and a worthy cast; however, between the director’s loss of creative control and admitted distance from the material, Lynch’s version doesn’t click. The Sci-Fi Channel miniseries from 2000 has other problems, ranging from its lack of faithfulness to the book to its underwhelming production values. Not even Alejandro Jodorowsky’s unmade version of Dune, detailed in the 2013 documentary, sounded inspiring since the filmmaker seemed more interested in extravagances than Herbert’s themes. Still, when Villeneuve’s first part was released in 2021, the sequel had not yet been greenlit. I approached with perhaps too much caution, not wanting to invest myself or build expectations should the sequel go unmade or not stick the landing. Watching the second half, all of my concerns faded away, and I found myself immersed in Herbert’s world again, seeing moments from the book onscreen just as my mind’s eye had seen them as a reader. That’s just one aspect of Villeneuve’s genius—his ability to conjure images from the text and visualize what Herbert wrote.  If not already apparent, it’s best to watch the 2021 film before Part Two and catch up on the elaborate mythology. There’s no recap or “previously on” summary here; the sequel picks up where the first part ended. After his family, House Atreides, falls to the biomechanical House Harkonnen, the returning brute custodians of Arrakis, Paul joins the Fremen to earn the desert people’s loyalty. Paul has slain a Fremen warrior to prove himself, buying time for him and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Among the Fremen, Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and many others believe Paul is the “the One”—the Lisan al-Gaib, or off-world prophet. Others have their doubts. But Jessica, pregnant with a baby who communicates with her telepathically, sets out to become the Reverend Mother of the Fremen—a process that requires her to drink poison yet imbues her with all the memories of her forbearers. By acquiring this position, she hopes to convince them that her son is their promised messiah, who will return the trees and liberate the arid planet. Paul gradually fulfills one prophecy after another, survives trial after perilous trial, amasses a deadly arsenal, and converts dissenters to followers. Among them is Chani, who comes to respect Paul and becomes his lover.  However, Chani isn’t quite prepared for how Paul intends to seize power and get revenge on the Emperor of the Known Universe (Christopher Walken)—by disrupting the Harkonnens’ Spice-mining operations, inciting a holy war among the Empire’s many houses, and ascending in the chaos. All of this fuss is over Spice, the speckled fragments in the desert that, when used as a psychotropic, opens the mind and facilitates space travel, making it the most coveted resource in the universe. “Power over Spice is power over all,” crackles a voice from the void before the Warner Bros. logo, reminding us that the characters in Dune, like those in Game of Thrones, serve as pawns amid power plays. Take the Emperor’s daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who, along with her fellow Bene Gesserit, Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux) and the Truthsayer, anticipate the Emperor’s fall. But to whom? Paul could prove victorious. Then again, so could the Harkonnen—not Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), the Baron’s (Stellan Skarsgård) nephew who has lost control of Arrakis to Paul’s Fremen rebellion. It’s more likely the Baron’s other nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, convincingly replicating Skarsgård’s accent). Lady Margot moves the Feyd-Rautha piece into place despite believing him psychotic, which he is, and ensures his bloodline should he prove victorious against Paul. While the Dune saga might play like a space opera at times, with pregnancies and revelations about Paul and Jessica’s true bloodline, Villeneuve embraces Herbert’s themes about religion as an exploitable belief system to serve political gain. The book and film draw from humanity’s historical struggles over resources such as oil and land, with parallels between Paul’s adoption of the Fremens’ ways and T. E. Lawrence’s immersion into the Arab Rebellion during the First World War. Villeneuve has announced his desire to adapt Herbert’s second novel in the series, Dune Messiah, which continues the trend of watching vast political and religious regimes rise and fall. Such themes have made the book an enduring text for scholarly analysis, illustrating how politics adopt religious concepts to secure control—notions all too familiar in a country where Christian nationalism has become a platform for certain leaders. However, with the Fremen, the themes in Dune reach even further into social foundations built on the concept of personal discipline for the community good, which Herbert drew from Islamic values. Through that lens, Paul becomes less a hero than a warning about “chosen ones” who buy into their own savior myth.  This is all to say that Dune is a multifaceted work brimming with ideas. With a few exceptions, Villeneuve and Spaihts have adapted the material with faithfulness in mind. If only to maintain a commercially viable PG-13 rating, scenes of Baron Harkonnen and Feyd-Rautha’s predatory sexual behavior have been omitted from the page-to-screen translation, robbing the characters of a particularly nasty detail to their monstrosity. But in most other instances, the filmmakers have preserved the tone and spirit of Herbert’s text. To be sure, Villeneuve finds inspired ways of realizing facets of the story, such as Paul’s haunted dreams of millions dying under his reign and the elegant depiction of gravity-less Harkonnen gliding up a rock face or dropping from an aircraft. Shots from inside of Jessica’s womb of the unborn Alia, who talks to her mother and has an uncanny knowledge of everything happening, recall the all-seeing view of the Star Child from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)—and they have an analogous metaphysical quality to them. But even with imagery such as Alia in the womb drawing from the Star Child, Villeneuve’s filmmaking doesn’t feel like anyone else’s, which is a rarity among today’s directors.  Villeneuve isn’t making a pastiche or compendium of allusions to other films; rather, he carves out something singular with Dune and its sequel, adding to his already impressive work in science fiction. On a purely technical level, Part Two is astounding. Production designer Patrice Vermette and costumer Jacqueline West return from Dune, creating spaces and outfits that look wholly original. At the same time, cinematographer Greig Fraser balances scopic, severe sequences with more spontaneous interpersonal moments. And while CGI accomplishes much of Villeneuve’s vision, there’s not an oppressive computerized quality to everything onscreen, unlike most contemporary blockbusters—even when the enormous sandworms arrive onscreen, their mouths vaguely resembling the human eye. Villeneuve shot many of the exteriors in Abu Dhabi and Jordan, but other sequences rely on CGI. A black-and-white sequence under the black sun of Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen home planet, delivers a convincing arena with special effects. Not even Hans Zimmer’s music reverberating through the viewer’s chest feels like the typical Hollywood score; it’s otherworldly and hypnotic, yet it supports the thrilling aspects of the story with guitar riffs. Most of these technical areas earned the 2021 film its six Oscar wins, and the sequel deserves the same attention. It’s also worth noting how the stellar cast, one of the most stacked ensembles in recent film history, disappears into their roles effortlessly, thanks to the strength of Villeneuve’s storytelling.  Dune: Part Two further proves that a popcorn-munching, $150-million-plus production doesn’t need to be mindless entertainment; rather, it can be cerebral, passionate, and challenging. Villeneuve already proved as much with Dune—not to mention Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. He doubles down with the sequel, which may shock viewers who expect to follow Paul on a heroic rise to power. The audience may root for Paul at the moment because the Harkonnen look like an awful alternative. But is Paul any better? Through Chani’s eyes, who knows Paul’s doubts and strategy more intimately than anyone, except perhaps Jessica, she sees the opportunism and scheming by the proposed leader, who so shrewdly chose the name Muad’Dib after a spry kangaroo mouse that can make its own water. But Chani sees through all that. “You want to control people? Tell them a messiah will come. They’ll wait for centuries,” she tells him early on. The Bene Gesserit know this to be true; so does Paul, yet he cannot help but follow the path laid out for him. As I grappled with these ideas after the sequel, I must acknowledge my complete immersion into the film’s world; I was engaged on every level. Fitting, for what must be one of the greatest science-fiction epics of all time. "
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,A rousing&#44; heartfelt and breathtaking spectacle&#46;&#10;
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Denis Villeneuve once again proves that he has desert power&#46;
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 operatic and dense sci-fi spectacle ‘Dune’ was just scratching the sandy surface, or so you feel when you watch its sweeping second installment, out in UAE cinemas on February 29. ‘Dune: Part 2’, shot partly in Abu Dhabi’s scenic Empty Quarter, is a stunning piece of sci-fi adventure and isn’t as meditative as its first part, opting for a more propulsive pace. Central characters like the noble reluctant leader Paul Atreides (an on-point and toughened-up Timothée Chalamet) and desert nomad Chani (an alluring Zendaya) are given ample room to slide seamlessly into our collective imagination. Chalamet’s character has truly come of age as he plots revenge against those who massacred his family with the help of the toughened Fremen desert people. He’s lost that coltish quality seen in the first chapter and exudes a quiet warrior vibe. It’s safe to say that Villeneuve has successfully distilled one of the most un-filmable stories in the science fiction canon, author Frank Herbert’s iconic 1965 sci-fi tome, into a palatable-yet-sprawling fantasy adventure that could even rival ‘Game Of Thrones’ and ‘The Lord Of The Rings’. ‘Dune: Part 2’ transports you into a world of folklore, mythology, and futuristic warfare that is still relevant in today’s times.  If you strip away the overarching sci-fi trappings, you realise that this ambitious franchise -- which must be seen ideally on IMAX screens -- is a coming-of-age story set on a distant planet in the future and their valiant fight for spices, the precious currency that propels intergalactic domination. A determined Atreides unites with the far more liberated Fremen tribe of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against their common enemy House Harkonnen. Even if you are not a fantasy fanatic (guilty, as charged), this awe-inducing epic works because it doesn’t just focus on giving us a spectacular-looking film but dares to dive deep into the characters tapping into their vulnerabilities and their strengths. The scene in which Chalamet's character battles prophetic dreams and Zendaya's character takes him under her wings are stirring. In contrast to the arid desert around them, their feelings are far from barren and stark. Complicated themes such as -- is fate stronger than free will, the intricacies of faith, and fight for the control of spice -- a psychedelic mineral that grants its users supernatural abilities found exclusively on Arrakis -- are explored with a hawkish eye, but it’s the relationships and its varying shades of closeness that had my heart. No character is simply black or white. They revel in different shades of brown and just like the sand around them, it's impossible to capture them in your hand or slot them into categories of good and evil. In the first half, Chani and Atreides’s young romance, their palpable mutual attraction and that impending doom of how their love has only a slim chance of making it in their futuristic world are explored with a wild sense of abandon. The scenes where a hapless-yet-clinical Paul – perched always as this ultimate savior of his own people -- is forced to make choices that go beyond his personal fixations is tragic and touching. Zendaya -- who has a lot more to do in the second installment and is fortunately given more lines in the second innings -- and Chalamet have enough chemistry to make us root for them, against all odds. Their complex relationship dynamics don’t get lost in translation nor is it drowned in the din of creating a larger-than-life film that aims to impress visually. There are many scenes that are undoubtedly awe-inspiring and the grand austerity in the serene-but-sometimes brutal desert-scape will impress, but it’s the human dynamics and feuds that are compelling. Chalamet’s turbulent relationship with his heavily pregnant mother Lady Jessica Atreide (Rebecca Ferguson) and her dogged determination to remind her son of how his duties bind him is a keen examination of mother-son power dynamics. Their borderline exploitative power-play is palpable. If you are craving action, the climactic showdown between Atreides and Feyd Rautha (Austin Butler, the new entrant to the Dune landscape) is a showman-like spectacle of sorts. And did I tell you the scenes in which the strapping young Chalamet rides the sandworm are oddly satisfying to watch. The speed, the urgency, the craziness of it all is communicated with aplomb. It’s not just the heroes that impress, the villains are equally convincing. Dave Bautista as the evil–incarnate Harkonnen thug Beast Rabban also gets to flex his brooding looks and muscles a lot more in the second film. Brolin, who returns as Gurney Halleck – the mentor and advisor to Atreides, seems to have stepped out of his comfort zone and doesn’t shy away from breaking into a sweat. The surprise package of this cinematic marvel was Butler’s turn as the psychotic Feyd Rautha. His portrayal famously lived up to director Villeneuve’s description as “a cross between a sword master and Mick Jagger”. His snake-like movements and razor-sharp wit land smooth. So, if you are looking for an emotionally-charged sci-fi adventure that focuses on characters and their motives, then ‘Dune: Part 2’ delivers on all fronts. Even if you are not a fan of the fantasy or sci-fi genre, this film can still enchant."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"  The latest on-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, Dune: Part Two (2024), directed by Denis Villeneuve, is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor. Within mere moments, there is a palpable but welcome difference in tone, action, and just about everything else that this film -- roughly the second half of the novel -- has to deliver. Here is a sci-fi film that currently serves as the best argument for handing the keys over to an individual instead of a board of trustees, and allowing them to sift the sand for its hidden treasures.   Dune: Part One (2021) had the unenviable task of seeing if a novel -- replete with its outmoded appropriations and decades' worth of fans inventing their own visual schemata to match the material -- could bear the weight of connecting with a contemporary audience. It would've come as a surprise to no one if Part One simply burned up in the atmosphere. Twice adapted and twice falling short of the mark, Denis Villeneuve's version is the first that sees a coherence of aural and visual spectacle that captures something vital about the novel -- the same quality that perhaps explains why it's still read to this day.   Part One welcomed us to a grand, brutalist vision of a universe at the bluntest end of avarice, having contorted itself into a pretzel around how to deal with the spice-rich yet utterly inhospitable planet Arrakis. It is nothing if not fascinating: sapped of color and joy, yet oddly compelling for its formidable sense of scale and ability to embed key terminologies and lore while establishing its core cast and central themes. It doesn't hurt that the story of an heir apparent rising to power is as old as sand.   As a cinematic scouting mission, the film's modus operandi was to develop relations with a moviegoing audience virtually starving for large-scale sci-fi to fill the void left by redirected resources and a spate of TV series diminishing IP with overabundance. No, this isn't Star Wars, but we should be thankful.   Dune: Part Two, following the portentous, open-ended ending of the previous film, follows in the immediate aftermath of the fall of House Atreides. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), have found temporary asylum with a sietch group headed up by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Stilgar's methods are mysterious, often ending in fisticuffs. Still, he is compelled by the possibility that Paul might be the Lisan al Gaib or the prophet who will liberate Arrakis from bondage. As Stilgar pleads Paul's case for messianic worship to various Fremen council members, each representing a sietch from the northern population, there are just as many, like Chani (Zendaya), who are skeptical about any outworlder being able to deliver salvation from the grasp of the Emperor.   It's certainly a lot to take in. Still, in its density of language, Villeneuve's script, co-written by Jon Spaihts, has miraculously managed to ensure that each of the terms is oft-repeated and explained to the audience stand-in Paul in outsider terms so that that meaning begins to accumulate. Before long, and only our thirtieth time hearing the term Lisan al Gaib, Paul and his mother are presented with some choices: Paul can make himself useful as a young man, still malleable to the ways of the desert, and a possible hero for the cause; Lady Jessica can take on the role of Reverend Mother by ingesting the ""water of life,"" a psychoactive poison harvested from young Shai Hulud -- or be killed and drained of her body's moisture.   Suffice it to say, as it has been prophesied, Paul begins his formal training in the Fedaykin arts while catching the eye of Chani, who starts to warm to this outworld stranger. Meanwhile, Lady Jessica, bearing the child of a deceased Leto in her womb, takes on her new role and begins to preach the word of the Messiah to the various fringe sietches and sub-sietches that make up the Fremen south.   Elsewhere, on Giedi Prime, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is making plans of his own, having previously collaborated with Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) in the obliteration of House Atreides. Now needing a new representative on planet Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen enlists his nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), for the task. In Part One, Skarsgård is compelling and vile but is given even more to work with this time around as the same grotesque balloon, but who salivates at the very thought of conquest. Doing his best vocal impression of Skarsgård, Butler is introduced in one of the film's starkest, most stunning scenes. In short, he's like his uncle, but worse because he doesn't have to rely on anti-gravity technology to remain upright.   It's a lot to take in, and the movie is really just beginning. Dune: Part Two is a formidable chunk of storytelling and the most bang for your hard-earned buck that big-budget sci-fi can offer.   For all of its commendable groundwork, Dune: Part One's action was clunky and detached. With body armor modules that flickered blue and red with varying attacks, a glitchiness took away from the combat. Sardaukar soldiers, operating at the Emperor's behest, floated in like dead marionettes, giving not only the sense that there were strings but also that there was no weight to their actions. Villeneuve, tastefully omitting blood as much as possible, made some clear decisions that didn't always land but were at least there to give something to improve upon.   Dune: Part Two offers immediate improvement. The film begins with a chase: sniper-kitted Harkonnen scouts searching high and low for ""rats."" As the threat of a worm comes into play, they ascend like seasoned divers up a small mountain with grace -- one even touches the rock's side in a detail that does all the heavy lifting in terms of believability. When, moments later, they are attacked by unseen enemies, there is both a sense of scale -- that this is an island in a vast ocean -- and that there is far more at play than what is seen.   Where Dune: Part One offered Baron Harkonnen's oil-slick, humanoid spider pet and a kangaroo mouse recycling moisture from its ears as two of few world-building curiosities, this sequel provides more touches that give a sense of reality to Arrakis and its people -- who actually rib the white guy for having seasoned food. Part Two is chock-full of interactions that, though familiar for fans of hero's journeys, at least give some sense that these are living and breathing people. Bardem, in particular, is excellent as Stilgar, and his evolution from the stoic keeper of Fremen secrets to the outspoken believer in the Lisan al Gaib offers a superb turn for a previously underutilized character -- and a comic foil to Paul's well-trod path.   But, of course, the actual center of attention is the relationship between Paul and Chani. As the two characters get to know one another, we, the audience, can immediately tell that these are two very different performers from the previous film. Zendaya's appearances in Part One were mostly relegated to perfume ad snippets of what we were told was meaningful, but we could sense that, at two hours in, there wouldn't be answers in that first dose of Dune. In Part Two, Chani is revealed as a Fedaykin par excellence, a soldier who lives and breathes in the desert but doesn't believe in the possibility of an outsider bringing peace. Zendaya slides through the scenery confidently and delivers a performance that, as the runtime mounts, more and more resembles the series' beating heart.   Timothée Chalamet, as Paul, is noticeably different as well. Now a seasoned headliner, he exudes an energy that is day and night between his former, meeker self. Where Paul was once the buttoned-up heir apparent, he is now a person clawing through psychic visions and his wants and desires. In some of Dune: Part Two's most rousing moments, Paul galvanizes rooms full of faith-hungry Fremen, promising a new, more violent order. These scenes are some of the film's best and offer a compelling reason for Chalamet to take the lead. Villeneuve, for all of his bold gambles, chose the right Paul. After completing a particular arduous feat, Paul is given the opportunity to choose his war name. It all clicks when he lands on Muad'dib, the Fremen word for kangaroo mouse.   Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two is a bold accomplishment. Taking inspiration in unequal parts from Jean Giraud, aka Moebius, Stanley Kubrick, Star Wars, and much more, Villeneuve has gone beyond his influences to create a hefty piece of sci-fi world-building that is lost in the spate of films that need to have delineated heroes and villains. While it's far too early to say if Dune Messiah will follow, it would be a pity not to see what Frank Herbert's original vision leads to. With all of the complexities and cliffhangers lingering in the air, Dune (the Fremen word for Arrakis) is more than just a repository for melange harvesting.  Dune: Part Two briefly features Anya Taylor-Joy as the newest member of the House Atreides, setting her up for a bigger role in the third movie."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE," David Lynch’s 1984 film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi novel Dune is best described as an interesting failure. Much of the failure was Lynch’s—he didn’t really understand the source material, and he made some questionable artistic calls—but blame must be shared with Universal Studios, which insisted Lynch significantly cut the intended three-hour runtime to a more manageable two hours. The result was a rushed third act that barely feels like a movie at times, and that hits many of the major beats of Herbert’s novel without giving them the necessary space to mean anything. At one point, the passage of time is conveyed through a montage while a narrator solemnly intones, “Paul and Chani’s love grew” as Kyle MacLachlan and Sean Young smooch to a Toto guitar riff. No wonder Lynch’s Dune was a critical and commercial flop, and no wonder Lynch himself still hates to be associated with it. With Lynch as a cautionary tale, it’s understandable why Denis Villeneuve insisted Warner Bros grant him more than five hours to tell the same story, split into two parts. The first of those came out in the fall of 2021, after pandemic-related delays, to mostly positive reviews; now, after strike-related delays, the second is finally here. Both halves were worth the wait, and having rewatched Part One in theaters less than 48 hours before watching Part Two, I feel confident saying that Villeneuve understands how to pace Dune in a way Lynch never did. Even with all that extra time, a hard-core fan of the novel might still flag some missing scenes and characters and concepts, but that’s forgivable. Villeneuve is clearly a hard-core fan himself, but he’s also trying to make a complex story work in a different medium, and the scenes and characters he does include need a chance to breathe. If it matters to the story that Paul and Chani’s love grew, then we need to see it grow, and we need actors—in this case, Zoomer icons Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya—capable of investing us in their romance. When we left off at the end of Part One, Paul (Chalamet)—heir to the noble House Atreides and possible end product of an ancient Bene Gesserit breeding scheme—had only just been introduced to Chani (Zendaya), a young Fremen warrior native to the planet Arrakis, and had fallen in with her desert tribe. Though Zendaya narrated the opening sequence of Part One and appeared in Paul’s prophetic visions throughout, her role in the first film was marginal; this time around, she’s given far more screen time and emerges as the film’s moral center. And if ever a film needed a moral center, it’s this one. Lynch’s Dune fundamentally misunderstood the story Herbert was trying to tell, which was meant to be about the dangers of religious fundamentalism and messianic hero worship; instead he filmed a conventional hero’s journey that ended by recognizing Paul Atreides as an actual messiah. Villeneuve has made clear in interviews and implicit in Part One that he wouldn’t make the same mistake, and only an unusually dense viewer of Part Two would miss the underlying tragedy of Paul’s revenge against his family’s nemeses, the Harkonnens, who are responsible for his father’s death and for his own exile to the desert. Villeneuve’s Harkonnens are repulsive and irredeemable, as both Herbert and Lynch made them, but Villeneuve also telegraphs throughout that an Atreides victory could be even worse, unleashing mass murder and starvation upon billions of innocents. This is a bleak story, and in order to bear witness to its bleakness we need at least one character who can see what’s really going on. Herbert was a marvelous world builder but a clunky stylist, and his novel’s strength is in the rich cultural, technological, and ecological details it lays out. Villeneuve, by contrast, is a great visual director working with an exceptionally stacked cast, and he manages to use those assets to tell Herbert’s story in some ways more effectively than Herbert did. Herbert’s details are faithfully recreated if you know where to look, but Villeneuve’s Dune is a human-centric story in which every major character has a thematic function as well as a plot function. Since the central theme of Part Two is the danger of a looming “holy war” (the film’s less loaded term for what Herbert called “jihad”) carried out by Paul’s Fremen legions, the major characters in Paul’s inner circle each represent a different angle on that war and what it would mean. Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the Fremen tribal leader who takes Paul under his wing, is a man of sincere faith in the messianic prophecy that Paul appears to fulfill; for him, each of Paul’s achievements is further confirmation, and behind him are millions of awestruck Fremen believers ready to be led into battle. Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), once Paul’s weapons instructor and now a spice smuggler, has no interest in religion but is preoccupied by a desire for revenge against the Harkonnens, who killed both his actual family and the Atreides family he served, and is eager to use the Fremen to that end.  Paul’s mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a rogue Bene Gesserit who early in Part Two consumes the poisonous Water of Life and unlocks the memories of her ancient sisterhood, knows that the Fremen religion is a lie planted by the Bene Gesserit for their own mysterious long-term purposes, and she’s inclined to use that lie to protect her son and his claim to be the Kwisatz Haderach, a superbeing. And then there’s Zendaya’s Chani, who loves both Paul and her Fremen community exactly as they are, and who is sensibly skeptical of prophecies, superbeings, and vindictive crusades. Chalamet’s Paul is caught in the middle of all these cross-pressures, trying to avoid realizing his own terrible visions of the future but finding himself boxed in. One advantage of telling the story this way is to counter inevitable claims that Dune is a standard Hollywood white savior narrative. Certainly the members of the Great Houses that run the Imperium are all played by white actors, whereas the Fremen are a mixed but overwhelmingly nonwhite population—the parallels to real-world colonial dynamics are obvious and intentional. But the Fremen are not presented as monolithic noble savages whose only role is to be instrumentalized by a highborn protagonist. As in the novel (and unlike in Lynch’s film), we spend time with them, learn their customs (notably the care with which they extract water from human corpses and put it to more or less sacred uses depending on their feelings for the deceased), learn to admire them as Paul does, and also learn that there are more secular Fremen like Chani alongside fundamentalists like Stilgar. Villeneuve takes the time to sketch these internal divisions, and from the beginning of Part Two we are privy to lively debates over the role of religion in a tribal society. As for Jessica and Gurney, Villeneuve makes the bold decision to paint both of these fan favorites in a more sinister light than anyone previously had. Gurney is a military man out for Harkonnen blood and eager to use the Atreides’ secret stockpile of nuclear weapons for his narrow ends, and Jessica, once she attains the status of reverend mother, is actually more determined to exploit the Fremen religion and to realize Paul’s latent gifts than Paul is. This is something of an inversion from the novel, but it works—Jessica is far less passive in the latter half of the story here, and the qualities in her that frighten her former Bene Gesserit mentor (Charlotte Rampling, still a formidable presence at 78) are far more apparent. If all this sounds ponderous and talky, rest assured that Part Two has more action and more spectacular set pieces than Part One, which is also consistent with the book. We see Paul learn how to ride a sandworm, and later we watch an army of sandworm riders bear down on the Imperial Sardaukar corps. We see daring Fremen guerrilla raids on spice harvesters, gladiatorial combat on the Harkonnen homeworld, and the detonation of those aforementioned nukes. We also see each of the Harkonnen villains—Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), Rabban (Dave Bautista), and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, appearing for the first time in Part Two and chewing up every scene he’s in)—knifed to death. As monstrous as each of them is, these knifings are brief and not particularly satisfying or dramatic; by the time they happen, Villeneuve wants us to understand that the Harkonnens are almost beside the point, and that the terrifying power Paul has unleashed is going to claim far more lives than these three. Villeneuve is for the most part scrupulously faithful to the source material, which makes his most significant departures interesting and worth lingering on. The biggest is to compress the story chronologically so that Paul’s sister Alia, conceived weeks before the end of Part One, remains in utero at the end of Part Two (Herbert and Lynch both allow a few years to go by, and have a young Alia, born with all the adult memories of her female ancestors, present in the final act). Alia appears in Part Two as a conscious fetus to which Jessica is constantly talking, which is a detail so weird Herbert might as well have thought of it himself; we also glimpse an adult Alia in one of Paul’s prescient visions, and if Villeneuve delivers on his promise to adapt the second novel in the series, Dune Messiah, we’ll get to know her a lot better. For now, though, Villeneuve seems to have determined that Part Two is busy enough without a preternaturally wise little girl joining the cast (this also means it is Paul, rather than Alia, who kills the old Baron, who is revealed to be their grandfather). There are some other secondary characters that fall by the wayside: the Atreides adviser Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), who had a memorable role in Part One and who in the second half of the novel becomes a Harkonnen hostage, doesn’t feature in Part Two, and we don’t meet the emperor’s right-hand man, Count Fenring, though we do meet his seductive Bene Gesserit wife, Lady Margot (Léa Seydoux). We also meet Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the sad-eyed, Machiavellian emperor of the universe, and his sharply analytical Bene Gesserit daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who together stand between Paul and the fulfillment of his political ambitions. Like I said, the cast is stacked, and everyone seems thrilled to be a part of Villeneuve’s project, again in marked contrast to the labored performances by talented actors in Lynch’s film. What’s most impressive about Parts One and Two alike might be Villeneuve’s ability to make all of this comprehensible to a lay audience that hasn’t read the book and doesn’t have access to its lengthy glossary. He has a remarkable sense of what does and what does not need to be explained, how to make exposition seem organic to the story, and how to balance this onslaught of information against the need to develop distinctive characters and advance the plot. He makes all of that look much easier than it actually is. Fans of the book can recognize all the subtle nods—for instance, how closely the emperor’s temporary headquarters on Arrakis resembles its description in the novel: “A single metal hutment, many stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle from the base of the lighter—a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves.” Newcomers don’t need to know how accurately the film realizes that image to appreciate how cool it looks on screen. They may, however, understand some of the plotting and character motivations better than first-time readers of the novel do, because Villeneuve is frankly better than Herbert at establishing those in plain English and in logical sequence. Villeneuve closes Part Two with the commencement of Paul’s holy war and with Chani’s lonely anxiety in the face of it. Assuming Part Two is as big a hit as Part One, it’s entirely possible he’ll have his opportunity to adapt the second novel in the series as Part Three, and to make even more explicit the bloody consequences of Paul’s apparent victory. It’s an auspicious time for these themes; while they don’t always map neatly onto current events, audiences today are plenty familiar with desert warfare, the destruction of tribal lands by extractive industry, climate change, the lure of fundamentalism to the oppressed and marginalized, and the dangers of singular charismatic figures seeking political power—not to mention the uses and misuses of hallucinogens. As big-budget sci-fi franchises go, Dune could hardly be more relevant. With Part Two, Villeneuve has definitively proven that it’s possible for Hollywood to do justice to Herbert’s vision."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Folks, it's like this: if you liked or loved Dune: Part One, you will like or love Dune: Part Two."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,There is an emotional depth to it that's missing in the worldbuilding of the initial installment.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE," In an interview we conducted with director Denis Villeneuve following the release of Dune in 2021 he spoke about his hopes for Dune: Part Two expressing his desire to make this film ‘playtime!’ Visually this is astonishing filmmaking that uses technology (such as infrared cameras) in innovative ways to produce arresting images but it also allows its ensemble cast, including new additions Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux and Christopher Walken to have some fun with the interpretation of their characters for the second part of the big screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved novel. Much of the action takes place in Arrakis (featuring sublime panoramas and horizon placements that wisely follow John Ford’s advice to Stephen Spielberg in The Fabelmans), following Paul Atreides’ (Timothée Chalamet) journey as he bonds with the Fremen, learns the truth about his destiny and heritage, and gets spicy with Chani (Zendaya turning in a touching performance). Pugh’s turn as Princess Irulan is refined as she plots and narrates diary entries, Seydoux is excellent and mysterious in her role as Lady Margot Fenring and Walken is delivering his lines as only he can with distinct pronunciation as Emperor Shaddam. Butler as the sociopathic Harkonnen, Feyd-Rautha, with a thirst for blood, violence and humiliation is incredible, from his wild gestures to his impressive physicality he is truly a detestable and memorable villain! Also new and notable is Souheila Yacoub as a Fremen and close friend to Chani and well-guarded secret Anya Taylor-Joy pops up too (as revealed at the World Premiere). The influence of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey is eerily apparent in Lady Jessica’s (Rebecca Ferguson) metamorphosis narrative as it traces themes of rebirth and humanity. But it’s also evident across the widescreen shots and close-ups of those big blue eyes. As rebellion blooms with a powerful story of revenge, the set pieces become increasingly more thrilling. Exhilarating giant worm rides and terror filled amphitheatre battles showcase not only great special effects but performances that convey psychological turmoil. Villeneuve’s bold stylistic choices, along with the penetrating score by Hans Zimmer result in a film that intensely washes over the senses as it pummels the viewer with beauty and brutality."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is a doozy. Director Denis Villeneuve follows up his phenomenal Part One with a staggering interpretation of Dune‘s most interesting bits, and he does so with the verve and tact of a Frank Herbert admirer and committed filmmaker. Paul Atreides’ (Timothée Chalamet) transformation from earnest outsider to emotionally removed idol is a critical element of this story. Rightfully, most of Part Two‘s success hinges on whether or not this specific development works (thankfully, it does). With Part Two, Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts again do justice to Herbert’s toothsome novel, bringing care, scale, and moral murk to a complex epic. Villeneuve wrangles the material with the thoroughness of a diehard; everything from Fremen customs to Harkonnen ideologies feel fleshed-out and he has been open about Dune‘s importance to him, so it stands to reason that he’d put enormous care into making his adaptation the absolute best version of itself. Of all it gets right, though, Part Two‘s most impressive feat is its artful relegation of its many villains. The Emperor and the Harkonnens are present and felt throughout, but they all play second fiddle to the ramifications of Paul’s ascension. Prophecy and deification are the big bads here. Villeneuve, eager to honour the story that helped shape him as an artist, spends most of Part Two digging deep into what makes Paul’s evolution so complicated and devastating. Granted, a number of character arcs and subplots are resolved perfunctorily, and a handful of defining moments get zero time to breathe. The rest of it, though? The rest of it is impressively close to perfect."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE," Hay películas que duelen no tanto por lo que son, que en principio no hay nada dañino en ellas, sino por lo que pudieron ser y, finalmente, no han querido o podido ser. El astronauta, de Johan Renck y presentada fuera de concurso en la Berlinale, puede ser considerada a partir de este preciso instante el ejemplo estrella. No hay nada en esta cinta definitivamente malo. Y, sin embargo, pesa mucho más todo lo bueno que falta. La historia está basada en la singular y sorprendente (además de divertida en la mejor tradición checa) novela de Jaroslav Kalfar'El astronauta de Bohemia' (Tusquets). En ella se cuenta en primera persona la historia del primer cosmonauta checo, que es además el relato de un hijo condenado a redimir los pecados políticos de su padre, que es además una reflexión sobre el perdón, la pobreza, el tiempo, la soledad, la vida en pareja y hasta una araña gigante con patas de pulpo. Sí, los monstruos surgen cuando se acumulan demasiados argumentos graves en un texto. Y claro ante semejante festín de buenas ideas uno hace cábalas sobre la adaptación que le hubiera gustado ver. Quizá algo pomposa y exageradamente épica a lo Nolan. O tal vez visualmente exuberante pero muy consciente de la voz desesperada que dicta el relato más cerca de la concepción de Villeneuve. O, por qué no, carnal y enferma de sí misma (ésta es nuestra favorita) como sin duda habría hecho el mejor Cronenberg. O, un paso más allá, caótica y voraz con un Abel Ferrara dispuesto a sabotear la propia película en cada plano. Y luego ya están todos los extremos que se quieran. Pues bien, nada de eso. El sueco Johan Renck --antes conocido por una larga lista de anuncios, videoclips y la dirección de capítulos de la serie 'Chernobyl'-- destierra de sí cualquier intento de punto de vista y, secundado por dos estrellas como Adam Sandler y Carey Mulligan, se deja llevar por la más plana y equidistante de las propuestas. Tratándose de una producción de Netflix, quizá el imperativo de acoplarse al punto medio del algoritmo pesó más que cualquier otro. ¿Quién sabe? Lo que duele de verdad, ya se ha dicho, es pensar en todas las opciones, y todas válidas, que nos hemos perdido. Básicamente, se cuenta la historia de un astrofísico checo de nombre Jakub que acepta la misión más extrema y agónica de todas (irse a recolectar muestras de una extraña nube mucho más allá de las estrellas) con la lejana idea de conseguir la exculpación del padre, antiguo miembro del Partido Comunista. Quiere ser un héroe aunque eso le cueste el matrimonio y la salud mental. En la soledad se hará amigo de un alienígena con forma de gran tarántula. ¿Realidad o proyección de su mente?, todo indica que lo segundo, pero tampoco hay que ponerse tan fino, que esto es cine. La entrada en 'El astronauta' no puede ser más sorprendente y feliz. La visión del hombre, solo de pura soledad, ante la criatura, peluda de pura bestialidad, encoge no tanto el alma como las amígdalas. El espectador es colocado ante la posibilidad de replicar el asco y el miedo del propio protagonista. Pero pronto, la maquinaria, por aquello de no molestar, es desactivada. El director opta por abrir el abanico de opciones en un intento algo más que frenético de contarlo todo. Y todo a la vez. Que si la crisis matrimonial, que si la paranoia, que si los 'flashbacks' de la infancia... En puridad todo está correcto, bien incluso, pero tan desenfocado, tan disperso, tan sin ánimo alguno de profundidad y vértigo que desalienta. Adam Sandler y Carey Mulligan, por su parte, ofrecen sus más conocidas y respetables versiones. Es decir, nada se sabe del tono irónico y febril con que el primero riega sus mejores trabajos (Diamantes en brutoo The Meyerowitz Stories) y todo queda a la vista del registro siempre tenso de la segunda. Tampoco lo que hace el reparto es criticable. De nuevo, lo que incomoda es lo que dejan sin hacer. No es lo que es, es lo que pudo ser. Lástima. Por lo demás, si un día antes con 'Pepe', de Nelson Carlos de los Santos, y con 'The Devil's Bath, de Veronika Franz y Severin Fiala, la sección a competición vivió su mejor momento, la del miércoles fue la jornada más discutible. O solo mala. Ni 'Black tea', del mauritano Abderrahmane Sissako, ni 'Gloria!', de la debutante como directora (hasta ahora actriz y cantante) Margherita Vicario, aciertan en sus tan arriesgadas (importante, vaya por delante, reconocer el riesgo) como confusas y fallidas propuestas. El caso de Abderrahmane Sissako es el más lacerante por su relevancia. También el más disculpable por su atrevimiento. Hablamos de uno de los directores africanos más importantes cuya película anterior, 'Timbuktú', fue uno de esos trabajos a su modo, por compromiso y claridad, histórico. Ahora la apuesta es infinitamente mayor. 'Black tea' quiere ser una película sin limitaciones de ningún tipo. Se desenvuelve igual en la imaginación de sus personajes que en una realidad con aspecto de ensoñación; discurre de la misma manera en Costa de Marfil que Guangzhou (china) o Cabo Verde; se habla, sin que los que hablan demuestren el menor esfuerzo, francés y chino; es fabulación y es sueño. Pensemos por un momento en 'In the mood for love', de Wong Kar-Wai, pues ésa es clarísimamente la inspiración y hasta el objetivo (inalcanzable, cabría añadir). El problema es la ausencia casi completa de implicación con el espectador. Sissako aspira a crear una especie de estado emocional (o mental) que solo él retenga la atención de la audiencia. Y en aras de ese deseo sacrifica prácticamente todo: narrativa, lógica y estructura. La confusión, en el ideario de la película, es parte de la embriaguez buscada, pero, muy al contrario, acaba por transformarse en el monstruo que todo lo devora y todo lo arruina. Resulta imposible seguir el paso a los vericuetos casi místicos de un drama donde los protagonistas aparecen y desaparecen, se confunden entre sí y, finalmente, desesperan. El caso de 'Gloria!' es muy distinto. De forma radical. Margherita Vicario propone un drama histórico y vocacionalmente anacrónico de huérfanas que cantan. Estamos en la Venecia de 1800 y alrededor del recién inventado pianoforte, nuestras heroínas componen su particular ópera rock para liberarse de las imposiciones de la sociedad, la Iglesia y el Estado. El problema no es la ingenuidad ni los gorgoritos melismáticos ni la ligera homofobia (los personajes homosexuales son los malos), lo grave es la falta de pudor de una Berlinale que, contra toda lógica y sentido de la proporción, ha colocado una película parroquial en la competición oficial. Esto sí es lo marciano y no lo de 'El astronauta'."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE," With “Dune: Part Two,” visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve resolves the biggest complaint about his visually sumptuous but incomplete 2021 adaptation of the classic sci-fi epic — mostly. This time, he proffers an honest-to-goodness ending, even if it, too, teases even more chicanery and planetary conflict ahead. (Villeneuve has said he envisions this “Dune” series as a big-screen trilogy.) But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, and focus on “Dune: Part Two,” which opens March 1 and has already been screened for critics. My advice: rewatch the first chapter before seeing this more creatively, narratively and technically ambitious epic. It picks up right after the first film, and is available on Netflix, Max, and other services. Indeed, “epic” best describes what Villeneuve and his team have crafted, an instant sci-fi classic that respects author Frank Herbert’s intentions and themes (faith, hero worship, colonization, the corruption of power), and re-creates some of the 1965 novel’s most iconic moments. And it has the audacity to imagine all of it better than any diehard fan could — a rare occurrence, and one reason why this “Dune” is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Case in point is a thrilling sequence wherein the story’s protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) rides atop sandworms as if he’s parasailing on the desert planet of Arrakis. It’s pure movie magic, an exhilarating rollercoaster ride that fills viewers with child-like wonder and awe and is on par with what movie magician Christopher Nolan conceived with those folding, interacting worlds in “Inception.” The first film was a work of art, and so is this one, with a screenplay from Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts that spices things up by moving characters like chess pieces to more strategic positions in this world. The key chess piece is Paul Atreides, who is seeking some payback against those who killed his dad, villains who also happen to the oppressors and profiteers on the spice-rich Arrakis. Chalamet proves here he’s an actor with range, as Paul and his strong-willed mother Jessica (the accomplished Rebecca Feguson) assume commanding roles in the lives of the Fremen, the land’s Indigenous people. Some see Paul as their messiah and most see Jessica as their Reverend Mother, titles these outsiders don’t feel entirely comfortable wearing — at least at the start. One who does back Paul and believes he’s “Muad’Dib” is Stilgar (Javier Bardem, robustly providing much of the comic relief), a showman himself who has earned the respect and clout of others. The skeptic remains Chani (Zendaya, giving a fiery and complex performance), a fearless Fremen who’s drawn to  Paul but reluctant to see him as a savior. She’s suspicious of any outsider given that so many have preyed on their land. It’s one of the themes that resonates most forcefully in this sequel. Meanwhile, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken, a fine choice), his more-with-it daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling, icy as ever) scheme ahead. They’re aligned on a quest to stomp out revolt with the grotesque Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his homicidally inclined nephew ​​Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler, slithering with evil). Other indelible characters return, including the cowboy-like Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, in fine form) and brawny fury magnet Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista, flexing his acting chops). It’s a huge cast of characters to deal with, and that’s one reason why “Dune: Part Two” — which needs to be viewed on a big screen with the best sound possible — clocks in at 2 hours, 46 minutes, and leaves plenty on the table for a third installment. It’s a credit to the cast for managing to create indelible characters even if their screen time is limited. But main kudos go to Villeneuve — this is his gem from start to finish, as he weaves together a cogent story with such timeless themes as blind faith, savior syndrome, resource exploitation and the lure of power. “Dune: Part Two ” juggles all of that with precision and skill and serves up action sequences that more than keep up with the characters, story development and world-building visual splendor. It rivals 2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” as a staggering, monumental achievement in genre filmmaking and reminds us what truly talented movie directors can do."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE," Yes, it is a gorgeous production but not a masterpiece. I’ll be brave and say it: Walken is a feeble lopsided emperor, Bardem is over-acting in his own movie and Bautista’s emotional decimal is higher than everyone else. Only Butler ignites the movie. According to Google, 2021 DUNE PART 1 had a budget of $165 million and grossed $402 million - during the pandemic. How many people who paid to see DUNE PART 1 read the book by Frank Herbert? If the same number of people see PART 2, how can the projection of $1 billion worldwide be predicted? According to Variety, the film is projected to make between $60 million and $80 million in the US alone for its first weekend. Unless you saw DUNE: PART 1 or read the book (my prediction is reading is going the way of cursive), you will not understand what the hell is going on. Why is spice so important? If spice rules the world, why are the people living on the spice planet so poor? Why are there people on a planet that does not have water? How did humans get there in the first place? Apparently, the people living on the planet have nothing to do with spice production. Machines do the work. How did humans come to live on a planet without water? These miserably poor people are constantly trying to disrupt the key element – spice - needed for expansion throughout the Universe. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? The planet’s humans are called Fremen. Does spice serve a special purpose to the Fremen? The heighten consciousness that spice gives them certainly hasn’t enhanced their lives. Their world has no colors. What does no color do to the human brain? What benefit is having the white of their eyes turn blue? Now, what about those “worms.” No one knows anything about the true indigenous lifeform on the planet. Are the worms angry about the removal of spice? Do the worms make spice? What do the worms eat? How does the constant spice production affect the worms? So the worms are the Moby Dicks of Arrakis. How many ticket buyers read Moby Dick? There was a 1956 movie directed by John Huston starring Gregory Peck. Captain Ahab rode Moby Dick. Paul gains the Fremen’s respect by riding a big worm. In PART 1, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac), the ruler of the planet Caladan, is assigned by the Emperor Shaddam (unseen in PART 1) to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) as the fief holder of the desert planet Arrakis. What is “spice”? It is said to be a psychotropic substance that bestows heighten awareness, but its power is key to interstellar travel. What is the agenda of the interstellar navigators? Once on the planet, Duke Leto did not do much or help the people. The Fremen were suspicious of House Atreides. Could life get any worse under House Atreides? Why didn’t he just bring water? He could have been The Water God of Arrakis. I saw DUNE: PART 2 at the best possible venue, the Dolby Cinema Theater at AMC Town Square in Las Vegas. The Dolby theater is the best way to see director Denis Villeneuve’s majestic production. However, why was so much of the dialogue that was not subtitled, impossible to hear? PART 2 delves deeper into the Emperor’s (Christopher Walken) plan. We find him sitting in a garden with his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). It reminded me of I, CLAUDIUS, where all the emperors stayed in their gardens. The Emperor wanted to destroy House Atreides by having House Harkonnen retake Arrakis by bloodshed and destruction. Duke Leto wasn’t tough enough. 20,000 years in the future and humans still have a caste system with titles and poor people. The human race is still colonizing but now it’s planets with resources but without a standing army. A quote attributed to Napoleon, “An army marches on its stomach” has evolved in the year 10,191 to ‘an army marches on its testosterone lust for conquering and subduing other planets.’ Also, by 10,191, the suffixes A.D. and B.C.E. are gone. I still do not know anything about why the Fremen claim the planet. How did they get there? What happens to generations of humans living without colors? What do they eat on a planet of sand? Imagine if the Fremen saw colors! In Roman times, the color purple was reserved exclusively for the emperor - some even punished their citizens if they wore any shade of the color. Queen Elizabeth 1 set laws that permitted only her close relatives to wear purple. DUNE: PART 2 picks up moments after PART 1. It begins with the burial of Jamis, a Fremen warrior whom Paul killed in a knife fight. Duke Leto is killed. His widow, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a Harkonnen, is still a significant member of the Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit are forbidden to bear male children (females are the dominant species). Lady Jessica gives Duke Leto a son, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) thinking he could be the foretold Kwisatz Haderach, a messianic super-being prophesied to guide humanity that has already thrived and conquered the Universe. What better future are they waiting? Jessica defied her life’s purpose. Secretly, she trained their son, Paul, in the special skills of her cult. The special ways are enduring pain and a deep voice. Lady Jessica did not lose her position in the Bene Gesserit. Regardless of betraying the Bene’s directive, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen (Charlotte Rampling) does not throw Lady Jessica out of the cult. If Gaius Helen is indeed the Emperor’s Truthsayer, she didn’t know Lady Jessica was lying about intentionally giving Duke Leto a male heir. As the head of the Bene Gesserit, Gaius Helen wears big shoe boxes on her head. What’s up with that? With House Atreides destroyed, now pregnant Lady Jessica and Paul are outlaws. Aided by Chani (Zendaya), Paul must prove his loyalty is to the Fremen. After being accepted into the Fremen, Lady Jessica is asked to take the place of their dying Reverend Mother, who transfers her memories in an orgastic fit. Lady Jessica uses her new position to imply Paul is the messiah they have been waiting for. Paul enjoys his new place in Fremen society and is given the honorific name Muad'Dib. Chani, who now has an intimacy with Paul, is quite vocal that waiting for a messiah to save them is ridiculous. Lady Jessica’s womb is carrying her daughter who refuses to shut up and is constantly complaining to her mother and brother. They treat the “pre-birth baby” as a sage. PART 2 really takes off with the arrival of the villainous Feyd (Austin Butler). He is the Baron’s nephew, and his outstanding personality trait is sadism. His birthday celebration is reminiscent of Commodus entering the gladiator arena. Hey, it worked for GLADIATOR. While the budget is on the screen, the problems are evident. As the movie ends, Paul joins his mother in turning away from his moral code and becomes emperor. Paul wants to be emperor instead of messiah. Messiahs come and go, emperors build cities. Will we be left with this ending, or will there be a DUNE: PART 3? Word is, if you want DUNE: PART 3, you better get your family and friends to see PART 2 because, supposedly, no one is contractually obligated to be in PART 3. If this is true, Chalamet can demand $50 million to return. PR is using a threat to get people in seats for PART 2 or there will not be a PART 3. Chalamet grows a backbone, Ferguson’s role expands and Zendaya commands the trophy for acting. Florence Pugh, Lea Seydoux, and Anya Taylor-Joy all look alike. They are the catwalk models of DUNE: PART 2. Josh Brolin looks his true height, Javier Bardem chews up the scenery and every actor around him, Dave Bautista screams, Jason Momoa hugs, and Walken gets a 2-day paycheck."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE," “This is only the beginning,” says Chani (Zendaya) at the end of Dune: Part One. For those familiar with Frank Herbert’s epic book, we knew, going into Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited sequel, of the expectation to come – beat for beat. Yet even with that prior knowledge and the darker territory it embarks on, nothing quite prepares you for what you’re about to see – sandworms and all. Villeneuve – unapologetically – crafts a cinematic masterpiece with Dune: Part Two, instantly reminding us of the power of cinema as an artform and why we love grandiose spectacles like Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings. As a sci-fi and fantasy fan, these films challenge our imaginations as we lose ourselves to the operatic mythology of other worlds and cultures beyond our own. And buried within its immense subtext is a fascinating richness of nuance and depth for its characters that questions the essence of our human nature. Dune – without question – answers that call in abundance. This sequel is a darker, twisted and complex beast that surpasses Part One in every way. There’s a great reward in watching Villeneuve accomplish his lifelong dream with Dune. It’s an impressive track record when you chart his filmography: Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy and Sicario, to name a few. But science fiction is where he has found his home. The exponential growth between Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and now the Dune chapters is astonishing, and similar to Christopher Nolan, the cinematic canvas is pushed to ambitious levels with each film. What makes Villeneuve’s direction special is his ability to explore the human condition. In getting the best out of his actors, the characters in that exploration are all on a destined quest, wrestling with the nature of fate and prophecy, be it understanding their dreams (Amy Adams in Arrival), unearthing a secret past (Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049) or becoming ‘The One’ (Timothée Chalamet in Dune). In a genre primed for subversion, the legacy of their journey always has a consequential price. If there were complaints that Part One felt like an immersive indulgence of a three-course dinner but leaving with only “half the meal”, then splitting Herbert’s book into two films now feels justified (a luxury David Lynch did not receive when making the 1984 cult classic). With such extensive mythological material to cover, the sequel script – written by Villeneuve and ​​Jon Spaihts – allows for Part Two to hit the ground running knowing the first film did the heavy lifting to set the stage. Picking up where we left off on Arrakis, the house of Atreides (including Oscar Isaacs’ Duke Leto) has been wiped out after the massacre at Arrakeen and Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) take refuge amongst the Fremen clan led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). With Jessica assuming her new role as Reverend Mother, Paul trains and learns the ways of the Fremen, seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. On a technical level, Dune continues to push the envelope with its awe-inspiring scale and production design for the IMAX format. Greig Fraser’s breathtaking cinematography delights in creating visual and poetic distinction with shadows, particularly on the monochrome world of Ghedi Prime – the Harkonnen homeworld. Joe Walker’s editing perfectly balances between action and dramatic tension, never allowing the film’s 2-hour and 46-minute runtime to feel its weight. The sound design is one-of-a-kind when a thumper can sound like the heartbeat of the sands, or the “voice” can hauntingly come from various speaker directions. The VFX is sublime, and Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer and his synth-based score (fewer bagpipes this time around) deliver the film’s soul. And it all culminates into some incredible action sequences – a particular highlight involves Paul riding the sandworm for the first time, and the audience is right there beside him in that immersion. But at the heart of Part Two is its compelling story. Villeneuve and Spaihts’ Arabic-infused script begins with a statement – “Power over spice is power over all”, continuing themes of oppression and subjugation. Villeneuve steeps his audience in the action from the get-go, showing guerilla tactics used by the Fremen to avoid detection in the sand (with an outstanding set-piece involving the Harkonnens ‘floating’ out of sandworm danger) to the bombing raids reminiscent of ‘The War on Terror’ campaign and the countless wars fought in history over natural resources.  Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) showcases the impact of demonising language when referring to the Fremen as “rats”. Even in one hilarious scene (showing the extent of colonialist belief), Chani – a native Fremen – looks upon Paul in disbelief when he questions the proper way to sandwalk. But where Dune: Part Two takes a shadowy turn is its look into religious fanaticism as a weapon to dominate over others. With the Fremen’s desire to see Arrakis become a “green paradise”, the Bene Gesserit’s socio-political and moral manipulation of the bloodline fulfils a greater role in Part Two. The power of faith presents a murky subversion of the ‘white saviour’ trope, with Paul positioned as a prophet leader. The real-world parallels of power and control are unmistakable here, further illustrating the relevancy of Herbert’s work in modern culture. What makes this film special is the career-defining performance of Chalamet. Figuratively and literally, there’s a significant weight placed upon Chalamet’s shoulders in leading a franchise and for the adventurous story Dune embarks on. In the first film – an intergalactic ‘coming of age’ film – it was Paul understanding his place in the world, duelling between being a dutiful son to his father and a destiny shaped before him beyond his control, thanks to his mother and Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother Mohiam. For its sequel, Paul’s conflict and inner turmoil in fulfilling the prophecy comes at odds with his assimilation into the Fremen culture (including taking on the ‘Muad’Dib’ title in his name). The beauty of Chalamet’s multilayered performance is his sincerity for the role. He’s still the ‘reluctant hero’, troubled by visions of a terrible future. But emotionally – as the film charts a path towards all-out war with Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and The Harkonnens – his arc is a full circle moment, with devastating consequences waiting to be unleashed. Not to be left out of the conversation, Zendaya is equally outstanding as co-lead. With more to do this time around, Chani is the beating heartbeat of Part Two with her fierce and commanding perspective that actively questions the nature of blind faith leadership amidst the Fremen’s path to freedom. Her alliance with Paul and subsequent love for him is the added complication that inevitably raises the stakes. The stacked cast featuring Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux and Josh Brolin does suffer from limited screen time, however, there are a few exceptions. Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan mirrors the book, introducing the film with a helpful recap of events. In addition, Rebecca Ferguson remains exceptional as she enacts the film’s scheming master plan, while Austin Butler delivers a superb menacing turn as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha. But it is Bardem’s Stilgar who steals the show, adding humour and levity as a resolute believer in Paul’s ultimate destiny. Dune: Part Two is a momentous, jaw-dropping and masterful achievement in cinema that stakes its claim to be the best film of 2024. We may have had to wait for its release due to the Writers’ and Actors’ strike, but it was worth the wait. Epics come once in a lifetime, especially of this scale, scope, vision and craft. If Denis and his creative team get the green light to adapt Dune: Messiah, we could be witnessing the next best sci-fi trilogy on our hands. "
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE," Originally scheduled for an October 2023 release, the strikes in Hollywood delayed the release of Dune: Part Two by over four months, pushing it out of the award season and among the first of 2024’s most highly anticipated blockbusters.  With a runtime of 2h 46h, there is a lot to take in terms of narrative in this sequel. While Dune: Part One feels like the audience dipping their toes into another world, the sequel is a deep plunge into Paul Atreides’ journey as the battle for Arrakis – the home of “spice” – continues. The film divides itself between Paul’s growing bond with the Fremen and warrior Chani (Zendaya); Lady Jessica’s growing belief in her son’s destiny as Lisan al’Gaib, a Messiah-like figure of the Fremen; and the Harkonnens’ ongoing battle to conquer Arrakis. In addition, the Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Pugh) along with the Bene Gesserit witches scheme towards their own goals. The increased number of character arcs opens the narrative to complications but given Dune itself is one of a six-novel series by Frank Herbert, the amount of development in Denis Villeneuve’s vision is elaborate to a tee to build a franchise that has already broken ground for modern sci-fi cinema. Spaiht and Villeneuve’s screenplay allows enough time to develop its characters to a reasonable point before branching out to another plot line. It may be a lot of roads but all the paths eventually come together to an immensely satisfying climactic sequence and a stunning sunlit fight between Paul and Baron Harkonnen’s sociopathic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Butler). The film momentarily lags due to Lady Jessica’s fervency in her new role as a “wild” Reverend Mother among the Fremen and Paul’s occasionally amusing struggles to fit in with the tribe yet these are minuscule blips of an incredibly big picture. Villeneuve is not afraid to take things to an unimaginable scale through his ambitious but exemplary direction, as well as Grieg Fraser’s tight cinematography. They both bring an understanding of scale and depth to Herbert’s vision, especially when it comes to different atmospheres, to visualise a believable yet breathtaking world that – combined with Hans Zimmer’s score and reverberating bass – offers an extrasensory cinematic experience. Whether it is capturing the vast and endless emptiness of the desert, the triumph of luring and riding a gigantic sandworm or conveying the Harkonnen’s home planet of Giedi Prime in bleak monochrome, Dune: Part Two is a feast for the eyes and an assault on the ears. Chalamet balances determination and vulnerability as his spice-infused dreams conflict with the role that he feels he must assume. Ferguson and Zendaya have meatier roles that battle for Paul’s conscience while Barden’s fervently devout Stilgar brings an unexpected source of comedy. The newer cast members, however, are a mixed bag – Austin Butler’s unsettling performance as Feyd-Rautha provides a formidable enemy for Paul yet Lea Séydoux’s Lady Margot performance feels fleeting. Meanwhile, Florence Pugh comes across as underused yet makes a quiet impact as the most diplomatic (and well-dressed) character among the ensemble as Princess Irulan. At a runtime of nearly three hours, Dune: Part Two is an intense and lengthy sci-fi instalment that solidifies what can become an impressive and influential film series. With five more novels to adapt, audiences will have to wait to see whether Villeneuve will continue his adaptation of Herbert’s saga. But for now, Dune: Part Two‘s jaw-dropping epicness is enough to satisfy one’s appetite for spice, cementing itself as one of the best sci-fi sequels of this century."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Sci-Fi fans rejoice&#44; DUNE PART 2 is truly remarkable&#33; Denis Villeneuve achieves perfection in this immersive cinematic experience&#44; which includes Zimmer&apos;s masterful score and Fraser&apos;s best work yet&#46; This is a genuine sci-fi masterpiece&#33; &#10;
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," Star Wars has been described as Frank Herbertâs Dune with the sharper edges sanded off. When Denis Villeneuve began adapting the epic of space empires and politicized mysticism in 2021âs Dune, he kept all those dangerous angles and challenging elements in place, creating a complicated mythology interspersed with battle scenes that were more stomach-churning than exciting. He even had the audacity to leave the story on a cliffhanger, with Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Ferguson), seeking shelter among the indigenous Fremen of the desert world of Arrakis after his father and their entire noble household had been butchered by the monstrous House Harkonnen.
 
Villeneuve is equally unapologetic with the opening to Dune: Part Two, which leaps straight into Paulâs guerrilla war against the Harkonnens. It is increasingly clear that the rubber-clad barbarians are only the catâs paws of the aging and disconnected emperor (a perfectly brittle Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Pugh). Yet Irulan is also part of the Bene Gesserit, the mystical and manipulative order that has its own agenda for humanity, scattered as it is across the stars and connected only by the power of the spice harvested on Arrakis. Plans within plans, as one character notes, and schemes within schemes are what really define Dune: Part Two.
 
Fortunately, Herbert provided Villeneuve with some of science fictionâs most despicable villains in House Harkonnen, with the returning Baron Vladimir (SkarsgÃ¥rd) and the Beast Rabban (Bautista) joined by Feyd-Rautha, a true monster played with sociopathic glee by Austin Butler. As Paul grows, so he requires more menacing adversaries, and a pallid and shaved Butler presents him with exactly the ghoul to make even that jihad seem like the better option. Not good. Just â¦ better.
 
Yet this isnât just about Paulâs growth. Dune: Part Two is really about Chalametâs growth. His boyish good looks havenât exactly hurt his career to date, and he was more than plausible as a budding young action hero in the first film. Yet his Bumble-friendly charisma might not have parlayed into what Paul must become: a guerrilla, a messiah, an ambitious and cunning political operative, a vengeance-fueled son of privilege, and an ideologue. In his most intriguing performance to date, Chalamet finds a new metaphor within Herbertâs work, steering the ancient schemes within which he is caught up the same as how he rides the giant sandworms that dominate Arrakis. Neither can be stopped, but both can be manipulated to the riderâs preferred direction. The underlying question is not whether Paul wins or loses: Itâs about whether he remains a hero or becomes the morally murky protagonist.
 
Dune: Part Two is both horrifying and romantic, presenting a far, far future that is recognizable because people never change. While the war may be portrayed as a jaw-dropping spectacle, the answers to all those political and moral questions may leave the audience deeply uncomfortable. Herbert would be proud.

"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," Thankfully, there is zero chance whatsoever of Dune: Part Two tumbling out of our memories and ending up at the bottom of the bargain bin. It is a healthy antidote to the widespread jadedness of contemporary blockbusters – a film that reinstates the marvel of the epic on the big screen. Its story is sharp. Its struggles are reflective of the modern age. Its writing is precise. Its aesthetic is idiosyncratic. Its score is stirring. Its performances inflict the full gamut of human emotion. Of course, making a memorable film in any genre is never easy. But making all the small parts click together gets even trickier in the sci-fi realm, where one crack in the structure can bring the whole edifice down and cause it all to blur together in one's mind into a cliched slurry. This stunning sequel accomplishes it with a deft touch. What separates an unforgettable sci-fi epic from a lacklustre one is how seamlessly all its disparate layers come together – how holistic the world-building seems in the end. Complicated worlds work best when they feel simple. With films that are adapted from doorstopper bestsellers, and with source material as dense as Dune’s, the challenge of cohesion often proves insurmountable. It makes sense, then, why the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert had become something of a white whale among filmmakers. Alejandro Jodorowsky had an unsuccessful attempt at adapting the work, and David Lynch would go on to distance himself from his own 1984 interpretation. For a long while, it seemed that Arrakis was impossible to render faithfully on screen. Then in 2021, Denis Villeneuve released Dune. In a cinema culture saturated with grandeur, it is understandable that we’ve become somewhat jaded by blockbusters. Between the constant barrage of films and series tackling superheroes, the fantastical and the dystopic, we have become an audience that is inured to spectacle. Villeneuve’s first Dune film somehow managed to not only do its source material justice but stood as its own as a cinematic masterpiece. Between sprawling, desert scenes honed by refracting light and fog, to the glum-lit and tense instances that feature the Harkonnen, the film was confident in its visual juxtapositions and aesthetics. Its stellar cast, which featured Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Dave Bautista and Javier Bardem, also delivered top-notch performances, and for many of them the portrayals would be career-defining. The film marked Hans Zimmer’s best score in years, with otherworldly orchestral and vocal compositions that stir as they border on the eerie, and won six Oscars. However, as much as Dune met acclaim in awards season, there was ambivalence on how to view the film. It was, after all, not a complete film in itself, and seemed more like an introduction to the world of Dune than a fully fledged story. Those who hadn't read the original material also seemed suspicious of the white saviour trope that seemed to direct the film. Dune: Part Two picks up where the first film trailed off, in both style and substance. The film starts with Paul Atreides (Chalamet) as he begins rallying the Fremen to retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens, who launched a bloody assault against the Atreides House for the planet’s control. While the first film set firm the foundations for a geo-political scuffle, the second dives deep into these tensions, ramping up the pressure in all kinds of unexpected ways. Dune: Part Two is a delectable pay-off to the drama that was burrowed in the foundations of the saga. Another thing that makes this instalment engrossing is the heterogeneity and individual quality of its characters. No faction or house is uniform in ideology; the Fremen are divided in how they respond to the prophecies proliferated on the planet by the mysterious sisterhood called the Bene Gesserit, which points to Paul being the chosen one, or Lisan al Gaib. The Harkonnens as well as the Bene Gesserit have their own power struggles to contend with. Emperor Shaddam’s intergalactic rule, meanwhile, hangs in the balance, and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) tries to find her own path to leadership while accounting for her father's oversights. The film also brings several star players to the fold, from Christopher Walken, who portrays the emperor, to a surprise role by Anya Taylor-Joy, plus Austin Butler, who takes on the role of Feyd-Rautha, the Harkonnen foil to Chalamet’s character. Zendaya also is propelled to the forefront, playing Chani with a performance that is rife with complexity. The dynamic between Chani and Paul, meanwhile, takes on the expected romantic turn before upending expectations with a tense climactic scene. The second film sets the stage for Paul’s continuing transformation as a leader, and even if you’ve read the book and know how the character eventually shapes up, it is a pleasure watching Chalamet struggle in the throes of destiny, prophesy and choice. Overall, Dune: Part Two sustains and even elevates the aesthetics that made the first film great, proving its predecessor was an achievement in its own right. It is one of those films that reminds a person of their first experience at the cinema. To me, it brings up memories of first watching Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, braving into the cinema with a forged passport copy that pretended I was old enough to watch the film. It is the cinematic epic of this generation. When its time in the awards season comes, it won’t be surprising if Dune: Part Two collects its fair share of statuettes. The film has the makings of a contemporary classic, with the only downside being that we’ll have to wait another few years to see how tensions unfold."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," Even better than the first film, the stakes are exponentially higher, the power struggles even more mythic, the on-screen world-building richer and more exotically filigreed, and the visuals even more dazzling. I didn’t think this was possible. You don’t need to be a studio head or a theater owner to realize that everyone in Hollywood has their fingers crossed for Dune: Part Two. Sure, the Oscars are right around the corner, and there are certainly plenty of great films from last year that are worth celebrating, but so far 2024 has been an absolute shit show at the box office. Business had been bad and the product has been even worse. Granted, we’re only three weeks into February, so the sample size is small, but you know things are rough in Tinseltown when trash like Argylle opens at No. 1 and the latest Marvel-affiliated widget off the production line currently sits on Rotten Tomatoes beside a fat green splat and a woeful 13% favorable rating.  What does any of this have to do with Dune: Part Two, you may ask. Well, director Denis Villeneuve’s hotly anticipated follow-up to his blissfully weird 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s talismanic 1968 novel was originally slated to open last November. But because of the actors strike, Warner Bros. opted to push the film to March 2024, no doubt so that Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and newcomers Florence Pugh and Austin Butler could peacock on the red carpet and promote it to the heavens on the late-night talk show circuit. Of course, sci-fi fans bitched and bellyached, as they do. But in retrospect the delay turned out to be a pretty wise move. After all, back in November, all anyone was talking about was Barbenheimer and Bradley Cooper’s fake schnozz. There wasn’t a lot of oxygen left in the room. But now? Now the stage couldn’t be better set for the further adventures of Paul Atreides. If the movies ever needed a savior, it’s right this second.  Glancing back at my review of the first Dune on this site back in 2021, I noticed that I called it “the best sci-fi movie of the decade.” Hyperbole? Not really. Remember, the decade wasn’t all that old yet. And to be honest, heading in to the new sequel, I stood by it. But walking out was a different story. Because Dune: Part Two is even better than the first film. The stakes somehow feel exponentially higher, the power struggles are even more mythic and Shakespearean, the onscreen world-building is richer and more exotically filigreed, and the visuals are even more epic and dazzling—something I didn’t think was possible. Dune: Part Two isn’t just an embarrassment of narrative and retinal riches; it’s the sort of big-canvas franchise storytelling we haven’t see since The Lord of the Rings came to a close back at the shire.  For those who have been tracking the fits and starts of the Dune franchise online, I don’t think I’m giving away anything by saying that Dune: Part Two is a middle chapter in the franchise. Yes, like the first film, it ends on a cliffhanger. But this time around, it feels like a steeper and more rewarding cliff. And, unlike most middle chapters of a trilogy, this doesn’t feel like a jerry-rigged bridge connecting two more interesting stories. In fact, a who’s who of welcome new faces arrive on the scene to add layers the first installment only hinted at. As the Emperor, Walken dials down his worst mannered tendencies to simultaneously convey a heavy-is-the-head-that-wears-the-crown world-weariness and a craven sense of realpolitik expediency. The Emperor is old enough to have seen how these power struggles play out and he knows that his time on the throne is finite, but at the end of the day loyalty is only as valuable as it is useful.  While other new additions include Léa Seydoux and Anya Taylor-Joy (no spoilers here), Dune: Part Two is, at its heart, a hero’s journey. And as original as Dune may be, its arc is straight out of Joseph Campbell. Which bring us to Chalamet’s Paul Atreides. As excellent and against-type as the actor was in the first Dune, his character’s evolution couldn’t really skirt the fact that he had to start off a little bit whiny and petulant, not unlike Luke Skywalker in A New Hope. But now that he’s made the leap to battle-tested hero, Chalamet really lets it fly, summoning a more interesting performance. Torn between avenging his slain father and fulfilling the messianic destiny that many of the Fremen (including Bardem’s Stilgar) want from him, Paul takes on an interesting new complexity that brings to mind Willem Dafoe’s fallible, self-doubting Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ, right down to his push-pull romantic connection with Zendaya’s Chani. Ferguson, meanwhile, is allowed to let her witchy side loose even more this time around. Her Lady Jessica is now pregnant, and she not only speaks with the baby daughter growing inside of her, she uses the unborn as a pawn to manipulate Paul’s next move. It’s a deliciously freaky puppet-master performance that manages to draw you in and creep you out.  Still, if Villeneuve’s film was just a gallery of characters fighting for power, warring over spice, and spouting metaphorical mumbo jumbo, it wouldn’t be half the movie it is (although it would still be pretty great). No, the director knows that we’ve paid to go on a ride. A deep, philosophical ride to be sure, but still a ride. And Dune: Part Two never forgets that it’s first and foremost a shock-and-awe eye-candy blockbuster. In an era when we go to the movies only to be bombarded over and over again with the same tired visual tropes and clichés, Villeneuve delivers enthralling, shoot-the-works set pieces that feel like high-wire acts of visual poetry and boundless originality. Witnessing Paul learn how to ride a giant sandworm like a rodeo cowboy waterskiing on a high-speed bullet train is as breathlessly thrilling as watching Charlton Heston racing a chariot in Ben-Hur.  Like its predecessor dialed up to eleven, Dune: Part Two is a spectacle that you feel with your head and your heart, but it also never lets your eyes take a break for a minute. It’s a film of grandeur that asks a lot of its audience and rewards us for going on its journey. My advice is don’t just see it, see it on as big a screen as you possibly can and just soak it up. Because Villeneuve shows us the magic of movies—a brand of magic that’s all too often invoked, but all too rarely felt these days. He’s given us nothing less than beautiful and bizarre sci-fi masterpiece bursting with big ideas and even bigger visual wonders. "
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," The success of Dune: Part One in 2021 can be, at least in part, attributed to the fact that a sequel was, more likely than not, imminent. Unlike David Lynch’s attempt in 1984 to adapt the unadaptable, French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve was given the not-so-secret key to the puzzle: time. By stretching Frank Herbert’s ""unfilmable"" landmark science-fiction novel across two 160-minute films, Villeneuve was able to establish the various worlds of Dune, the different royal houses and their dynamics, and the varying cultures and their histories before diving into the thick of it. As a result, Part One ended on a wanting note, like having the prologue to a novel without the rest of the book to read.  With Part Two, the real fun of Dune begins. The movie picks up right after the events of Part One, as Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), ingratiate themselves with the ways of the Fremen people. As Paul slowly wins the trust of the Fremen, Stilgar (Javier Bardem) becomes convinced that Paul is the messiah as written in the prophecy. The focus of Paul's messiah status is divided between those who believe and those who consider the prophecy to be propoganda to control the Fremen people, with Stilgar falling in the former camp and Chani (Zendaya) in the latter. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts do well to update Paul's storyline, giving consideration to colonization and saviour themes rather than the more commonplace class warfare discourse. Part Two goes deeper into the House of Harkonnen with another of the Baron's (Stellan Skarsgård) nephews introduced when Dave Bautista's Glossu Rabban fails at securing the north of Arrakis. As the sociopathic other nephew, Feyd-Rautha, Austin Butler excels. By lending the character just the right amount of cleverness and menace, Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings an unsettling yet contained chaos to the film. Along with Butler, the new generation of Hollywood is well represented. Chalamet continues his run as heir to the prestige-leading-man throne with a dynamic performance as a young man growing into a leader. From Part One to Two, Chalamet gently transforms Paul and presents his inner conflict as a reluctant messiah carefully and thoughtfully. And although Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan plays a small role in this film, Pugh's gravitas hints towards her character's importance if/when a Part Three gets the greenlight. The efforts of Villeneuve and casting director Francine Maisler in selecting the younger actors needs to be acknowledged. While the likes of Chalamet, Zendaya, Pugh, Butler and Anya Taylor-Joy may seem like obvious choices given their popularity among both Gen Z and older audiences, by grouping these performers together, we get a glimpse of who will most likely be dominating the best Hollywood has to offer in coming years. As they continue to develop as actors, Dune: Part Two will be remembered as the time when lightning struck and, somehow, all of them graced the same screen all at once. Shot entirely using IMAX cameras (and for the record, IMAX truly is by far the best way to watch this film), the immense scope of Part Two utilizes the format perfectly. Villeneuve and director of photography Greig Fraser use the vast aspect ratio to capture the grandeur of Arrakis's desert landscape and the House of Harkonnen's population on Giedi Prime. It isn't only the expanse of the visuals that impresses — it's Villeneuve and Fraser's use of relative sizes that creates an awe-inspiring effect. By placing a person in front of machinery that could be described as a tank, the actual size of the armoured vehicle becomes apparent — something not of our world, something far more powerful than we can comprehend. Many Canadian cinephiles continue to associate Villeneuve with his earlier homegrown work like Polytechnique, Maelström and, of course, Incendies — films that placed priority on narrative above visuals or scale. Since joining Hollywood's golden circle after 2013's Prisoners, Villeneuve has deservedly commanded higher budgets, allowing him to achieve feats in filmmaking simply not possible within the Canadian industry. However, rather impressively, in spite of the financial abundance before him, Villeneuve has continued to find the heart in each of his films. This characteristic of Villeneuve becomes all the more remarkable in the face of something like Dune. We've seen other space operas (that borrowed much from Herbert's classic) lose their way amidst the lure of CGI; but with Villeneuve, his north compass steadily maintains its position, facing toward Paul's turmoil, Jessica's ambition, Chani's integrity, Gurney's honour and Stilgar's faith. In a film that could have rested on being a visual masterpiece, Villeneuve stays true to the humanity of his direction."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune&#58; Part Two surpasses even the highest expectations&#44; establishing itself as an unquestionable technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking&#46;
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," Frank Herbert's Dune has a long legacy of filmmakers attempting to do justice to his novel. Whether it be a failed take on the material from Alejandro Jodorowsky in the '70s, David Lynch in a 1984 film, or a 2003 miniseries, no one could quite crack the code to make a definitive translation of the material to balance the dense and layered themes Herbert delivered while also making for an accessible and easily digestible experience. Denis Villeneuve largely accomplished the impossible with his 2021 Dune, as he avoided the standard tropes of the sci-fi genre and honored the complexity of the source material, to the point of splitting the narrative into two films. With Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve continues to circumvent expectations and, while there was the opportunity to offer up more bombast than the debut film, instead focuses on the tragic elements of Paul Atreides, serving instead as a cautionary tale of anyone deeming themselves to be a messiah. Picking off almost immediately after the events of Dune, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have collided with a group of Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), after the Harkonnen have attacked and seemingly eradicated all of House Atreides. Paul and Jessica are both integrated into the Fremen community, based on prophecies and visions the Arrakis natives have, all while Paul and Chani (Zendaya) grow closer to one another, despite Chani's apprehension about Paul's furthering beliefs that he could be a messiah that will bring peace to the universe as the Fremen's ""Muad'Dib."" Elsewhere in the universe, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) aims to extend his power, enlisting his nephew Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) to call the shots on Arrakis. However, reports of the rebellious Muad'Dib have reached Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), as they grow nervous of what this figure could mean for the empire. With his first Dune, Villeneuve offered a much more ethereal take on the worlds of Herbert's novel than seen in previous takes on the material, which allowed him to further establish himself as a visionary in the sci-fi realm in the wake of projects like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049. Part Two is just as gorgeous and captivating as the debut film, though what holds it back in the realm of spectacle is that audiences are continuing to spend time on worlds we've already been introduced to, so there isn't much that takes us by surprise. While sequences of Paul taming the sandworms, known as Shai-Hulud, or attacks on spice miners are intense and adrenaline-pumping, they don't entirely surpass what the filmmaker accomplished in the debut film. The exception to this in Part Two, though, are the sequences on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime, which are filmed in a contrasting monochrome that makes for a striking gladiatorial scene that showcases the ruthlessness of Feyd-Rautha. Additionally, while a siege sequence in the final act of the film would have likely been expanded to create epic scenes of intergalactic combat under the direction of other filmmakers, Villeneuve keeps this sequence efficient and restrained, never showcasing warfare just for the sake of injecting action. While the visuals of the film might not surpass the accomplishments of the first, the character development of figures both new and old are far more rich. Many audiences who were unaware of Chani's role in the story were disappointed she earned so little screentime in the first Dune will be delighted to see her become arguably the most important character in Part Two's story. Zendaya continues to showcase why she's one of the most in-demand performers of her generation, while Chalamet delivers equal parts charm, vulnerability, and megalomania as Paul. Ferguson is also a standout in the picture, as she weaves an intricate tapestry of a figure who cares for her child yet always has the goals of the Bene Gesserit (a witch-like group who aims to control the events of the universe) in mind. Skarsgård is just as detestable as he was in the first film, but it's his on-screen nephew that will both excite and frighten viewers, as Butler has entirely disappeared into the treacherous role of Feyd-Rautha. Only a year after viewers witnessed his career-defining performance in Elvis, Butler is entirely unrecognizable as the warrior, making for a stark contrast to how Pugh brings the worrying Irulan to life, as she seems to be the only one who puts the fate of the universe ahead of her own wants and desires. Where Villeneuve and his cowriter Jon Spaihts must really be commended is how, despite Paul being known as an iconic sci-fi hero, the pair make it quite clear that he's not necessarily a character to envy. He's undeniably powerful, charismatic, and driven by revenge against those who killed his father, but he also buys too much into what he's being fed by his sycophants, whether they be the Fremen or his mother. Paul will stop at nothing to achieve his goals and this film proves that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and it's up to the viewer to determine whether the ends justify the means.  Speaking of endings, Villeneuve has already expressed how he aims to also adapt Herbert's next novel in the series, Dune Messiah, into a film, though it has yet to be officially greenlit by Warner Bros. The ending of Dune: Part Two might not feel quite like the implied ""To be continued..."" that the first film ended on, so this resolution is a bit more satisfying than its predecessor, but the implications of the final act of the film are sure to frustrate viewers. For better or worse, there's even a piece of dialogue that harkens back to Aragorn's line, ""Let's hunt some Orc,"" in the final scenes of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but knowing that the Tolkien film had a sequel on the way, audiences accepted it a bit more easily. While it seems likely that Villeneuve will get to make Messiah in the relatively near future, the nature of the source material and the director's authentic adaptation of it means we can't count on getting that entirely satisfying ending quite yet. Herbert's Dune is not only a thrilling journey in its own right, but it also serves as an allegory exploring themes of colonialism, fanaticism, religion, imperialism, and the exploitation of natural resources. These aren't entirely crowd-pleasing ideas, and Villeneuve largely accomplishes honoring those themes while also making for an engaging sci-fi epic. It doesn't quite feel as awe-inspiring as the debut film, but this will ultimately work in the favor of the story, as we aren't given arbitrarily inflated elements that would have fit within the blockbuster-oriented sensibilities of franchise filmmaking seen in so many other series. Still, the fact that such an inaccessible tome could be brought to life without having to sacrifice either the character complexities or depressing allegories found within the source material makes the two-film journey a triumph in its own right, and we can't wait to see where Messiah will take us."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve delivers a visual spectacle in DUNE: PART TWO. The sequel is slower paced than the first installment with the director taking time for Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) to prove himself the messiah to the Freman. The standout is Austin Butler’s turn as the creepy warrior Feyd-Rautha. PART TWO picks up where the first film left off. Paul and Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are taken in by the Freman after his father was betrayed by the Emperor. Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes Paul is the Muad'Dib prophesied by his people. Chani (Zendaya) doesn’t believe in the prophecy or a savior. The Fremen are split as well. Paul spends the majority of the film proving himself worthy of the Freman’s messiah title. Chani is reluctant to believe he’s a savior even as she falls in love with him. In between the action on Arrakis, the Baron and his nephew are plotting against the Fremen. Here we meet Feyd-Rautha played by Butler in a game-changing performance for the actor. After Butler’s amazing performance as Elvis Presley, he follows it up with an impressive and creepy villain. There’s no doubt he’s a star on the rise. Once again, Chalamet is a captivating Paul Atreides. The actor brings mischief and innocence to the character. When Paul transitions from the young prince to a leader, Chalamet’s eyes make the transition from an empathic Paul to a cold and calculating ruler. It’s quite stark. While there is action littered throughout, the pacing halts a few times with what seems like redundant scenes. For example, we meet a couple of different groups among the Fremen, doubting Paul’s destiny. For a two-hour and 45-minute movie, scenes could’ve been combined which is often done in adaptations. One can argue the Director is sticking to the events in the Frank Herbert novel but for a cinematic experience, it feels repetitive and slows down the pacing especially when the finale feels rushed. Paul’s transition wasn’t given much screen time as it occurs in the last 15 minutes of the movie. The final moments in the film feel rushed as Paul enters the transition from prince to ruler. No doubt Denis Villeneuve is saving Paul's ascension into full power for the third installment, DUNE MESSIAH but it certainly leaves the audience salivating for more. However, that wait is looking like a few years in the future telling Collider that he will be ""taking his time"" with the follow-up, and will most likely work on another film in between. The score is big and ominous while the visual effects engulf you in the world of Arrakis as does the production design of the sets. "
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Villenueve has put forth considerable effort to mitigate potential issues with the novel&apos;s &apos;white savior&apos; material&#44; but in the end&#44; has made a movie that is entirely too rad and &apos;dudes rock&apos; for those efforts to matter or be particularly effective&#46;
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE," Denis Villeneuve’s lifelong dream of bringing Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 novel Dune to the big screen has become a wonderous reality, in the stunning sequel Dune: Part Two, which hits theaters on March 1. Dune Part Two picks right up where the 2021 film left off with Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and Rebecca Ferguson as his mysterious mother Lady Jessica, now embedded with the Fremen of the barren planet Arrakis, both of them delivering incredible performances, which are enough to distract from the at-times overly-compressed bulky story at the core of the proceedings. The plot here is as thick as the stunning special effects. A devious galactic emperor (Christopher Walken) and daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) have a convoluted plot to continue their dominance over the trade of “Spice,” the material that makes intergalactic travel possible in this distant future, and which exists in abundance in the otherwise barren planet Arrakis. The plot involves exiling Paul and his family to the planet, where they are to succumb at the hands of the invading House of Harkonnen, led by the grotesque Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgard), his brutish nephew Glossu (Dave Bautista), and his other, much creepier nephew Feyd (Austin Butler). Paul’s mother Jessica has an agenda of her own, as a member of the mysterious and religiously clad Bene Gesserit, a clan led by the Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling), who, through eugenics, has plans to create a female super warrior that will supposedly bring the universe into a brighter future. At the center of this is the planet Arrakis, where terrifying creatures called “Sandworms” roam the vast deserts, and the Fremen pride themselves in conquering and riding them, empowered by the desert’s life and the blue eyes that Spice generates in them. These native peoples include cultish leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Paul’s love interest Chani (Zendaya), fierce warriors who show Paul the ways of the desert. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that it is Paul unwittingly at the center of it all, with his constant visions of the future, and the persistent implications that he is both the messiah that his mother Jessica disobediently created to fulfill the Bene Gesserit ambitions, as well as centuries-old prophetic tales passed along by the Fremen and their ideologically-committed members. The only weak link in the masterful Dune Part Two is the huge leaps that the script takes at times, going from one scene to the next without always the most narrative precision. This is understandable, of course, given the bulky and convoluted source material, but it at times results in jarring tonal shifts by the characters and the film itself. Beyond that perhaps inevitable peccadillo exists a cinematic world of stunning beauty and perfection. Fans of the craft of filmmaking must watch Villeneuve’s technical masterpiece, as the French-Canadian filmmaker reunites with his collaborators, whom netted six total Oscars three years ago, including Composer Hans Zimmer, Cinematographer Greig Fraser, and Visual Effects Supervisor Paul Lambert. Villeneuve regales in the craft of filmmaking and lets his talented crew shine and work in unison, like a perfectly-constructed ecosystem. Zimmer’s score announces itself the loudest but also the most different from the original, making it seem as if the series is entirely new. Sweeping takes and beautifully golden landscapes, at times suffused with the violent winds of sandstorms, are the next best element of this below the line cornucopia of talent. Watch this film in the biggest, loudest screen possible—you will be transfixed, and may even not necessarily notice when the plot lurches violently forward. The costumes are lavish, the makeup on the Harkonnen and Fremen characters is subtle but evocative, the visual effects are entirely seamless. This is, quite simply, the best visual film that you are likely to see in this still young 2024. But Dune Part Two is not just about the below-the-line talent. Underneath the bulky techs exists a complex world, crafted of course by the novels that created it, that speaks to dark and confusing aspects of our shared humanity. While the first film was about a more pedestrian trade war and fight over resources – a topic that, to be sure, resonates in a world running out of water and other materials – this one is about something more fundamental: extremism and all the forms that it takes, or the follies it engenders. As monstrous and misshapen as the Baron and his acolytes are, the dark undertones that slowly rise from within Paul himself and his new followers is no less chilling and even terrifying. Lady Jessica is, to be sure, ruthlessly ambitious, Lady Macbeth style, but the damage she unleashes is unquestionably broader. Questions of messianic complexes, saviors, prophecies, and the inevitability of human destruction are all interspersed in this intergalactic, intergenerational battle. Paul is kind and for the most part resists the fate he has foreseen for himself and for his beloved Chani, until powerful forces intercede. The complexity with which Chalamet and Ferguson play these two captivating characters cannot be overstated, even if some of the less experienced actors in their group overplay their hand. Dune Part Two ultimately does not answer any of the transcendental questions it poses or resolve the conflicts it targets. While the plotline of the first film is mostly resolved, another, far vaster one is just beginning. There were, after all, eight novels in Herbert’s anthology, and these first films only cover the first one. Villeneuve—and surely the studio—have big dreams for this franchise, and we are all lucky that they have indulged them. Nothing is left to chance, and the wonderfully imaginative world is brought to palpable relief. All that is left is to hope that audiences see the brilliance, too, so that it may be worth the studio’s while to continue to do so. Talent: A

"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," In 2021 I walked into a theater completely unfamiliar with Dune. As a horror fan, I’d dismissed Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel and David Lynch’s 1984 adaptation as a story about giant worms and spent years making unflattering comparisons to the 1990 monster masterpiece Tremors. I bought a ticket to Denis Villeneuve’s new adaptation because it was the next big movie to see and entered the theater knowing nothing about the story. I found myself entranced by the gorgeous yet deadly landscapes, the otherworldly styling, and the touching family drama playing out through the fall of House Atreides. I still haven’t finished the book, but I went into Dune: Part Two ready to be wowed. To say I was pleased would be an understatement. Villeneuve’s second chapter tops it’s fantastic predecessor in every possible way with exquisite set pieces, gorgeous visual design, astounding action, and a stunning cast. Simply put, Dune: Part Two is a tremendous achievement in filmmaking and a sci-fi sequel for the ages. Villeneuve picks up the story immediately after the ending of Dune. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has just killed in battle for the first time and found temporary acceptance with the Fremen of Arrakis. Viewed as both threats and potential saviors, he and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) navigate the tricky social structure of the sun-scorched planet. Meanwhile, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) deals with the fallout from her father’s choice to wipe out House Atreides. Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) struggles for absolute control over spice production while a new villain emerges from his murderous family tree. As tensions rise, Paul gains status as a Fedaykin and falls in love with fellow warrior Chani (Zendaya) while attempting to distance himself from the prophecy now guiding his life. Lady Jessica unfortunately takes the opposite approach. With Paul’s sister now growing inside her, she travels to the fundamentalist south of the planet hoping to stoke the fires of religious frenzy.  By contrast, Dune feels like a table setting for this intricately plotted film. Characters put in place in the exciting opening chapter now begin to live out their destinies and jockey for position in this turbulent world. I can’t speak to faithfulness to Herbert’s celebrated novel, but this complicated plot is well-paced and expository while remaining accessible for newcomers to the saga. Each move makes sense and mostly follows well-established characterization, allowing the story to progress at a breakneck pace without overwhelming the audience. Some quieter elements of the plot like the deadly Water of Life and the Bene Gesserit’s levers of control feel occasionally murky, but Villeneuve does his best to present this complex plot as a coherent thread. We feel the weight of these shocking moments even if newbies to the story don’t totally understand how we got here.  Chalemet leads this exceptional cast in a nuanced performance that pulls us along his dark hero’s journey. Beginning as the naive young Duke, he slowly evolves from reluctant leader and grieving son to gallant young lover and war hero before fulfilling the prophecy as a stone-hearted commander. Chani proves to be our conduit for this transition in a heartbreaking performance that feels simultaneously steely and sorrowful. Zendaya navigates a cavalcade of conflicting emotions as she rides with Paul on this treacherous journey. It’s through her eyes that we see how far he’s come and everything he’s giving up on his quest for revenge. Javier Bardem adds humor and heart as the aging warrior and surrogate father Sturgil. A southern fanatic at heart, Bardem flexes his comedic muscles as the full breadth of this character’s charming persona shines through. If Chani is a conduit for the audience, Sturgil serves as a representative of his people. We watch him make questionable leaps of faith as the prophecy he was born with takes shape before his eyes. Moments of humor lean into disquieting dread as Paul’s visions remind us that religious devotion can also lead to danger and destruction.  Villeneuve expands the world with additional cast members reeling from disruption to the universe’s fragile economy. Christopher Walken sets a dissociated tone as the aging and ineffectual Emperor led astray by a duplicitous advisor. Charlotte Rampling returns as the sinister Reverend Mother Mohiam whispering in his ear. Skarsgård and Dave Bautista also reprise their roles as the villainous Harkonnens struggling to capitalize on the devastating blow they’ve just dealt to House Atreides. Florence Pugh and Anya Taylor-Joy prove to be flashy additions to the cast, but they’re not given much to do at this point in Herbert’s story. Perhaps as intended, their inclusion only serves to make us eagerly anticipate Villeneuve’s next installment.  Dune gave us a deplorable villain with the glutinous Baron Harkonnen and the irrational Beast Rabban (Bautista), but Dune: Part Two delivers even more terrifying monsters. Austin Butler steals the Harkonnen show as the psychotic young Feyd-Rautha, next in line to inherit the valuable planet. In a mostly physical performance, he manages to convey intense malevolence and dangerous unpredictability with a simple tilt of his head and flick of his tongue. He is a force to be reckoned with and a new challenger for Paul’s precarious position. Butler remains the flashier villain, but Rebecca Furgeson proves to be the film’s horrific star. Seamlessly transitioning from conscientious mother to cunning priestess, she wanders through the film continuously plotting with her pregnant belly. The mere flick of her eyes is enough to show not only dangerous instability, but the frightening calculations behind the power she’s amassing.  Villeneuve builds upon the gorgeous visual style he established in his opening chapter, dazzling us with exciting revelations and lush new worlds. Not only do we blast through sparkling sand as Paul rides his first sandworm, we follow the Fremen army as they begin to disrupt spice production one harvesting crew at a time. Each sequence is more spectacular than the next from gliding assassins to Fedaykin fighters bursting from concealment underfoot. The firepower is intense and set pieces deliver a breathtaking level of artistry without losing track of the complex story. The heat and shimmering sand of Arrakis are mesmerizing and fall in sharp contrast to the stark, black and white visuals of the Harkonnen realm. The film’s most stunning sequence (an incredibly high bar) is an arena battle in which Feyd-Rautha proves his mettle in a high-stakes exhibition match before a roaring crowd. Contrasting with the sun-scorched world of Arrakis, this introduction feels like a modern nightmare with sharp black angles, sinister faces, and danger lurking around every corner. "

The film is just big in every way- with a loud, loud score from Hans Zimmer and some massive action setpieces. Even the sandworms are huge (although there are small ones too!) I recommend as highly as possible seeing this film in IMAX, Dolby, or another large format- and also giving the first one a rewatch before you go (it’s on both Netflix and Max.) Dune is a notoriously complex story, with a huge number of characters and massive amounts of exposition and lore, and my biggest fear going into the 2021 film was that, as a non-reader of Herbert’s books, I wouldn’t be able to follow it. But the second film manages to keep the storytelling relatively straight and find a human element within all the dense mythology.  As with the entire Dune saga, the new film is mostly set on the desert planet of Arrakis where, in the first film, the galaxy’s colonial power has placed House Atreides in charge of the resource-rich planet, displacing the long-ruling Harkonnen dynasty. But as revealed in the first film, it’s all part of a plot by the emperor to destroy the Atreides family. By the end of the first film, they have mostly been wiped out, except for young messiah figure Paul (Timothée Chalamet), and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a powerful figure of the religious order known as Bene Gesserit. I know this all sounds very dense, as well as nonsensical if you don’t know the backstory.  And that’s just the first movie. But credit is due to Villeneuve and his co-writer,  Jon Spaihts, for telling the story in a way that is easy to follow, not to mention exciting.  As the second movie begins, Paul and Lady Jessica have aligned with the planet’s indigenous people, known as the Fremen, who include the warrior (and Paul’s love interest) Chani, played by Zendaya.  The film largely focuses on battles, with the Atreides/Fremen alliance on one side and the Harkonnens on the other. Memorable new characters include Christopher Walken as the emperor, Florence Pugh as his daughter Princess Irulan, and Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, a completely hairless Harkonnen scion.  There’s also a lot there about the question of whether Paul is a messiah, and what that means. And Chalamet plays it all very well, especially in the third act when he’s essentially playing a different character.  The sandworms are back, and better than ever, and now they’ve inspired the world’s most controversial movie theater accessory. And due to a certain property of the worms, the second movie in three months to both star Chalamet and have a plot point that reminded me of the “Fry and the Slurm Factory” episode of Futurama. Much has been written about whether Dune is a “white savior” narrative, and if your knowledge of the saga amounts only to the Lynch movie from the 1980s, you might conclude that. But the later books, I gather, are quite a bit more complex than that, something very similar to the discourse that emerged mid-series on Game of Thrones.  Every indication is we’re going to see that complexity play out in the third film. In the third act of Part Two, things certainly take a turn indicating that that is what’s coming.  Meanwhile, there are real-life allegories everywhere, to Islam, to colonialism, to the Middle East, and numerous other things. The Nazi symbolism of the Harkonnens is even less subtle than in the first film, including a long sequence that’s heavily inspired by the 1936 Berlin Olympics and Leni Riefenstahl’s cinematic depiction of them.  The Dune movies are likely to end up as a trilogy, even though they weren’t planned that way, and the first was made without any guarantee of a second. Dune Part II, though, feels an awful lot like The Empire Strikes Back (and also, it must be said, like The Last Jedi.) All three are second parts of trilogies that very much feel like that, even if they’re great on their own.  The current series of Dune films, while successful, has fallen victim to a lot of unfortunate circumstances. First COVID, and then the strikes, caused long delays in the planned releases of both of them. But both have been more than worth the wait, and I say this as someone who was never all that enamored with most of Denis Villeneuve’s work.  The SS Ben Hecht, by Stephen Silver  is a reader-supported publication.

"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," When director Denis Villeneuve released his epic adaptation of Dune in late 2021 some audience members walked out confused. They didn’t know it was only half the story. Villeneuve took the tale of Paul Atreides to the midpoint of Frank Herbert’s dense book with the view that if the Timothee Chalamet-led sci-fi film was successful, they would get the money back to make the second half. Dune was a critical and commercial hit thanks to Villeneuve’s command of visual scale and compelling storytelling. It also won six Oscars. The money followed and so now has the sequel. An operatic saga of ambition, religious fervour, prophecy, revenge and love – it has it all – Dune Part Two is a rip-roaring spectacle packed full of action set-pieces and is more accessible than its predecessor. The sequel, while an impressive accomplishment, loses the restraint and elegance of the first film, leaning more towards a blockbuster experience. Everything here is monumental, including the emotions, and the quiet confidence of Part One has morphed into unshackled bravura in Part Two. Plot-wise, Dune Two picks up moments after we left Paul (Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) in the desert, having connected with the Fremen, the native peoples of the unforgiving planet of Arrakis. Paul is making puppy love eyes at Chani (Zendaya) and comes to view Stilgar (Javier Bardem) as a replacement father figure. Paul says he wants to learn from the Fremen, to be one of their fighters to seek revenge against the Harkonnens (Stellan Skarsgard, Dave Bautista), who killed his father. “I want to be equal to you,” he says to Chani. His mother Jessica, a member of the Bene Gesserit guild, has other plans. She is convinced Paul is the saviour (the Lisan Al-Gaib) foretold in the prophecy created and seeded by the Bene Gesserit for centuries. Dune Part Two delves deeper and more explicitly into the power moves made by various factions and interests in its world. The Bene Gesserit (“We don’t hope, we plan”) has placed its members at the epicentre of the royal houses, including Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the daughter to the ageing Padishah Emperor (Christopher Walken) who made the call to eradicate House Atreides in the first film. The Harkonnens also have ambitions for the throne with the Baron putting on the board his psychopath nephew Feyd-Rautha (a sly and formidable Austin Butler who is having more fun in the role than his one-note book counterpart). Through Paul, Dune Two explores faith, fundamentalism and the unerring belief in a messiah who will lead the marginalised Fremen to paradise. It’s a role Paul rejects, having seen a desolate and deadly future if he accepts the title. The film is also playing with the trope of the foreign white saviour coming in to rescue a population of non-white indigenous peoples. Chani, who is given more agency than in Herbert’s book, becomes the counterpoint to what could be a problematic narrative. She’s adamant the Fremen must be freed by one of its own people, even though she is clearly becoming entangled with Paul. She is never completely comfortable with the figure he is “prophesised” to be. Zendaya was barely in the first film, but she now comes into her full power as the character, and she and Chalamet have a charged chemistry with their intimacy showcased in fluid close-ups. That relationship is an exquisite reprieve from the more imposing action and manoeuvring of the film. Visually, Dune Two is beautiful to look at, thanks in large part to the graceful camera work of Australian Greig Fraser’s cinematography. There are more than a handful of moments when it pushes into a fierce hero shot of Chalamet, Zendaya or Brolin that makes you go, “phwoar”. Similarly, Patrice Vermette’s production design – the organic grit of the Fremen world and the stark German Expressionism-cum-brutalism of the Harkonnen spheres – is a feast to take in. In terms of pacing, there is both a lull and then an abrupt jump that doesn’t quite land, but the climax with its grand and kinetic action scenes ends the film on a high note. But, be warned if you were one of those who didn’t know Part One wasn’t the full story. Part Two also ends at the start of something, so you will have to wait for a not-yet-confirmed Part Three to see where it goes next."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune Part Two is Empire Strikes Back level great&#46; You have a lead character put to the test and rising to the occasion in epic fashion&#46; The scale is dynamic&#44; and Butler&apos;s portrayal is wildly hypnotic and menacing&#46; This is greatness on every level&#46; 
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," Watching Dune 2, was like watching The Dark Knight for the first time: impressionable, impressive, and immersive. Directed by Denis Villaneuve and an adaptation of one of the most famous sci-fi series of all time, the movie feels like the very definition of an epic. Similar to the eternally praised Batman film, Dune 2 feels so good and fulfilling that it will stand out: no matter what came before or comes after it. They are the bread and this film is the ham and cheese we were waiting for.  Frankly, I liked Dune Part 1. Of course, it could be a little dry and long like some of the desert paths our characters take, but that it was undeniably beautiful and impactful is true. Dune, as a whole, feels like Star Wars in how it build such a vast world and mythos that it goes beyond the plain rating of ¨good or bad movie.¨ Instead, it feels whole and as a rich as a literary experience. From the very beginning, you are mesmerized: wondering if its author, Frank Herbert, truly imagined such a big world. By minute one, you are in Dune, and by hour 2, you do not want to leave, and just as you near hour 3, you feel like sending a Thank You Note to the cast for the invite. From gorgeous visuals to a storyline so perfect adapted and paced from its original text, Dune 2 is deserving of every Oscar it hopefully wins, but I fear, as with so many sci-fi films, the magnificence of its cast will be casted aside. After all, Barbie, herself, aka Margot Robbie, was not nominated for her role, despite its richness, because it felt too mainstream and light-hearted to be rewarded for its depth. Hence, I say this, in all sincerity: Timothée Chalamet f**king killed it. He was radiant and almost emblematic to his own acting journey of being the prodigious kid playing lost youth to entering more adult, leading roles where he resolves the dramatic situations rather than being swept by them as a teen. His take on Paul Atreides captivates the heart of a character whose sweetness and determination to do right by all is potentially his very downfall, especially when it comes to his love for Zendaya´s Chani.  Can I just say I am so happy for Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet: talk about to child actors that have had great careers/ lives and just keep on winning! YES! Zendaya turns an, otherwise, annoying character into a fierce, charming warrior. I say this because, in the book, like most literary tropes, Chani is the ¨heart¨ of the hero: morally sculpting and measuring them to make sure power does not corrupt them by trying to convince them they should not go for it, at all. Yet, the film is about a man so destined to become a legend that the real journey is deciding it details. To the world of Dune, Paul is Muad- Dib: a messianic character meant to bring back a green paradise to this arid, ¨spicy¨ one they know. Whether or not, he is actually a Messiah does not matter because he will be impactful, and the chemistry Chalamet and Zendaya share is palpable, tender, and one to cheer for. You want him and Chani to draw their names in the sand with a forever under it, but you know it is doomed from the start.  From Christopher Walken´s brief, but looming presence as the emperor to Austin Butler giving us more accents to meme as Feyd- Rautha, the film is lush in how completely realized every actor has turned their character. Javier Bardem makes Stilgar  two yoga trips to Tulum away from a cult documentary: absolutely embodying how faith can help us persist against but also invest too much in everything but ourselves. Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica/ Reverend Mother holds a diabolical energy that, frankly, I understand if I had been married to Oscar Isaac in the last film and they killed him. Meanwhile, Florence Pugh gives Princess Irulan such a simple elegance, that she wraps how this film is SUCH A REPEATING WATCH.  Out March 1, Dune 2 was always destined to make numbers at the box office, but the question was whether it would make a memory amidst audiences. If the last decade of movies shows us anything ,it is that the cinematic experience has been a little lost. Content not as original or captivating beyond the one day trending it builds. Dune 2 gives the audience a launchpad for their imagination that will keep them coming back forever like, Star Wars or Batman. Just ICONIC! "
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Villeneuve&apos;s epic is an incredibly immersive and narratively rich awe-inspiring sci-fi feast&#46; It&apos;s so strong across the board that not even an overlong second act and a rushed resolution can diminish its impact&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," At the end of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, there was still so much story to tell. It was only the beginning and in Dune: Part Two there is so much story to discuss. The second installment lives up to the long-awaited hype but it once again leaves you excited for much more. The return to the vast sand planet of Arrakis is a grand and sweeping production, with an even bigger cast of characters, and a deeper conversation about space politics, religious beliefs, prophecies, and the prophets we follow. Dune: Part Two is an epic continuation and builds the potential of what could be one of the greatest science fiction trilogies of all time. The story left off with Paul Atredies (Timothée Chalamet) and his royal house all but massacred by the brutal Harkkonen. It has forced him and his pregnant mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to escape to the desert, and they now trust in the sand people known as the Fremen. Paul creates a bond with Chani (Zendaya) and great leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) places all his faith in the prophecy of Paul leading the Fremen to paradise to be true. Through methodical acts of war against the Harkonnen, destroying their ability to mine Arrakus for spice, along with signs of giant sandworm riding, and even defying the laws of death, Paul begins to become the leader, known as the Muad’Dib. But becoming a prophet can be viewed as a great threat and slowly, Paul attracts many enemies, making it hard to know if he has any friends. The rise of Paul’s greatness is nearly one part of the story of Part Two. Weaved in between his path are the surrounding characters. We finally meet the person who set these wars in motion, the Emperor (played wonderfully by Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). Along with the scheming Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), they have placed the evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) in power, only to maneuver the psychotic Feyd-Rautha (a wicked Austin Butler) in a position to defeat Paul for good. The narrative becomes a collective circle of characters, each pushing for their prophet, the explosion of war, who to trust, and the pressure for Paul to lead without losing those he loves. Slowly, the sand becomes a nest of snakes, scorpions, and worms. Narratively speaking, the screenplay by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts closely follows the books by Frank Herbert but is strictly a second installment. The first Dune was a setup and every bit of this feels like a thick middle. Yet, the story is incredibly rich with themes that permeate throughout all great science fiction, along with the topics of war, religion, politics, believing in God, good vs. evil, and how all humans seek to have power. Dune continues to reflect the inspiration for Star Wars while also being closer to Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, or Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi. At the core is a story relative to struggles in the Middle East, or the central debates about those who believe, often willing to forgive bloodshed in the name of their lord. Dune is as complex as the bible. All of these parts are put together through the magnificent direction of Villeneuve. The production is grand in scale and seamless in special effects. You can’t see the green screens and the world we inhabit feels real. You throw, on top of the excellent production design, a cast that glows in every frame, from Chalamet’s flowing hair, the glossy shine of Austin Butler’s face, the beauty of Ferguson in her flowing robes, and the serious stare of Zendaya. Dune: Part Two captures the greatness that comes from cinema today. The themes, dialogue, and general text may be hard for some to absorb, but the context is all universal. Dune: Part Two is a long journey through an unknown space, ramping up, and burrowing into Herbert’s world, which could only be brought to life through Denis Villeneuve’s great ambition. The biggest sign of his success is how he leaves us ready for Part Three. The spice is flowing strong and Dune: Part Two is already one of the great achievements of 2024."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE," After Dune relaunched in 2021, it quickly became apparent that Denis Villeneuve had accomplished something unique. While much of that movie focused on setting the table for the future, Dune: Part Two promised an epic story on the horizon. In a surprise to no one, Villeneuve fulfills that promise. The action, sci-fi spectacle soars as a conclusion to Part One, a standalone film, and a bridge to the next stories in the saga. After the Harkonnens destroyed House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) join with the Fremen. Led by religious fanatic Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul and Jessica slowly grow accepted into the culture. Chani (Zendaya) becomes Paul’s mentor, confidant, and lover, as Lady Jessica becomes the new Mother Superior for the Freman. Guided by her unborn child’s literal thoughts and plans, Jessica begins paving the way for Paul to become Kwisatz Haderach – the chosen one to lead the universe. However, the Harkonnens fight back against the Fremen, bringing sociopath warrior Fyed-Rautha (Austin Butler) to quell the Fremen rebellion. Many will believe that Dune: Part Two is a dime-a-dozen blockbuster. Giant spectacle is nothing new, and sci-fi can often lose itself in the weeds of its lore. What differentiates Dune: Part Two from many stories of its ilk is how it weaves interpersonal relationships into the heart of the story. At no point do we lose character in favor of spectacle. Each character’s beat builds toward the next big setpiece. This adds emotional weight to the battle sequences that few other films can accomplish.  However, Villeneuve and fellow writer Jon Spaihts shine the most in exploring capitalism, religion, and faith. Dune: Part Two cannot ignore comparisons to modern conflicts in Ukraine/Russia or Gaza because ideology is so thoroughly entangled in the storyline. The ways narratives are crafted and woven to consolidate power and military action feel far too relevant to ignore. The images of destruction for holy symbols and figures hurt the audience. We understand the importance of these elements because every principal actor, background character, and extra fully commits to the world. Chalamet takes a giant leap forward, and his charisma comes through as he rises to power. However, Zendaya and Ferguson steal the show, providing polar opposite figures in his development. Ferguson must chart a course from a physical and emotional threat to a large-scale schemer. The character transformation comes after drinking a substance, but watching her mental evolution is something to behold. Meanwhile, Zendaya becomes a co-lead, making her emotional journey as integral to the plot as Chalamet’s rise. She becomes the audience surrogate in many ways, allowing us a peek into a perspective outside the zealots surrounding Paul.  The brutal fights also give highlight moments to Butler. His few scenes are spine-chilling, and he proves his star-making role in Elvis was no fluke. A physical battle with Paul will be among the best scenes of 2024, and until then, he more than earns the sociopath label placed upon his character. Brolin, Bardem, and Skarsgård each rise to their usual standard. Even with limited screen time, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken rise to the occasion. With so much talent in every corner of the movie, we never go a scene without a standout moment.  Once again, Villeneuve delivers a singular visual experience. The power of Dune Part Two as an action spectacle begins early, but Villeneuve quickly ties in the ethical and religious themes of the story. The visuals become more unhinged and unreal as the presence of Spice affects characters, yet it’s when Villeneuve shifts settings that we see his mastery on display. Dune: Part Two features even better cinematography from Greig Fraiser this time, but the visual effects might be the best in any movie over the last decade. A detour to Giedi Prime shines as a landmark visual setpiece, with the interiors and exteriors providing wholly unique showcases. Yet Villeneuve works to the scale of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Gladiator in terms of sheer spectacle. The battles are bone-shattering in the sound design, and the score from Hans Zimmer delivers beautiful new themes. The sandworms – the Shai-Hulud – become far more critical to the plot instead of shining as solely visual showcases. With an impeccable cast and even grander ambition on display, Dune: Part Two soars as a feat of storytelling. It’s destined to join the ranks of the great sequels and visually stuns at every turn. Whether Villeneuve returns for a third or fourth film is up in the air, but if he leaves after this movie, he has more than established himself as one of the greatest filmmakers alive. "
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Blockbuster and IP filmmaking at its finest&#46; Dune&#58; Part Two rocks a script that doesn&#8217;t shy away from character complexities&#44; and does a shockingly solid job of reacquainting viewers with the Dune chessboard while adding more pieces to it&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," A master of the science fiction genre, Villeneuve introduced the world to a new generation of actors portraying complex otherworldly characters in 2021's ""Dune,"" based on the cult-favorite novel by Frank Herbert. Winner of six Academy Awards, the initial film gave way to Villenueve's latest, ""Dune: Part Two."" A spectacle to end all spectacles, the sequel to ""Dune"" far surpasses the original in flair and scope but falls short in its deep dive into what makes the characters shine brightest. ""Dune: Part Two"" picks up where ""Dune"" leaves off, with fateful hero Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) working alongside the Fremen of the desert planet, Arrakis. Most of the film takes place in the desert, with Paul and Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) falling in love. Paul's pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), slowly transitions into the Reverend Mother as Paul continues training in order to wage war against House Harkonnen. Paul eventually accepts the messiah label he's been given by the spice obsessed Fremen people, tasked with controlling sandworms and one-day seeking revenge against those who want to eradicate his family. A conspiracy arises when House Harkonnen leader Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and the Emperor's Truthsayer (Charlotte Rampling) choose Vladimir's nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to ascend the throne to become Emperor. If ""Dune"" was meant to be world-building, then ""Dune: Part Two"" is the reason we go to the movies…at least for the last hour of the nearly three-hour journey. What begins as a two-hour vision of the events to come radically morphs into a third act worth every dollar spent on the film's massive budget. Secrets the Atreides family is hiding, and the seemingly never-ending number of characters weaving in and out of a drawn-out premise mark the slog of the first two acts. However, the final hour gives way to an epic battle stripped of Hans Zimmer's heart-pounding score to reveal deafening inner turmoils and character transformations in real time. Denis Villeneuve understands how to craft a film worthy of the movie-going experience, and ""Dune: Part Two"" satisfies every inch of the science fiction genre that was practically created based on the film's source material. ""Star Wars"" and other movies like it have been influenced by the many books in the ""Dune"" series, and it's easy to see why. This sequel recalls a time of unruly Emperors, a quest for world domination using an unhinged patsy, and an altruistic warrior who gains the trust of everyday people to rise up against the perils of evil. Despite the long runtime and sluggish first half, ""Dune: Part Two"" finds its footing in sweeping landscapes aided by gorgeous cinematography, sound design that's loud as all get out, and a host of standout performances from its A-list cast. Chalamet has grown into the character of Paul, becoming a man before our very eyes, though his struggles are high and mighty. Austin Butler commands the screen as the bald and psychotic murderer Feyd-Rautha in a menacing portrayal. Zendaya takes her character center stage in a formidable way, a complete reversal of 2021's ""Dune,"" where she merely existed in Paul's visions for his future. Outside of the young leads, there's a full plate of performers getting their 15 minutes during overly complicated character development, yet watching their work on the screen is still fun. Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, and Javier Bardem all see some time in the spotlight, with Brolin stealing every scene he's in. Though many of their storylines become convoluted over time, there's no loss of empathy for their plights. ""Dune: Part Two"" is the follow-up audiences deserve and an excellent excuse to go to a movie theater to see it on the biggest screen possible."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two, a sequel to Dune, returns with undeniably stunning visuals and cinematography. It also comes back with a lot more violence and is more emotional. Is Dune: Part Two kid friendly? It depends what you consider appropriate for your kids. Expect minimal language, moderate to heavy violence, and mature themes and content in this PG-13 rated film, especially when it comes to religion and politics. Here’s what parents need to know in this Dune 2 Parents Guide. Director Denis Villeneuve continues to take audiences on this incredible sci-fi journey with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) in Dune: Part Two. Paul unites with Chani and the Fremen and learns their ways in the desert to not only survive, but exact revenge against the Emperor and the Harkonnens, who destroyed his family. Along the way he learns things that surprise him and change his course of action.He must choose between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, trying to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. Dune: Part Two is rated PG-13 for “strong violence, brief strong language, and some suggestive material” which means some content may not be appropriate for kids under 13.  Language was pretty mild for a PG-13 movie including a couple uses of sh*t, piss, and hell. I thought I maybe heard a use of f*ck, but I couldn’t tell. As with the first Dune, there is war, plenty of battles, and many fight scenes, but this film feels more extreme. Dune: Part Two is not for young kids.  Close up shots of hand-to-hand combat, knife fights, characters throats getting slit, and scenes of death and explosions can be gruesome. Bodies are seen falling from a cliff. Helicopters are shot down and many characters die. However, there isn’t much blood and gore. The scenes can just be flinch-worthy.  A child is seen with blood on his face. A character’s head is seen slammed against a hard surface repeatedly. Ants and insects are seen crawling on a deceased head. Giant worms are seen swallowing bodies. A character is shown drinking poison and in pain. Characters are drugged and forced to fight to the death in a colosseum. More killings, war weaponry, fires, stabbings, etc. While there is no nudity in Dune 2, sex is implied. Characters kiss and a character is seen on top of another without clothes on, but the shot is from about chest level. There is also some heavy breathing.  With a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes, Dune 2 is going to be too long for kids. Dune: Part Two is more appropriate for teens than younger kids due to war violence and mature themes. The film is stacked with teens’ favorite stars – Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya, Austin Butler, and more, so they’ll want to see it. But will they get it? This is a mature sci-fi adventure that Dune fans will love. It’s the casual teen star fans I worry about unless close-up shots of Chalamet’s broody faces are going to be enough. And for some people it might be. Paul has matured since the first film. Villeneuve takes his time with the story, allowing character development and connection to grow, unlike the first Dune. The world building is phenomenal, and the payoff is a thrilling third act. The buildup was slow, and sometimes I found myself nodding off in the beginning.  Everyone in this cast delivers with Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya being the stand outs for me. Ferguson even scared me more than Austin Butler did.  The battle sequences in Dune: Part Two are extraordinary and the score only adds to the intensity. My seat was shaking. Some of the Fremen believe that Paul is the prophesied hero and Messiah who will lead them to freedom. Others (like Chani) think they’re crazy and that this prophesy business is just nonsense. However, when Dune 2 commented on fundamentalism and/or religious extremism and fanaticism, I started to feel silly for being a believer – in anything. Remarks about faith or people being controlled for waiting for a Messiah almost made me feel ashamed in a belief of a Savior. Questions are good; blind faith can be dangerous, but also who am I to tell someone else in what they should or shouldn’t believe in? Perhaps I missed the point. Dune: Part Two is better than the first and deserves to be seen on the big screen. It may be pretty to look at, but the judgments made the film less attractive. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The first Dune film of the new Dune era—which is to say, director Denis Villeneuve’s version of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, both stark and maximalist at once—was a lot of flash with dismayingly little substance. The film, shot by Greig Fraser in eye-popping washes of fiery orange and forbidding black, was an aesthetic marvel, a Hans Zimmer score groaning away as the the noble House Atreides (including young heir Paul, played by Timothée Chalamet) moved to the desert planet Arrakis and quickly fell victim to a terrible assault by their galactic rivals, vicious House Harkonnen. Dune suggested grandeur but its good looks belied a thin narrative, one more predicated on mood than on compelling incident. That’s largely because Dune is actually a part one; it’s a preamble, ornately setting the stage for Dune: Part Two (in theaters March 1), in which the real meat of the story is served. Part Two is thus a more engaging film, a robust space opera of revolution and religious fervor built off of the first film’s collection of storyboard images.  Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), are now living with the Fremen, Arrakis natives who have been warring with colonialist powers for decades. Fremen tribe leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and crack soldier Chani (Zendaya) have enlisted Paul to aid them in guerilla raids on the Harkonnens, who have seized control of the planet and launched a campaign to eradicate its indigenous peoples. Chani is sweet on Paul and sees his militaristic value, while Stilgar is guided by a much deeper conviction: he believes, along with an increasing number of cultish Fremen, that Paul is the fulfillment of a prophecy, that he is a messiah sent to Arrakis to deliver the Fremen from subjugation.  Paul knows that this myth is propaganda seeded by the all-powerful magical nun collective known as the Bene Gesserit, of which his mother is a member, and is wary of feeding into a lie meant to keep the Fremen in thrall to a higher, off-planet power. And he is having an ominous recurring dream of his own—another, more credible sort of prophecy that he terribly fears coming to fruition.  And yet, he’s a young man who, by nature of his birth, does have some kind of innate call to power. It’s intoxicating, the idea that he might one day surpass even his revered late father in might and influence. Temptation creeps toward him. Which is the interesting tension of Part 2: will Paul give into these pressures, external and internal, to become a great leader, even though he fears that way lies ruin?  As Paul wrestles with his impulses, the film stages a series of stunning sequences. There’s a bracing raid on a lumbering harvesting machine; there’s a harrowing first attempt at riding one of the enormous worms that course their way through the desert. We travel into the towering front of a sandstorm, toward an undiscovered country. There’s also a trip offworld, to the black sun-lit home of the Harkonnens, where we meet the vicious nobleman killing machine Feyd-Rautha, played with arresting snarl and strut by Austin Butler, the best new addition to the cast.  Heavy with spectacle and theme as it is, Part Two is often surprisingly nimble. As a filmmaker, Villeneuve has long had trouble balancing plot with picture, but here he almost gets the calibration exactly right. It’s only toward the end of the film, a mighty crescendo in which big, universe-altering choices are made, that the film trips over its own momentum. Paul’s complicated evolution is slow and steady until, all of a sudden, it’s moving at breakneck speed. It feels as if we’ve skipped a crucial expositional step in order to get to the massive finale sequence. Chalamet is an effective communicator of Paul’s tortured ambitions, but he has trouble making it legible when it really counts, because Villeneuve hasn’t given him the time.  Time is very much of the essence with Dune, premised as it is on a tangle of mythology denser than a black hole. Part Two mostly manages to juggle its many components, and does arrive at something like a satisfying conclusion. But it’s more the ending of a chapter than of a whole saga. Future films, should they ever exist, would allow Villeneuve the temporal space to flesh out what he really only teases here. Presumably we would see more of, say, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken), who is just making her way into the story when Part Two ends.  But how many of these films can we really expect from Villeneuve? They’re massive undertakings, taking years to put together. Which is why, I suspect, Villeneuve (who wrote the script with Jon Spaihts) decides to close as many doors as he leaves open. Part Two functions well enough as a finale, but it could also serve as yet another launching pad. Whether Paul continues on toward his dangerous destiny will of course depend on Villeneuve’s continued interest, and on studio willingness. Should the Dune arc end here, though, that would be just fine. An accomplishment, when considering how many planes—er, starships—Villeneuve had to land. Dune sits in a tricky position. It shows the powers-that-be that serialized films, if they must exist, can be artful and strange and grim and still stoke the kind of hungry-for-more addiction that the bright and comestible comic book stuff once did. But, such a victory may be pyrrhic, stoking a franchise mentality that has been gradually eroding Hollywood’s capacity for innovation.  It might be better for the long-term health of the industry, then, if Villeneuve and Warner Bros. took some kind of principled stand and let Dune be done now, that they stopped here and made a bold assertion that a rare artistic and commercial success can and should be singular, not simply fed back onto the factory line until the product deteriorates into nothing. Part Two expands on its predecessor’s promise and delivers. Why then risk corrupting such an achievement in the reckless pursuit of an empire?"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," In one of the most thrilling scenes of “Dune: Part Two,” Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) must prove he belongs among the Fremen of Arrakis by mounting and riding a sandworm. If Paul makes one false move in his effort to control the cosmically gargantuan beast, he will undoubtedly perish. The scene is a fitting metaphor for director Denis Villeneuve’s efforts to adapt Frank Herbert’s sprawling sci-fi epic “Dune” for the big screen. Where brilliant visionaries like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky were left in the dust, the French-Canadian filmmaker succeeds. “Dune: Part Two” not only does justice to Herbert’s groundbreaking novel, it eclipses 2021’s “Dune” both in scale and ambition. “Dune: Part Two” picks up shortly after the conclusion of 2021’s “Dune,” finding Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), fighting off Harkonnen troops on Arrakis. The faceless soldiers can fly with the touch of a button and are armed with the strongest firepower in the galaxy. Yet they never stand a chance.  The desert skirmish is an effective preview for the artistry on display throughout the film. Cinematographer Greig Fraser digitally tints the scene a deep orange, immersing viewers in the harsh climate of Arrakis. The sound design is visceral: As the bodies of the soldiers fall from the sky, your seat will shake with concussive thuds. Paul may be an outsider, but he has taken to the Fremen ways like a fish to water — a simile that wouldn’t track on the barren planet. With each victory in battle, whispers among the Fremen that Paul is their long-promised savior — a religious myth seeded across generations by the witchy, power-hungry Bene Gesserit — grow stronger. Also growing stronger are the frustrations of the Harkonnens, the fief-holders (read: colonizers) of Arrakis, whose efforts to mine the planet’s spice are constantly disrupted. The plot of “Dune: Part Two” is incredibly dense, and Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts’ script is an impressive feat of storytelling. Fans of the novel will appreciate that almost every major plot line remains intact on screen. And despite the dense narrative (and the film’s tendency to wander into scenes full of dreamy images and dizzying spice hallucinations), newcomers should be able to follow the action without too much trouble. In 2021’s “Dune,” Chalamet’s Paul is adept at combat and statecraft, but nevertheless appears waifish and hesitant. The Paul of “Dune: Part Two” is a young man with enough strength and charisma for reasonably intelligent people to build a religion around. It’s a testament to Chalamet’s performance abilities, and to Villeneuve for giving Paul the time and space to grow in front of our eyes. On the other side of the coin, the Harkonnen’s prince-that-was-promised candidate, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), is appropriately cruel and psychotic. In black-and-white scenes shot on the Harkonnen’s home planet reminiscent of “Gladiator,” the “Elvis” actor slices and dices combatants with ease, grinning his black-stained teeth in malice. (Sidenote: Butler’s talk show appearances in six months where he explains why he can’t stop talking like Stellan Skarsgård will be hilarious.) Even with a 166-minute runtime, many actors are forced to make the most of limited screen time. As the puppet masters observing the Arrakis conflict from on high, the emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), embody the cold indifference of imperialist greed. As the battleground versions of middle managers, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Gurney (Josh Brolin) and Rabban (Dave Bautista) aptly convey the motivating power of religion, revenge, and conquest, respectively.  If there is an area where the film falters slightly, it’s the relationship between Paul and Chani (Zendaya). In Herbert’s original work, Paul’s evolution into a messianic figure is treated as a cautionary tale. But he is still the book’s proverbial hero, even if Herbert goes to great lengths to interrogate this manufactured framing. Villeneuve — no doubt aware of the potential for blowback from a media-illiterate portion of the audience for whom depiction equals endorsement — spells this criticism out even more bluntly, with Chani serving as Paul’s chief skeptic. The pair share tender moments, including a scene in which Chani teaches Paul the proper way to walk without rhythm (which won’t attract the worm). But between doubting Paul’s godlike qualities in the first half of the film and reacting in disgust when he marches towards his destiny in the second half, there’s barely any time for the two of them to fall in love. “Dune: Part Two” is a filmmaking triumph, masterfully adapting one of the most influential sci-fi novels of all time. It is a technical marvel, featuring some of the most beautiful camerawork of the year and a score from Hans Zimmer that will rattle your teeth. It tells a deeply complex story with difficult-to-parse themes and refuses to let audiences off the hook with a wink to the camera or a self-deflating joke, as has become standard thanks to the runaway success of Marvel.  It remains to be seen if viewers will respond positively to this challenge, thus providing a green light for Villeneuve to make “Dune Messiah,” the director’s third (and final) film in the series. But regardless of how the box office receipts pan out, nothing can take away Villeneuve’s fulfillment of his grand creative vision. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," “Dune: Part Two” stars Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler sat down with AP film writer Lindsey Bahr to talk about their fight scene, director Denis Villeneuve’s playful approach to creating the sci-fi epic, Chalamet’s growth in between trips to the desert — and that sandworm theatre popcorn bucket. The movie hits theatres March 1. Three firm thumps into the Arrakis sand is all you need to summon a sandworm in Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two.” It’s almost as easy as hailing a cab or calling for the check. The big buggers can’t resist the sound, which is a little like how I feel taking in all the vibrations of Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 science-fiction novel. Whispers, incantations and guttural sounds buzz throughout “Part Two,” a hissing hulk of a sequel that fluctuates between ominous silences and thunderous booms. The first “Dune,” released in 2021 when movie theaters were still humbled by the pandemic, tackled just the first half of Herbert’s opus, saving the second half for the sequel. That split can be owed in part to the enormous amount of plot contained in the novel, but it can also be attributed to the operatic rhythms of Villeneuve’s solemn spectacle. Sober as they are, “Dune” parts one and two are almost drunk on their own sense of atmosphere. And with good reason. Like its predecessor, “Dune: Part Two” thrums with an intoxicating big-screen expressionism of monoliths and mosquitos, fevered visions and messianic fervor — more dystopian dream, or nightmare, than a straightforward narrative. That filmmaking prowess sometimes comes at the expense of other things. Humor, for one, is in shorter supply on Arrakis than water. Javier Bardem, returning as the Fremen leader Stilgar, alone seems to want to breathe a little laughter into all the fiery red sands and mammoth machinery of “Dune.” “Part Two” primarily follows the rise of Paul Atreides ( Timothée Chalamet ), who, after seeing his father killed and House Atreides routed from the Arrakis capital by House Harkonnen and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a monstrously good Stellan Skarsgård), is now living among the Fremen, the desert-dwelling peoples of Arrakis, with his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). The myth of Paul is already growing among the Fremen, who call him Muad’Dib. (A great feature of these movies, like Hebert’s books, is the exquisite names.) Is he the chosen one or a false prophet? Doubts are gradually erased by his accomplishments (leading strikes against Harkonnen spice harvesters; quickly learning the ways of the Fremen); the cunning maneuvering of Lady Jessica; and the worshipful zeal of Stilgar. The Fremen warrior Chani ( Zendaya ), though skeptical of the hype, believes, with some reluctance, in Paul. “Part Two” is significantly propped up by their dynamic and budding romance, a relationship that gives a deserving wide-screen canvas to two of the most exciting young movie stars of their generation. For a while it’s fun and games in the desert, blowing up stuff and learning how to ride sand worms. Oh, there’s the matter of the “holy poison” forced on Lady Jessica, a neon-blue liquid extracted from sand worms that looks like it would produce a fine Slush Puppie, but, if it doesn’t kill you, confers a frightful clairvoyance of the universe. Blue is an important color in the otherwise darker shaded “Dune.” It lights up in Lady Jessica’s eyes and, later, Paul’s too. If you thought Peter O’Toole’s eyes blazed in “Lawrence of Arabia,” Paul’s look like they’ve been pumped through with windshield-wiper fluid. As his following swells, Paul grows increasingly aware, and fearful, of his god-like power. “Dune: Part Two” spends much of its energy with Paul wrestling with this supposed messianic destiny. Like “Lawrence of Arabia,” he’s a white protagonist from the West (or, here, the “Outer World”) on a Middle Eastern-like desert, leading the revolution of a dark-skinned population against oppressors whom he, himself, has deep ties to. Herbert’s metaphor-rife book has sometimes been interpreted — or misinterpreted, scholars would say — by the alt-right for its racial politics. Villeneuve’s film, scripted by the director and Jon Spaihts, appears highly conscious of this legacy as well as that of the white-savior trope. And often — as in so much of these two films — the movie expresses itself most through imagery and movement. The Harkonnens, universally white, bald and violent, are served up as the symbol of colonist rule. In the middle of “Part Two,” the film introduces the Harkonnen prince Feyd-Rautha (a hairless Austin Butler, looking a bit too much like the albino protagonist of 1995’s “Powder” ) who is a kind of opposite to Paul. He, too, could take command of Arrakis. When Villeneuve temporarily switches to Feyd-Rautha’s story and away from Paul and Chani, the film’s richly orchestrated sense of momentum falters. But the comparison is illuminating. In a massive colosseum, Feyd-Rautha ruthlessly battles a trio of Atreides survivors in a scene, bleached in monochrome, that looks like “Triumph of the Will,” supersized. There’s an earnest reckoning here in the power dynamics of the source material and previous Hollywood tales of first-and-third world confrontations. There’s plenty of doubt to go around for all involved, too. The movie’s perspective ultimately resides in the drained, shrouded face of Charlotte Rampling, who plays the matriarch of the Bene Gesserit (again, the names!), a mystic order that pulls the strings behind the galactic politics of “Dune.” For her, it’s a game of raw calculation and “no sides.” As “Part Two” brings all parties together for the final act, it begins to loose steam. The Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), seen sporadically from afar debating the events on Arrakis, turn up. But while Walken’s company is always welcome, he might be too warm a presence for “Dune” — too much of the Earth despite so often seeming on a planet of his own. Yet the limpness of the finale, despite all of the expert build-up of Hans Zimmer’s score and Mark Mangini and Theo Green’s sound design, goes to something deeper. Villeneuve’s great talent lies, I think, in invocation. He may be less perfect when it comes to conclusions but he’s brilliant at summoning — a sense of doom, a suddenly appeared spacecraft, a sandworm. Even better than those serpentine sand creatures (the runaway stars of “Part Two”) is that thump, thump, thump that precedes them. “Dune: Part Two,” a Warner Bros. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for sequences of strong violence, some suggestive material and brief strong language. Running time: 165 minutes. Three stars out of four."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Directed by Denis Villeneuve.
Starring Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Léa Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Tim Blake Nelson, Souheila Yacoub, Roger Yuan, Babs Olusanmokun, Alison Halstead, Giusi Merli, Joelle, Peter Sztojanov Jr., Gino Salvano, and Anya Taylor-Joy. For someone willing to shout at the mountaintops declaring that director Denis Villeneuve is one of the most exciting and stimulating filmmakers working today, capable of excelling across all genres and budget sizes, it wasn’t exactly fun to be out of step with colleagues and, well, almost the rest of the world that while Dune: Part One was an ambitiously realized technical marvel (especially for an adaptation many had considered unfilmable considering the visual complexity of Frank Herbert’s novel and the failed take in the 1980s from David Lynch), the story felt cold and largely emotionless, too fixated on politics, aside from when it finally started to gain some momentum during the third act. In between debating whether or not this adaptation should have been split up into multiple parts, that lengthy climactic stretch of betrayal and action did give hope for Dune: Part Two. There is still some to question regarding what Denis Villeneuve and his co-writer Jon Spaihts have decided to extend and what to streamline (sections here feel long without much narrative progress, whereas others fly by and leave one craving something more in-depth exploring a few characters slightly more), but it’s also safe to say that they have kept their fingers on the pulse they found at the end of Part One, sustaining it here for the majority of this epic three hour running time. Having fled his invaded home on the Middle Eastern-inspired desert planet Arrakis, Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides looks to further impress the Fremen people with hopes of recruiting them to his cause, enacting revenge on the uncle/nephew combo of Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Vladimir and Dave Bautista’s Beast Rabban of House Harkonnen for leading a siege on House Atreides, murdering his family, trainers, and people in search of gaining control over spice factories (a superpowered, battle intensifying, psychadeling drug that turns the user’s eyes blue.) Half of the Fremen people are excited by this development as they seem to believe he could be the Messiah, namely Javier Bardem’s amusing Stilgar, quick to point out whenever signs of the prophecy are fulfilled. Then there are the others who are understandably unsure about letting someone else lead the way against this shared enemy, cautiously outspoken that relying on such a prophecy could lead to eventual enslavement. The only surviving member of his family, his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), also takes it upon herself to go to extreme lengths to spread the word and gain the people’s trust in her son. Among the uncertain group is Zendaya’s Chani, who notices Paul’s sincerity in wanting to help them while accepting that he should fight by their side rather than fall down the rabbit hole of religious Messiah fervor. She begins to help Paul with a series of desert tests and develops a romantic bond with him as they and Fremen soldiers repeatedly take out small Harkonnen squads to take back some of the spice production. This is generally accomplished through electric ambushes with characters typically rising from underneath the sand, engaging in thrilling, tracking-shot combat, and sometimes taking out tank-like vehicles. Smartly, this adaptation makes Chani more of an active participant in everything from character dynamics to the breathtaking action, which feels like an important choice to make when updating a novel that, while still socially and politically relevant today, was also written in the 1960s and kept that character somewhat in the backseat. Ultimately, Dune: Part Two is a story about the appeal of letting a Messiah figure take over and assuming that the aftermath will pave the way for great prosperity versus controlling one’s own destiny and fighting that battle for themselves. After all, some of Paul’s intense visions aren’t necessarily promising, even if he does assure Chani he will love her for as long as he breathes. It’s also worth pointing out that the characters who encourage Paul to embrace the control and power that come with accepting the role of Messiah are typically white. Meanwhile, House Harkonnen begins to feel the pressure, relieving Beast Rabban of his duties to bring in his younger, more ruthless, psychotic brother Feyd-Rautha (an unhinged Austin Butler bringing some showmanship to this violent nutjob), with promises that the Emperor of this distant future world (Christopher Walken) and his daughter (Florence Pugh) will allow him to be the sole ruler of Arrakis. Despite the admittedly funny sight of watching Dave Bautista kiss Austin Butler’s feet, it is slightly confounding that the film shoves aside one barbaric villain to introduce another one when the reality is that, no matter how much is set up, Feyd-Rautha doesn’t serve much of a purpose as a character, even if the climactic final duel is satisfying.  Thankfully, the thorny aspects of the ensuing romance between Paul and Chani only grow more complicated, with visions of a holy war and magical drinking water that could be both a blessing and a curse for the path the former walks. Again, it must be mentioned that much of this adaptation has been considered from the perspective of both Chani and the Fremen, continuing that self-aware approach from Part One to both subvert and play into white savior tropes in a thoughtful and compelling fashion. Aside from a major third-act battle that feels a bit too short and truncated, the action here is involving and dazzling, with a score from Hanz Zimmer that drives home the emotional beats. That emotion courses through Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two like spice, ensuring viewers stay alert and riveted by the sweeping story (with more tantalizingly teased to come) in addition to basking in astonishing audio/visual spectacle this time around."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two may be the highly anticipated sequel from Denis Villeneuve, but somehow, the sequel far surpasses its predecessor. Picking right back up with Paul Atreides’ (Timothée Chalamet) time on Arrakis, Part Two finds a balance between its new characters and time with those we loved before. Much like many a great fantasy/sci-fi story, Dune: Part Two has the advantage of already having the groundwork laid for us to be thrown right into the thick of it. Paul Atreides has coped with the death of his father Leto (Oscar Isaac), and he is living among Arrakis’ native Fremen to learn their ways on the desert planet Arrakis. A mix of Paul’s journey to becoming Muad’dib and the struggling of his relationship with his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Dune: Part Two lets its characters breathe so when we do have bigger action sequences, we care about their wellbeing. “Power over spice is power over all” is one of the first things we hear in the movie, and it sets the tone for the fight for the Fremen and protecting the consciousness-expanding “spice” on Arrakis. Paul, who in Part One was trying to mine the planet along with his family, is now learning of the importance of the Fremen and their mission. They want to be free as others seek to exploit them in the production of spice, and while he is growing to be a strong leader for not only his family but for the Fremen as a whole, he still has moments where that ambitious and angry young man makes an appearance. Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) is one of the more fascinating characters in the Dune universe, but even more specifically within Part Two, the nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and a bloodthirsty man dedicated to his quest for power. What makes this particular take on Feyd-Rautha so memorable is how Austin Butler brings a sinister approach to him.  Feyd-Rautha and Paul do not meet early in the film, but still, the tension is there. We know that these two will meet eventually, and it won’t be a peaceful introduction. But what makes Butler’s take on Feyd-Rautha so noteworthy is the fact that he plays him in such a way where you are afraid of his every move. He is constantly teetering on the edge of madness with every passing moment, and as we see his ascent to power, it is terrifying. But on the flip of that, Villeneuve brings Paul’s rise to becoming Muad’dib (a Fremen name that Paul chose for himself) to us in a series of slow moments, making it clear that Paul is doing this because of what he is destined for and not necessarily what he wants, and to see Paul and Feyd-Rautha’s journey to their battle is one of the highlights. 2021’s Dune lacked a strong female presence, mainly because it was setting up a story where the female players did not come in until later on. Yes, Chani (Zendaya) was there in visions to Paul, and he always had his mother, but Dune: Part Two is decidedly more focused on the journey that these women are going through. Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan is constantly learning, working behind her own curtain to try to understand what her power means in this world and where her place will be in it. She’s strong and calculated, but Princess Irulan is also determined to continue to be there for her father, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken). We are with her as she is listening to him, as she is being educated on the ways of this world, and when we see her finally stand up for herself towards the end of the film, it’s clear that she has always been thinking about making the best move for herself. Jessica spends her time on Arrakis with little choice. She must become the Reverent Mother, and that is her calling. Much like her son Paul, Jessica is Bene Gesserit, and the training of her mind and her powerful abilities made her the perfect candidate for Reverend Mother, a position of power and enlightenment. Jessica’s intentions throughout the movie then become skewed, with those close to Paul not knowing what she is doing. Jessica is so split between her dedication to her children (as she is still pregnant) and her new title that she does not explain her intentions, just using Paul’s trust to get him to do what she believes is best, and that doesn’t always work with Chani and her trust.  One of the shortcomings of the previous movie was the use of Zendaya. While Chani was not yet an important character to Paul, outside of the dreams he had of her, we as the audience only got crumbs of Zendaya’s performance. Part Two shines in how it gives her power as a voice among the Fremen while still building out her relationship with Paul. She is not limited by the romantic connection the two shared, but rather, she uses it to her advantage and tries to reason with Paul when he seemingly needs it most. Pushing back against the idea of the “Messiah,” Chani is not afraid to use her voice to yell at those who are making decisions for all of the Fremen. She’s vocal about how this “prophecy” is trying to control them all, and when Paul continues to fall into its path, she stands up for herself and her beliefs with him.  What Dune: Part Two comes down to is a dilemma for Paul: follow his heart or follow his destiny? The movie really shines in its ability to show how Paul is trying to have it all while still being there for Arrakis and the Fremen. He is falling in love with Chani, but he’s still listening to the men in charge telling him what he should be doing. He’s still taking advice from his mother, even when it has been proven to be dangerous. Paul is torn throughout this movie, constantly being pulled in different directions, and then, when he does make a decision, it hurts everyone around him. Dune: Part Two is a truly stunning visual spectacle with a hero’s journey at its heart and is a film that you want to see on the biggest screen possible. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Culture Representation: Taking place in the year 10,191, on the fictional planets of Giedi Prime and Arrakis, the sci-fi action film “Dune” features a predominantly white cast of characters (with some black people, Asians and Latinos) representing heroes, villains and people who are in between. Culture Clash: House Atreides royal leaders Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica, who are refugees from their planet Caladan, get suspicion from and ultimately join forces with the native Fremen people of Arrakis, to battle against House Atreides rivals in House Harkonnen from the planet of Giedi Prime.  Culture Audience: “Dune: Part Two” will appeal primarily to people who are fans of the “Dune” novel and to people who like epic sci-fi adventures with stunning visuals and good acting. “Dune: Part Two” is a masterful technical achievement that surpasses its predecessor movie on a storytelling level. It’s less cluttered with characters than 2021’s “Dune” and has a more compelling villain and higher emotional stakes. Fans of the the “Dune” franchise will have their expectations met or surpassed with “Dune: Part Two,” a sci-fi epic worth seeing on the biggest screen possible with the best sound system possible. Directed by Denis Villenueve, “Dune: Part Two” (co-written by Villenueve and  Jon Spaihts) is the second part of Villenueve’s movie triology adaptation of Paul Herbert’s densely packed 1965 novel “Dune.” (Villenueve’s “Dune” adaptations are far superior to 1984’s disastrously awful “Dune” movie, directed by David Lynch.) The first part of Villenueve’s “Dune” movie, released in 2021, was an introduction to the main characters and had a lot to do with showing the combat training and the rise of main “Dune” hero Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet), a royal leader from House Atreides.  Is it necessary to know about the “Dune” book and/or know what happened 2021’s “Dune” to completely enjoy “Dune: Part Two”? Yes. There are many references to 2021’s “Dune” in “Dune: Part Two” that will be confusing to viewers who don’t know what happened in 2021’s “Dune.” Viewers who watch “Dune: Part Two” who don’t know anything about the “Dune” story can still enjoy “Dune: Part Two,” but they will feel like they’ve started reading a book from the middle, not from the beginning. In “Dune: Part Two” (which takes place in the year 10,191), Paul and his mother Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson), who is pregnant with a daughter, are refugees from their home planet Caladan, which has been devastated by a genocidal attack from House Harkonnen. The attack killed Paul’s father/Jessica’s live-in partner Leto Atreides (played by Oscar Isaac), a duke who passed on his legacy to Paul before Leto died. Leto was ordered to be the fief ruler of Arrakis, a desert planet with harsh terrain that is the only place to find a priceless treasure: melange, also known as spice, a dusty substance that can enhance and extend human life. Because spice is the most sought-after substance in the universe and can make people wealthy, people will go to extremes to get it and to be in charge of Arrakis, whose native people are called Fremen. Prolonged exposure to spice can turn humans’ eyes blue in the iris. Harvesting spice can be a deadly activity because gigantic sandworms ferociously guard the spice. “Dune: Part Two” begins with this caption: “Power over spice is power over all.” House Atreides and House Harkonnen have been in a bitter rivalry over getting control of spice. House Harkonnen was behind the attack that killed Leto and several of his people. The evil leader of House Harkonnen is a baron named Vladimir Harkonnen (played by Stellan Skarsgård), an obese and ruthless tyrant, who likes to spending time in saunas filled with a tar-like substance. Vladimir’s closest henchman is his sadistic nephew Glossu Rabban (played by Dave Bautista), who doesn’t hestitate to kill anyone for any reason. The person who orderd Leto to rule over Arrakis was his adoptive cousin: Padishah Emperor of House Carrino named Shaddam Corrino IV (played by Christopher Walken), who was not seen in 2021’s “Dune,” but he has a prominent role in “Dune: Part Two.”  In the beginning of “Dune: Part Two,” Shaddam’s daughter Princess Irulan (played by Florence Pugh) can be heard in a voiceover commenting on the night of the House Atreides massacre: “Since that night, my father hasn’t been the same.” Why? It’s because Shaddam set up Leto as ruler of Arrakis, knowing that House Harkonnen wold respond with a brutal attack on House Atreides. This betrayal (which isn’t spoliler information) becomes a layer in the conficts that exist in “Dune: Part Two.” There is also a big family secret that is revealed that has to do with House Atreides and House Harkonnen. Meanwhile, Paul and Jessica have made their way to  Arrakis, with the help of Stilgar (played by Javier Bardem), the leader of the Fremen tribe called Sietch Tabr. Stilgar is the translator, and negotiator when the Fremens become suspicious of the arrival of Paul and Jessica, who ar ebelieved by many Fremens to be spies. Stilgar, who is convinced that Paul is the messiah from a prophecy, is often the movie’s comic relief in how he how tries to convince his skeptical Fremen people to trust Paul and Jessica and to believe that Paul is the messiah. However, the relationship between Paul and Chani doesn’t happen without problems. There’s the difference in their social classes: Chani is more uncomfortable with Paul is about the fact that he’s a royal and she’s a commoner. Chani also has to spend a lot of time defending Paul to Fremen skeptics, such as her close friend Shishakli (played by Souheila Yacoub), who is a perceptive and brave fighter. All of the female supporting characters in “Dune” are capable but obviously not meant to outshine Chani. Meanwhile, House Harkonnen has heard stories that Paul and Jessica are still alive. And you know what that means: There’s going to be another big showdown. And guess who conveniently shows up? Paul’s no-nonsense mentor Gurney Halleck (played by Josh Brolin), who was one of the teahcers in Paul’s fight training. Gurney is still loyal and mostly stoic. He doesn’t really become a father figure to Paul, but Gurney the closest male connection that Paul has to Leto, since Gurney and Leto knew and respected each other. For the big showdown in “Dune: Part Two,” House Harkonnen has enlisted the help of a vicious killer named Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (played by Austin Butler), Vladimir’s nephew whose weapon of choice is a massive knife. A seductive psychic spy named Lady Margot Fenring (played by Léa Seydoux) has a plan to seduce and get pregnant by Feyd-Rautha, for reasons that are explained in the movie. She also does this seduction to find out what Feyd-Rautha’s weaknesses are. The 2021 version of “Dune” was nominated for 10 Oscars and won six Oscars: Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Production Design, Best Sound, Best Original Score and Best Visual Effects. Without question, “Dune: Part Two” is also award-worthy in these categories as well. Everything in “Dune: Part Two” is done on a grand, immersive scale that are stellar examples of excellence in cinematic world building of a fictional universe. “Dune: Part Two” (which was filmed in Hungary, Abu Dhabi, and Jordan) has scenes taking place in the sand that are truly unforgettable. As for the relationships between the characters, Paul sees a more vulnerable side to his mother Jessica, when she is pressured into becoming a reverend mother, which is a responsibility with physical and emotional burdens that Jessica is reluctant to have. In the first half of the movie, Jessica shows her powerful fight skills, but after she transforms into a reverend mother,  Jessica ctually becomes passive, as she sits by and watches other people fight. Reverend Mother Mohiam (played by Charlotte Rampling), who was in 2021’s “Dune,” has a more scheming side that is revealed in “Dune: Part Two.” “Dune: Part Two” might have more appeal than 2021’s “Dune” for people who want to see the romance of Paul and Chani that didn’t exist in 2021’s “Dune.” This romance is very chaste, with a “first love” tone to it. The “Dune” trailers already revealed much of the dynamics in this romance, where Paul respects Chani and wants to treat her as his equal. However, will Paul’s royal lineage and duties get in the way of this budding romance? Chalamet and Zendaya are quite good in their roles as Paul and Chani, but nothing about their performances is worthy of prestigious awards. Paul is depicted as a sensitive and somewhat tortured hero. He tells Chan that he keeps having nightmares of thousands of people dying of starvation because of him. Chani is kind of a stereotypical “tough woman in an action film” who wants to act like she doesn’t fall in love easily, but of course she does just that with Paul. A characteristic of an above-average sci-fi/fantasy film is the portrayal of the chief villain or villains. Skarsgård as Vladimir Harkonnen and Bautista as Glossu Rabban have less screen time in “Dune: Part Two” than they did in 2021’s “Dune” and don’t really do anything new with their performances. Butler as Feyd-Rautha is the “Dune: Part Two” villain who is the obvious standout, since it’s already been revealed in the movie’s trailers that the climactic battle scene includes a one-on-one fight with Paul. “Dune: Part Two” lacks susbtance by not telling more about Feyd-Rautha’s background. He’s an enigma for the entire movie. “Dune: Part Two” will no doubt have multiple viewings from fans of the franchise. As for winning over new fans, the movie has a tone that seems to be saying, “You either understand what you’re watching , or you dont. And we don’t have time to explain it all to you.” If you’re unfamiliar with the “Dune” franchise, and you’re the type of person who doesn’t like the idea of dong homework-like research before seeing a sc-fi movie that has a complex story, then “Dune: Part Two” probably isn’t for you. For everyone else, “Dune: Part Two” will fill up your senses with an absorbing story whose cliffhanger ending hints at how this excellent cinematic adaptation continues."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve is nothing short of a living maestro. No other working director can so skillfully transmogrify a heralded text into a jaw-dropping exercise in both art and commerce, making for a sci-fi epic that’s as artistically entrancing as it is nonstop thrilling. A masterclass in world expansion, Dune: Part Two picks up where the last chapter, released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max in the doldrums of the lingering pandemic in 2021, left off while continuing to complicate the world of Arrakis, its mythology, its peoples, and what’s at stake for the entirety of Frank Herbert’s well-drawn universe. Villeneuve’s eleventh feature film presents a triumphant middle chapter that grapples with inner darkness, ruminative notions of prophecy and destiny, romantic entanglement, and familial tragedy in what is set to be one of the great trilogies and a true modern masterwork.  Following the culling of House Atreides by rival Great House Harkonnen, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined ranks with Arrakis natives, The Fremen. Whispers of the prophecy of Lisan Al Gaib, The Voice from the Outer World, amplify as Paul learns the ways of the desert folk from the devout Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and the skeptical but warming Chani (Zendaya). Sandwalking, wormriding, and water harvesting are just a few of the ways that the Fremen survive in such inhospitable conditions and Villeneuve pays great attention to the smallest detail, pursuing the cardinal filmmaking virtue of showing rather than telling. The architecture of his filmmaking is rich with choices, leaning on film grammar that emphasizes visual language as much as narrative exposition. It’s a tremendous way to draw audiences in and force their engagement, Dune: Part Two a towering storm of audio-visual majesty that’s impossible to turn away from for even a moment. The ways of the desert apply also to Fremen military campaigns with Paul and the Fremen besieging spice harvest operations with guerrilla warfare tactics in order to disrupt the galactic wheels of commerce and draw the Emperor (Christopher Walken), surreptitiously responsible for his father’s demise, more directly into the conflict on Arrakis. Meanwhile on the duochromatic, industrialized planet of Giedi Prime, Harkonnen Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) turns to his ruthless nephew Feud-Rautha (Austin Butler) to tame the uprising on Dune in a bid to take over the Emperorship for his bloodline. The script from Villeneuve and Jon Spaights invests in the turmoil between houses as well as within them, weaving webs of possibility that suggests greater depth and complication than the story’s otherwise linear story of underdog chosen one ascendancy. With another Dune chapter on the horizon, it’s impossible to say which of these threads will bear fruit but Villeneuve and Spaights belly enough political intrigue into each character exchange that they take on value divorced from their impending implications to the plot. All roads lead to Spice, a psychedelic substance used for increased vitality, consciousness-expansion, and space travel. As the opening crawl of the movie tells us, he who controls the spice, controls the universe. It’s basically space LSD crossed with interstellar gasoline and Paul’s increased exposure to the spice leads to visions of a future he cannot bear but also cannot prevent. Dune: Part Two grapples with the weight of prophecy through Paul, who ostensibly wants to help free the Fremen so that they may lead themselves, despite his mother’s insistence that he is the fated and foretold Lisan Al Gaib, destined to rule Arrakis and its people. The film also challenges the idea of religious fervor and its power to manipulate, with Ferguson’s character working the weak minds of the masses, laying the groundwork for Paul’s ascendancy. The more that characters like her turn towards power and faith (the two completely intertwined in this universe), the less recognizably human they become. This dynamic is explored within Paul and Chani’s emergent relationship. Paul is unable to resist the pull towards Chani’s hesitant Fremen affection and yet, on a grander metaphysical scale, he’s acutely aware of the devastation and sacrifice that awaits him, his allies, and his people with each decision on the desert planet. Their relationship grounds his transformation from rebellious warrior to burgeoning leader, with Paul’s increased cognizant of his destiny further clouding his affections. Religious overtones inject a further fervor that threatens to transform Paul from a committed cog of the collective into a messianic iron fist. Villenueve captures this romance against the blistering backdrop of Dune’s expansive desert wasteland, underscoring their solitary unity before thrusting them into battles with enemies and from within. If for only a moment, it’s them against the world. A thundering score from Hans Zimmer and simmering cinematography from returning DP Greig Fraser are the most immediately recognizable production elements that burst off the screen but every single aspect of Dune: Part Two scorches with brilliance. Patrice Vermette’s considered production design, Jacqueline West’s sharp and utilitarian costumes, and Shane Vieau’s expansive sets all contribute to Dune’s epic scope, giving rare potent artistry to what could have been a vacuous exercise of genre. As more and more studios turn towards existing IP in order to maximize shortcut profits, Villeneuve’s Dune franchise should serve as a template for how to do so thoughtfully. Some in the audience may gripe that Dune: Part Two builds slowly, a symptom of blockbuster mainstays following algorithmic storytelling patterns, but there isn’t a single subplot or steady slo-mo gaze into a sand-blasted dunescape that doesn’t add to the building mythology of this story. A steely-blue-eyed Chalamet handily leads the cast, his chemistry with Zendaya’s Chani, in a much expanded role from Part 1, the human foundation for the sociopolitical war games to unfold atop of. The supporting cast is truly a remarkable assemblage of A-cast talent, one of the finest ever congregated for a tentpole film (or really any film for that matter), with the aforementioned cast as well as Josh Brolin and Charlotte Rampling returning and the addition of Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux, and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo from Anya Taylor-Joy capping off a real who’s who of Hollywood talent. Of the newcomers, Austin Butler’s ferocious turn as the Harkonnen heir apparent pops most. From his stark, sharp, eyebrow-shaven physicality to his growling vocal fry, he’s an imposing antagonist, even if all his striking build up ultimately results in a bit of short shrift come the last act. Javier Bardem, as a devout Fremen warrior-leader, is also a standout. Those left unfulfilled by Part One’s open-ended, “to be continued…” nature will find similar complaints with Part Two, as Villeneuve and his creative team have once again decidedly not shut the book on this story. So much so that the journey would feel unequivocally incomplete without a third film in the trilogy to wrap up the many open narrative threads. As someone who could spend untold hours watching Villeneuve further spin out this world, its mythologies, politics, and characters, that seems more an otherworldly promise than a threat.  CONCLUSION: ‘Dune: Part Two’ further opens the book on the world of Paul Atreides and Arrakis in this towering accomplishment that’s as thrilling as it is stunning to watch, hear, and feel. Witness it on the biggest screen you can find. When not plugging away at his computer, Matt can be found holed up in his Seattle home or hidden amongst the mountains.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,If you&apos;re casting a hero whose Chosen One origin is &apos;I&apos;m The Chosen One&#58; I Have A Note From My Mommy&#46;&apos; Timoth&#233;e Night Shyamalan is the actor you want&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve has created another out of this world cinematic experience as he continues to expand on Frank Herbert’s Dune with Dune Part Two. You must see this on the biggest screen possible when it opens March 1. Dune Part Two picks up right where the first one left off. We’re introduced to Florence Pugh’s character, Princess Irulan, narrating the events of what happened. The power over the Spice means power over all the people. The Harkonnens took over Arrakis destroying the House of Atreides. It’s believed that Paul Atreidis (Chalamet) is dead, but what the Emperor (Walken) and Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgård) don’t realize is that he’s alive and hiding within the Fremen people. Word starts to spread that Paul may be a Messiah or he’s living as a False Prophet. Paul’s destiny has grave impacts on his mother, Lady Jessica (Ferguson), his budding relationship with his friend Chani (Zendaya) and the future of the planet. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune Part Two is a spectacular piece of big-budget, major studio moviemaking from start to finish. Especially when compared to much of what constitutes a would-be blockbuster in the digital/streaming era, it’s a towering achievement in terms of how it looks, sounds and feels while unspooling in a darkened auditorium. As much as (relatively speaking) the likes of John Wick: Chapter 4 and Avatar: The Way of Water, it’s a “What’s your excuse?” call to arms. It also operates as a skewed relic of the mid-2000s when tentpoles as gorgeous (and varied) as Return of the King, Dead Man’s Chest and The Dark Knight regularly pushed the boundaries of what was possible within the medium. It has some of the same issues as its predecessor, specific to pacing, narrative redundancy and the whole “unfinished movie” thing, but good is not the enemy of perfect.  Beginning just after the previous picture, director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts spend the first reel or so reacclimating audiences to the visual and narrative tropes associated with the desert planet of Arrakis. There’s a lot of new lore and character reintroductions, but it’s delivered with a confident momentum and earned panache amid at least one cleverly staged action sequence involving falling bodies.  That readjustment applies to size and scale, as the visuals blend a tactile authenticity and toweringly imposing Imax-friendly scale that just makes the film seem *bigger*. That Villeneuve and friends treat this sci-fi pulp material with the solemnity of a Biblical epic gives the 165-minute epic a genuine sense of grandeur and pathos, even while we notice many of the tropes and narrative beats have been already appropriated in various films and shows that followed in Dune's wake.  The plot is as thin as you might expect, as A) it’s half of a single narrative tome and B) the presumption of further cinematic installments gives way to a certain indifference to resolution. Timothée Chalamet reprises as would-be savior Paul Atreides as he unites with the Fremen people to wage war against House Harkonnen (whose leaders bumped off most of his family). He also tries to avoid A) being positioned as a leader of these unfamiliar people and B) bringing about a prophecy that leads to tyranny and genocide.  Chalamet is excellent here, offering a nuanced and fiery star turn that positions him as a convincing action hero and makes good on Paul’s darker impulses and scarier behavior. We’ve had 20 years of promising young actors who break out via indie darlings and TV hits only to flame out when headlining a franchise blockbuster. While some of that may be the movies themselves (Dune Part Two > Battleship), Chalamet sacrifices little of his star power and charisma while playing in the tentpole sandbox.  The rest of the cast is fine and engaged, with Rebecca Ferguson playing complex notes as a wannabe mother-of-God and Javier Bardem offering a complicated portrait of a skeptic turned believer. Zendaya, while delivering more than what’s on the page, primarily provides romance and a moral counterbalance, while Florence Pugh gets what amounts to an extended cameo to set up the sequels.  However, like the first installment, Dune Part Two is a 2.5-hour movie that comparatively runs out of track 1.5 hours in and must slow-walk or jog in place until the (bemusingly identical-to-its-predecessor) action climax. That includes lengthy digressions with the villains, including a gleefully intense Austin Butler. He is introduced around 3.5 hours into a 5-hour epic merely to provide a last-minute hissable, sexually menacing bad guy for Paul to fight.  It would be almost an act of courage to end Dune here, presuming Dune Messiah will involve moral reckonings and explicit finger-wagging. Bemusingly, attempts to make this adaptation more inclusive than the 59-year-old book (while casting few, if any, MENA actors) rendered it more of a white savior power fantasy than intended. The film is obviously positioned as a cynical and pessimistic commentary on religious mania, absolute power and cult-like devotion amid circumstances where they represent an almost necessary evil.  However, movies that mock and belittle tyrants and deplorables – think Blazing Saddles or Jojo Rabbit – are less likely to be misconstrued than self-serious (varying quality notwithstanding) “bad thing is bad” dramas like American History X. It's the conundrum of empathetic films made by empathetic filmmakers consumed by unempathetic audiences. Granted, Joker came and went without incident, but I’m curious if Paul Atreides becomes the Scarface, Tyler Durden or Kylo Ren for a generation of misguided nerds.  That’s more of an observation than a criticism and another example of the challenges faced with adapting old material while making it palatable for modern social mores. Beyond its more complicated subtexts, intentional and accidental, Dune Part Two is still a hell of a popcorn flick. It suffers from many of its then-groundbreaking character arcs and plot twists appropriated by decades of blockbuster movies and shows.  Yes, it’s a little too serious for its own good, which plays out by being longer and less narratively disciplined. However, with the help of editor Joke Walker (who cuts the action scenes for maximum clarity), cinematographer Greg Fraser and composer Hans Zimmer, Denis Villeneuve has delivered an unusually polished and uncommonly accomplished piece of blockbuster tentpole filmmaking. Good is not the enemy of perfect, and much of Dune Part Two is very, very good.  If y'all thought the Youtube troll-industrial complex got worked up over the Last Jedi, get ready for Dune Messiah. As a massive fan of subversive art and jimmy rustling,  it's all going according to plan *tents fingers and chuckles evilly to himself.  Finally saw Dune 2…. Yeah it was alright I guess. Traded a lot of the substance for style. Lynch captured the feel of Dune better. This version was pretty literal and the psychedelia was too muted. Maybe it’s because I saw the 80s and 2000 version and read the book that I wasn’t particularly wowed. I don’t see how they match up Chani from this version to the Messiah version. But divorcing it from the book and seeing it as its own thing…. Yeah it was okay. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,A spectacular feat of science-fiction filmmaking&#44; marrying immersive world-building with engrossing storytelling&#46; 
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The biggest gotcha of 2021’s Dune—a movie full of spectacle and visual wonder—was that it was not a complete story. Most audience members were surprised by the ending, which set up a continuation of the story. And quite literally at that, with the final line being Zendaya’s Chani saying “This is a new beginning.” Now almost two and half years later the story finally gets its bigger and bolder sequel. Dune: Part Two picks up exactly where its predecessor left off, as in the next scene. From then on it manages to have the same rhythm, look and feel as the first one, for better or worse, as neither movie can stand alone. They should be taken together as one long five-hour adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel. Director Denis Villeneuve’s first major coup is in casting. Having Zendaya and Timothée Chalamet, two of the hottest young stars in the world right now, is not enough. He doubles the hotness—both in physical beauty and career trajectory—with Oscar nominees Austin Butler (Elvis) as Feyd Rautha, a new ruthless antagonist for Chalamet’s Paul Atreides, and Florence Pugh (Little Women) as Princess Irulan, a character that complicates the growing attraction between Atreides and Chani. In addition, most of the other actors from the first movie return, even if some cede the limelight to the newer characters. The script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, delves deeper into themes of religion and power. It’s a polemic about how religious power brokers manipulate people’s belief systems to gain power, something more than what audiences usually get in a Hollywood blockbuster. The story follows Atreides’ ascendance to lead the people of the dusty desert planet Arrakis against the forces of evil. It is straightforward enough and has all that is expected in such a movie: A requisite love interest, a violent nemesis, and the hero’s realization and embrace of their power. But it’s those aforementioned complicated themes that make it more than just a spectacle.  Visually, Dune: Part Two builds on what the first movie has offered. It looks similar, but everything is just a little bit more lavish and striking. The battles are bigger, the sandstorms more violent. When Chalamet, as Paul Atreides, finally gets to show off how he mastered riding the sand it makes for a truly exciting moment that will have many jump out of their seats. Unfortunately, when the story calls for thousands of people cheering, charging ahead, or surrounding the main character, they appear as visibly computer-generated effects. Hans Zimmer’s thunderous score is another impressive feat that adds dramatic heft to the proceedings. Yet the most memorable moments are the smaller hand-to-hand, sword-to-sword fights, and in particular a climactic one between Atreides and Feyd Rautha.  The screenplay tries to give Chani some complexity by turning her into the voice of the freedom fighters. However she still remains just the hero’s love interest, since the main narrative is primarily concerned with Atreides’ education as a leader, which is another rather simple story. That leaves the movie’s two stars stranded with nothing much to do except to pose and make intense eye contact at each other. At that, they are both fabulous and fulfill the promise of the first movie. Sometimes all a movie needs is just two good looking movie stars filling the frame with their presence. That leaves Butler to have all the fun. His Feyd Rautha is teetering on cartoonish evil. A bloodthirsty villain who kills for sport. The character is a psychotic menace, but the performance brings lots of macabre wit. It’s so over the top that it adds a much-needed hint of camp that punctures the seriousness of the rest of the endeavor. Butler takes everything up a notch, making the film more memorable and definitely much more entertaining. Sadly Pugh fares worst out of this quartet since her part is small and the character ends up being just a forgettable plot convenience. Rebecca Ferguson adds a hint of malevolence to the gravitas she brought to the first movie, continuing her role as Atreides’ mother and champion. Javier Bardem personifies the movie’s skepticism about religious fervor with humor. As blockbuster movies go, Dune: Part Two is a thrilling ride that totally earns its two-and-a-half-hour running time. The filmmakers add much-needed heft to their display of virtuoso filmmaking by adding serious real-life themes. However, there is a jarring disconnect between the words uttered by the film’s characters, many in Arabic or derivations of the Arabic language, and the actors uttering those words. With the exception of Souheila Yacoub and Zendaya, all of the main characters are played by actors of white European descent. No one is asking for literal casting in a fantasy movie, but when the story is clearly borrowing from myths and folklore from a particular part of the world, perhaps the casting could have been more diverse. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"  House Atreides strikes back in a blockbuster sci-fi sequel that surpasses the superb original with bold and stunning artistry. Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two shatters already sky-high expectations by immersing the viewer in a deeply layered, complex narrative. The film takes a Game of Thrones approach to the brutality, politics, and spiritual machinations of fiery revenge. Every cunning step forward negotiates a minefield of deadly ramifications. The battle for control of Arrakis and its powerful spice takes unexpected turns as a heroic protagonist wrestles with fate versus destiny. The cost of victory may be a burden too heavy to bear.   Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken), and disciple of the unscrupulous Reverend Mother, Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), sighs as she recounts the bloody slaughter of House Atreides. A bloodline that lasted countless generations and spanned the universe was annihilated in a horrific act of treachery. House Harkonnen, its repugnant leader Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), and his murderous nephew, Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), never declared war or fought with honor. They reasserted control of the spice trade by cutting throats under a veil of darkness. She ponders the consequences of their heinous crime.   But unknown to their gloating enemies, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), survived the slaughter. Paul's defeat and killing of Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) secured a shaky exile among the sand people of Arrakis, known as Fremen. Stilgar (Javier Bardem), the tribal leader of Sietch Tabr, knows his people are deeply suspicious of the foreign refugees, a Bene Gesserit witch and her defeated scion. House Harkonnen scours the planet looking for ""rats"" who escaped the purge. Paul and his mother have nowhere to hide. Stilgar decides to take them underground to the hidden Fremen sanctuaries.   Paul and Jessica's presence stirs controversy. Most Fremen want to ""give them back to the desert."" Others, including Stilgar, believe that Paul may be the Lisan al Gaib, a prophesied messiah that will unite the Fremen and return Arakis to its rightful owners. On the other hand, Chani (Zendaya) doesn't believe in myths or legends. But fortunately, Paul has proven himself to be a capable warrior, and he's sincere and willing to learn their ways. Meanwhile, Jessica senses an opportunity to be exploited. They have the chance to raise a new army against the Baron and Emperor. Paul must embrace the Fremen's religious fervor to reclaim his birthright — a decision he doesn't take lightly despite his anger and thirst for blood.   Dune: Part Two cuts no corners in its sweeping, near-three-hour runtime. Villeneuve (Sicario, Blade Runner 2049) explores events on other planets key to the developments on Arrakis; nothing happens in a vacuum. The intricate plot evolves like a web slowly ensnaring every character. Jessica, Princess Irulan, and the Bene Gesserit women try to be masters of puppets, attempting to control every thread in the tapestry. But Paul walks a path that's uniquely his own, with Chani's love igniting a passion that binds him to her people. Their enthralling romance raises the stakes. He understands the devastation that war will bring to the Fremen.   Paul's compassion is graphically juxtaposed with the ruthless methods of House Harkonnen. Their astonishing cruelty is thrown into overdrive after the bitter taste of comeuppance from his growing guerrilla campaign. The Baron's unleashing of his youngest nephew — the psychopathic fiend, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) — raises the savage stakes. Villeneuve uses a second-act deviation to portray the sinister other side. Your skin will crawl as the Harkonnen inner workings are brought to light. The Reverend Mother and another acolyte (Léa Seydoux) add tinder to these flames. Their arrogant villainy is utterly blind to Jessica's potent evolution. Her pregnancy leads to a transformative experience with a formidable companion.   It's evident that the entire cast and crew have done their work here exceedingly well. Dune: Part Twohas exquisite costumes, mind-blowing cinematography, and a striking production design that continually dazzles. Every ensemble character is unique in their setting. The Fremen have a distinct desert lifestyle akin to Berber nomads. The sharing of water, communal eating, and prayers in close quarters affirms a philosophy of fellowship overcoming hardship. The Emperor's lavish, colorful court is also completely different from the Harkonnens' hairless and pasty-white sadism. Different ways of life compete to prevail. Their clash of cultures fuels the epic and stupefyingly awesome action scenes.   Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts's script allows each actor to fully inhabit their roles, and this is the film's greatest tenet. Each performance is just so good. You're enthralled by winding journeys, it feels as though the characters are pieces on a chess board moving of their own volition. Where they end up is quite surprising, there are no easy answers here. Dune: Part Two is an extraordinary film that requires patience and an aptitude for abstract thought. But let it be known that the final shot is absolutely brilliant.   Dune: Part Two is a production of Legendary Pictures, Villeneuve Films, and Disruption Entertainment. It will be released theatrically on March 1st from Warner Bros.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. The chosen one is one of the most widely recognizable staples of genre fiction. Dune: Part Two takes an axe to the very concept of it.  Tim Blake Nelson may have a big role in next year's Captain America 4, but he could have also been part of this year's epic Dune sequel.  An ""unfilmable"" novel has finally made its way in full to the big screen. But dramatic liberties always have to be taken – here's what Dune 2 changed."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It&apos;s even more epic than the last&#46; Sound design&#44; costume&#44; and cinematography were firing on all cylinders&#46; This movie is the definition of why people go to the movies&#46; A must see&#46; 
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The easy shorthand for Denis Villeneue’s Dune: Part Two will be a comparison to The Empire Strikes Back. That’s both fair and staggeringly incorrect. George Lucas wishes his space opera was as complex as this, with its dark warnings about false prophets, imperialism, and the familiar danger of fascism. But this is undoubtedly a grim, bleak chapter full of rebel alliances, guerrilla tactics, heroes, and romance in the time of war. I’ve said it before that Frank Herbert’s Dune has never meant anything to me. I found his writing trite and the predictable result of an adaptation the comical 1980s movie we still ridicule. What Villeneuve, working with screenwriter Jon Spaihts, has done is lend gravitas and spectacle to the universe that Herbert created. Whether you love sci-fi or not, Dune: Part Two is simply a movie that cannot be missed. Picking up after the events of 2021’s Dune: Part One, we’re thrust into another jaw-dropping desert battle. Timothee Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, the apparent sole-surviving member of House Atreides, the noble house who saw their commitment to duty on the spice planet Arrakis be their downfall. The first movie, which equates to the first half of Herbert’s novel, introduced us to the conflict between Atreides and House Harkonnen. But the central struggle is taking place within Paul, who grapples with a duty he didn’t ask for and a prophecy thrust upon him. He never saw himself as a messiah figure, even as the Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem) saw it within him. That struggle takes a different shape in Part Two, as Paul becomes exposed to the mystical spice that saturates the planet. The schemes of his pregnant mother Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are steering Paul closer to acceptance of this fate, as the religious fervor of the Fremen grows with his every miraculous deed on the battlefield. And miraculous they are indeed, as Paul learns their ways and battlefield strategies like he was born to them. But as he grows more comfortable and arrogant with his position of power, it begins to push away Chani (Zendaya), the Fremen warrior who has grown to love the outsider despite herself. Paul is no Luke Skywalker. He’s a more complex figure than that, grappling as well with a desire for vengeance that could consume him. Dune: Part Two is a massive expansion of the first movie, with more characters, more storylines, and a vast increase in conflicting agendas. Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) moves the chess pieces around from the shadows to ensure the Bene Gesserit’s power, even if it means conspiring with the emperor (Christopher Walken) to wipe out House Atreides.  Meanwhile, his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), also a member of the Bene Gesserit because all women are apparently, is stuck in the middle. There’s also a small role for Léa Seydoux as a member of that secretive group, but it’s one of many that feels like a glorified cameo. The Harkonnens are in some ways crueler than ever, with the Baron’s (Stellan Skarsgard) lust for power pushing him to more destructive assaults on Arrakis. As legend grows surrounding Paul and his incredible feats, we see the power of such myth-making on the Baron’s nephew Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), whose spine has grown weak compared to his monstrous nature in the first movie. That leaves an opening for the psychotic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to prove himself in gladiatorial combat and ultimately in vicious attacks against the Fremen. For a film that largely takes place over a barren desert and vast seas of nothingness, Dune Part Two is jaw-droppingly beautiful. The sound booms in your ears as the thumper pounds sand to call the deadly sandworms. They are more crucial in this story than before, and feature in two of the most exhilarating moments that had me wanting to leap out of my seat like the Millennium Falcon’s heroic save in Return of the Jedi. Once again filmed by cinematographer Greg Fraser, the heavy use of shadow and light perfectly complements Hans Zimmer’s deafening, ominous tones. If anything, Dune: Part Two takes on too much and grows a bit unwieldy in the final act. The film grapples with so many big concepts in subplots that brutally collide that it’s easy to lose track of where the story is headed. There are teases of future Dune stories, which may or may not happen depending on how successful this film is, and at least one will mean absolutely nothing to casual moviegoers…despite the cameo appearance of an A-list actor in a key role. So much is happening that the love story between Paul and Chani feels cheated like there’s another cut where they get more focused attention. And while the eventual war on Arrakis is stunning for the level of technical detail and war choreography, it ends in rushed fashion with an anticipated showdown falling just short of expectations. At nearly 3-hours in length, you don’t feel any drag but you do leave feeling that Villeneuve has more that he wants to do. Did any of these small issues affect my enjoyment of Dune: Part Two? Not at all! I remain shocked by how awesome Villeneuve has made Dune, and how much he has made me care for the characters and this conflict. I mean, Timothee Chalamet believable as a fearsome warrior, lover, and savior? I believed all of it and am willing to accept anything and everything as long as Villeneuve presents it with the seriousness and deft command that he has presented all of Dune! He has created an exceptional film and a franchise that has set a new standard for sci-fi, one that will surely be copied in the way Star Wars was aped for decades after. If Villeneuve doesn’t want to return to make Dune: Messiah, Warner Bros. should do whatever it takes to make sure that he does."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is a visceral masterpiece and one of the best science fiction movies ever made. Besides delivering a visually impressive assault on all the senses, it’s also a riveting political thriller and character study that struggles with morality, religion and power. Director Denis Villeneuve guides every facet of the movie—costumes, production design, visual effects, sound—to the very top of its craft.  Dune: Part Two is a The Empire Strikes Back or The Return of the King-level event. A science fiction classic in the making that’ll inspire the next generation of science fiction and fantasy films. Denis Villeneuve continues his unblemished filmography. From the opening throngs of Hans Zimmer‘s score and saturated rust-colored first shot of the desert planet Arrakis, it’s impossible not to feel immediately transported. Like you were shot out of a rocket straight into a sand dune—ironic because we first encounter our protagonist (?) buried hiding in the sand. That’s partially thanks to director Denis Villeneuve‘s skillful world-building in the first half of the story that brings a detailed view of the future set out in Frank Herbert’s novel of the same name. But what sets Dune: Part Two apart is its absolute audacity of vision that often has your heart skipping a beat. Like the moment when a group of Harkonnen soldiers leap and gracefully float from a sand dune to a rocky plateau to escape an incoming sandworm. Villeneuve makes the moment one of effortless wonder. Like what is happening in front of us is completely normal and the most incredible feat we’ve ever seen before us—partially because it is.  There are countless moments like that throughout Dune: Part Two. There is the breathless battle sequence where suspected messiah Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya) along with the desert-born Freman people take down a Harkonnen-held spice mining operation or Paul’s jaw-dropping and anxiety-inducing wormriding rite of passage that involves… well, riding a giant sandworm. Both sequences feel like an assault on every one of your senses. It’s like you can feel the grains of sand whipping by your face when an army of Fremen-ridden sandworms blast through a sandstorm to the apparently inaccessible southern hemisphere of the planet.  It’s almost impossible not to overstate Villeneuve’s absolute cinematic achievement. It is perhaps the most visually impressive movie I’ve ever seen—a visual and auditory spectacle that is at times difficult to comprehend in the same way that I imagine audiences felt when seeing Star Wars or 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time. And just when you didn’t think it could surprise you any more, it introduces you to the black-and-white Harkonnen world as it explore the sadistic but intoxicating villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler is a terrifying scene stealer in a role that proves that Elvis wasn’t a fluke).  Admittedly, I’ve never read Frank Herbert’s book nor seen David Lynch’s much-maligned 1984 adaptation. And after watching the first part of Villeneuve’s adaptation I was confused why this story had to be retold. The story of Paul, an aristocracy-born and bred white man, tapped to lead an oppressed people against his own enemies wasn’t only formulaic but reductive. Hadn’t we advanced past the white savior narrative? So when Dune: Part Two takes a turn to the morally grey area I wasn’t just enthralled, I was impressed.  Throughout the movie, Paul is resistant to the label messiah. Not because of some internal imposter syndrome, but because he is prescient of the potential outcome if he embraces the label. That isn’t a new concept. What does feel fresh is the social and political implications of a messiah—or at the very least a leader that people see as the only way out. Dune: Part Two tackles the moral-quandary from many different angles. There’s the one of Paul who sees it as both a strategic blessing in his mission of revenge against the people that betrayed his family—mainly the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård)—and a curse that would betray his closest confidant Chani. There’s his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson who continues her enthralling complex performance) who works on behalf of the Bene Gesserit, a group that aligns itself with those that could best help their pursuit of power. There’s the aristocratic elite, the Emperor and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who are playing for their own relentless pursuit. And then there’s the Fremen, split into two groups. One that is seeing the messiah as their way out of struggle—particularly Stilgar (Javier Bardem)—and the other that see him as a threat to their pursuit of freedom.  In the middle is Chani, who wants to believe in the good she sees in Paul but worries that her infatuation is clouding her better judgement for her people. Zendaya has for years been bubbling to the surface as one of the great new talents of her generation. Dune: Part Two cements her movie star status. With interwoven plots that involve a meddling mastermind fetus, intergenerational feuds and a social and political game of colonization and power, it could have been easy for Dune: Part Two to buckle under the weight of its ambitions—it’s the reason Lynch’s movie and John Harrison’s miniseries adaptations failed. Instead, Villenueve finds a balance between engrossing political thriller and epic science fiction action that grabs for heart and mind and doesn’t let up through its entire surprisingly breezy runtime.  Dune: Part Two in many ways is the classic blockbuster spectacle with its intense battle sequences, ever unfolding world and characters that are held up as heroes. But the way it subverts the hero’s journey, in a way that angered many in The Last Jedi, is what makes it a classic-in-the-making that feels like it has the gravitas of The Empire Strikes Back or The Return of the King. Like those movies, I could see Dune: Part Two inspiring the next generation of great science fiction and fantasy stories. It is that singular. It is that impressive. It is that awe-inspiring.  Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut. I started Smash Cut in 2014 to share my love of movies and give a perspective I haven't yet seen represented. I'm also an editor at The New York Times, a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, and a member of the Online Film Critics Society. I kind of wish he would end it here.  Dune Messiah, IMHO, isn’t that great of a book.  I get it’s Paul’s conclusion, but really better to be explored on page than on the screen where most audiences want to see a satisfying ending.  If he really wants to get crazy with the moral philosophy and introspection, he could do a TV series combining Messiah, Children of Dune, and God Emperor.  I don’t see them working as films but a series would be less expensive and could really explore the themes."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL," fter Baron Harkonnen’s (Stellan Skarsgard) ruthless purge of House Atreides to take control of planet Arrakis’ priceless spice-mining operations, only Paul (Timothee Chalamet), his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and his unborn sister remain alive. Fleeing into the unforgiving sands of Dune, the trio are taken in by the Fremen, a native population of warriors and survivalists. As Jessica attempts to cement the idea that her son is the messianic figure prophesied in Fremen religion, Paul chooses to live and fight alongside the people, learning their customs and cultures and earning their respect. After proving himself in combat on numerous attacks against enemy strongholds, Paul is accepted into the Fremen’s society and falls in love with the proud and fierce fighter, Chani (Zendaya). When the Baron entrusts his psychotically vicious nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) with the task of quashing the rebellion, war breaks out. Enlisting both the clans of the north and south, Paul must lead a massive army into battle to decide the fate of a planet – and the future of a galaxy. “This world is beyond cruelty.” To get around the overdone voiceover narration that Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) – not seen in the last picture – might have been tasked with, here she records her thoughts on a computerized diary, which is certainly less clunky than in the 1984 adaptation (the rest of the film utilizes dream/nightmare sequences just like in the 2021 predecessor). Strangely, however, her vocal preface doesn’t include much at all about what happened in the first part of this massive tale, which means that audiences had better be well-versed in the previous two-and-a-half hours worth of content; virtually no reminders are in place for the specific events that led to Paul’s situation with the Fremen (and Chani), nor are there any clues about the interim undertakings of soldiers Lanville and Gurney, who reappear mysteriously. Nevertheless, it’s difficult not to get wrapped up in the visuals; the way in which the Dune novel’s many signature characters and adventures are realized are simply stunning. With all of the creative costumes, customs, cultures, languages, technology, beliefs, politics, weaponry, gadgetry, vehicles, methods of survival, and even physical characteristics/mutations, this isn’t just world-building, it’s universe-building. And Denis Villeneuve is undoubtedly right for the job, handling this often-proclaimed unfilmable franchise with an admirable blend of inventiveness and sincerity. Yet while he sticks relatively closely to the source material, he forgets to edit for viewers both unaccustomed to Frank Herbert’s work and unconcerned with an open-ended conclusion for the sake of banking on further sequels. The closing shots here are a major misstep, sapping a considerable portion of the satisfaction found from the last lines of the book. This second half does stay faithful to the first, as the music remains thunderous (though it’s once again a monotonic volume turned all the way up), the action scenes are intense (maybe even kicked up a notch from before), and the cinematography captures utterly striking imagery and framing. The villains tend to work against those highlights, however, with Rabban yelling his lines, Feyd-Rautha and the baron growling theirs or trading piercing stares, and all of the Harkonnen leaders killing subordinates to prove their nastiness. Plus, everyone from Giedi Prime dresses in high-contrast blacks and whites, surrounded by (or playing with) pointy things, like the bondage-enrobed demons from “Hellraiser.” A lot of it is almost comically weird and morbid, though the players tend to approach the scenarios resolutely; the casting definitely helps. In the end, “Dune: Part Two” aptly handles the commentary on blind faith and fanaticism, and how they might be twisted and manipulated by largely unseen, widespread tinkerers. It’s a bleakly realistic, topical exposé on faith, as flames are fanned to warp and corrupt outcomes and pawns (the string-pulling of bloodlines is similarly arresting). Of course, it takes far too long, excising a couple of details that might have been revelatory for the personas (particularly Jamis’ wife, since she would have tied into the ending), and adding a few that absolutely didn’t need to be included (such as extracting baby sandworm bile). With enough sci-fi wonderment and fervor to neutralize the slow-going segments, however, the production is undeniably epic in its scope and visual achievements. It’s just a shame that it took two lengthy movies to relate the story, and that the anticipated, worm-riding climax isn’t nearly as much campy fun as in David Lynch’s jumble of an attempt.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,An absorbing viewing experience and wholly immersive descent into sci-fi storytelling&#44; frequently sold with incredible magnitude&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Even as my understanding of Fremen and Harkonnens and Bene Gesserit becomes increasingly confused—to say nothing of trying to keep track of the mounting pile of names for Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet)—the spell cast by Dune and now Dune: Part Two continues to hold me enthralled. Must be the spice. You’ll have to look for a spirited defense of the movie’s snowballing narrative, as well as the complicated character motivations driving it, elsewhere. I’m here to tell you to set much of that aside, breathe in the precious spice that has brought warring parties to the desert planet of Arrakis, and simply take the trip. It’s not Paul and his perplexing quest to lead the indigenous Fremen in a defense of their world that captivates me about Dune: Part Two. Instead, it’s the sounds of whirring machines in vast, hollow spaces; the textures of the fabrics and armor worn by the massive cast of characters; and the ever-shifting, sifting play of sand and light on a planet that seems to exist of only those two things. (In some ways cinematographer Greig Fraser is as much the auteur of this series as director Denis Villeneuve.) Like its predecessor, Dune: Part Two gets in your nostrils, employing the sensuousness of cinema to put you—bodily—in a wholly original time and place. Beyond that sand, Part Two also incisively incorporates the unexpected element of water, presented here as precious, even holy. As a religious narrative, Part Two is a bit unsteady—at turns provocative and diffuse—but its use of water is wholly engrossing. Sucked from the corpses of slain enemies so that others might live or preserved from the bodies of lost compatriots to be added to a sacred well, water in Dune: Part Two has both an intriguing spiritual import and an earthly materiality. Beneath those dusty nostrils, you can feel it on your lips. (With Zendaya, given more to do this time but largely stuck in a perfunctory romance; Javier Bardem, adding gravitas but also, on occasion, a blessedly light touch; and Austin Butler, channeling all his Elvis charisma into a new villain, essentially a nightclub Nosferatu who’s picky about his knives.)"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Did we really expect anything less? The only major issue I can even find with Dune: Part Two, at least on its own terms, is that we had to sit through all of Dune: Part One just to get to the movie Denis Villeneuve actually wanted to make. It’s uncanny what a difference a sci-fi film with the gumption for honest-to-Paul set-up and payoff can do in the age of anti-sci-fi cinema.  As Dune: Part Two kicked off, the book-by-Frank-Herbert-reader in me who found Part One to be a pretty picture with bland writing couldn’t help but spiral with doubt and uncertainty. What am I supposed to feel when I look at Paul Atreides, played once again by brood-core afficionado Timothée Chalamet, the rich outcast forced into a Dances with Wolves meets Avatar meets The Lion King type situation? (Herbert published the book in 1965, to be clear). How do I unironically watch Paul struggle and scrap his way into the trust of a wary desert tribe of “Fremen” (free men, get it?) led by Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, who insists Paul’s their white savior messiah figure and all that.  Am I supposed to root for this kid dressed neck to toe in rubbery plot armor? Am I supposed to clap when he hooks up with Zendaya’s Chani, who watches him suspiciously at first but of course grows to love him?  Well, then Villeneuve swings in with, at last, a message worth grasping onto. Paul knows he’s a white savior in this middle-east-sci-fi and doesn’t just resist it, he both resents its shady origins and finds himself suckered into it all the same. He can’t help it. The mechanics of storytelling must appease the demands of the masses. By using his own manufactured mythic status to control others. Brilliant.  For a long time, Villeneuve’s pretty much been at war with sentiment, and with Dune: Part Two, it’s like he finally found the story that can communicate why that is. He found the story that adapts to the times while still faithfully adapting the source material, because it’s subtly self-aware about its own groan-worthy, tiresome implications. Even the iconic sandworms get their full due. Villeneuve penned this one with Jon Spaihts, and the duo certainly lucked out when Part One was just successful enough (on HBO Max) for Warner Bros. to let them go ahead and make a second (and maybe a third? Honestly, they could end it here just fine or keep going, either works). Many have already pointed out sand-nauseam about how hard it is to adapt Dune into a movie, with both Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch each failing in their own spectacular ways.  Now we live in an age of seemingly limitless computer effects where we can actually expect sprawling imagination to keep up with technological constraints. But let’s be real. The differentiator for Denis Villeneuve in this regard is that he doesn’t treat CGI like a bandaid, he looks at it as an art form unto itself. The man and his team truly get that you still actually have to make the world (digital or not) look and feel and sound like it has some creative gravitas. Sure, Hans Zimmer’s score overplays itself to the point of (slight) diminishing returns. Entire stretches of the film are essentially incoherent if you try to analyze them only from the dialogue. And we spend an inordinate amount of time in this 167-minute movie watching people silently moving around a desert planet with blue determination in their eyes and a chip or two on their shoulders, maybe even breathing huffily. But thanks to Villeneuve’s mastery of visual storytelling, complete with Greig Fraser’s unstoppable ability as DP to make science fiction look like a perfect blend of both science and fiction (see not just the last Dune, but also The Creator); well, you end up with a proper step forward for spectacle blockbuster filmmaking that can come out in March, November, May, December, whatever you want. The film doesn’t just raise the stakes of its blistering hero-messiah story. It expands the world/galaxy/universe with a heightened sense of who these people really are and what they want. Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård return as the brutish, conniving villains, but the film almost immediately pushes them to the side with the arrival of Austin Butler as their deranged, younger family member, who actually commands a big chunk of the film all to himself in order to effectively set up his ruthless, yet complex makeup (in more ways than one).  We also see Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Charlotte Rampling, and Léa Seydoux receive imperial politicking roles that do well to put the events happening in Arrakis within a plausible framework that adds much-needed urgency and context to how Paul’s actions steadily affect the outer worlds.  Even Rebecca Ferguson, who bristles early on in this film when it comes to her exact role in this story, blossoms into a bonafide force of Reverend Mother nature that does well to capitalize on her ability to mix vulnerability with savage confidence. Pretty much how I always envisioned Mother Mary, myself. On the one hand, you can maybe argue that audiences “aren’t prepared for what’s to come.” But that’s not entirely true. Part One certainly laid the necessary groundwork, and in some ways, the previous attempts at a Dune adaptation also set the stage in their meta-ways. The most exciting thing about Dune: Part Two isn’t even the movie itself, it’s the audacity of a filmmaker to stick the landing and effectively lay out a blueprint for how other seemingly “unmakeable” sci-fi novels can be culture-defining movies (not just TV shows, great as some are). And it goes beyond special effects and spine-chilling music. Sci-fi has to start with a message that is equal parts smart, biting, and maybe even a little full of itself.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,I know that people use this as a meme&#44; but&#44; whatever&#46; This is cinema&#46; This is why big screen cinematic experiences exist&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune Part Two is almost 3 hours long&#44; and it still left me wanting more&#46; Denis Villeneuve is back with another sweeping epic&#46; It has to be seen on the biggest screen and the loudest speakers&#44; and the Dolby Atmos version I experienced was shaking my seats&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on 'Dune: Part Two,' the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated novel. Pictured: Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and Zendaya as Chani. Denis Villeneuve is a master at creating intrigue in his films. He has a unique ability to make even the simplest scenes, such as characters walking or flying across sand, captivating. Villeneuve's passion for the world of Dune is evident in the attention he pays to every detail.  This is especially apparent in Dune: Part Two, which starts with an opening scene full of tension well beyond much of what’s seen in Part One. The main character, Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet), is fleeing with his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and the Fremen people (including Zendaya as Chani and Javier Bardem as Stilgar) on the desert planet of Arrakis. The House Harkonnen and their group of sybaritic no-goods (featuring Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen and Dave Bautista as Glossu “Beast” Rabban, Baron’s nephew) are on their trail, seeking to take over the planet and control its spice, the most valuable resource in the galaxy.  Part Two expands our understanding of the Fremen culture including their customs and way of life in the desert. They recycle their water and ride giant sandworms, making for some of the most exciting scenes in film recently. The movie's cultural immersion is similar to that of Avatar: The Way of Water. Additionally, you'll notice similarities in the creative and narrative elements with The Lord of the Rings, Foundation, and Star Wars, as well as some dark imagery paying homage to the otherworldly work of H.R. Giger (points if you know that history). Compared to Part One, there’s much more going on, but not so much that it’s overstuffed. The film will switch back and forth between what's happening on Arrakis with Paul's journey to lead the Fremen into war, Beast Rabban's struggle to gain the field, Feyd-Rautha's (Austin Butler) rise to become Baron's heir, and the commentary on everything by Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), a powerful ruler with a dynasty that's 10,000 years old. Villeneuve transitions smoothly from one storyline to the next without losing momentum. Each one is thematically rich and visually stunning, particularly Feyd-Rautha's black-and-white gladiator fights. Butler stands out among the cast effortlessly. From how he licks knives, smiles with black teeth, or roars with an intensity that would make Elvis shake and faint, he continues to impress with his range and talent. Don't worry — Part Two isn't as serious as its predecessor. Villeneuve invites more laughter and fun. While betrayal and tragedy were at the center of Part One, here, it's all about war and the joys and exciting thrills of Paul learning to become a leader. Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, the former warmaster for House Atreides, may be responsible for the rise in comedy. He delivers some of the best lines in the movie. The incredible performances are complemented by Greig Fraser's astounding camerawork and Hans Zimmer's exceptional musical score. The way they bring to life a world that is reminiscent of Shakespeare is likely to be studied. One impressive scene involves Feyd-Rautha walking down a dark hallway while fireworks light it up. However, it is more complex than it sounds. The hallway and Feyd-Rautha are in color, but the flashes of the fireworks from outside turn the image black and white. It's a subtle but extraordinary sequence. It’s clear that Villeneuve and his team thought about this film on a granular level with its exhilarating action and narrative heft. There is a lot to appreciate and anticipate. Hopefully, the third part, titled Dune Messiah, will be released soon because this is the epitome of cerebral entertainment.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," In 2021, director Denis Villeneuve brought us the first must-see big screen experience of the COVID-era (2020-??) in Dune, or more accurately, Dune: Part One. An ambitious adaptation of the first volume of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed sci-fi epic—which ranged across six novels from 1965 to 1985—Dune racked up eight Academy Awards in technical categories plus a Best Picture nod, all but guaranteeing that the Canadian auteur would get to complete his duology. Somewhere along the line, however, Villeneuve decided that he also wanted to adapt the second Dune novel, Dune: Messiah, and in so doing has effectively turned Dune: Part Two into the second chapter in a trilogy. As a result, despite reaching the conclusion of the first novel’s plot, Dune: Part Two deliberately leaves an assortment of dangling threads that will leave you either tantalized or frustrated. DUNE: PART TWO ★★1/2 (2.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Denis Villeneuve
Written by: Denis Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts
Starring: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Léa Seydoux, Souheila Yacoub, Stellan Skarsgård, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem
Running time: 166 mins. Dune: Part Two picks up almost immediately where Part One left off, with the young Duke Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, the mystic Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), hiding from their political rivals on the arid planet Arrakis. Though their noble house has been exterminated by order of the jealous Padishah Emperor (Christopher Walken), Paul and Jessica now have an even more powerful force on their side — the religious fervor of Arrakis’ downtrodden desert dwellers, the Fremen. All signs point to Paul being the Fremen’s long-awaited messiah, but that’s only because his mother’s ancient religious order has been weaving and selectively fulfilling prophecies across the galaxy as a means of control. Paul is plagued by visions of a galactic holy war in his name, but can he avenge his old family and liberate his new one without fulfilling his terrible destiny? Despite beginning halfway through Frank Herbert’s novel, the first third of Dune: Part Two genuinely works as an opening act, establishing a new sense of home and family amongst the Fremen. The kooky but honorable Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) becomes Paul’s mentor and most ardent apostle, a very different father figure from Oscar Isaac’s statuesque Duke Leto from Part One. Romance blooms between Paul and the pragmatic warrior Chani (Zendaya), who sees the prophecy for the political tool that it is. We see Paul and the Fremen wage a bold guerilla war against the ruthless Harkonnen regime, training and bonding between battles, while the Harkonnen overseer Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) curses their names with a wild but impotent fury. This classic Hollywood adventure movie simplicity doesn’t stick around long (nor should it), but it’s fun while it lasts, and it provides a bedrock for the rest of the film’s weirdness and intrigue. The trouble comes any time the narrative escapes the confines of the planet Arrakis to take a broader view of galactic politics. The film opens with the introduction of Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), whose writings are scattered throughout the original novel to provide exposition and a historical perspective on Paul’s campaign. That’s essentially the same role Irulan plays here. She pops her head up occasionally, but she has little impact on the story and seems to exist in this movie primarily to set up a larger role in the next film, which would adapt Herbert’s Dune: Messiah. The same could be said for Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux), who fulfills the role prescribed for her by the novel but serves almost no purpose in the film. Anyone rushing out to see Dune: Part Two out of love for either of these acclaimed actresses will be as disappointed as Zendaya fans were by Part One. Even the continuing story of Lady Jessica—one of the highlights of the first film—feels like a drag on the narrative here, as the payoff to her bizarre pregnancy is kicked down the road for a potential sequel. Dune: Part Two repeatedly sheds momentum, something that no 166-minute epic can afford to lose. Though its plot may be tangled and winding, Villeneuve and his award-winning production team have outdone themselves with Dune: Part Two’s visuals. Building on their work in the first film, each of the film’s alien worlds has a distinct and lived-in aesthetic, particularly the Harkonnen homeworld of Geidi Prime, which is painted in a stark monochrome by its strange black sun. The battle scenes are much more legible here than in the previous installment, where the Atreides and Sardaukar forces were sometimes impossible to tell apart. (Shout out to fight coordinator Roger Yuan, who also plays a featured role as one of Feyd-Rautha’s victims.) The deserts of Arrakis are as stunning as ever through the lens of cinematographer Greig Fraser, and the visual effects team once again demonstrates that CGI doesn’t need to be gaudy or intrusive. Nevertheless, despite its naturalistic “space opera for grown-ups” visual aesthetic, Dune: Part Two’s emotional intensity is cranked up to melodramatic levels, especially when compared to its predecessor. Part One focused on quiet palace intrigue, and no performance in Part Two is as layered or interesting as Oscar Isaac’s or Rebecca Ferguson’s were in the previous chapter. This is to be expected, as the palace intrigue has now exploded into open war, but it also has something to do with the percentage of characters in this volume who are either in the process of losing their minds or have already done so. Both Paul and Lady Jessica are less steady on their feet thanks to their respective psychic ailments, while the villains — particularly Austin Butler’s Fayd-Routha — are psychotic monsters with goofy voices. While there’s nothing wrong with a sci-fi blockbuster being silly or pulpy, it’s at odds with the tone established in Part One, which is theoretically the first half of this same movie. Perhaps it was inevitable that the conclusion to Dune would feel strangely paced or incomplete, and these criticisms aren’t entirely fair. After all, the novel’s ending isn’t exactly “happily ever after,” and this adaptation takes pains to clarify that we are not supposed to applaud when the credits start rolling. Still, it’s disappointing that Dune: Part Two should, like its predecessor, not so much end as simply stop. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Is being near the proximity to power too hard to resist? Can the themes of prophecy and revenge overpower even the purest of minds? If Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 Dune is viewed more as an appetizer to Frank Herbert’s massive world of spiritual, physical, and theological warfare, then Dune: Part Two sinks its teeth deeper into what all that means. When we last left this story, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), had joined the Fremen on the desert planet Arrakis after the assassination of Duke Leto (Oscar Issac) by The Harkonnen. Villeneuve, together with Hans Zimmer’s score and the camera work of Greig Fraser, meets that end with a sort of dream-like romanticism. The course for Paul to become the Muad’Dib is in place; he’s found Chani (Zendaya), who is due to become someone he falls in love with, and ultimately, the Fremen will be led to triumph over the indiscriminate cruelty of The House Harkonnen. Everything seems like it’s lining up precisely in place, and that’s exactly the complex problem this second film strives to tackle. To view Dune: Part Two is to know that you’re going to experience a lot of different points of view heading to the same uneasy center. At the heart of the matter, Paul is doing his best to try to assimilate into the culture of the Fremen — all the while, he’s receiving visions of death and destruction if he ventures off to the southern part of Arrakis. The Fremen are justifiably suspicious of him (how would you feel if someone from another walk of life came into your culture ordained to save you?). At the same time, leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) has unshakable faith in what Paul is supposed to become. In the middle is Chani, who believes the Freman must rely on themselves as their means of salvation. Meanwhile, she sees Paul has a sincerity residing inside of him. This is where the mode of storytelling Villeneuve is critical, and it works on both the small and large scales of the ramifications of choice. There is this war inside Paul, but the forces outside him almost dictate his steps in the future. This is where Dune: Part Two utilizes its impressive cast to ensure the story’s layers shine through. Fergusion’s portrayal of Lady Jessica becomes more pronounced during the character’s pregnancy and ascension to being a prominent figure within the Fremen religious sect. She embodies all the ways religious conversion happens as she sets off on her own path to “spread the gospel” of what the Bene Gesserit sees for Paul. She’s dead set on seeing her son’s elevation while forging a connection with the baby still growing inside her womb. While The Harkonnen were on top in the first installment, forging war on a foreign land has proven unfruitful. Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) has been considerably weakened, and his nephew Glossu Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) has been taking loss after loss. In a desperate attempt to cling to power, Baron looks to his other nephew, the warrior/sociopathic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), to be a successor to the throne. In the background are Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). Irulan’s character almost serves as the narrator of the future to come within this story, much like in the novel. As she’s aware of what is taking place, she’s caught between the wishes of two figures. There’s her father, desperately clinging to whatever power he has, and Bene Gessert Revered Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) orchestrating all sorts of things to keep the “bloodline” going. Within the two hour, 30-minute plus time frame of this film, Villeneuve splits time between the backdoor dealings to stop the coming of the Messiah and some grand battles that occur on the sands of Arrakis where the Fremen make mince meat out of the Harroken’s extensive machinery. To the credit of Villeneuve and Fraser, they join forces to make the worlds feel distinct. You can almost feel the heat radiating from the sand of Arrakis and perhaps get a foreboding sense of dread from the black-and-white gladiator competition within the land the Harkonnen inhabit. You gain a sense of elation from seeing Paul able to ride a sandworm as the coordination of him entirely discarding the life he once lived. All of this comes with a sense of caution that I feel Dune: Part Two may have underestimated as being its centerpiece. Paul is the planet that everything orbits around, but what he personifies to different people is the most compelling thing about Dune: Part Two. In terms of what’s to come, Chalamet spends much of his energy trying to show that Paul is torn between two words. The budding love story between Paul and Chani is the factor that is supposed to drive that principle home the most. Zendaya’s acting grows stronger as the film goes on, and he gets to witness her tribe subscribe to this religious story. Bardem also does a fantastic job with Stilgar to show how intoxicating religious promise can be. But there’s a particular point where you notice that everything is inevitable, and the smell of how sweet the throne can be might be too irresistible even to the cleanest of souls. The sudden return of Paul’s mentor, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), serves as a human indicator of how the past can shape the road ahead. While Dune: Part Two exits on a cliffhanger (more like a completion to the first book), much like the first, those endings feel much darker, speaking to those who are viewed as saviors and the others who get to play the followers. In Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, the bad guys have all the good guys on the ropes. Here, there’s something even more insidious at play that Villeneuve scratches at.  It sees a future where a strand of religious fanaticism embodied within a single person can turn a world and its culture inside out from within. It’s also the proclamation that in the long game of rule, nobody’s hands end up clean no matter what you intend to do because that’s not how power works.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," For all its influence and vision, Frank Herbert’s original Dune novel never quite hit the note the author intended. With its sweeping sci-fi vistas of desert worlds and space age T.E. Lawrences, it’s easy to see why some readers got lost in the adventure of it all—or simply extracted those fun bits for their own riffs on galaxies far, far away. Still, it was never Herbert’s goal to pen a white savior narrative about Paul Atredies, a boy hero plagued by prophecies of genocide. After viewing the second volume of Denis Villeneuve’s grand but immensely foreboding adaptation of Dune, it’s safe to say that no one will make that same mistake about this work. Dune: Part Two is, to be sure, a profound cinematic achievement, a dense and richly layered spectacle that immerses you into strange worlds and fantastic ideas. But Villeneuve’s world of Arrakis is truly strange this time around. It’s also cruel, esoteric, and ultimately despairing. All of which makes for a splendid stage for a great tale, but in Villeneuve’s hands, one reader’s adventure yarn becomes this filmmaker’s operatic tragedy writ large enough to spill across an IMAX screen. The seemingly doomed hero of this passion play is once again young Paul (Timothée Chalamet, fully embracing a chic messiah complex). As a quick reminder, the last film left Paul as the new patriarch and duke of his beloved House Atreides—but only because the great feudal dynasty was nearly wiped out by their grotesque rivals in House Harkonnen. In the aftermath, Paul and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) were forced to flee into the desert where they might be adopted by a native tribe of desert dwellers called Fremen… or they might be killed by them. Yet the real subversive brilliance of Herbert’s story—which Villeneuve brings to the forefront of the movie—is that the only thing keeping Paul and Jessica alive is one uncomfortable manipulation: Jessica’s coven of space witches, the Bene Gesserit, has spent centuries brainwashing local, impoverished populaces like the Fremen into believing in messiahs and chosen one prophecies. To simply see the son of a Bene Gesserit—and his witchy mother—come in from the desert is enough to seduce fanatics like local chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and to at least intrigue the younger generation of skeptics, such as the warrior woman of Paul’s dreams, Chani (Zendaya). Paul thus finds himself quickly going native, but only insofar as it brings him several steps closer to leading these people against House Harkonnen’s vile Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), and even the Imperium’s Emperor (Christopher Walken), who secretly condoned the murder of Paul’s father. But each move toward revenge Paul makes, with Jessica whispering in his ear to embrace the messianic complex and the holy war it will surely unleash, the closer Paul comes to becoming anything but a hero. The complexity of Paul’s journey from vengeful son to bloodstained warmonger is Dune: Part Two’s strongest narrative element, and one that Villeneuve and Chalamet handle with care. After decades of Chosen One narratives, including in the most famous cinematic space opera which owes substantially to Dune, we return to the original idea: an inversion and warning about such tidy images promulgated by leaders and prophets. Chalamet was good in the first film at playing a wronged son; he’s better here at portraying a man struggling with a more monstrous foe—his own vanity. Yet the success of Villeneuve’s Dune duology emanates from no single story beat or theme, but rather the collective tapestry they weave. While the general gist of the story is simple, both films retain a novelistic structure and texture, making room for fascinating vignettes and detours like the scholarly pursuits of Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the astute daughter of Walken’s emperor and a Bene Gesserit in training who has her own suspicions. There is also her weirding sister Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux), who is sent to the Harkonnens’ home world to inspect the next generation of that family. And, indeed, the most magnetic new addition to the mythos is the Baron’s hitherto unknown nephew and heir apparent, a reptilian Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. Introduced as a cosmic riff on Gladiator’s Commodus, Feyd celebrates his birthday by slaughtering handicapped and drugged prisoners of war in a monochrome arena. He also literally feeds underlings to his vampiric paramours. It’s a big black hat that the former Elvis actor wears like a debauched rockstar who’s gone feral. In a film filled with showy performances, this is the star turn. But the real star, again, is not any single piece but the impressive whole Villeneuve weaves. In fact, despite the film’s nearly three-hour length, there is not enough time to fully explore every curious nook and cranny. We personally could have spent a lot more time with Lady Jessica’s increasingly ambiguous machinations and her relationship with a still unborn daughter. However, when it’s the overarching vision which compels, this becomes more virtue than sin. Like the first volume of Villeneuve’s Dune, Part Two sharply chooses to imagine a future with a deep wealth of history. Despite existing in a tomorrow where interstellar travel is possible, this cinematic telling embraces the fact that Herbert’s universe is one married to the old ways, be it through feudal fiefdoms or how folks are still fighting, dying, and drilling for special resources to make their vehicles go vroom. There is a weight and tactility to the film that emphasizes stone and wood as much as sleek metal and glistening chromatic surfaces. The emperor’s spaceship tellingly looks like a cross between a Pokéball and something Natalie Portman would’ve used in the Star Wars prequels. But on Arrakis, the Fremen’s customs and sacred temples have the scent of antiquity about them. It’s a veritable playground for production designer Patrice Vermette and costume designer Jacqueline West, the latter of whom extrapolates medieval couture from a story of princesses and dukes, and sand-swept madness in tales of religion and the desert. Villeneuve captures all of this on the vastest scale, losing himself in sandy seas, as well as the most aloof or sinister of details. Viewers are never told why exactly the Baron has a steady stream of dead young bodies in his quarters, or what exactly it means when a pregnant woman drinks from the bodily fluids of a great sandworm. The specificity of things can go by unexplained because their cumulative, overwhelming effect is the point. The film is a feverish dream of another world that feels as real and elusive as sand slipping through your fingertips. It’s not entirely knowable, but the impression you’re left with is that you have been transported to a bleak, oppressive fantasia. It’s a place one would never want to be, and yet you do not want to leave. That such an uncompromising vision could be made as a modern blockbuster, and that something so ultimately chilling (even with all that sun) will be embraced by a global audience, is fascinating. This is the kind of monumental moviemaking that has beguiled audiences since the dawn of cinema, but Villeneuve has spiced his vintage with a madness befitting Paul, the voice from the outer world."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Part Two surpasses the first in almost every way&#46; It is a technical masterpiece&#44; as expected&#44; but even the writing is a step up&#46; It left me with this beautiful feeling that I had just experienced something truly special&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," For starters, I can’t believe director Denis Villeneuve pulled off the big scene in “Dune: Part Two” in which Timothée Chalamet learns to ride the world’s largest pool noodle. True, the story of “Dune” offers some built-in possibilities for success with such a potentially ridiculous scene. This two-hour, 46-minute continuation of the 2021 “Dune” is the sandiest movie since “Lawrence of Arabia.” This means whirlwinds and sandstorms worthy of Frank Herbert’s massive hunk of trippy science fiction lit, which in turn means lots of dramatic visual texture – all the better to disguise as well as complement the sequel’s extraordinarily sophisticated blend of digital and practical design elements. As the budding anti-colonialist revolutionary Paul Atreides, Chalamet risks life, limb and career embarrassment, faking like he’s getting his balance against considerable headwinds and near-zero visibility atop a particularly gargantuan sandworm on the move. He’s clobbered with everything the sound designer, the composer, the editor, the cinematographer and the effects armies have created, and it’s chaotic bordering on “Wait, what am I looking at?” And then a smile comes over your face because the scene is actually working, and you believe it. There are many flights of fancy in director David Lynch’s certifiably insane 1984 “Dune,” but in that one, the “ride ’em, wormboy!” scene does not work. This one works, because Villeneuve and his tiptop digital and practical design wizards are the best we have working in modern movies. These first two “Dune” films really are gorgeous. They don’t look or behave like any comparable, massively budgeted contemporary studio enterprise, whether it’s a Marvel or a “Star Wars” derivative. Now: Is “Dune: Part Two” my thing? Does the bloody fall of House Atreides and the vengeful rise of messiah-in-training Paul Atreides, played by Chalamet; the battle for domination over the spice harvesting business on the desert planet Arrakis; and the machinations of the Emperor of the Universe (Christopher Walken, but of course we knew that already) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world? And what about the political and romantic alliance between Paul and Chani, the fierce Fremen warrior fighting for her people? Chani is once again played by Zendaya, who actually has things to do and say in “Dune: Part Two.” Javier Bardem returns, too, with an expanded presence, as Fremen leader Stilgar, heading the revolt against the invading Harkonnen. With a different filmmaker I’d say no, not my space jam. I read the first “Dune” novel only in prep for the 2021 film, and I fought it most of the way. But director and co-writer Villeneuve, whose previous works include, on the high end, “Incendies” (2010) and “Arrival” (2016), uses the screen to imagine technological and otherworldly amazements, and treat them matter-of-factly. A movie can strip source material for parts, and its own needs, and still capture its essence. When the dragonfly-styled helicopters known as ornithopters reappear for duty in “Dune: Part Two,” they’re just as terrific as they were in “Dune 1.” The sequel features more and larger battles and mayhem, though it also features lots of murmuring strategy in extremely dark corridors. Among the new wrinkles: There’s an old-school scene of Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha, the nephew of the unsightly Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), in gladitorial-style combat against three surviving Atreides soldiers. It’s part of a section in the movie depicted in monochrome black-and-white. That’s life under a black sun — a cinematographer’s dream! The inspired Greg Fraser returns as director of photography on “Dune: Part Two,” along with all the other key visual collaborators from the 2021 success.) Take away all the larger power plays, and at heart the movie’s a study in how the younger generation, nearly 11,000 years in the future, is still learning to maneuver around their know-it-all elders. Like Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson enjoys a larger share of the storyline this time. As Lady Jessica, the now-widowed pregnant mother of Paul, she communicates telepathically with her newborn daughter while movin’ on up to the Bene Gesserit order of mystics who foresaw Paul’s destiny before anyone else in the universe. She’s pushing her kid to fulfill that destiny; meantime the oil-slicked blob Baron Harkonnen sees in his nephew (Butler) a bloodthirsty psychotic — we know this because on first reference, someone says “he’s psychotic” — and the logical heir to his corner of the universe. This isn’t Butler’s biggest screen role to date, but it’s his most effective by a long shot, and he gives the sludgier passages of “Dune: Part Two” a needed jolt. Also, it’s very gratifying for a film so dependent on digital effects to lean into more traditional methods for a first-rate duel between Feyd-Rautha and Paul, staged, edited and executed like something out of Act 5 of “Hamlet.” What we have here, in the end, doesn’t end anything — no film in which the last lines include “the holy war begins!” could pretend otherwise. This is a middle-chapter installment, landing on the same note of “to be continued, if business is good” as the previous “Dune.” What Villeneuve and company achieve in “Dune: Part Two” is every bit as impressive and, in its peak imagery, hypnotic as part one. And, yes, frustrating. Even fans have to concede that Villeneuve’s facility for cinematic movement has its limitations (glaring in the dull finale of “Blade Runner 2049,” for example). So “Dune: Part Two” is not marvel of narrative momentum. It’s going for something else. Rewatching the 2021 movie earlier this week reminded me of just how much of an aesthetic outlier Villeneuve is these days. He shows us sights to behold, truly and consistently. As for Chalamet, he remains effective in his murmuring-brook way. It’s a mite low-key for the character’s circumstances, as well as for the movie’s massivity. On the other hand, he’s easy to take, and the “Boy from the Outer World” has a lot on his mind, which is plagued by horrifying psychic visions of what’s to come if “Dune 3” gets the go-ahead."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"  The task of adapting Frank Herbert's Dune was never going to be easy, but Denis Villeneuve chose to do it twice and managed to pull it off. Dune: Part Two is an awe-inspiring sci-fi spectacle and a devastating collision of myth and destiny on a galactic scale. In returning to the world of Arrakis, Villeneuve has crafted one of the bleakest modern blockbusters as Timothée Chalamet's Paul Atreides falls into a well of prophecy. Even in sacrificing some of what gives Dune its signature weirdness, Villeneuve brings Herbert's work to life in a way that feels definitive.  Dune: Part Two is the sequel to Denis Villeneuve's 2021 film that covers the novel's events by Frank Herbert. The movie continues the quest of Paul Atreides on a journey of revenge against those who slew his family. With insight into the future, Atreides may be forced to choose between his one true love and the universe's fate.   Dune: Part Two has a sense of dread that lingers over it like the sand that coasts over the desert. Instead of a looming attack from a rival house, though, the dread is much more existential as Paul is fighting against destiny itself. Upon joining the Fremen, Paul is pulled in two directions. He eagerly shrugs off Bene Gesserit prophecy in favor of simple revenge, but Fremen factions fight over his place in their society and, in his willful ignorance, Paul misses what was true all along: His mother and the manufactured Kwisatz Haderach prophecy are too powerful to be ignored.   It's a terrifying thing to behold as Paul becomes a willful victim of fate, but, as the gom jabbar test proved, he's not one for impulsive decisions. Paul's turn from fighter to leader, from reluctant prophet to full-blown messiah, is a decision he makes with full knowledge of the personal and political consequences. It's a big ask from Villeneuve, as it was from Herbert decades ago, and the director's take on Paul is slightly more sympathetic than the author's.   Dune was long considered un-adaptable for a myriad of reasons — its dense world full of otherworldly technology seemed nearly impossible to realize visually, but it's the internal worlds of its main characters that seemed most difficult to bring to life. In changing key parts of the novel, though, Villeneuve makes Paul's reluctant pivot towards fundamentalism all the more tragic. Zendaya's Chani serves as a perfect foil for Paul and her chemistry with Chalamet sells what would feel a bit thin otherwise in the first half of the film.   Ultimately, it's Lady Jessica and Feyd-Rautha that reveal the true terror of unfettered belief. Watching Rebecca Ferguson stride through the Fremen's desert hideaway as she whispers to her fetus could easily fall into caricature if it weren't so chilling. As she embraces the role of Reverend Mother and pushes Paul towards his fate, the lines between prophecy and family begin to blur, recalling a pivotal conversation between Duke Leto and Jessica about protecting Paul. Jessica, in her own way, is protecting her son, but to shield someone in mythology is to invite different dangers.   One of those dangers is Feyd-Rautha, a bald and eyebrow-less Austin Butler oozing with insanity. Paul and Feyd have more in common than either of them would admit, and their intertwined destinies make the inevitability of Paul's visions that much clearer. Dune: Part Two's scenes of Giedi Prime expand Herbert's world in visually arresting ways — the black-and-white effect produced by the planet's black sun feels harsh against the warm earth tones of Arrakis and a scene between Lea Seydoux's Lady Fenring and Feyd manages to be terrifying and sexy, an effect Butler is clearly aiming for (and pulls off).   Paul's quest for revenge against the Harkonnens is the driving force of the first half of the film, and it allows Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser to show off the true desert power Duke Leto kept on about in Part One. They nail every element of the world that was teased or glimpsed briefly in 2021: Villeneuve's sand-bound action is as impressive and foreboding as the angular Arrakeen palace — Fremen silently erupt from below the sand to knife their enemies and Spice harvesters explode with world-shattering might.   The scale of the first film is multiplied tenfold with extended visits to Giedi Prime, Kaitan, and the supposedly uninhabitable southern deserts of Arrakis, all against the backdrop of grand tragedy and revenge — something that, as Jessica points out, Paul's father would reject. It's an early indicator that, despite his best intentions, Paul will fall prey to the plots at play.   Through Dune: Part Two, this revenge morphs into something deadlier and more monumental, and, in the desert of Arrakis, Paul is eventually forced to choose between holy war-inducing survival or the end of everything he has come to love. Alongside Chalamet's transformation, Javier Bardem's Stilgar goes from skeptic to disciple as his unbridled thirst for prophecy realized overtakes any logic that Paul or Chani attempt to thrust upon him.   It's the perfect encapsulation of the thematic center — it doesn't matter whether the Kwisatz Haderach is a manufactured myth. No matter what anyone does, Paul is always going to confirm the Fremen fundamentalists' belief in the messiah, leading to billions of casualties across the imperium. His acceptance of this fate is perhaps the most terrifying thing of all in Dune: Part Two, and it's hard to overstate just how impressive Villeneuve's film and Chalamt's performance really is.   It's an epic science-fiction tale told in a visual language that is both uncomfortably intimate and imposingly grand, a terrifying thing that you can't look away from and perhaps one of the best book-to-screen adaptations of all time.

A huge part of Dune: Part Two’s story centers around the prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib; what is the prophecy and how does it apply to Paul Atreides?"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," In an era when old sci-fi war horses Star Trek and Star Wars have stalled their big screen outings, and, at a time when sequels and reboots galore die at the box office, thank God for Dune Part Two. Director Denis Villeneuve completes his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved novel in the kind of immersive cinematic experience moviegoers cry out for. Like Barbie and Oppenheimer last year, at last, audiences have a reason to return to the cinema for both an engaging story and movie that relishes being a movie. This is the best page-to-screen adaptation since The Lord of the Rings. The transition from 2021’s Dune to this continuation feels seamless. Part Two picks up where the first film left off: Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca Ferguson) have escaped death at the hands of House Harkonen, disappearing into the vast deserts of Arrakis. The pair meet up with a group of desert dwellers called “Fremen,” led by the grizzled Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Paul feels an immediate connection with Stilgar’s daughter Chani (Zendaya), and begins to learn the ways of desert life. Jessica, meanwhile, agrees to become the tribe’s new Reverend Mother, a religious psychic, in exchange for allowing her and Paul to join the tribe. Jessica’s decision, however, has some radical, unintended consequences. Fremen have long held believed in the prophecy of a messiah—a son born to a Reverend Mother, who, unlike other men, could also command similar psychic powers. In order to survive among the Fremen, both Paul and Jessica do their best to appear to fulfill the prophecy. Paul begins leading Fremen attacks on Harkonen troops, which prompts Baron Harkonen (Stellan Skarsgård) to send his psychotic nephew, Feyed (Austin Butler) to Arrakis in hopes of ending the resistance with brutality. Dune Part Two has a lot going on, though the script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaiths makes all the events, intrigue and cultural dynamics easy to follow. It helps that the director hits his stride in the first frames of Dune Part Two—everything here gels and flows with the original film with astonishing smoothness, especially considering that the new movie shot years after the first, and after the pandemic. That self-assuredness really shows in the elements of Herbert’s novel Villeneuve chooses to highlight. Dune Part Two has a more action, ranging from terrorist raids, to warring armies to hand-to-hand knife combat. Without giving too much away, the climax of the film features a knife fight between two characters. Staged without music and in medium shots, the scene takes on a visceral power—the same kind of cringe-inducing realism that makes the fights in a film such as Raging Bull captivating. Consider, for a moment, what it says that a scene of hand-to-hand combat has so much resonance in a movie full of spaceships, giant worms and surreal planetary environments. In Dune Part Two, Villeneuve has emphasized human drama as much as his special effects. Villeneuve also meditates on a philosophical notion with his narrative. Frank Herbert’s Dune always included the element of Paul posing as a god-like figure, though the author treated it more as a plot device. Dune Part Two goes even further: Jessica urges Paul to lean into the messiah template, only to begin to believe that Paul might actually be the foretold savior after all. The same goes for Zendaya’s Chani, or even Paul himself, who at first rejects any notion of saviorhood. But if Paul does fulfill the prophecy, does that actually make him God incarnate? Can a man choose to become a god? Can a false prophecy become true? Though Dune Part Two preoccupies most of its runtime with space opera action, the kernels of this meditation on faith and religion permeate its narrative, elevating the narrative beyond mere space opera. The movie asks questions about power, manipulation, and the ethics demanded in wielding them—questions Villeneuve has the good sense to leave unanswered. These underpinnings also help set up an adaptation of Herbert’s second novel Dune Messiah, a film Villeneuve has said he wants to make. (The appearance of an unbilled, A-List actress as a pivotal character from that novel also hints that the director and Warner Bros. will charge full steam ahead in developing a third movie.) As with Dune Part One, Villeneuve, working with cinematographer Greig Fraser, conjures up jaw-dropping images of the desert. Watching Dune Part Two feels more like watching a National Geographic documentary than it does a sci-fi opus. It also helps that the director works hard to differentiate Dune from the look of other franchises—a tremendous feat, considering how many other sci-fi movies, including Star Wars, pillaged from Herbert’s novel. Dune Part Two showcases new kinds of places—planets with black suns, where fireworks look squirted by an incontinent squid, or spherical spaceships covered in mirroring. Whatever it says, everything here looks so real viewers will have a hard time figuring out where the set ends and the effects begin. The actors, for their part, also seem to love reveling in Villenuve’s world. Bardem has a ball here, reveling in his character’s grit and fanaticism. Butler goes way out into orbit as Feyd, giving a performance so wild and unhinged that it seems destined to invite parody. Zendaya gives her best performance to date, a mix of fury, empathy and stunning physical strength. Chalamet matches her every step of the way the chemistry between them concocting one of the most charged screen romances in some time. Dune purists might complain about certain changes to the material. Villeneuve truncates the original narrative from seven or so years to about eight months. That means reducing the appearance of a key character, though the director makes her presence felt throughout. Others might accuse him of wasting great actors—Christopher Walken, Florence Pugh, Léa Seydoux—in minor roles. In the case of the three aforementioned performers, each plays a pivotal role, and makes the most of their screentime. Pugh, in particular, makes a strong impression, in part because Villeneuve has expanded her role from the novel and in part because she probably knows she’ll get more to do in Dune Messiah. Dune Part Two celebrates Herbert’s novel, and, with its grandiose vistas and thundering sound, the power of cinema itself. Curious viewers should seek out the largest screen format they can find, sit back, and let the surreal and provocative images wash over them. Defenders of David Lynch’s** 1984 adaptation of Dune have long championed it as a fever dream. Here, Villeneuve actually fulfills that PR buzz, crafting an epic that will remind audiences of why they fell in love with movies in the first place. **Note: Villeneuve, in the act of tongue-in-cheek empathy, pays obvious homage to the work of David Lynch. Keen eyes will spot the scene in question, and note that it comes from Blue Velvet Lynch’s Dune. Given the dreadful quality of Lynch’s Dune, that’s just good taste.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," And when your film adapts what essentially is the second half of a book, it tends to be more exciting than the installment that came before it. Not surprisingly, then, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve’s excellent “Dune: Part Two” — in theaters March 1, after being pushed into 2024 as a result of last year’s Hollywood strikes — is greater in scale and more frequently riveting than its strong predecessor, 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.” This second “Dune,” costing a reported $190 million, isn’t a giant leap forward, the science-fiction epic matching the first ($165 million) precisely in terms of look and tone. And it picks up where “Dune” left off, with possible future messiah Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, mystical Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning”), living among the Fremen, the native people of the remote desert planet Arrakis. In case you need a refresher, “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two” are based on Frank Herbert’s influential 1965 novel “Dune,” a work interested in ecological themes, among others. In Herbert’s world — set thousands of years in the future and following humanity winning a war against artificial intelligence — computers are outlawed in the universe. Instead, to traverse space, folks depend on spice, the mind-altering substance that grows in the sands of Arrakis. As a result, control of the otherwise desolate planet is important — so important that it cost Paul his father and saw the great House Atreides fall to the merciless types of House Harkonnen. Now, the prescient Paul desires to express his distinct displeasure with what has happened to that house’s leader, the grotesque Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, “Andor”), and the man pulling the strings from above him, the Emperor (Christopher Walken, “The Deer Hunter”), seen in “Part Two” for the first time. Paul wishes to learn the ways of the Fremen, who exist in the harsh lands of Arrakis despite the ever-present threat of the giant sandworms and do not appreciate outsiders coming to take the planet’s valuable resource. Fortunately for Paul, a key Fremen, Stilgar (Javier Bardem, “No Country for Old Men”), believes him to be the prophesied off-worlder who will lead the Fremen to a better existence. Paul isn’t so sure about that, and neither are others, among them Chani (Zendaya “Spider-Man: No Way Home”) — literally the woman of his spice-fueled dreams and to whom, of course, he grows closer in this film. As the story progresses, Paul works to pass tests administered by Stilgar to prove his worth; encounters an old friend and mentor in Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin, “Avengers: End Game”); and faces a new and possibly more dangerous enemy in Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), the psychopathic nephew of the baron, who rises to power as his brother, Beast Rabbanas (Dave Bautista, “Guardians of the Galaxy”), struggles to defeat the constantly attacking Fremen. Most importantly, Paul wants to avoid the potentially catastrophic results of choosing the path he takes in his visions. However, other forces, including his mother — traveling her own rise to power in this chapter — may pull him there nonetheless. Visually, at least, “Dune: Part Two” is a masterpiece. With contributions from returning contributors including director of photography Greig Fraser, production designer Patrice Vermette, editor Joe Walker, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and costume designer Jacqueline, the film is regularly wondrous while also presenting a very gritty and lived-in world. It is a sight to behold, for example, every time Fremen warriors rise from the sand and charge at the Harkonnen spice-harvesting operation. Ultimately, we seldom get world-building as stunning as what Villeneuve has offered with these two films. Like the 2021 release, “Part Two” is a little slow at times, not a shock given its two-and-a-half-hour-plus runtime. Even still, this is yet more topnotch filmmaking from Villeneuve, whose previous directorial efforts include the outstanding films “Sicario” and “Blade Runner 2049.” He knows how to pull you into a story and keep you invested, even a narrative as strange and sprawling as that of “Dune.” Villeneuve co-wrote the screenplay with another returning collaborator Jon Spaihts (“Doctor Strange”), the tandem continuing to show tremendous work in the realm of adaptation, bringing to the screen only what we need for a compelling tale. Within the frame, Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), as he was in the first film, is merely a semi-engaging hero — that is until a rousing late-affair scene where the actor goes big and truly impresses. It’s a performance that’s needed to sell what’s to follow, and sell it he does. The cast is too large to do much more singling out, but know that Butler, following impressive performances in projects including “Elvis” and “Masters of the Air,” is rather terrifying as the especially horrendous Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha is one-dimensional and a disappointingly underdeveloped character, but Butler is terrifying as the villain all the same. The huge ensemble of “Dune: Part Two” also includes notable newcomers in Florence Pugh (“Black Widow”), as Princess Irulan, daughter of the Emperor, and Léa Seydoux (“No Time to Die”), as Lady Fenring, an enigmatic Bene Gesserit who pays a visit to Feyd-Rautha. Both actors get relatively little screen time, but one imagines they could get significantly more in a third “Dune.” As you’d expect given that Herbert penned sequels to “Dune,” there is room for this story to continue. And as likely as a “Dune: Part Three” is to be green-lit, there are reasons to suspect it won’t arrive as quickly as this film has. Regardless of when it arrives, with the gift Villeneuve so far has illustrated for spice-navigating us through space, we’ll follow him back to Arrakis as beyond."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two” offers grander sci-fi spectacle and storytelling. Warriors clash, villains and heroes scheme, believers seek a messiah and two hearts crave connection. Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two” offers grander sci-fi spectacle and storytelling. Warriors clash, villains and heroes scheme, believers seek a messiah and two hearts crave connection. Warriors clash, villains and heroes scheme, believers seek a messiah and two hearts crave connection in the immersive storytelling of the Canadian director and co-writer.  Villeneuve continues to grandly illustrate and expand “Dune” author Frank Herbert’s evergreen vision of desert planet Arrakis, a sun-scorched place rich in natural treasure — the magical spice melange — but bereft of harmony between its Indigenous and colonizer inhabitants. The movie fairly throbs with conflicts and intrigues, all the more so if you see it on an IMAX screen with the deep bass of Hans Zimmer’s majestic score rumbling through your body. Greig Fraser’s tactile cinematography and Patrice Vermette’s Brutalist production design help cement inevitable and favourable comparisons with “The Empire Strikes Back,” “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,” Villeneuve’s “Blade Runner 2049” and other sci-fi/fantasy totems. It’s a lot to take in, especially with a running time that approaches three hours. Yet “Dune 2” would be just meaningless fireworks if the human component of the story didn’t pack the same oomph. Fortunately it does, most impressively with the love story that drives the narrative: Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides and Zendaya’s Chani, two warriors caught between destiny and desire. Zimmer added a lovely celestial tune to the soundtrack, “A Time of Quiet Between the Storms,” to salute their romance. Paul is the heir of House Atreides, the Arrakis stewards who fell prey to the malevolent machinations of rival House Harkonnen, ruled by the evil slug Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). Chalamet’s acting has improved substantially in the three years since “Dune: Part One.” He was good as the callow young Paul, unsure of his role within the internecine politics of Arrakis; he’s terrific as the slightly older and considerably wiser Paul of “Dune 2,” who is forced to grapple with competing prophecies of him as a saviour and a destroyer. There’s a steely glint in his eyes, now blue from consumption of spice provided by the Fremen, Indigenous inhabitants of Arrakis whom Paul pledges allegiance to after the fall of House Atreides and the murder of his father, Duke Leto (Oscar Isaac). Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), pregnant with his unborn sister, warns he must prepare himself for “the beauty and the horror” of the path ahead. Paul must also decide what to do about his love for his fellow warrior Chani. Zendaya brings genuine affection and pathos to her role. She’s another standout member of a large and superlative cast of “Dune” players old and new. (Josh Brolin’s mentoring Gurney Halleck is a particularly welcome returnee and he finally gets to play his guitarlike Baliset, which was cut from the first film.) Chani is one of the Fremen and, as such, she has every reason to be wary of colonizers like Paul. Yet she falls for him almost as quickly as he falls for her. We see their first kiss and also a sweet “Fred and Ginger” moment as Chani teaches Paul the side-stepping Fremen method of “sand walking” the dunes. Chani was more of a dream in the first “Dune,” finally appearing in person in the film’s cliffhanger ending, from where “Dune 2” begins. Paul and Lady Jessica, who are lost and fighting to survive in the broiling sands of Arrakis, find shelter and common cause with the Fremen, most of whom initially distrust the newcomers. Fremen elder Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is a notable exception. He recognizes Paul as a potential messiah, as did the prophetic Bene Gesserit sisterhood of whom Lady Jessica is a member. Stilgar provides the film’s comic relief. He schools Paul in the ways of the Fremen, which includes riding the monstrous toothy sandworms that are the source of spice melange and transport. A pulse-raising action sequence illustrates the latter. He’s going to need these skills and more as he assumes a leadership role within the Fremen, even as he suffers recurring nightmares of global catastrophe for which he might be the cause. Paul must also contend with the brutal ambitions of Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the vampiric second nephew of Baron Harkonnen, who plans to rule Arrakis by any means possible. Accurately described as psychotic and sociopathic, Feyd-Rautha is the best of several new characters introduced in “Dune 2.” They also include Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV, leader of the Galactic Empire; Florence Pugh as his truth-saying daughter, Princess Irulan Corrino; and Léa Seydoux as Lady Margot, a Bene Gesserit reverend mother and ally of the emperor. As before, no one should approach a “Dune” screening without at least a rudimentary understanding of the source novel and its main characters. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts provide no hand-holding, other than to drag you into a multi-layered tale that includes many supernatural elements. They also increase the presence and importance of women in the “Dune” saga, improving on Herbert’s male-dominated prose. When all is said and done, the most urgent concern of “Dune 2” is something everyone can relate to, whether they are sci-fi fans or not: Can the fragile love of Paul and Chani survive the chaos of their situation? On a planet rife with death, betrayal and suffering, a resounding “yes” to that question would be the greatest triumph of all, and a reason to hope that Villeneuve can make his triumphant “Dune” saga a trilogy. “Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. Only in theatres March 1.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"It may take five and a half hours for his character to truly come to life, but two films in, Chalamet’s evolution as Paul gives everything a center."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Those were the words Jon Stewart used to kick off his return to “The Daily Show” after a long absence. It was funny in part just because it’s funny, but also because of the enormous amount of world-changing events that occured in his absence, so he wasn’t really just picking up where he left off. For “Dune: Part Two,” however, the question couldn’t be more apt. The first film, released in 2021, was a masterful achievement that ended practically in the middle of a sentence — an ending all the more abrupt considering director Denis Villeneuve had not yet secured a sequel. Which is where we find ourselves again this time. At least in “Part 2” there is some resolution, though the way the movie ends, you know there is more to come. Probably. Once again, the next film is dependent upon how well this one does at the box office. The first film made a lot of money, which is a good thing because otherwise we would have been left forever with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya just hanging out there in the dunes of Arrakis, on the run from their enemies. Which is where we pick things up in the sequel, which plays in part as an extension of the first film (since that’s what it is), but also as a deeper exploration of the journey of Paul Atreides (Chalamet) to find himself, and to find out what he is to everyone else. To Stilgar, a Freman leader (Javier Bardem returns in the role), he is nothing less than the Lisan al-Gaib, the messiah whose arrival prophecies have foretold. Chani (Zendaya) isn’t so sure (for that matter, neither is Paul). She believes the Fremen should be led to paradise by one of their own, not an outsider, messiah or no. She’s also distrustful of Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the all-women order of mystics that has been doing all that foretelling. The Fremen take Paul and Lady Jessica in, and Paul learns their ways, insisting that he only wants to fight beside them, despite Stilgar raving to anyone who will listen, and to anyone who won’t, that Paul is the real deal. Meanwhile the Emperor of the Universe — it’s a big title, but Christopher Walken is the man for the job — is scheming, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is trying to keep Spice production going by whatever means necessary, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is positively foaming at the mouth looking for someone to kill and figures Paul is as good a candidate as any and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), the emperor’s daughter, is recording it all in her diary. If all this sounds like so much big-name mumbo-jumbo, like you missed something, well, if you didn’t see the first movie, you did. Some of the story can be hard to follow even if you did see the first film; occasional short leaps in time don’t help. But it’s OK, because Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “Sicario”) may be the best director working when it comes to putting an audience in challenging, even audacious settings and making them feel as if they belong there. “Dune: Part 2” makes sense in a kind of cosmic way, even when the nuts and bolts can be mystifying. Villeneuve trusts his audience, but his audience also has to trust him. This relationship gives his films an immersive feel, as we slip into the world he creates. You just have to kind of go with it. Butler is outstanding as the bald face of pure evil; he employs facial tics that make him look unhinged. I think Ferguson is the underrated secret ingredient in both films. Bardem becomes less interesting the more fervent Stilgar becomes. But it falls to Chalamet and Zendaya to carry the emotional burden of the film. Both of their characters are transformed in different ways as their relationship evolves, and each actor makes the transformations credible — which makes the stakes and the consequences all the more intense. It shouldn’t work, honestly. There’s too much going on in too many directions at the same time. But Villeneuve brings it all together somehow. We’re more than five hours in between the two films (this one is 2 hours and 46 minutes), and while the lack of a sequel wouldn’t be as infuriating as it was last time around, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I think I’m ready for more."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Fans have been waiting what feels like forever for Dune: Part Two to grace the big screen and now the time has finally come. So was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. Not only did the visuals somehow get even more breathtaking, Timothée Chalamet absolutely owns every single scene he is in. That being said, the entire cast is incredible, with the only real issue with the movie being that we could have used some more of a few characters — because they are that good.  This film picks up exactly where Dune Part One left off, and wastes absolutely no time sending viewers on an epic journey. Yes, this movie is long. Yes, it features a lot of sand. And yet, it is never boring or exhausting, instead it will leave fans begging for more. Luckily for us, Denis Villeneuve has said he plans to continue playing in this sandbox (pun intended) and we cannot wait to see where things go from here. While it is virtually impossible to find a standout actor among this incredibly talented cast – because they are all THAT good – Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha absolutely should be applauded for his performance. Not only is he absolutely terrifying almost every single time he is on screen, he very clearly gives his all to this role. He is fully committed, as is the rest of the cast, and that is why this movie works as well as it does. These characters are believable. It is easy to become lost in the story and to root for some, and love to hate others. Not to mention, the costumes and hair / makeup are astonishing. They really do transport you to another place and time. Probably my biggest issue with this movie, which is, in actuality, a small issue, is that there are two characters I would have liked more of, mainly because they are just so phenomenal in Dune: Part Two. First is Dave Bautista as Beast Rabban. We saw a little bit of him in Part One, and I was eager to learn more about his character and get that exploration. While we do get a bit of it, it is not nearly as much as I would have liked. That said, there is one scene in particular that will live rent free in my head for years to come. He is so perfect in this, very intense, moment. You will know exactly which scene I am talking about when you watch the film. The other character I would have liked to see more of is Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan. Again, she is truly incredible whenever on screen. Mainly in scenes with Christopher Walken, she absolutely shines and her character is intriguing in the best way possible. Of course, should the story of Dune continue, we will see a lot more of her. This is exciting as she is sure to deliver powerful scenes, especially when opposite Timothée Chalamet more – the two are already amazing together on screen. That being said, we could have used more of her this time around. Yes, the movie was already nearly three hours, but she was lovely in it and more of her would be celebrated. Another slight issue is how jarring it can be when going from dark scenes to light scenes, however that was very much in the first film as well, and didn’t take too much away from the experience. The sound and set design are top notch. This movie knows what it is doing. Everything that has gone into it makes it an unforgettable epic. It probably goes without saying, but it needs to be said that Timothée Chalamet (Paul Atreides) and Zendaya (Chani) have unmatched chemistry. They are incredible on screen together. While they are both fantastic, Chalamet in particular, steals the show. It is incredible to think about the range this young actor has. It is almost baffling that he is the same person who flawlessly played Willy Wonka, and stole our hearts in Bones and All. He excels throughout the entire film, but especially in the third act. If his performance does not give up goosebumps during certain moments, I don’t know what movie you were watching. The way Paul evolves in these moments, and the path that Chalamet has sent him down, brings both heart and heartbreak to the story. He commands the screen when opposite talent like Christopher Walken, and that says all you need to know. Zendaya also delivers the performance of a lifetime in the film, but particularly in the third act. And the two of them together will leave audiences with their jaws on the floor. They are that good. Overall, Dune: Part Two is sure to be one of the best films of the year, if not the best. It might seem a little early to say but with stunning visuals, intense fight scenes, and a cast that all brings their A-game, it is easily a front runner. The visual effects are jaw dropping and the hair, makeup, and costumes are the perfect touch to what is already an incredible movie. There is no doubt about it, fans will agree this one was worth the wait. Dune: Part Two absolutely begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible, with the best sound system. IMAX with Dolby Atmos is how this movie was made to be seen, and I highly recommend seeing it this way if it is possible.  “Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a path of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. The big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), Souheila Yacoub (“The Braves,” “Climax”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve is the Mahdi of modern sci-fi. He delivered an adaptation of Frank Herbert’s infamously unwieldy, seminal tome (lest we forget David Lynch’s disasterpiece or Alejandro Jodorowsky’s doomed Shai Hulud-scale recreation) that was one thing above all else: comprehensively watchable.  Part Two is a superior echo of its predecessor; issues remain (mainly an emotional dearth that threatens to hollow out its spectacle), but it’s still an overwhelmingly immersive, ginormous experience that cannot be missed.  “All died in the dark,” Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) says, recounting the bloody extermination of House Atreides on Arrakis, a battle that “took everyone by surprise” – and, curiously, didn’t constitute a declaration of war. It was a cold-hearted move in aid of self-preservation from her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken), a man who has always been “guided by the calculus of power.” Meanwhile, Rabban’s (Dave Bautista) failure to manage Arrakis and sustain a steady spice supply attracts the ire of the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), who enlists the brutal help of his younger “psychotic” nephew: Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), the potential heir to the Harkonnen throne and the Bene Gesserit’s new pet project.  Spice is all things: an essential component of interstellar travel, a hallucinogen, and a resource that can greatly extend one’s life. But in the world of Dune, it’s just a McGuffin; the sun around which a cycle of unquestionable violence and reclamation are fated to orbit. “Power over spice is power over all,” the throat-sung opening message reads, and that last part is key – the hunger for absolute dominion is the poison that infects the universe, not spice. Part Two deals with some weighty stuff; notably, the weaponization of fear (once the mind-killer, now a tool to control) and the great and grave contradiction of religious fanaticism (faith so devotedly divine “is always a function of repressed doubt”). Paul and Chani’s love story is woven through those ideas, but it’s foregrounded when it’s the least compelling through-line of the two movies – and that’s symptomatic of their larger problem.  Villeneuve’s imagery communicates the narrative heft of Herbert’s story, and Hans Zimmer’s screen-rattling score does some heavy lifting (the omission of bagpipes this time around is unforgivable, but its Vangelis-inspired, goosebump-pulsing, romantic central melody is maybe some of his best work ever). But its characters are solely agents of plot rather than feeling; for love nor money, I’ve never found a soulful connection to any of them, beyond Duncan Idaho’s glorious “Ah, my boy!” in Part One.  This certainly isn’t a call for more levity (its ultimate bleakness is a huge merit), nor is it necessarily a criticism of the story (though its faux resolution is a bit frustrating): I just wish I cared about what happens. Similar to the first half, this plays out like the greatest concept art you’ve ever seen, but the reason the “Welcome to Jurassic Park” scene has remained a pop-cultural touchstone isn’t just because it’s wondrous – the movie was more than its spectacle.  Still, to call anyone in the cast a weak link would be a disservice. Chalamet puts in a more convincing performance as Paul, with believable (if never moving) chemistry with Zendaya; their arc becomes a bit tedious, but that’s a consequence of the material more than their work. Ferguson delivers another beguilingly sinister turn as Jessica, arguably the most fascinating character in the whole film, while Pugh, Skarsgård, a deliciously screamy Bautista, and a surprisingly funny Bardem are all worthy of praise.  And then there’s Butler, somewhere between Prometheus’ milk-bottle humanoid and a cobra. He strips the pantomime from Feyd-Rautha without losing the showmanship, radiating pure menace; as unnerving as he looks (and sounds), he’s always a clear and present danger even off-screen, so much so that any moment without him feels lesser off. Between this, Elvis, and Masters of the Air, it’s clear he should be our next great movie star: an actor with matinee idol looks whose talent isn’t shallow nor fully explored.  He steals the film – aside from the breathtaking visuals, of course. Greig Fraser’s cinematography is in a league of its own, potentially taking Roger Deakins’ place as this generation’s great eye; it has to be a contender for one of the greatest-looking blockbusters of the 21st century, rivaled perhaps only by Villeneuve’s earlier Blade Runner 2049. Lord of the Rings is a credible comparison (although nobody cares about Paul and Chani like Sam and Frodo), especially in the sequel’s jaw-dropping, epic action sequences. But the filmmaker’s influences are sprinkled everywhere: silhouettes of ornithopters are a squadron shy of Richard Wagner, one shot of a sandstorm is a clear nod to Fury Road, and the use of Paul’s breath as he anxiously waits in the desert is reminiscent of 2001’s otherwise silent, in-helmet sound.  This is the closest we’ve come to experiencing the sights Roy Batty vowed we wouldn’t believe; clews of gigantic sandworms tearing through vast deserts, colossal spacecraft that feel tiny because the vistas are so enormous. Villeneuve completely blurs the line between CGI and practical effects, and with its trademark brutalist style, he establishes a tangible, textural reality; Dune should be in the same conversation as Avatar in that regard (though I doubt anyone has post-Arrakis blues).  Is Dune: Part Two truly great? The sands of time will decide, but one thing is clear: movies of this scale and caliber come around seldom to never. Don’t miss it.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Back in 2021, Denis Villeneuve tried his hand at adapting Dune, the well-loved and famously complex sci-fi novel series by Frank Herbert. Although it was delayed a bit by the pandemic, it garnered favorable reviews from critics and audiences alike and was a box office hit despite its lengthy running time and enigmatic narrative. It was only one part of a more significant tale, and Villeneuve is back again to try to finish the Atreides story arc. Dune: Part Two (2024) picks up directly after the first film's events: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen of the spice planet Arrakis. They hope the Fremen will accept them and that they will help them fight against House Harkonnen, who betrayed House Atreides in the first film. Paul forges a deeper relationship with Chani (Zendaya), a fierce and independent Fremen fighter who is incredibly devoted to her people and their freedom. The film's first act is dedicated to Paul's attempts to integrate himself into Freman culture while representing himself as the heir to the Atreides family legacy. At this point, Paul is optimistic and open to change, and he is excited to welcome the Freman's culture into his own. House Atreides only saw spice as a means to immense wealth, but the Fremen used it to further their consciousness and spirituality and gain superhuman powers. A fish-out-of-water aspect is introduced while Paul learns the way of the desert group and gains their respect, and a budding romance develops between himself and Chani. Religion is one of the main concepts that Dune critiques, and it does so through Paul's hero's journey. In a lesser story, Paul would be ""the chosen one"" and save everyone through his miraculous actions and selfless disposition. Even further, given that the groups in Dune have parallels with real-life cultures, they could have been trapped in the ""white savior"" cliche. The Freman have a religion based around prophesies and legends, and Paul conveniently fits into every slot. In this way, the narrative is a subversion of the Hero's Journey, in which the protagonist cannot change his destiny or refuse the call and is tragically exploited by powers outside of his control. Just as real-life religions share similar origin stories, just told from different perspectives, the Freman religion is filled with ambiguous symbolism that can be applied to many situations. Paul is an easy target to use to manipulate people through misguided faith, and he is also reluctant to be worshipped. Dune asks questions about religious zealotry, messiah complexes, and how it is used to control instead of liberate. Chani is naturally skeptical of the legends and is essentially a humanist who wants her people to overcome the opposition by their will and cooperation alone. Visually, Dune: Part Two surpasses the first film and establishes a strong style early on with bold colors and striking scene composition. The scenes on Arrakis are warm-toned and easy on the eyes, a mixture of gold, brown, and deep reds, which is contrasted sharply with the cold black-and-white starkness of House Harkonnen. Even though the runtime is longer than the first part, it flies by quickly due to the excellent pacing and increased action. Villeneuve uses the ""show, don't tell"" technique much more in this outing, avoiding exposition dumps while keeping the narrative streamlined and easy to follow. Hans Zimmer's bombastic musical score is intense and sweeping, and the sound design, in general, will elicit goosebumps at the climatic scenes. Dune: Part Two ups the ante in every way compared to the first film, and both movies combined form an incredible story of power and tribulation."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," We join Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides at a moment of cautious acceptance, with the prospective mini-messiah having just bested a noted Fremen warrior in a mano-a-mano knife tussle.  The first part of Denis Villeneuve’s impressive Dune saga covered the opening salvo of Frank Herbert’s freaky 1965 opus, setting up the political context of warring noble families and a desert planet (Arrakis) rich in a multi-purpose hallucinogen referred to as “the spice”. This continuation of the story charts Paul’s ominous rise and eventual transcendence, but refuses to ride the ragged coattails of his heroism and charisma, instead dealing in the moral minefield that comes with being ordained a mystic god. Villeneuve very lightly tweaks the successful formula that was coined for Part One, with the sights, sounds and sensual stigma of Arrakis carried over in his patented, supremely tasteful less-is-more visual schema. Those who perhaps found that the first film sapped Herbert’s book of some of its more lurid and eccentric delights in favour of a stern, teutonic grandeur will be pleased to hear that the director – who is not known for working in warm or comic hues – has scattered the first half of the film with some nice jocular horseplay and a few salty one-liners. And not to mention a burgeoning, beautifully-realised romance between Paul and Fremen footsoldier Chani (Zendaya). There is focus, too, on the various contraptions and gizmos that make life in the desert possible, most notable of which is the iconic “thumper” which, when planted in the sand at the correct point, issues a pounding beat to draw in the planet’s sandworms – who are complete bastards, unless you know how to lure them in then surf on their heads. The uncluttered design and decoration of the film means that these details receive the attention they deserve without drawing you out of the story which, for better and for worse, was not something you could say about the David Lynch movie from 1984. With the Atreides clan now decimated due to a surprise attack from House Harkonnen (overseen by Stellan Skarsgård’s rotund floaty slime-bather, the Baron), secretly sanctioned by the Emperor of the Known Universe (Christopher Walken, obvs), the Fremen now have the tactical advantage of being able to mess with the planet’s spice-harvesting programme. Indeed, if there’s an issue with the film at all it’s that the Harkonnens don’t ever seem to pose that much of a threat to the Fremen, what with their underground lairs and guerrilla warfare tactics.  As such, the story’s climax plays like the obvious conclusion to the a careful counterattack rather than a tense flashpoint riven with the possibility of failure. Retribution is received in a manner that eschews triumphalism, to the point where it all feels a little bit rote. Yet Villeneuve somehow acknowledges this with a pair of haunting, politically-loaded images which top and tail the film, both of which decry the inhuman roundabout of power and the arrogance of leadership which always seem to end up punishing those whom it should, in theory, be elevating. A more general point of praise derives from the simple, tactile qualities of the production where digital effects and green screen have been used extremely sparingly. Seeing a lavish sci-fi epic which has actual visual texture and artisan craft is suddenly special again due to the sad fact that such practices have fallen out of favour (or, more likely, are not deemed financially worthwhile) within the Blockbuster Industrial Complex.  Filmmakers should take pride in the work they’ve done and want to display the wares they’ve painstakingly produced, and in this respect Villeneuve is very much following the charge led by Christopher Nolan in his belief that viewers respect artistry that takes time and patience rather than processes that are used as time and money savers. Sure, there is artistry in the process of digital effects, but not when they’re being used – as they so often are – as a bandaid. The first half of Dune: Part Two is among the best things that Villeneuve has ever done, though the sheer eventfulness of the plot and a bustling retinue of side-players (Austin Butler upgrading Sting’s cod-pieced ninny from the 1984 film into a hairless psychopath is worthy of mention) means that the final act does feel rushed. In terms of narrative pacing, it’s easy to see how this could’ve been sliced into three films, but the question remains as to where part two would’ve ended and whether a lack of closure may have alienated the more casual Dunehead. Small niggles aside, this is an undoubted success, and is powered a clutch of lead performances – Chalamet, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson as a newly-ordained Bene Gesserit reverend mother at the shining core of the ensemble – help to foreground the rich political ambiguities inherent to the text.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Not only because the story is so gigantic in its themes, ambitions and millennia-spanning timeline that it threatens to swallow any filmmaker into the belly of a sandworm. But also because wrangling even the basics of Herbert’s world(s) requires moviegoers to get onside – and quickly – with such concepts as hallucinogenic space minerals, a secret society of matronly psychics, a prophecy that requires the endorsement of interplanetary jihad and those skyscraper-sized, sphincter-shaped worms. To turn Dune into a workable, digestible piece of big-budget blockbuster cinema – and as David Lynch and others have discovered, you really do need full access to the war chest of a major studio – is for a director to risk a one-way ticket to movie jail. If not the movie asylum. Yet with the eye-popping and (enjoyably) ear-splitting Dune: Part Two, Canadian director Denis Villeneuve proves that there is a radically refined method guiding his madness. While his film is not as narratively flawless as the sands of desert planet Arrakis are harsh, Villeneuve’s epic arrives as a big, sincere and essential reminder that film is the home of true push-the-limit visionaries. It is a medium of transformative dreams and immersive nightmares. Or it can be when its powers are harnessed by artists like Villeneuve, a storyteller who is willing to spill the entirety of his imagination on the screen, damn the consequences. Picking up exactly where Part One left off – this is not so much a sequel as the second half of one movie, with zero patience for neophytes – Part Two finds deposed aristocrat Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) cast out into the harsh wilderness of Arrakis, whose prized natural resource known as “spice” fuels the interstellar space travel crucial to the rule of the galactic empire. While plotting his revenge against the brutal Harkonnen clan who usurped his father’s throne in a bloody coup, Paul forges an alliance with the indigenous Fremen, including warrior Chani (Zendaya) and tribal leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem). The latter acts as a mentor, father figure and manic street preacher, living with the hope that a messiah will one day help his people return Arrakis back into a lush, green paradise. Is Paul that saviour? Perhaps. It helps that his mother, the scheming psychic Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), is pushing for just that prophecy to come true as she gains a dangerous influence over the Fremen. Yet Paul, who has a gift for dreaming about events before they actually happen, foresees nothing but intergalactic misery should he lead the Fremen against the Padishah Emperor (Christopher Walken). Realizing that any and all of the plot points described above sound ludicrously complex or derivative of countless other cinematic spectacles – Herbert’s original books might have literary precedence over something like George Lucas’s Star Wars, but in film it’s the race to the screen that matters – Villeneuve takes a refreshingly unapologetic, all-in approach to the material. This is not a movie interested in hand-holding sci-fi skeptics. You’re either with its gravity-defying space assassins and cannibalistic albino psychopaths rendered in heart-stopping IMAX grandeur, or you’re not. Yet the power of Villeneuve’s work here is that only the most cynical of audiences will turn their noses up at Dune’s magnificent, hardcore, often quite brutal weirdness. The director builds his world so seamlessly and with such deft narrative and stylistic confidence that, before you know it, Arrakis feels completely, devastatingly real. As do the men, women and worms populating it. Chalamet, Hollywood’s best chance at developing a true 21st-century movie star from scratch, possesses an uncertain, humble energy that aptly reflects Paul’s journey from pampered prince to scarred revolutionary. Zendaya delivers the right balance of steely nerve and repressed vulnerability to pull off a tricky role that might have been lost among the sandstorms and explosions were it not for her commitment. And Bardem pulls off an often darkly funny act as a zealot blinded by his own faith. If Part Two was merely a three-hander between the actors, then it would be a riot. Yet Villeneuve convinces half of Hollywood to appear in the margins, too, including Walken (creepy enough for us to wish that he had played that other big emperor, Palpatine), Josh Brolin (whose grizzled Atreides lieutenant gets one of the most fiery introductions, or rather reintroductions, in recent film history) and Austin Butler (who, as a psychotic Harkonnen brute, trades his Elvis impersonation for a dead-on Stellan Skarsgård riff). While Villeneuve might carry a reputation for turning chilly source material into uncrackable permafrost – dating all the way back to his early Québécois work – he opens and then offers the entirety of his heart in Part Two. The rousing battle scenes in the final third would mean little without the director and his co-writer Jon Spaihts spending the previous two hours carefully establishing the trifecta of personal dramas plaguing Paul’s every move. There are a number of points where Villeneuve seems to leap before he looks – even at 165 minutes, parts of Paul’s journey, including a real worm-turn moment, feel rushed. And like Part One, this film doesn’t so much conclude its story as it teases out another, even more colossal one. (If Villeneuve is able to get a greenlight for the outré chaos of Herbert’s Dune Messiah, Muad’Dib bless him.)"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Ever since the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows movies were announced, two-part films have been a scourge on blockbuster cinema. At their best, they’ve often felt like hollow attempts to stretch lucrative material into something even more profitable. At worst, they’ve felt like two incomplete halves that make up a disappointing whole. But Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Dune feels like a special exception. The first movie, publicly billed as Dune and revealed as Dune: Part One only in the credits, handled the world-building and all the expositional heavy lifting. It all came with the understanding that the conclusion could be an all-killer, no-filler science fiction epic. And that’s exactly what Dune: Part Two delivers. Dune: Part One followed the fallout as the Atreides family and its young scion Paul (Timothée Chalamet) were given control of Arrakis, the one planet in the universe that produces an ultra-valuable commodity known as spice. After only a short time on the planet, the Atreides were betrayed by the previous controlling family, the Harkonnens, who seized the planet again, nearly wiping out the Atreides in the process. Only Paul and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), escaped to the deserts of Arrakis.  All of this is worth noting here primarily because this sequel wastes no time whatsoever on a real recap. Instead, Dune: Part Two picks up with Paul and Jessica easing into life among the Fremen, the Arrakis natives who have made its harsh deserts their home. Jessica, following a plan established by the mysterious order of space witches, the Bene Gesserit, continues to spread the idea that Paul is the Fremen’s prophesied messiah. Eventually, she becomes a Fremen spiritual leader herself. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

Meanwhile, Paul is quickly making a name for himself as a Fremen warrior, and finding increasingly creative ways to stop the Harkonnens from restarting their spice-harvesting operations on Arrakis, mostly via guerilla-warfare-style attacks and raids. Paul, fellow Fremen warriors Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem), and the rest of the Fremen take on the Harkonnens’ massive spice-harvesting sandcrawlers with surprise attacks that start from under the desert sand, using Arrakis’ native giant sandworms and laser weapons that cut vehicles in half in an instant.  These scenes are Dune: Part Two’s earliest flexes, seamlessly blending the massive scale of the Harkonnen desert vehicles with the Fremen’s brutal, efficient, and beautiful hand-to-hand combat. Characters dart back and forth between the legs of the crawlers while hiding from thopters circling ahead, as their allies battle behind them with fists, knives, and guns. It’s an impressive balance of intimate violence and epic scale, and Villeneuve employs it brilliantly all over the action-heavy Part Two.  These raids pepper the first hour or so of the 166-minute movie, and they always feel like a treat when they appear. They inevitably push Paul closer to his destiny: leading the Fremen in an all-out war to take Arrakis back from the Harkonnens, and maybe even to overthrow the Emperor who cannily set up the conflict in the first place. What makes this typical Chosen One story so interesting is that Paul is reluctant to accept such power, because he knows through his prophetic visions that his ascension will bring about untold death and destruction throughout the universe. But with every adult in his life pushing him toward his destiny and only Chani to hold him back, Paul slowly starts to see the necessity and advantages that power affords.  Dune: Part Two handles this complex character turn for Paul with surprising deftness. In large part, that’s thanks to Chalamet’s ability to sell both Paul’s charismatic, populist strongman side and his brooding, conflicted adolescent nature — and more importantly, flip between the two modes on a dime. No matter which mode he’s in, it’s easy to feel the weight of the other mode on his mind. When Paul directs the Fremen’s violence, it’s clear he’s just as scared as he hopes his enemies will be. But for all Chalamet’s incredible work in the movie, Zendaya is the one who sells Dune: Part Two’s surprising moral complexity.  In the movie’s quietest scenes, with just the two of them, Zendaya employs a gruff sensitivity that makes Chalamet’s more emotional scenes as Paul stand out even more starkly. It’s an impressive chemistry that gives both terrific actors moments to shine in ways that blockbusters rarely afford, with complex debates over morality and culture rather than the triter, tearful admissions of love that are common in epics like this.  Their counterpart, and the final point on Dune: Part Two’s trident of exceptional young performances, comes in the form of Na-Baron Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis star Austin Butler). Brought to Arrakis to end Paul’s raids and destroy the Fremen once and for all, Feyd-Rautha is a born psychopath more bloodthirsty even than his uncle Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). And Butler relishes every ounce of the character’s villainy. Villeneuve weaponizes all Butler’s rock-star charm, giving him the same close-ups that made him irresistible as Baz Luhrmann’s version of Elvis, except that Butler widens his haunting spotlight eyes and flicks his tongue instead of smiling. Butler imbues the character with all the alien grace of a snake slithering across a high-fashion runway, at once completely out of place and strangely perfect.  All this is aided by the fact that one of Feyd-Rautha’s first scenes is also one of the movie’s most electric: a celebratory fight at an arena on the Harkonnen home planet. The scene is shot entirely in black-and-white infrared, giving everything a gorgeous, sickly glow. It looks incredible, simultaneously setting up a perfect character introduction for Feyd-Rautha and, more broadly, explaining incredible amounts about Harkonnen society via vibes alone. It’s the kind of visually audacious scene that should overwhelm the entire movie. Instead, it fits perfectly into Villeneuve’s parade of equally amazing images in Dune: Part Two.  Villeneuve’s science fiction has always looked incredible, particularly at the scale he works at for movies like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, and Dune: Part One. But each of those movies has a showiness that’s both understandable and distracting. Villeneuve often starts his scenes on an element of nature, or something else mundane and recognizable, then slowly pans to reveal whatever massive, imposing monument will eventually dominate the frame.  It’s impossible to blame Villeneuve for his impulse to point and marvel at the images his team has created, or the way he so seamlessly merges elements of the natural world with the visual effects necessary to build these worlds. Villeneuve has repeated this trick over and over throughout his career, and it’s undeniably awe-inspiring every single time he does it. But these moments are distracting too. They’re overwhelming in a way that reduces the films, even briefly, to singular icons of grandeur rather than images that make up a story.  In Dune: Part Two, however, Villeneuve has matured as a filmmaker. The movie is no less impressive than his previous work, maybe even more impressive. But these moments of visual splendor often come and go with little fanfare, supporting the character and action of a scene rather than distracting from them. Villeneuve has never had this kind of overt visual confidence before. It’s a clear statement that no single visual has to be the movie’s signature moment, because it’s surrounded by a thousand other beautiful, breathtaking images that somehow all feel perfectly aligned.  Dune: Part Two is full of a thousand of these little tightrope acts, falling between massive set-pieces and the dozens of desperate hand-to-hand fights they’re built from. Between the kind of comforting hero myths that make up most blockbuster storytelling, and more complicated questions about the dangers of people who wield power and command violence. Between gorgeous images and distracting showiness. But all this delicate balance is only possible because Dune: Part One already did the heavy lifting. For those who loved it, the promise of Part Two was that the conclusion of Paul’s journey would be even more exciting, beautiful, and poignant. For those who were bored during Part One, the promise was that all the slow, exposition-heavy pacing was in service of streamlining this next installment. Dune: Part Two is exactly the movie Part One promised it could be, the rare sequel that not only outdoes its predecessor, but improves it in retrospect. It’s more than just a fitting finale to Villeneuve’s adaptation, though: It’s also one of the best blockbusters of the century so far, and an instant sci-fi classic. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," In 2021’s surprise hit Dune, director Denis Villeneuve makes a promise to audiences. Behind all the grand spectacle, Villeneuve establishes a foreboding tone that indicates he just might nail the apocalyptic terror of Frank Herbert’s classic novel. In Dune: Part Two, the direct follow-up film, that promise is fulfilled.  Dune: Part Two isn’t just an exceptional work of technical craftsmanship. Nor is it simply an epic sure to be in conversation with the likes of Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings. This second film is, above all else, a terrifying warning against the power of “savior” figures and the destruction those narratives cause. Picking up directly where the first movie left off, Dune: Part Two finds Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), in the care of the native Fremen people of the planet Arrakis. Their Great House now destroyed by the cold Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the two plot their revenge. To do so, Paul plays into the prophecy of a great messiah, the Lisan Al-Gaib, laid out by the Fremen people. In the shadows, Jessica stokes the flames.  As he grows closer to Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), he takes on a mythic status among the people. The Mythic journey of Paul Atreides continues as Shaddam, his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), and the clairvoyant Bene Gesserit sisterhood must act. To do so, they enlist the help of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler). The twisted nephew of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), Feyd-Rautha may not be enough to stop the impending Holy War under Paul’s name. Everything audiences liked about the first film is back in full force for Dune: Part Two. The returning players all put their best foot forward. Rebecca Ferguson is unnerving as ever as Lady Jessica, Stellan Skarsgård and Dave Bautista repulsive as the Harkonnens, Josh Brolin’s Gurney Halleck still full of that gruff military charm, and Javier Bardem bringing his signature gravitas to Fremen leader Stilgar. The cinematography from Greg Fraisier remains the gold standard for a blockbuster on this scale. Hans Zimmer turns in one of his strongest scores maybe ever. What sets Dune Part Two apart is how it ups the ante across the board. As a sequel, Dune: Part Two is ideal. It takes the first film’s well-laid lore and plots out an ambitious, layered revenge narrative. What’s surprising is, given that it is a Part Two, Villeneuve’s film remains powerful on its own. Even with a cliffhanger ending suggesting an adaptation of Dune: Messiah, Dune: Part Two plays out in a satisfying manner. Dune is not an easy novel to adapt. The seminal work doesn’t shy away from the destructive power of cults of personality. Timothée Chalamet utterly transforms as someone who first uses the existing traditions of the Fremen to survive, only to start believing in himself as some sort of holy being.  By the time he fully gives in to the moniker of Muad’dib he bestows upon himself, he sends shivers down the spine. Additionally, Zendaya as Chani is given more agency than she was in the prior movie and the book itself. She represents what a true hero of the people can look like. Moreover, she’s a lens by which the dangerous deification of a man comes to leave destruction in its wake.  Dune: Part Two twists its spectacle into dread. The admittedly cool images of the sandworm and bombastic battles become signposts of devastation under Greg Fraisier’s eye. Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts’ screenplay tells the story of systems of power. Furthermore, how competing systems of power attempt to remake the world in their image. First, the Bene Gesserit run eugenics-adjacent attempts to bring out a super being. Léa Seydoux, in an all too brief role as Lady Margot Fenring, communicates that scheming as an ambitious member of the Sisterhood. Concurrently, the Fremen desire a holy figure. The Fremen are given the most complication. Some, such as Souheila Yacoubs character Shishakli, have their doubts about Paul’s claims. Yet, a mob mentality takes over. In their own selfishness, the Harkonnen lust for control is strengthened by Austin Butler’s deliciously evil performance. The Emperor shows cruel indifference and Irulan cowardly subservience. Because of their competing goals, all of these systems come about to wreak unspeakable devastation. Dune: Part Two is not an easy pill to swallow. That’s what makes it such an essential film. Denis Villeneuve delivers a harrowing warning to audiences about the true cost of the narrative we’re fed. Dune: Part Two refuses to be misinterpreted; its bravura spectacle is simply the delivery system for a story. In other words, Dune: Part Two matches the second part of the book on which it’s based. Both “parts” of Villeneuve’s grand vision form a watershed moment in sci-fi. More specifically, it takes the bones of extraterrestrial melodrama and simplicity that define a space opera and builds onto it to the point of becoming something new entirely. By refusing to shy away from the novel’s prescient themes, Dune: Part Two redefines the very notion of a space opera. Consequently, in an era where heroism and saviors are taken at face value, Dune: Part Two redefines what kind of stories blockbusters can tell. Satoru Gojo is the heart of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 — now, heading into Cour 2, here is everything you need to know about the character.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Colonization, revolution, means of production, religion as social control — these are among the themes that elevated Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi novel “Dune” far above its traditionally pulpy genre. No gold-plated bikinis here: Herbert, a career journalist and ravenous researcher (he died in 1986), was more interested in how humans create cultures and how civilizations rise and fall. Despite David Lynch’s 1984 film adaptation (a legendary misfire) and a 2000 miniseries for the Sci-Fi Channel, “Dune” is being remade as a theatrical franchise by Denis Villeneuve, a Canadian director whose austere style (“Prisoners,” “Arrival”) seems perfect for Herbert’s dense material. “Dune: Part One” (2021) was certainly visually striking but, for my money, it felt overly complicated and short on human warmth. “Dune: Part Two” has something of the same problems, but here’s the good news: As the story deepens, the previous film’s setups pay off and those heady Herbertian themes come to the fore. The most intriguing: Can an invented religion spawn a real Messiah? “Dune: Part Two” finds young aristocrat Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) fully assimilating into the Fremen tribe on the planet Arrakis — a desert world his own family once colonized. The Fremen chieftain Stilgar (a wonderful Javier Bardem) believes Paul is their savior: “As it is written!” he exclaims whenever the kid performs the slightest feat. The warrior Chani (Zendaya, making up for her bit part in the first film) doesn’t fully trust this newcomer — but those Chalamet eyes are hard to resist. There’s also a wild card in Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who’s pressing her own agenda as part of an ancient order called the Bene Gesserit. The eclectic support cast includes Christopher Walken, Charlotte Rampling, Florence Pugh and an enjoyable Dave Bautista as the spluttering villain Glossu “Beast” Rabban. Back on the Beast's home planet, Giedi Prime, the corpulent Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) charges his psychotic nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), with obliterating the Fremen. Butler just about steals the show as this bald, black-toothed sadist, and his ability to nail an accent — first the Memphis-raised Elvis Presley, now the Swedish-born Skarsgård — is uncanny. Villeneuve stages several magisterial action sequences involving mountain-size tanks and spacecraft being brought down by Fremen guerrillas. Why does this CGI-dependent movie look so impressive where others look so phony? Ironically, it might be Villeneuve’s use of stillness: The less those giant ships move, the more ominous they feel. (Warner Bros. waited out the pandemic to release this IMAX-shot film to theaters, where it belongs.) All of which makes “Dune: Part Two” a welcome addition to the genre of grown-up sci-fi. There’s still something a little cold about this desert-themed franchise: Its characters feel more conceptual than primal, and its world feels more like allegory than fantasy. Then again, that might be just how Herbert would have liked it."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," “Any sufficiently advanced technology,” Arthur C Clarke wrote in 1962, “is indistinguishable from magic.” Perhaps the defining achievement of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune films is that they blur the line between the two so thoroughly that the equation collapses in on itself. The technology here is magic: something to be felt in your soul, not puzzled out in your head.  Early in this second instalment – perhaps the last, perhaps not – a squad of Harkonnen stormtroopers use their jet packs to scale a rocky butte in the deserts of Arrakis. But rather than the devices boosting the soldiers skywards, they cause them to drift up the outcrop’s wall like astronauts slingshotting their way through the arterial tunnels of a space station: fast, slippery and silent, up they shoot.  You recognise the movement immediately but the context is alien, and the dissonance makes your skin prick. Villeneuve pulls off something like this in almost every scene, and the effect refreshes as much as it unnerves. When was the last time a $190m blockbuster was this stately, this sinister – and this content to not explain a single aspect of itself, but instead simply allow the viewer to grab what they can and intuit the rest? The answer may well be 2021, when Villeneuve’s first Dune film was released – and proved popular enough to secure this sequel, yet still felt a little under-appreciated. Part Two picks up exactly where its predecessor left off, immediately dunking the audience back in by the ankles. The Harkonnens, led by Stellan Skarsgård’s toadlike Baron, now preside over Arrakis’s spice trade, while Timothée Chalamet’s exiled Paul Atreides wages guerrilla warfare with Zendaya’s Chani and the native Fremen tribesfolk on the Harkonnens’ mining operations. Paul’s attempt to wrest back control entails cashing in a centuries-long religious conspiracy, and it is this process – led by his mother, the Bene Gesserit priestess Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) – that consumes much of the film’s epic running time. That makes this second part feel even more single-minded than the first, which also had to introduce the mining process, as well as the mytho-hallucinatory properties of the spice itself.  Here, in place of that, we get a lot of Javier Bardem’s devout Fremen leader Stillgar getting worked up about prophecies, with a sunny intransigence that sometimes recalls Life of Brian’s “Yes! We’re all individuals!” scene. Breaks come in the form of occasional glimpses of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter (Florence Pugh) mulling the unrest from afar, and a chunky sojourn to the Harkonnen home world, where Austin Butler’s psychotic heir to the dynasty, Feyd-Rautha, prepares to take charge. Channeling a Skarsgårdian Nordic drawl that might finally get the Elvis accent out of his system, Butler is transfixing as this terrifying sadist, who slits throats as casually as you or I might flick at flies. (When an adversary presses a blade to his own, he drools with delight.) Butler is by far the busiest of the new batch of gorgeous weirdos Villeneuve has added to his ensemble: Pugh and Léa Seydoux are both strong presences, but have relatively little to do. That could of course change in a further sequel – and judging by a single-scene cameo by Anya Taylor-Joy, Villeneuve certainly appears to want to make one. But Dune’s loose-endedness is one of its best qualities: finding out what happens is secondary to just seeing it unfold. You feel like Chalamet’s Paul when he first manages to ritually mount one of Arrakis’s giant sandworms: the beast thunderously ploughs up a monstrous sandbank, dragging him along with it, then crests its glittering ridge, and all you can feel is your stomach drop away beneath you. "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," That’s “Dune: Part Two,” the captivating and complex follow-up to director Denis Villeneuve’s grand 2021 film about a young duke who may or may not be an embattled world’s long-awaited messiah.  Villeneuve’s even better movie starts with a seamless transition from the last one. Paul (Timothée Chalamet), whose father was murdered, joins up with the Fremen, Arrakis natives who have been ruthlessly culled by House Harkonnen. Their home is enormously valuable because it’s the only place in the universe to hold spice, a substance that powers spaceships, gives users unnaturally long life and — uh-oh — is terribly addictive. Another balancing addition is a touch of romance, in the form of Zendaya’s Chani, a skilled Fremen fighter who falls for Paul. Reservedly, I should add. Heart-tugging orchestral music doesn’t swell as they make out and viewers don’t reach for the tissues here.  Speaking of happy tears, Villeneuve is careful — actually, much more careful than the last director to take on this story, David Lynch — to avoid “Dune” becoming a “Star Wars” or an “Avatar.” Although those differently excellent movies would surely not exist without Frank Herbert’s seminal novel “Dune,” this is a far more complicated tale of geopolitics and religion. Good and evil are not so clear-cut. For instance, Paul’s terrifying mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), who’s part of an all-powerful group with supernatural abilities called the Bene Gesserit, becomes the Fremen’s spiritual leader after drinking a blue poisonous liquid extracted from a dead baby sandworm. Adding to the madness, her unborn daughter, Alia, speaks to her in utero.  That freaky floating fatso Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is back, and is now joined by the even creepier Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Feyd’s a violent Darth Maul type, who looks like a hairless gerbil who got an Equinox membership. Butler surrenders Elvis’ charms to unquenchable bloodlust. But the series’ grounding force continues to be Chalamet. After singing and wisecracking as Willy Wonka, he’s back to his bread and butter: brooding and stoic contemplation.  It’s in this second chapter, however, that we realize how perfect the actor is for Paul. The European looks and indie angst that brought him instant fame in “Lady Bird” and “Call Me by Your Name” are key to bringing this uniquely troubled central figure to life. And if Villeneuve follows through on making “Dune: Part Three,” as he’s said he hopes to, audiences will soon learn the perils of risking your life and planet on a new hope."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve's “Dune: Part Two” (★★★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters now) bests his first 2021 epic, based on the classic Frank Herbert novels, in every significant way. Even though it snagged six Oscars (and a best picture nomination), the previous “Dune” was a mixed bag with lackluster storytelling – even David Lynch’s crazypants 1984 adaptation was a more entertaining exercise. But “Part Two” rights the cosmic battleship with plenty of staggering visuals, all the gigantic sandworms you’d ever want, plus a deeper thematic exploration of power, colonialism and religion. “Part One” introduced a sprawling fantasy landscape that centered on the desert planet Arrakis, where the precious resource of spice is mined. The family of House Atreides – including young Paul (Chalamet), heir apparent to the throne – is put in charge of operations but come under a massive attack by the villainous Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and House Harkonnen. Paul and his mom, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the witchy sisterhood Bene Gesserit, are seemingly the only survivors. Left to fend for themselves in the desert, they meet a tribe of the Indigenous Fremen – including Chani (Zendaya), a mystery woman whom Paul sees in his possibly prophetic visions. Here's the thing: Paul might be a messiah foretold in an ancient prophecy, and that’s the primary gist of “Part Two."" With the help of Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani, Paul learns the ways of being one of them, from living in hazardous desert conditions to riding sandworms. But there’s a divide among the Fremen about if he’s really the one said to deliver them to paradise. Paul also becomes of one the Freman’s fiercest fighters against the Harkonnen threat, so much so that the Baron installs his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) as the governor of Arrakis. He and Paul factor in a much larger game afoot, about who is and who should be in charge of ruling the universe. While the political dealings of the expansive “Dune” mythology were touched on in the first film, they’re one of the more fascinating aspects of the sequel as Villeneuve leans into them and weaves in debuting personalities. Christopher Walken plays the aging Emperor, Florence Pugh is his daughter Princess Irulan – who begins to worry about how unsteady the galaxy is becoming – and Lea Seydoux co-stars as Lady Margot, an ambitious member of the Bene Gesserit. Villeneuve doubles down on the sci-fi action, too, with more space battles, more vicious blade fights and more insect-y helicopters (which are honestly really cool). But they mean more this time around because there's actually some character development. Chalamet fleshes Paul out as a complex dude torn between loved ones and fretting over his fate, and a strong chemistry with Zendaya fuels the movie's core relationship. Ferguson’s Lady Jessica rises to become a gripping “Dune” persona, who goes from being extremely dry in the first film to an intriguingly determined figure in “Part Two.” The pasty-faced bald baddies of House Harkonnen, dangerous in the first film, now loom as a dastardly existential threat for our heroes. Skarsgård is super-creepy as the Baron, Dave Bautista gets more to do as his brutishly insecure oldest nephew Rabban, and for those who want to wipe Butler’s Elvis from their memory, watch him lick knives and chew scenery as the venomous yet magnetic Feyd-Rautha. And he doesn’t even show up till well into the movie: At two hours and 46 minutes, the latest “Dune” still feels long but packs in a bunch of mythology before the all-hands finale. Villeneuve leaves you wanting in his ""Empire Strikes Back""-like second chapter, but at least it’s not an anticlimactic cliffhanger like last time. That “Dune” ended with no real temptation to hurry back to Arrakis. When this “Dune” finishes, you’re not only ready for a third one but likely digging into the Herbert books with one hand while your other’s in a sandworm popcorn bucket."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," If you threw a rock on the internet when Dune: Part One came out, you’d hit a comment calling it “Star Wars for adults.” The sandworm-eating-its-own-tail of that assessment aside, Denis Villeneuve’s efforts to adapt Frank Herbert’s novel of interplanetary empire and rebellion really share more in common with Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy – films which transposed a thorny, dense literary mythology into an accessible, groundbreaking spectacle which remains beloved today. In that respect, Dune: Part Two’s considerable expansion of the story’s scope and splendor positions the movie as a Two Towers for the 2020s, a middle chapter that doubles down on the quirks of its source material and is largely successful at sustaining its unwieldy, fascinating identity. Dune: Part Two picks up in the immediate aftermath of the Harkonnens’ obliteration of House Atreides, with the supplanted Duke of Arrakis Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) hiding amongst the desert planet’s native Fremen people. After narrowly avoiding death himself, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is moving quickly to resume control of spice harvesting. The storyline splinters into a tapestry of war, intrigue, and destiny from there. For as heady and sometimes hard-to-follow as the mythmaking surrounding Paul gets – or the space politics, for that matter – Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts’ script constantly reinforces the most important information with streamlined efficiency. Dune: Part Two can’t even get to the Warner Bros. logo without reminding the audience how important spice is – remember, it’s the lifeblood of the economy in this far-off future – and it’s with that fervor that Baron Harkonnen sets about consolidating his family’s power. The success of Paul’s counteroffensive, and his rise as a messianic figure amongst the Fremen, are contingent of how much of himself he’s willing to sacrifice in the name of destiny, and Chalamet does a good job navigating the Kwisatz Haderach through the darker territory this time around.  Tense confrontations between Paul and trusted confidants like his mother and his mentor, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), serve to highlight Dune: Part Two’s story of generational divide, and Chalamet’s rising frustration feels well-pitched to the stakes as they boil over into a larger conflict. Villeneuve drives a particularly interesting wedge between Paul and Jessica, a far more active player this time around who tests the limits of her own Bene Gesserit power in some of the most surreal sequences of Part Two. Dune certainly traffics in big emotions, but there’s quiet tragedy in the distance that grows between Paul and Jessica as they reach fuller understandings of their own potential. After being more or less confined to dream sequences in Part One, Zendaya’s Chani is a focal point of Part Two. Her reluctance to accept Paul as the Lisan al Gaib – the savior promised to the Fremen by the Bene Gesserit – is representative of larger sociological forces at play, with Stilgar’s (Javier Bardem) Northern tribe being more secular than Arrakis’ zealous Southern Fremen. The Fremen will need to be united to stand against the forces of the Imperium, and the sacrifices and compromises that Chani make constantly ground the story with help from Zendaya’s direct, steely performance. If all this talk of prophecy and fate sounds like a rather ponderous way to spend 166 minutes, don’t worry – Villeneuve knows exactly when to drop one of Part Two’s fantastic action sequences. An early attack on a spice harvester gives the director ample opportunity to frame the central conflict in microcosm, with Fremen expertise and adaptability outpacing technological advantage in jaw-dropping fashion. Villeneuve’s as detail-oriented with Dune: Part Two’s bombast as he is with the spiritual minutiae, thrillingly staging battles and duels that remain in conversation with the human drama at play. It’s why Paul’s first sandworm ride – rapturously received by even Fremen who doubted him up to that point – feels like both a triumph and a bad omen. Villeneuve frequently asks the audience to remember that winning a battle does not mean winning a war, and Paul’s growing influence over the Fremen feels like an increasingly double-edged sword as Part Two goes on. With Rabban (Dave Bautista) proving to be all bark and no bite in his role heading up spice-mining operations, Baron Harkonnen turns his eye to an even more brutal nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). The younger Harkonnen’s raucous introduction through gladiatorial combat – and his compulsive throat-slitting – tells us everything we need to know about the character, and really, all there is to know. By design, Feyd-Rautha is a dark mirror of Paul – the kind of leader he fears he could become – and that’s about as much detail as Part Two commits to the character. Butler’s animalistic physicality and Skarsgårdian vocal qualities do a good job animating House Harkonnen’s id, but Feyd-Rautha is a tool of not only the characters in the story, but of the script itself. A similar fate befalls Part Two’s other notable addition to the cast, Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan. As counselor to her father Emperor Shaddam (Christopher Walken), Irulan’s scenes function to illustrate the precarious balance of power in the Imperium. Walken’s Shaddam is rendered as a frail, indecisive leader, which gives Pugh room to imbue Irulan with enough authority to feel like a power player, but the cutaways to the princess’ debates with her elders don’t have the same visceral power as the action on Arrakis and its on-the-ground perspective. The cat-and-mouse game between Fremen and Harkonnen, the hotly debated arrival of the Lisan al Gaib, Lady Jessica’s machinations – these movements of the story feel ominous and weighty and are handled with such panache that by the time of the Imperium’s delayed arrival on the desert planet, they feel out of touch in a way that makes them feel less threatening than they probably should. But no matter where in the universe Dune: Part Two’s narrative takes you, there’s incredible production design in place to hold you captive. A superlative, seamless blend of practical and visual effects make these distant worlds feel vibrant and tangible. Villeneuve keeps finding ways to ratchet up the atmosphere on Arrakis, with visions of glittering spice and dreamy, warm tones providing plenty of variety to the surface of the desert planet. Feyd-Rautha’s extended introduction on Giedi Prime gives the director and cinematographer Greig Fraser an excuse to shake up that visual language in favor of space-Brutalist architecture and a black and chrome palette that externalizes Harkonnen power quickly and impactfully, as if their gravity are enough to change how light bends on the planet. Dune: Part Two may ask for a lot of your time and focus, but it’s nearly impossible to look away from. It may come as a surprise that none of this resolves in a particularly satisfying way: The sequel more or less completes Villeneuve’s adaptation of Herbert’s first Dune novel, but it’s also very obviously the second act of a film trilogy. The ending is certainly less abrupt than Part One’s, but Paul’s fleeting glimpses of the future and Jessica’s doomsaying promise more fateful battles ahead, and by the time Part Two’s final showdown kicks into high gear, there are enough hanging plots threads and underdeveloped new characters to recognize there’s just not enough runway left to service them all. Villeneuve has more than earned our patience, and once this trilogy is complete, that feeling will no doubt lessen – but we’re still midstream. On its own terms, and despite all its strengths, Dune: Part Two’s desert power starts to fade by the time credits roll. Dune: Part Two expands the legend of Paul Atreides in spectacular fashion, and the war for Arrakis is an arresting, mystical ride at nearly every turn. Denis Villeneuve fully trusts his audience to buy into Dune’s increasingly dense mythology, constructing Part Two as an assault on the senses that succeeds in turning a sprawling saga into an easily digestible, dazzling epic. Though the deep world-building sometimes comes at the cost of fleshing out newer characters, the totality of Dune: Part Two’s transportive power is undeniable."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Having gone big in “Dune,” his 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s futuristic opus, the director Denis Villeneuve has gone bigger and more far out in the follow up. Set in the aftermath of the first movie, the sequel resumes the story boldly, delivering visions both phantasmagoric and familiar. Like Timothée Chalamet’s dashingly coifed hero — who steers monstrous sandworms over the desert like a charioteer — Villeneuve puts on a great show. The art of cinematic spectacle is alive and rocking in “Dune: Part Two,” and it’s a blast. It’s a surprisingly nimble moonshot, even with all its gloom and doom and brutality. Big-screen enterprises, particularly those adapted from books with a huge, fiercely loyal readership, often have a ponderousness built in to every image. In some, you can feel the enormous effort it takes as filmmakers try to turn reams of pages into moving images that have commensurate life, artistry and pop on the screen. Adaptations can be especially deadly when moviemakers are too precious with the source material; they’re torpedoed by fealty. “Dune” made it clear that Villeneuve isn’t that kind of textualist. As he did in the original, he has again taken plentiful liberties with Herbert’s behemoth (one hardcover edition runs 528 pages) to make “Part Two,” which he wrote with the returning Jon Spaihts. Characters, subplots and volumes of dialogue (interior and otherwise) have again been reduced or excised altogether. (I was sorry that the great character actor Stephen McKinley Henderson, who played an eerie adviser in the first movie, didn’t make the cut here.) The story — its trajectory, protagonist and concerns — remains recognizable yet also different. “Dune” turns on Paul Atreides (Chalamet), an aristocrat who becomes a guerrilla and crusader, and whose destiny weighs as heavily on him as any crown. In adapting “Dune,” Villeneuve effectively cleaved Herbert’s novel in half. (Herbert wrote six “Dune” books, a series that has morphed into a multimedia franchise since his death in 1986.) The first part makes introductions and sketches in Paul’s back story as the beloved only son of a duke, Leto (Oscar Isaac), and his concubine, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). When it opens, the royals, on orders from the universe’s emperor, are preparing to vacate their home planet, a watery world called Caladan, to the parched planet of Arrakis, a.k.a. Dune. The move to Arrakis goes catastrophically wrong; many members of House Atreides are murdered by their enemies, most notably the pallid, villainous House Harkonnen, and Paul’s father dies. Paul and the Lady Jessica escape into the desert where — after much side-eyeing and muttering along with one of those climactic mano-a-mano duels that turn fictional boys into men — they find uneasy allies in a group of Fremen, the planet’s Indigenous population. A tribal people who have adapted to Dune’s harsh conditions with clever survival tactics, like form-fitting suits that conserve bodily moisture, the Fremen are scattered across the planet under the emperor’s rule. Some fight to be free; many pray for a messiah. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two only stumbles in ways that hardly count, but with Villeneuve expertly guiding a truly talented ensemble cast, it all ultimately comes together. Dune: Part Two has a few issues, most of which can be linked back to the decision to make this a true Part One and Part Two experience, but they aren't pervasive enough to ruin an overall excellent film. When you decide to split a movie in half, some issues will come with that decision that just cannot be avoided. The structure and pacing of your film will be a bit off because you aren't giving people two complete films; you're giving them 50% of a movie with the promise of wrapping things up by the end of the second. Plenty of movies have dealt with this split well, and Dune is one of those films. Part One was a bit on the slower side, and the front half of that film was very lore-heavy with a ton of exposition, ending on a cliffhanger. Dune: Part Two hits the ground running and makes no assumption that you are here having seen Part One and having seen it recently. Dune, both as a film and a book, has never been about holding its audience's hand. However, even though this is the movie's second half, things still take a long time to get going. Instead of this entire film being an extended third act, the movie feels more like an extended second act with a shorter-than-expected third act. Some things need to be explained as Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), adapt to an entirely new way of living. It's another way of dropping a ton of lore and exposition on us, which does feel out of place for a Part Two. However, it's also incredibly important that we see how Fremen live because we need to see how Paul becomes one of them and, eventually, their leader. The opening moments with Paul learning how to live in the desert, him bonding with Chani (Zendaya), Jessica possibly going completely off her rocker, and the Fremen slowly starting to believe that Paul is the One are necessary. Much like the first film, these moments will likely become better the second time around; much of Dune appears to be enjoyed more on round two because you can just let it wash over you. However, the first time through and for people unfamiliar with all of the lore, it will be a lot to take in, and some of these sections will likely start to drag. The decision to tweak the timeline of the second half of the story could annoy book purists because some changes are very different, but they do appear to be made in an attempt to make all of this a bit more palpable for the masses. All of this, however, are merely nitpicks against a film that ultimately delivers. This is a hard book to adapt; there is a reason why we have seen so few adaptations even though this book came out in 1965. It's a massive story about a big world that seemed impossible not long ago. There is also the fact that director Denis Villeneuve is adapting something that is part of the DNA of so much science fiction that we see today that there was the worry that this film would somehow feel redundant because so many things have been ripping Dune off that Dune itself would feel unoriginal. These two films prove that with the right people guiding an adaptation, much like Peter Jackson and Lord of the Rings, you can be a foundational piece of media and still feel just as original when you finally get that big adaptation. The cast does much of the heavy lifting here, and there isn't a weak link in the bunch. It's one of those ensembles where you're disappointed that some characters don't get more screen time because they are doing a good job with the limited amount of time they are given. Much will be said about Austin Butler, who absolutely goes for it as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, and Florence Pugh remains as ethereal as always as Princess Irulan. The woman is royalty in all of our hearts. However, the movie's MVP will likely be Ferguson, who is given a tough role to play with Jessica when she starts down this new path, and they do something really interesting with her that feels very true to the character while also being amusing. Javier Bardem as Stilgar is likely the other one who will be overlooked as we see the journey of a man witnessing his faith bear fruit. At the center of all of this are Chalamet and Zendaya. Paul is a notoriously difficult character for people to wrap their heads around because you think he is supposed to go in one direction while writer Frank Herbert explicitly points you in the other. The script and Chalamet do a better job of portraying Paul as, frankly, less of a manipulative asshole than he is in the book and more of a man scared to death of the future he's desperately trying to avoid while still trying to make a difference. Chani is another place where the film deviates from the book, changing one of the most one-note love interests in fiction to someone who has a very strong opinion on all of this and isn't going to follow Paul around. Dune: Part Two only stumbles in ways that hardly count, but with Villeneuve expertly guiding a truly talented ensemble cast, it all ultimately comes together. There is no denying the pacing and structure issues that come with this being half a movie, but it also feels massive because Villeneuve was given two films to adapt this massive book. There were so many places all of this could have gone wrong, and the fact that it mostly went right is yet another one of those movie miracles. Villeneuve and his two Dune films join the ranks of Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings as one of those adaptations where, somehow, source material older than most people who are seeing the film still feels new."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," It takes chutzpah to restart your years-in-the-making sci-fi epic in the womb, but after a quick prologue, that’s basically where “Dune: Part Two” begins. The floating fetus, we’re told, communicates with mother and brother not in the typical ooh, the baby’s kicking fashion, but rather, in full-blown telepathic sentences about interplanetary strategy and guerrilla warfare. She is the unborn Alia and her sibling, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), has words for her, too: “Sister, Father is dead,” he says, sounding less like a hero on the rise than a glum teenager in need of a hug. There’s a spooky grandeur to these scenes with the galaxy-brain baby, one in keeping with the overall spirit of Frank Herbert’s revolutionary 1965 novel, which was itself in conversation with a future generation. For all its Campbellian myth building, the book spoke to a dawning audience of young people who wanted drugs (fine, call it “spice”), expanded consciousness and eco-awareness. Over the years, “Dune” has lured the most audacious filmmakers to crash their dream ships on its craggy shores, visionaries like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky. I would never have put the spectacle-minded French Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve in their company — and still wouldn’t. But he understands something about “Dune” that those cult creators never did, an insight that makes the second half of his colossal-feeling, frequently staggering adaptation an instant landmark of its genre. (The sentient unborn Alia is Villeneuve’s own invention, a departure from Herbert’s text.) He widens our eyes with big action hugeness — the products of an army of visual effects experts — but then asks us, as he did with 2016’s “Arrival,” to interpret and connect the dots. Less an act of literary fidelity than generosity, his sequel plunges us into the book’s messianic prophecies, but also into spiritual uncertainty, cultural conflict and doubt, as it must. Somehow, Villeneuve has made a “Dune” for right now — and tomorrow. If the chair-rattling first movie prioritized Imax-sized mood over incident (no small feat during our pandemic-challenged 2021), it nonetheless set the billiard balls in motion and we return to them midbreak. Rebecca Ferguson’s pregnant Lady Jessica and Chalamet’s Paul are strangers in a strange land: the sole survivors of House Atreides, their family and army recently murdered in a sneak attack on Arrakis, the arid, unforgiving desert world where precious spice is mined. It’s scary enough to be pursued by armored, faceless soldiers who can float up the sides of canyons, but Jessica and Paul also find themselves barely tolerated by the local Fremen, a blue-eyed people who see them as interchangeable with any other invader. Their presence is also complicated by an ancient, controversial legend, a tale that anticipates the coming of a revolutionary fighter, the Voice From the Outer World. Almost immediately, undercurrents of colonialism and imposed mysticism elevate Villeneuve’s central performances in ways the first movie could only suggest. Chalamet’s delicate features take on a haunted sharpness as Paul hopes to earn what his mother, the Bene Gesserit priestess Jessica, would rather manipulate into being by converting nonbelievers. (Ferguson, her face tattooed throughout much of the movie, leans into an arresting menace.) Two finely complex supporting turns add depth to the mother-son survival story: Zendaya’s suspicious Fremen soldier Chani, falling for Paul despite her better judgment; and a roaring, religiously transported Javier Bardem, who, with avuncular warmth, goes all in on the prophecy. There are gigantic sandworms to be mounted and surfed like waves, vials of blue goo to be imbibed for clarifying properties, yet “Dune: Part Two” fixes firmly on the idea of authenticity. At every step, the script (by Villeneuve and returning co-writer Jon Spaihts) injects Herbert’s Arabian-inspired milieu with a countervailing critique. Is Paul, their “desert mouse,” a pretender in hiding? We’ve mapped out 27 of the best movie theaters in L.A., from the TCL Chinese and the New Beverly to the Alamo Drafthouse and which AMC reigns in Burbank. Meanwhile, Paul learns to take down spice harvesters and conduct raids, his pale skin covered in dark goggles and shawls. How are we to receive this gargantuan slab of occupation and racial cooptation? It’s a hand grenade of a question that will no doubt be lobbed at “Dune: Part Two,” as it is, sometimes, at 1962’s soaring “Lawrence of Arabia,” the origins of which were an influence on Herbert. The answer will vary from viewer to viewer, but to these eyes Villeneuve enters into what could have been toxic with a conscious, scene-by-scene sense of fatalism, Chalamet stirring his character’s rise with notes of rage, guilt, unhappiness and imposter syndrome. Composer Hans Zimmer’s drone-laden score never strikes a tone of triumphalism; so much of this movie’s tricky poise is his. Then, on a dime, the film executes a stunning transformation, shifting to the spoiled-milk palette of Giedi Prime, an overindustrialized hellscape illuminated by a “black sun” where a young baron-to-be presents a challenge to Paul’s cosmic birthright. (Boldly, cinematographer Greig Fraser shoehorns in an entire second movie shot in silvery monochrome.) Austin Butler’s commitment to “Elvis” was the stuff of legend, but his eerie Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen may be just as impressive: a pallid, hairless monster prone to roars and dark appetites. These scenes — futuristic fascist rallies and gladiatorial stabbings — lift the whole of “Dune” into a realm of ominous stakes. You lean in for the showdown that’s inevitable. There are still elements of Herbert’s saga that no filmmaker, not even one as thoughtful as Villeneuve, can solve. It’s got one royal princess too many — here she’s played by Florence Pugh in a role that’s almost as thankless as the part Lynch gave to Virginia Madsen. She can’t be the ultimate prize of a battle this consequential. And the idea of a holy war that turns on the last-minute rediscovery of the “family atomics” seems a touch stuck in the 1960s, even if it is masterminded by a scruffy presence as likable as Josh Brolin. But has the final stretch of a movie ever leaned so heavily on the quivering chin of one actor? Zendaya wrestles with the ramifications of her Paul turned fierce and vengeful and oh-so-political. Chalamet stomps his foot and the camera shakes.  “Dune: Part Two” isn’t a battle for freedom won, so much as the beginning of something far more cynical, the potential for an entire universe to explode into flames. Villeneuve has made good on one of the great Hollywood gambles in recent memory, delivering a two-part epic of literary nuance, timely significance and maybe even the promise of another film or two. Like that talking baby in the womb, it speaks to what’s coming more than we may know. Joshua Rothkopf is film editor of the Los Angeles Times. He most recently served as senior movies editor at Entertainment Weekly. Before then, Rothkopf spent 16 years at Time Out New York, where he was film editor and senior film critic. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, Sight and Sound, Empire, Rolling Stone and In These Times, where he was chief film critic from 1999 to 2003."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," It's been three years since Denis Villeneuve brought his twin directorial passions (breathtaking vistas, whispered dialogue) to bear on Frank Herbert's beloved 1965 sci-fi novel/spice-opera. Now that, with Dune: Part Two, he's nailed the dismount with such assured visual sweep and splendor — and enriched many of the novel's thin characterizations in the process — it's worth examining why his approach worked then, and works now.  After all, many before him had attempted to distill that thick book's internecine tale of disparate interests who jockey for galactic control using tools like war, eugenics, mind control and propaganda. What was so bracing about Villeneuve's 2021 film, besides its many, many arresting set-pieces, was its decision to leave all those plotting families and their deviously chewy schemes-within-schemes just sort of churning along in the background.  He had a primary job to do before turning to that stuff, which was to get audiences invested in his brooding hero, whose cheekbones were so sharp they could slice Pecorino and whose raven hair couldn't seem to help but swoop Byronically. That would be young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), who with his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) found himself stranded on the desert planet of Arrakis after his father was murdered by a treacherous rival family.  Fortunately, Arrakis was home to an indigenous population called the Fremen who had adapted to living in the desert. They took Paul and his mother in – a strange decision made less strange once you realize that one of those aforementioned shadowy galactic groups had long ago planted prophecies among the Fremen of a savior who would come from another planet and lead them in an uprising that would turn Arrakis into a paradise.  Villeneuve knew that beneath all the book's fussy business about trading charters and ancient mystic sects and the intricacies of space navigation, there was a very clear and simple Chosen One narrative, complete with reluctant hero, refusal of the call – the whole Joseph Campbell schmear, really. So that's what he set out to tell, though he did take the time to dress it up in epic battles and endless horizons and great cheekbones and Charlotte Rampling sniffily sniping at everyone while swanning around in a veil.  Dune ended with Paul and Jessica encountering a Fremen tribe and its leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Part Two begins where it left off – with Paul making the acquaintance of one particular Fremen warrior named Chani (Zendaya), whom he'd previously glimpsed only through prophetic dreams.  The first film tackled the hard work of arranging the game pieces on the board, so Part Two swiftly sets about bashing them into one another. All those factional conflicts roiling away throughout the first film finally get to boil over at last.  The Baron pits his two nephews, feral Rabban (Dave Bautista) and sinister Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), against each other. Bautista rages, Butler slithers – and pulls off an impressive Skarsgård impression while he's at it, proving 1. Sneery, grumbly line-readings run in the Harkonnen genes, and 2. His Elvis was no fluke, this kid's one gifted mimic. Rising up against the Harkonnens are the Fremen, markedly and gratifyingly less monolithic here than they are in the book. Both Bardem and Zendaya get a lot more screentime this time out, and they each make the most of it, in vastly different ways. Stilgar is a true believer in Paul and his prophecy, yet Bardem doesn't play him credulous or naive; instead he finds the dry wit in the script's few jokes and proceeds to toss them away like the pro he is.  Zendaya's tough, independent Chani belongs to a younger generation of Fremen who see the prophecies around Paul for what they are – a clever marketing ploy, executed over hundreds of years via selective breeding. (Zendaya brings a grounded, searching ambivalence to her portrayal, which makes the Chani of the original novel seem like a one-note, lovesick child by comparison.) And finally there's the emperor, Shaddam IV, played by Christopher Walken with what counts, for him, as restraint. His daughter Irulan (Florence Pugh) wasn't in the first film, but here she gets a few scenes to helpfully narrate the movie's many gearshifts for us – a role the character (her diary, anyway) plays in the book, too. In those fleeting glimpses we get of her, Pugh manages to invest Irulan with sufficient intelligence and empathy to justify her presence in this film, and to make you want to see more of her in the future. Which is a sneaky way of telling you that the film only sort of concludes the story that the first film began. Here's why that's not a bad thing. Nothing about Dune or Dune: Part Two feels padded or unnecessary. (Indeed, Herbert purists will complain about the wholesale eliding of entire plotlines – and one fan-favorite character, in particular.) Villeneuve carefully planted seeds in Part One that not only bear fruit in Part Two, but that fundamentally change the story being told in the process. If you hadn't read the book, you might have come out of Part One thinking its story was simply yet another Chosen One narrative (which it was), and yet another White Savior narrative (which it wasn't, exactly): After all, no sooner does Paul arrive on Arrakis than some Fremen start to whisper he is the prophesied leader who will lead them to victory.  Villeneuve's decision to foreground Paul to the extent he did in the first film easily fed that reading. But in Part Two, the director makes explicit what he kept implicit before – various galactic puppetmasters emerge from the shadows, their agendas resolve into focus. This causes Paul's relationship to the Fremen to grow more complicated: Will he be their savior, or will he damn them to hell? Is he being used by others, or is he using them? Is he in control, or is he not?  Throughout the film, Villeneuve keeps adding texture to storylines and relationships that Herbert was content to keep smooth, or only introduce in later books. As a result, the film's conclusion feels far less conclusive than that of the novel.  But is that so bad, really? Especially if it means we might get Dune: Messiah: Part One a few years down the road, with Villeneuve at the helm?  In Villeneuve's hands, a sci-fi epic like Dune: Part Two can deliver what's expected – big stakes, big conflicts, big explosions – but it can do so in a clear and rigorously consistent visual language that serves the story. Even in the biggest battle scenes, his camera keeps us focused on what matters most – the human cost of it all. He closes in on eyes, hands, the movement of bodies. A wide shot which finds Harkonnen troops in black warsuits crawling over a sandy outcropping gets its visual and thematic echo later, in close-up, as black ants swarm over a human body.  Villaneuve finds moments like that one, and creates many others that the novel never even bothered to hint at, that collectively serve to deepen, humanize and ultimately improve both the story of Paul Atreides himself (as he did in Dune) and of everything he will unleash (in Dune: Part Two ... and, let's hope, in what comes next). "
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,After somewhat laboriously placing those chess pieces on the board in the first Dune&#44; Villenueve and co-screenwriter Jon Spaihts send them into strategic alliances and conflicts&#44; and the results are often breathtaking&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The second part of Denis Villeneuve’s monumental Dune adaptation lands with a sternum-juddering crash; it’s another shroom of a film, an epic sci-fi hallucination whose images speak of fascism and imperialism, of guerrilla resistance and romance. Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel – working with co-writer Jon Spaihts – draws on David Lean, George Lucas and Ridley Scott’s Gladiator in the (perhaps inevitable) mega-stadium combat scene with the tiny billions of CGI crowds in the bleachers. But he really has made it all his own: secular political cruelty meets Indigenous people’s struggle in those vast mysterious planetscapes. The sound design throbs and drones in this film’s bloodstream, lending a queasy frisson to its extraordinary visual spectacle and the recurrent horror-fetish BDSM chic which appears to govern so much intergalactic-wrongdoer style. My only reservation is that some of the momentum that the first part had built up has been lost since that movie was released more than two years ago. Those outside the existing Dune fanbase could feel that the ending does not deliver the resounding closure to which we all might, maybe naively, consider ourselves entitled to at the end of 330 minutes total screen time. And the final eventful moments of the film feel a bit rushed, as if Shakespeare had decided to shrink Henry VI Part III into a zappy coda to go at the end of Part II. None of that damages the film’s flair and staggering display. We begin with another extraordinary and surreal desert-battle scene with the invented technological detail that is so commanding and distinctly scary, as if we are witnessing a posthuman evolutionary development. The signature design touches are presented with absolute confidence; in any other film, those black nasal tubes would look odd, especially when the two leads are expected to kiss while wearing them. Here you accept it. We are on the planet Arrakis, with its hugely lucrative mineral resource of Spice, under the hideously corrupt Harkonnen rule, having brought off a duplicitous coup against the Atreides family, to whom the emperor had assigned administration rights. The Harkonnens are the gruesome Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his creepy nephews Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and the even creepier Feyd-Rautha, played by Austin Butler. The charismatic Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is still gallantly fighting with the Fremen insurgency, in love with Chani (Zendaya) and considered by warrior Stilgar (Javier Bardem) to be their messiah. But Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), part of the occult Bene Gesserit sisterhood, is with him also, taking her own place in the Fremen power structure. A great reckoning between the Fremen and the Harkonnen is approaching, and between Paul and the Emperor and his daughter Princess Irulan; these latter are slightly perfunctory roles for Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh. It’s a panorama of shimmering strangeness, now expanded to include a bigger cast, with Léa Seydoux on classically feline and insinuating form as the Bene Gesserit initiate Lady Margot Fenring and a tiny, almost subliminal cameo for Anya Taylor-Joy. As before, the second Dune film is superb at showing us an entire created world, a distinct and now unmistakable universe, which will probably be much imitated: a triumph for cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette. Hans Zimmer’s score provides exactly the right tone, at once plangent and grandiose. Villeneuve shows such ambition and boldness here, and a real film-making language. But I can’t help feeling now, at the very end, that though it’s impossible to imagine anyone doing Dune better – or in any other way – somehow he hasn’t totally got his arms around the actual story in the one giant, self-contained movie in the way he got them around his amazing Blade Runner 2049. There’s no doubt that Chalamet carries a romantic action lead with great style, even though there is so much going on, with so many other characters, that his heroism and romance with Chani is decentred. But this is a real epic and it is exhilarating to find a film-maker thinking as big as this."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part 2 is the next chapter in the Dune saga as filmmaker Denis Villeneuve brings his vision of the Frank Herbert novel to the screen. It’s such a classic line and comes to mind upon seeing a Dune movie on the big screen. Arrakis is a sand planet so I’m not going to miss an opportunity to use the line. That being said, I wonder if Academy voters will remember this film during awards season. Or awards voters in general. It’s one thing for a January film festival selection to stay with you but those films generally get a release a few months later. That’s not the case here. Granted, Black Panther earned a Best Picture nomination but Marvel also did a major push for it. Will Dune: Part 2 at least get the same love in categories such as sound? We’ll just have to wait and see. I need to talk about something. How is it that nobody in this film ever complains about the sand getting everywhere? You’d think someone would have to clean out their shoes or something due to the sand! Oh, well. I digress. Audiences reunite with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), Chani (Zendaya), Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Stilgar (Javier Bardem), and the Fremen as Villeneuve takes us on the second part of Paul’s journey. Their journeys are different and there are certainly disagreements. Regardless, Paul is dead set on getting revenge against the Harkonnen for his father’s death. He just won’t do it at any cost. He sees visions of the future and they impact his every move. It’s only once Paul sees the bigger picture that he knows what he must do. After all, the inevitable Dune: Part 3 depends on what Paul decides to do. Yes, this film ends on a cliff-hanger. As for who will survive long enough to be in the next sequel, you’ll just have to wait and see. Villeneuve reteams with a number of Oscar winners on his team. This certainly isn’t surprising. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right? I fully expect many of them to repeat as Oscar nominees for their work. The film is every bit as epic as the first film although its 2 hour, 46 minute run time feels every minute of it. In fairness, the press screening was at 11 AM and there was at least one restroom break. Lunchtime screenings can do that but keep that in mind when it comes to beverages. Anyway, there’s more action and visuals. It really feels bigger in every way.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," PLOT: Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) continues his war against the Harkonens. But, he realizes that the Fremen consider him more of a messiah than a leader and is tormented by not only the prospect of defeat but of victory too.  REVIEW: Back in the dark days of the pandemic, one of the true moviegoing tragedies was that enough people didn’t see Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One on the big screen. With many of the set pieces being shot for IMAX, it was an altogether different experience in cinemas than it was streaming. Had it come out at a different time, it would have made at least double the still impressive $108 million it made domestically. With the sequel hitting theatres, this will likely be the first time a huge chunk of the audience is seeing Villeneuve’s adaptation of the Frank Herbert classic the way it was meant to be seen, with the desert vistas of Arakkis all the more stunning on a giant IMAX screen. As such, I’m expecting a massive box office jump for this, especially with the two young stars, Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, being significantly bigger now than they were in 2021. Quality-wise, Dune: Part Two is a stunning achievement. A much more action-driven story than the exposition-heavy first film, it wastes no time plunging us directly into the war between the Freman and the Harkonens, picking up in the immediate aftermath of Paul’s knife fight with the Freeman warrior Jamis. Many are comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back, and that’s pretty fair, as it picks up in the middle of a chaotic war and has a conclusion that leaves us anticipating a third film (which is to be based on Dune Messiah).  Indeed, I can only think of a handful of times in recent years when I’ve been so immersed in a film. I don’t think it ever really happened to me last year outside of maybe Oppenheimer, and the scale and verisimilitude of Villeneuve’s work is staggering. By design, it feels like half of a bigger whole with the first film. Even still, I think those who might have found the first Dune too talky might find this the kind of quality jump The Dark Knight made from Batman Begins. It really grabs you right off the bat and doesn’t let go until the end credits. Villeneuve has shot the entire film with IMAX cameras this time, giving it a staggering visual look that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. This might be the best-looking film Greig Fraser has ever shot, and that’s saying something considering his filmography. The cast is uniformly excellent, from the returnees to the new additions. Timothée Chalamet was always ideally cast as Paul Atreides, and in Dune 2, he makes a convincing transition, as he has to go from the boy duke of the first film to a leader crushed under the weight of destiny. The theme of this film makes it much different from David Lynch’s adaptation of the same material. That was a heroic take on the messianic themes of the novel. By contrast, Villeneuve’s movie shows the devastating cost to Paul, with him a more reluctant leader here than we’ve seen before.  Chalamet is expertly supported, with Rebecca Ferguson’s Lady Jessica more of a schemer this time with an unhinged lust for power that doesn’t make her all that different from the Harkonens, putting her at odds with her heroic son. Zendaya’s Chani grounds him, with her evoking both her character’s deep, almost star-crossed love for Paul, as well as her bittersweet knowledge of the fact that Paul’s destiny may take him far away from her or make him a different man than the one she fell in love with. Physically, she and Chalamet look amazing together, with the fight scenes the two are in expertly shot, with the moves perfectly complimenting each other in a way that shows the character’s connection even extends to the battlefield.  Meanwhile, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are touching as Paul’s two pseudo-father figures. Bardem is Stilgar, the Fremen leader convinced Paul is the messiah they’ve been waiting for, while Brolin’s Gurney is his last connection to the House of Atreides. Both men give the impression of being willing to sacrifice everything, including their lives, for Paul, making their performances tremendously affecting. Bardem also finds a few moments of humour here and there to lighten the mood a bit, as overall, this is pretty heavy stuff. As far as the baddies go, Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård have bigger roles this time, even if, in terms of menace, they can’t help but be eaten alive by the saga’s newest addition. Indeed, Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha may be the role that finally gets people to stop looking at him as Elvis, with him playing a sadistic baddie who’s about as far removed from The King of rock n’ roll as you can get. His intensity and sadism push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating, and the final confrontation with Paul will likely rank highly among the best action scenes of the year. Meanwhile, other new additions to the cast, including Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh have comparably less screen time as the Emperor and his daughter. Still, both convey the scheming, calculating natures of the characters with aplomb (Pugh is set to have a much larger role in the sequel). The casting in the entire saga has been impeccable all the way through. Plus, the score by Hans Zimmer remains the perfect soundtrack for what – should it get a third instalment as expected – may well end up being the great sci-fi trilogy of our generation, being up there with the original Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. In this day of assembly line blockbusters, it’s a miracle that director Denis Villeneuve has managed to get not one but two incredible, uncompromised epics like this through the studio system. It works as a tentpole blockbuster, but Dune Part Two is also filmmaking at the highest level. It’s a real cinematic event everyone owes it to themselves to take in and hopefully won’t be forgotten come Oscar time. It’s a masterpiece.  Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Extraordinary filmmaking&#46; While the first film was impressive&#44; this sequel is one of the greatest sci-fi &#47; war films of all time&#46; Visually stunning but this time also strong character development &amp; commentary&#46; Also lots of inventive action&#46; A must see&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"You might expect a big-budget space opera to exhilarate you and move you, and on those terms Villeneuve's sprawling, pretentious folly has to count as an abject failure. But if you want to feel awestruck, that's another matter."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The most radical thing about director Denis Villeneuve’s handling of Dune is how accessible he’s managed to make it. We may never have a proper idea of how well ‘Part One’ may have done sans its simultaneous theatrical and home release due to Covid. Still, its various accolades (including six Oscars) and the visible anticipation I’ve seen for this sequel make it clear that Frank Herbert’s famously dense novel has been adapted in a manner fitting for those seeking a respectable and approachable sci-fi epic. This is what Dune: Part Two also delivers – blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. With a more action-packed story, big movie star performances, and astonishing visuals, there’s so much accomplished here that stems from the confidence of the filmmakers involved and their trust in the audience’s willingness to dive even deeper into the world of Arrakis. Being a true ‘Part Two,’ this film picks up where we last left things with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). He’s now the exiled Duke of House Atreides, as he and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), were forced to unite with the Fremen who live in the dangerous but spice-enriched deserts of Arrakis. Fortunately for Paul, Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, leader of one of the Fremen tribes, believes the young Duke to be their messiah, the Muad’Dib. As Paul becomes more accustomed to the Fremen life, including mastering the skill of riding the giant sandworms and developing a relationship with the woman he had seen in his dreams, Chani (Zendaya), The evil House Harkonnen is not content with their takedown of House Atreides. They are now looking to conquer the rest of planet Arrakis, including taking down the one known as Muad’Dib, responsible for leading attacks on Harkonnen soldiers and stopping spice harvesting. Perhaps more summary than necessary, but you must understand that there are a lot of moving parts involved (I haven’t even discussed the religious angles tied to Lady Jessica or the wicked heavy, Feyd-Ruatha, played with slimy delight by Austin Butler). Does that mean the casual viewer may be a bit lost wandering into Dune: Part Two without seeing the previous film or maybe only having a partial memory of what the first film offered? Perhaps, but if there’s an expectation of seeing a previous excellent movie to get the most out of an equally terrific (if not better) follow-up, so be it. If anything, however, some streamlining has occurred to have this film’s narrative flow as cleanly as it does. Having removed various players from the board, the movie can focus more clearly on Paul as the story’s lead character. Yes, we have subplots to consider and the introduction of new characters, but the world-building is more rooted in what we are experiencing from one character’s point of view. With that in mind, I again have to praise Chalamet for commanding the screen the way he does. Paul Atreides could easily land as a bland role used to shuffle us toward the more interesting characters, but there’s enough specificity for the actor to play into that allows us to respond favorably to his interactions, whether it’s with Zendaya’s equally strong Chani, or how he stands up the various elders who are either with or against him. Plus, any actor who gets the opportunity to lead us through a whole ordeal involving jumping onto the backs of sandworms and figuring out how to properly ride it goes a long way for me. As one who is happy to appreciate contemplative sci-fi stories and the depiction of massive creatures, this movie knows how to satisfy my interests. Among the returning cast members, Bardem gets more of a chance to shine this time around. Once you’re cool with the Fremen, Stilgar is apparently very happy to let his guard down, which lets Bardem occupy a mentor role that injects a decent amount of levity and gravitas in a scenario where waxing poetically or seriously about sand is a status quo. Meanwhile, Josh Brolin somehow combines world-weariness with warmth, allowing Paul another reliable comrade. On the other side, watching Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgård become more unhinged as villainous Harkonnen provides the film with adversaries you just know will be satisfyingly dispatched. The new additions also find their footing in this expansive universe, with particular praise going to the always welcome Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV and Butler’s ruthless warrior. With Walken, it’s not like he has to do much here, but there’s a presence that’s very welcome to see on screen, as he underplays the emotion of a man driven purely by power, with conflicting support from his daughter, played by Florence Pugh. Butler, on the other hand, is a total rock star in how he handles a fierce fighter willing to cut the throat of anyone around him, whether by necessity or for amusement. Accompanied by some of the film’s more creative cinematography approaches, while the film may linger on what kind of hero Paul is, there’s no mistaking the pure dark evil that someone like Butler’s Feyd-Rutha represents. Looking at the filmmaking as a whole, there’s no reason to expect less than what was delivered the first time around. Shot for IMAX, including 70 mm sections, Dune: Part Two looks and feels like a huge movie. The sense of scale is tremendous, even without losing sight of those who matter. Greig Fraser’s work to capture the details of the planet Arrakis at various times of day, what other homeworlds look like, what it means to see Fremen and Harkonnen in battle with each other, and more, all do so much to visualize this story in an exceptional manner akin to what some of the best sci-fi films have to offer. Hans Zimmer once again brings in the unique ideas that made his first Dune score stand out in his prolific, generally great (and also somewhat familiar) catalog. Much like the notion of creating languages and writing for films like this, which extends from ideas found in and expanded on what’s been conceived in the past, Zimmer is finding auditorily arresting ways to build anthems, ideas, and motifs from various instruments and unusual tools to match ambition taken to create the depiction of this universe. As a sequel that needs to respond to what the previous film served up story-wise, I could say there’s a certain inevitability to what’s taking place that, on the surface, could take away from the suspense of what’s to occur. However, I think that’s an easy way out of exploring what’s actually present here. From a plot standpoint, the aims are never unclear or feel as if they are threatened from occurring how they do. Still, with so many characters, it’s easy to be unsure who will arrive at the finish line, let alone how they do it. Moreover, Villeneuve frankly makes it a lot of fun to see how this all occurs. Dune: Part Two has the benefit of already having many character introductions and the understanding of allegiances out of the way, meaning the action arrives a lot faster (and furiouser). Now, it’s not as if I wasn’t on board with the previous film for being more meditative (again, I like both films about the same), but if one film was merely teasing the existence of sandworms, you better believe that a movie focused on how Paul Atreides and the Fremen get back at the Harkonnen means a lot more visceral fun that ranges from sandworm attacks to large scale dagger/knife fights to guerrilla warfare. This is a sci-fi blockbuster, after all, and committing to providing a certain kind of entertainment with such a large scale in mind means getting down to business pretty frequently and quite satisfyingly. With that in mind, while exploring the more psychedelic side of the material was never going to match whatever Alejandro Jodorowsky had in mind for his proposed Dune film from the 70s, it’s not as though Villeneuve is uninterested in what implications there are to what Paul represents, the conflict seen within the Fremen (and the film’s own battle with recognizing implicit notions of appropriation and other potential landmines), and the extent to which we can connect with the Bene Gesserit characters (the spiritual/superpowered ones) portrayed by Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling, and Léa Seydoux, among others. Without getting into it further, it excites me to know there’s more to think about in regards to what else the film is after here, let alone the potential there is to realize these aspects even further down the line. There is so much to praise about Dune: Part Two in the sort of way that allows me to feel immense relief after such skepticism in adapting this story. Not that I didn’t think Villeneuve and his team, including co-writer Jon Spaihts, didn’t have it in them, but watching this lengthy 165-minute film unfold and continually finding myself intrigued, excited, and curious about where it was going next is a true accomplishment. Having the means to deliver a top-quality experience for a story that means a lot to many people while skillfully bringing in a new audience is certainly worth admiring as well. Whether or not I make it back to Arrakis anytime soon, just know that this is undoubtedly one of the high points for the genre in recent years. It’s well worth taking in the desert power on display and flowing with it."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Part Two possesses state-of-the-art cinematic qualities that reward soaking in its grandeur... After the initial promise, though, the film only sporadically rises to the level of its sky-high expectations."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," 
Villeneuve’s movie also wore its ambitions on its sleeve, or rather, its title card: This was very much Part One, clocking in close to three hours yet stopping roughly halfway through the book. Whether or not he’d get to finish what he started was up in the air until his corporate patrons were convinced there was indeed an audience ready for sandworms, mystical sororities (big up the Bene Gesserit!) and a hesitant Muad’Dib.  
	Thank your respective gods that Villeneuve got the greenlight for another chapter. His Dune: Part Two isn’t just a continuation of a saga. The French-Canadian filmmaker has delivered an expansion and a deepening of the world built off of Herbert’s prose, a YA romance blown up to Biblical-epic proportions, a Shakespearean tragedy about power and corruption, and a visually sumptuous second act that makes its impressive, immersive predecessor look like a mere proof-of-concept. Villeneuve has outdone himself. More importantly, he’s done justice to the scope and scale and sheer weirdness of a stoner-lit touchstone’s back half without, pun intended, sanding away its edges. It’s unapologetically geeky. It’s twice as unapologetically cinematic. 
	It’s in this extended, Lawrence-of-Arrakis opening section of Dune: Part Two that you get the stakes laid out for both Paul and the fight for the planet, with Villeneuve once again proving that he can meld a visionary’s eye with a big-tentpole filmmaker’s instinct for spectacle. He understands how science fiction threads a needle between the familiar and the otherworldly, adding in oddball touches that suggest galaxies far, far away while grounding the human drama with gravitas and girding it with adrenaline. The gent also knows how to compose for a giant screen, filling set pieces with unexpected grace notes amidst the sound and fury. Watching Paul and Chani take on attack ships with the equivalent of a rocket launcher while ducking behind a harvest machine’s steel legs makes you feel as if you’re in the hands of someone who understands how to choreograph action. When you gasp as these freedom fighters sprint horizontally as an exploding vessel falls vertically behind them with perfect shock-and-awe timing, you realize that you’re watching a genuine cineaste at work. And he can make a static shot of a figure staring out at a vast landscape seem as exhilarating and beguiling as a cast-of-thousands firefight. Even his non-moving pictures thrum. 
	But this act is also where you see Paul Atreides come into his own, and by extension, the actor who plays him. Part Two is where you see a boy having grown into a man, who then evolves into a reluctant — and eventually not-so-reluctant — savior. There’s a sense that Chalamet has not just stepped into the role but stepped up his game to play Paul 2.0, even if his coy courtship of Zendaya’s character occasionally veers into heartthrob’s-gonna-heartthrob territory. It helps immensely that her role is much more prominent, and that she’s an equal when it comes to taking down enemy combatants and holding your attention. You get a lot more Zendaya for your buck here.  
	Which is necessary, because that’s when Dune: Part Two decides to trot out its villain di tutti villains. Dune fanatics may recall, fondly or otherwise, Sting’s portrayal of the dreaded Feyd Rautha as a sinewy male model in a winged codpiece in David Lynch’s 1984 version. The performance can be summed up in this single image, which was great for kickstarting the puberty of Reagan-era tweens but not so hot when it came to suggesting an unhinged killer. It’s safe to say that Austin Butler‘s take on the terror of Giedi Prime is anything but camp. Hairless, bulky and blessed with a world-class maniacal grin, this Rautha is 100-percent psychotic. The fact that Villenueve films him like a marble statue come to life, courtesy of a monochromatic gladitorial fight scene, only makes him that much more sinister. No supporting player is safe from his blade. No scenery is safe from his blackened jaws. It’s enough to make you forget he once played a 20th century icon.  
	By the time these two adversaries finally meet in front of all the main characters still left standing, hoping their knives chip and shatter, we’ve seen a lot: Léa Seydoux shows up as a seductive priestess, Anya Taylor-Joy drops by for a blink-and-miss cameo, the return of Josh Brolin as a cantankerous mentor, a sun that looks like a bat-signal, troops attacked by not one but three Freudian-as-fuck sandworms with armies astride their backs. And still, you feel as if the storytelling wave is just beginning to crest. We leave as we came in, knowing more is one the way, yet punch-drunk from the love triangles and the battles that will lead to even bigger fracas among fractured, warring houses. It’s not a spoiler to say that the stage is set for a third movie. Until then, however, Villeneuve and his cast leave you high on the spice of a science fiction sequel that seems bigger, bolder and somehow better than what came before it. "
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE," The best bit of dialogue from any iteration of Dune was not written by Frank Herbert, but it so perfectly distilled the absurd wonder of his magnum opus that you’d be forgiven for assuming otherwise. “The sleeper has awakened” is less a single moment of David Lynch’s Dune than an entire entry into the thinking-man’s space opera––preposterous and magnetic, as ready for scorn as it is appreciation. To hate it, though, is outing oneself as too serious-minded and too demanding of naturalism, which is to say: not quite in the headspace for Dune. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune (now known as Part One) was a perfect distillation of its own: titanic in both size and detail, of scale and floridity so impressive there was suspicion he’d set a benchmark for conjuring other worlds onscreen, while often narratively interminable. It’s difficult reconciling one (“that looks so cool”) with the other (“how are there 42 minutes left”) except to say this material has never––in neither Frank Herbert’s hands nor David Lynch’s, probably not (I’m just going to guess) a 2000 Syfy Channel original––functioned sans turbulence. Long, lumbering, lugubrious––accept these terms and you may learn to love Dune. Little surprise that Dune: Part Two, reuniting much of the core team, arrives as an astonishment of design, a film essentially applying Truffaut’s for-every-scene-a-new-idea philosophy to spaceships, imperial costumes, grand halls, weird walking sticks, or sound effects going thwoop-thwoop-thwoop. And again such breadth of aesthetic betrays much depth of imagination. Why does this feel so rote for actual fascination or curiosity, a faraway world of first impressions? Posed another way: did Denis Villeneuve ever crack Dune? It’s a troubling question north of five hours into a project he already intends to complete (speaking operatively) with a third entry. On paper there’s always plenty to admire; his and company’s efforts have been largely valiant, sometimes stirring, notwithstanding Hans Zimmer’s reliance on a wailing woman being the worst leitmotif I’ve ever heard. It takes a good stretch of precious screentime for Part Two to play as its own entity and not the serial continuation of a two-year-old film based on a 60-year-old property; it takes a good stretch of precious screentime for Part Two to play as anything other than a thoroughgoing, checklist-meeting obligation bolstered by obvious craft. Adapting a big novel’s hard business, surely. Don’t even start with matching Frank Herbert’s sui generis saga of interplanetary jihadism to any single person’s specifications—just ask Lynch, whose often-brilliant interpretation earned such scorn he’s spent forty years resistant to talking about it. And though it’s unfair comparing anybody’s stylistic approach to material with, well, David Lynch, it’s hard rewatching the second half of his 1984 film without admiring its skill for brevity and conflation. Where that filmmaker solved problems of condensation by galvanizing imagination with his own designs––something gross, something ungainly, something the author himself found suitable––this heir apparent’s now spent more than twice that time sanding down a good portion of what made Dune so strange and transfixing; what splinters Herbert left in the mind’s eye are now Villeneuve’s smoothed-out, worked-over tools. There isn’t room for “the sleeper has awakened,” and repeating the novel’s “long live the fighters” invocation rings falser than Lynch’s fabrication––it sounds like a tagline, perhaps because it literally is.  Manoel de Oliveira once expressed a wise maxim of film form: “If you don’t have a car, film the wheel, but film it well.” Villeneuve has the wheel, the car, every fathomable element––the worm, the shimmering shields––at his disposal, and by filming each and every one struggles for lasting images, for deeper texture. Early on is a battle sequence involving hand-to-hand combat, RPGs, and POVs oscillating between ground-level soldiers and aerial vehicles that plays somewhat spectacularly, and spectacularly to his strengths: this is a director who likes moving parts. More 1:1 segments betray his mistrust of an audience’s attention. In the iconic sandworm-riding scene (I understand how absurd that exact order of words sounds) it first seems he and cinematographer Greig Fraser devised a genius long-lens, long-take method of capturing Paul Atreides’ big hero moment: Timothée Chalamet stands rigid in the foreground as a massive force cascades towards us and him, deep in the background and then in the middleground and then… close-up of someone thus far offscreen before cutting to another close-up of someone thus far off that plane of action. Underline awe and wonder, I suppose. But we’ve been led into feeling this; it’s not necessary to punch in, tip the scales, beg for sensation. This alone is not a massive black mark, and really you must be made of stone not to feel something stir when, only a minute later, the abstract swirl of sand begins breaking apart as sunlight reshapes the frame. Yet it’s a mistrust of iconography, a witnessing of something brilliant until it’s suddenly not, so part and parcel of a film unsure how to situate itself. Villeneuve and Fraser shoot better the climactic fight between Paul and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler suggesting a buff Denis Lavant and sounding strangely like Cheech Marin)––mediums to emphasize combat, close-ups on striking faces, wides that make these figures into silhouettes or frame them like cave paintings––and somewhere along the line there emerged this very wise decision to play only immediate sounds of combat. (Or I really just can’t stand Zimmer’s imposition.) It’s also one of many sequences that end at about the same speed it began. Whether it’s Paul Atreides’ three-week novelistic slumber collapsed into three minutes of screentime or lacking gravitas when one of the world’s most bankable young actors slays another of the world’s more bankable young actors while a coterie of A-listers look on––Zendaya, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling, and Christopher Walken under one roof is the greater testament to this material’s interest––Part Two operates with forceful brevity, the desire to fit everything in a compact-enough package that can’t (on the part of its narrative, on behalf of its performers) generate natural frisson. Notwithstanding the commendable choice to let Walken sound like Walken––it’s appreciably guffaw-inducing when the fate of the known universe is pondered with that cadence––or boldness in hiding Rampling behind a dark veil (much credit to one scene that renders her entire figure pitch-black like that stark presence in Meshes of the Afternoon) this ensemble’s oddly wasted, somehow underserved. Léa Seydoux’s not been mentioned because I continue forgetting she’s appeared. Her assigned character, Margot Fenring, isn’t one nearly anybody comes away from Herbert’s novel with a grand impression of, but her three-or-so scenes (only one of which gives room to play) register too accordingly. This is less a movie that feels incomplete than one that has achieved its questionable goals––a diligent follow to a diligent adaptation, a brilliant build upon a brilliant physical manifestation. By my count, though, that makes two projects––maybe, possibly a bit hack to lean on this point, but just for the sake of context: about $300 million––spent in debt to another’s work or promise of some other film. A strange instinct for notoriously burdensome material. Myriad allusions to Dune Messiah, Villeneuve’s promised adaptation of Herbert’s far smaller follow-up, yield promise: flashforward images are stark, and Part Two’s climax finds its actors already selling the pieces set in motion. I can’t pretend I don’t want to see it, that it won’t look and sound great. But enthusiasm’s turning a tad dry."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling sci-fi classic is true to its source material in terms of scope (it’s huge!) and complexity (its plotting is very dense).  It hits all the book’s high points, and many of its many speeches are direct lifts from Herbert’s text. A more faithful adaptation could not be imagined. And there have been several previously, both on film (in 1984) and in a 2000 TV miniseries. But it’s a picture that’s more to be admired than embraced. For one thing, Villeneuve has chosen to have many of the speeches delivered in an invented alien language, complete with subtitles. The shift back and forth between spoken English and the subtitled dialogue is jarring.  Also, there’s a chill here in the performances, particularly, and crucially, in the portrayal of the relationship between its two main characters, Timothée Chalamet as the hero Paul Atreides and his lover Chani played by Zendaya. A detectable deficit of chemistry exists between them.  Villeneuve’s great strength is his mastery of sweeping visuals that bring to vivid life the worlds imagined by Herbert. The vast desert planet of Arrakis, home to the fierce Fremen, is a place of endless corrugated sandscapes (filmed in Jordan and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates) infested with the monstrous sandworms that oblige humans to tread very carefully with a special cautious gait lest they be devoured. The special effects of worm attacks are very impressive. And the costuming of the characters is grand. Flowing robes, hoods and cowls adorn the players, providing a rich visual tapestry.  Herbert, born in Tacoma and a one-time student at the University of Washington, incorporated environmentalism, religion, power politics and analytical ruminations on human nature into on “Dune.” He made it a multilayered work that took science fiction to previously unimagined levels when it was published in 1965. Villeneuve had his work cut out for him trying to do justice to all that.  He succeeded remarkably well in the making of “Dune,” released in 2021. And that picture is pretty much essential viewing for anyone hoping to fully grasp what’s going on in “Part Two,” which picks up directly where the previous movie left off. No backstory information is provided. We’re off and running from the get-go.  A knowledge of the novel is helpful as well. Villeneuve’s screenplay (Jon Spaihts returns as credited co-writer) hits most of the narrative high points, but skimps somewhat on the philosophical underpinnings. Even though this picture is close to three hours long and its predecessor is 2½ hours, it would have been unwieldy to try to truly plumb the depths even at that combined length.  Paul, pursued by the evil Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his legions of followers, makes common cause with the Fremen of Arrakis under the leadership of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) to seek the overthrow of the empire. Paul is reluctant to accept leadership of the Fremen, a reluctance felt even more strongly by his mother, the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), a member of the Bene Gesserit school that is a behind-the-scenes manipulator of human destinies. Closely aligned in the previous movie, mother and son diverge in “Part Two” as Paul grasps for power in a manner not preordained by the Bene Gesserit.  His drive for power brings him into conflict with the baron’s psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) whose shaven head and malignant stare make him look like an alien creature of pure malevolence. Their savage fight at the end is the picture’s climax. But it’s not the end. With Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, Christopher Walken, Stellan Skarsgård, Florence Pugh. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, from a screenplay by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, based on a novel by Frank Herbert. 166 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some suggestive material and brief strong language. Opens Feb. 29 at multiple theaters."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Things get spicier in Dune&#58; Part Two with a messier entry&#46; Embracing the weirdness of the source material has done wonders for the tone&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The number of people who were crushed at the end of DUNE: Part One is astronomical. If you’ve never read the books, you had no idea that Denis Villeneuve couldn’t possibly complete more than a third of the first Dune saga in one movie. There were lamentations about storytelling, and arguments about whether the words “Part One” showed up on screen at all (they did). I giggled a lot because I am one of those perverse science fiction readers who enjoys watching moviegoers get hit in the head by the mercurial and magnificent madness that comes out of classic sci-fi novels. Now, we are on the precipice of DUNE: Part Two and you’re wondering if you’ll get more than an introduction to the planet Arrakis and the life and times of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet). Take a deep breath—you won’t get hit in the head this time—the second movie kicks you in the face. Director Villeneuve and his team of creatives give new life to a sumptuous world of political machinations, messianic legend, and the nefarious grit of war-making. DUNE: Part Two is not only gorgeous filmmaking and storycraft, but its boots are on the necks of who humanity is now. I imagine that is what the original author, Frank Herbert, intended and Villeneuve gets it—he understands just how genius and twisted the chronicles of Arrakis are. At the start, we return to the desert sands and the Fremen. Paul is there, in the midst of a vision, and so is Chani (Zendaya). Immediately we see what good fighters they are and what a good pair they make. This pairing is vital to what is to come. Denis Villeneuve told Vanity Fair the same, “I wanted to make a very human movie, very close to the characters, despite the scope of the film,” he says. “I kept saying to my crew, ‘The most important thing is that spark, that relationship between both of these characters.’ If we don’t capture that, if we don’t have that onscreen, there’s no movie. The epicenter of the story is this relationship.” With the help of Zendaya and Chalamet, the director pierces straight through the heart of the tale—Paul and Chani’s love is an oasis and pyre all at once. All around them war is brewing as the Harkonnens work to wipe out all remaining signs of House Atreides. During this time the Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), are successfully sniping at the heels of Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista). Thus slowing down the production of spice. This is a problem as intergalactic travel requires “the spice must flow.” Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) is having fits because he knows what the emperor gives, the emperor can take away. So he devises a plan to protect the House of Harkonnen. That plan involves his nephew Feyd (Austin Butler). However, the players that both the baron and the emperor underestimate are the ever present sorcerer-nuns of the Bene Gesserit order, but even they have their problems. Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) and Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have very different visions for the future. Back on his home world, Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) is dealing with his own repercussions from the fall of House Atreides. That allows his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) to show off her diplomatic prowess—and Bene Gesserit training. Oh, and then there’s Alia. Daughter of the House of Atreides and one of the greatest ‘enfant terribles’ of all time. Y’all, the plot is thick and this entire cast and creative team devoured this. Everyone is top-tier, no exceptions. When it comes to production design, costuming, sound, and cinematography, there is no need to wait for March 2025, back the Oscar truck up to their offices and let the gold flow like the spice. No hyperbole, the visuals and sound are that good. Villeneuve and Chalamet will be on the shortlists too. Of course Zendaya fully embodies every character she plays to the degree that we sometimes miss what a good actress she is, but if you don’t already know, check her range of microexpressions and you’ll get educated. Applause for the writing by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts too. The dialogue is delicious, truly decadent on the tongue; at times it makes you sigh, at others giggle, and sometimes roar. The writing takes the intricacies of the plot and makes them relatable. Especially in underlining the tactics of colonialists and the use of enforced religion to rule indigenous populations—providing a clear throughline for all of us to connect. One drawback is the portrayal of the Harkonnens. They are now a homogeneous group with bald heads, pronounced brow ridges, and bleached skin. I miss the red hair, marking them in the books, and their more sinister nature. Here they are mostly animalistic and outright cowardly. This flattens them out as one of the villainous factions, especially Feyd who is meant to be an early foil for Paul. Austin Butler doesn’t let that stop him, his Feyd is a poisonous snake who hisses loud enough to let you know he’s coming. There are other wobbles, but that’s to be expected from a property this old (pre-Star Wars) and from one that hides its true themes until they converge at the end. When the first movie dropped I mentioned the following, “Second and more problematic are the dual poisoned swords of colonization (that bastard) and white saviorism (that bastard’s fictional twin). Dune has had these problems from its inception but when the Fremen are depicted closer to who they were meant to be, those issues come more sharply into focus. Villeneuve might’ve made choices to lessen or even fix these problems, he might still do it in the films to come, but he hasn’t yet.” What I couldn’t say then, but you will see foreshadowing of now, is it was done with intention. Dune is, after all, not a story about a chosen one but about the dangers of colonially instituted religion, megalomania, and the corruptive nature of power."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," You sense that Denis Villeneuve has been having Spice-fuelled visions his entire life. The filmmaker has spoken much of how reading Frank Herbert’s Dune at an early age cracked his mind wide open. Bringing the sci-fi tome’s heady mix of warring houses, psychedelic reveries, anti-colonialist themes and intergalactic action to the screen is, in a very real way, his life’s work. And once again, in Dune: Part Two, it seems the images Herbert conjured in Villeneuve’s head all those years ago are being ripped straight from synapse to screen. That Part Two arrives at all is something of a miracle. The filmmaker gambled on a two-part adaptation of the book, despite a sequel not being guaranteed — and the astonishing first part (by Villeneuve’s own admission, a place-setter to be paid off in later instalments) arrived in the midst of Covid. Part Two, as promised, is the war epic: a weightier, more muscular chapter with less world-building to do, but knottier narrative beats to untangle. It picks up shortly after Part One’s end (a rewatch is advised, though Florence Pugh’s incoming Princess Irulan functions largely as a recap-voiceover), with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his pregnant mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) being accepted into the Fremen, the native people of bone-dry Arrakis. Paul, having escaped the massacre of House Atreides by the brutal Harkonnens — as machinated by Emperor Shaddam IV, a disappointingly well-behaved Christopher Walken — desires revenge on all who wronged him. Many Fremen — including leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) — think Paul could be the ‘Lisan al-Gaib’, a prophet in their religion; except, those prophecies were intentionally laid down by space-witch meddlers the Bene Gesserit (of which Paul’s mother Jessica is one), and Paul’s Spice-visions show him possible futures where leaning into his engineered messianic ‘destiny’ results in endless bloodshed. Meanwhile, Paul falls for Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya, here given real screentime after her fleeting turn in Part One), their budding romance complicated by… well, all the above factors. In short, there are plenty of plates spinning — and for the most part, Villeneuve displays remarkable control over them all. Beyond that, he marshals staggering sequences to blow you to the back of your seat: an opening attack from gravity-defying Harkonnen warriors is hair-raising stuff; a ragtag rocket-launch mission with Paul and Chani taking down enemy ornithopters is breathlessly exciting; Paul’s long-awaited first sandworm ride is an overwhelming feat of sound and vision, with thunderous bass that’ll turn any regular cinema into a seat-shaking 4DX experience. And Austin Butler is the MVP of the newbies, his Harkonnen warrior-boy Feyd-Rautha (in every sense the Anti-Paul) a hairless embodiment of utter inhumanity. His stark arena battle on a distant planet — rendered entirely monochrome under a black sun that leeches all colour, the sky exploding in Rorschach blotches — is a welcome reprieve from the largely Arrakis-set action. In case Part One didn’t make it clear enough, this is Middle-earthian in ambition, Nolan-esque in the dramatic intensity of its execution. If anything, Part Two is almost epic to a fault. It is a gigantic film, and for all the character work Villeneuve beds in (Paul’s naming ceremony; the most sand-based flirting in a space opera since, well, another famous Episode II), there’s a point where non-stop immensity takes over. It reaches a terminal velocity of grandiosity, a critical massiveness — and just keeps going. Despite the two-film split, there’s considerable ground to cover, with mystical plot-points that even Villeneuve struggles to wrangle. The character throughlines are forced to reckon with central figures who — through narrative necessity — become less human as the film progresses. Those who haven’t fully imbibed the Water Of Life might feel overcome by ‘epic fatigue’ come the credits. Even then, the story isn’t over. While Part Two reaches the conclusion of Herbert’s first book, this is decidedly not the end of Villeneuve’s adaptation. Should the mooted Part Three — covering sequel novel Dune Messiah — be greenlit, it won’t be an optional coda, but a proper trilogy-closer. As such, this is firmly a middle chapter, with major threads yet to resolve. It feels churlish to complain, given the incredible achievements on display here — uninhibited ambition from Villeneuve, more eye-melting cinematography from Greig Fraser, fresh Hans Zimmer jams (a dark inversion of Paul’s theme; a booming anthem for Feyd-Rautha), and a plot thread involving a psychic foetus. Oh, and yes, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) gets a brief Baliset banger (sample lyric: “His stillsuit is full of piss…”). You might feel somewhat sandblasted by the end — but overall, it remains a remarkable display of desert power."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The whole point of adapting the novel Dune with two films was, we thought, so that even if the first one ends on a cliffhanger, the second will provide proper closure, right? Right? Insert the Anakin-Padme meme here. Not to spoil anything specific that you couldn’t already learn from a Frank Herbert novel published in 1965, but the moment director Denis Villeneuve started thinking out loud about making Dune a trilogy was likely the moment he decided on yet another stopping point rather than a conclusion. So brace yourself for that. Like the first, Dune: Part Two feels like part of a movie rather than a movie in itself. And that part sure as hell isn’t the climax. If you want character development or explanations of why certain things in the plot are the way they are, go back and watch the first. There’s very little recap here, and the only characters who feel like they develop are all varying degrees of new. Zendaya’s Chani, briefly in the first, stands in as the voice of audience skepticism. This was not her role in the book, but perhaps for a movie version aimed at the masses and not just sci-fi readers, one of the characters has to call the space religions on their BS, and she hits the lottery. Austin Butler steps into the role, if not the metal jockstrap, of villain Feyd-Rautha, formerly and memorably portrayed by Sting in the 1984 film. Though the actor who once embodied Elvis possibly could have out-cooled the Police frontman, he goes a different and hilarious direction. Being the nephew of Stellan Skarsgard’s Baron Harkonnen, Butler essentially does a Skarsgard impersonation the entire movie. It’s up there with Andrew Bryniarski’s Christopher Walken voice in Batman Returns as an all-timer, to-their-face star impersonation. Dune: Part Two picks up where the last one left off, with exiled royalty Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) captured by the desert nomad tribe called the Fremen, led by religious zealot Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Jessica’s intergalactic religious order, the Bene Gesserit, has spent generations seeding cultures with Messianic prophecies so that one day, via their own eugenics, they could create a Messiah who would match the scriptures and take on the role on their behalf. Paul wasn’t meant to be that Messiah — he came a generation too early — but Stilgar, who believes the prophecies are authentic, thinks he is. And if he is, he gets to stay with them, and his mother can be their Reverend Mother. But if he’s not, the Fremen have no use for them, and they’ll both be left for dead. A better player of the game of space thrones than her son, Jessica instantly sees the value of presenting themselves as prophecy fulfilled and uses her spiritual and physical training to enhance that impression. Paul doesn’t want to take on the role but has no choice in the immediate moment; later, of course, he realizes that if he can mobilize all the Fremen with religion, he can avenge his father and easily conquer the Harkonnen family, who took control of planet Arrakis from him. Like John Carter of Mars, or Jake Sulley of Avatar, Paul’s initial strength comes not from being inherently extra-special — though he does develop some psychic powers — but that he’s well trained in a completely different fighting style from the locals, and when he can learn theirs too, and teach it back, everyone benefits. If it feels less like a white savior trope than usual it may also be because it’s not clear the path they’re on saves anyone from anything. The best thing about Dune: Part Two is just how cynical it is about religion and politics, though it doesn’t offer any great alternatives. Letting the Harkonnens keep running the place as greedy bastards doesn’t seem especially sustainable, yet overthrowing them risks interplanetary holy war. In the midst of such major lose-lose decisions, Paul finds moments of peace and love with Chani, though it’s a much shorter timeframe than in the book, where two years pass and they have a child. The events of the movie take place over less than nine months, as evidenced by the fact that Paul’s unborn sister Alia remains a psychic fetus in the womb the entire time (just to be clear, we literally see her as such a few times). Thus, despite its general lack of respect for organized religion, Dune: Part Two should strongly find favor with pro-lifers. Is this more or less creepy than Lynch’s depiction of her as a prematurely born genius toddler? You decide. There’s no shortage of beautiful images in the second Dune, from an early scene of Harkonnen warriors slowly floating up to higher ground to the various dreams and snippets Paul sees in his mind. Yet so determined is director Denis Villeneuve to satisfy fans of both epic action and the intrigue of power struggles that he ultimately hampers both at the expense of one another. The action, when it comes, is often chaotic and brutal, and sometimes confusing — did they really just use a nuclear weapon and come out of it mostly unharmed and cancer-free? And despite an over-two-and-a-half-hour runtime that feels every minute of it, the palace intrigue could have used more time to play out, like on a premium cable miniseries. As a result, it often feels like Paul does things more because the novel dictates that he should rather than any reason that’s fully justified by the onscreen narrative. His journey from romantic to brutal pragmatist seems to play out only in Chalamet’s head rather than in Villeneuve and Greig Fraser’s camera shots. Fans of the book will have an advantage; hell, even reading the Wikipedia synopsis makes things much clearer than the film does. If you like the aesthetic of Dune so far, and you like cinematic spectacle, the movie should scratch that itch on a basic level. But when it comes to fully delivering on the promise of the first, well, once again we are left hanging. Like the Zack Snyder-verse, we may continue to wonder if the Villeneuve-verse would rather deliver a true finale or get years of free press from its director discussing what might have been. Luke Y. Thompson has been a professional film critic since 1999, and part of the toy blogging community since the aughts. He was the first blogger to cover Comic-Con panel by panel for a major trade publication, and has several LA Press Club awards and honorable mentions, including one for reviewing fast food."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Here is a story of psychedelic space drugs, gargantuan sandworms, and women who can control others with just their voice. Here is a lore-dense sci-fi masterwork, a cautionary tale about messianic figures, and an ecological treatise all rolled into one. It's deeply weird and wonderful, and somehow it's spawned film premieres crowded with screaming fans, crashed ticket sites, and gifted us one very strange tie-in popcorn bucket. Yes, Frank Herbert's work has always had its obsessives. But with the release of Denis Villeneuve's 2021 film adaptation — featuring buzz-worthy stars like Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya — Dune's desert power grew stronger than ever. Now, all eyes turn to Dune: Part Two to see if the director can recreate the Academy Award-winning magic trick of his first outing on Arrakis. For the most part, Dune: Part Two succeeds on the highest of levels. Villeneuve uses Dune's more contemplative set-up as a springboard, launching into explosive bouts of action, galactic intrigue, and tragedy. As a result, the film swings bigger and often hits harder, soaring beyond even the epic highs of its predecessor. Yet these highs make the few moments when Dune: Part Two pulls its punches —including an unfortunately abrupt ending — stick out like a clueless offworlder stranded in the Arrakeen desert. Dune: Part Two returns us to said Arrakeen desert directly in the wake of Dune. Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have just joined up with Arrakis' indigenous Fremen people. They hope to gain their trust and allegiance in the fight against the vicious Harkonnen family, who now hold power over the entire planet. Meanwhile, the Emperor Shaddam Corrino (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) assess the situation on Arrakis from afar. Making matters more complicated for Paul is the prophecy among the Fremen people that a messiah — the Lisan al-Gaib, or ""Voice From the Outer World"" — will lead them to freedom. Paul's arrival, as well as his budding prescient power and understanding of Fremen culture, are among the signs of the prophecy. But how much of this is fate, and how much of it is centuries-old Bene Gesserit propaganda at work? If the Fremen follow Paul, will they truly find the paradise they seek? Or will they instead find themselves enslaved, caught up in the holy war that haunts Paul's visions? This tension between faith and exploitation makes for compelling friction within the Fremen ranks. Leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) firmly believes Paul is the Lisan al-Gaib, while warrior Chani (Zendaya) asserts that the prophecy is a sham, and that only the Fremen can free themselves. Caught between the two camps, and with his mother leaning more into religious manipulation, Paul attempts not to lead but to fight alongside the Fremen. His journey will take him many unexpected places: a romance with Chani, a ride on the back of a sandworm, and perhaps down a road towards a bloody, inevitable destiny. Dune may have underutilized Zendaya, relegating her to Paul's visions, but Dune: Part Two gives her space to flex her impressive talents. It is as much Chani's story as it is Paul's. From their first flirtatious sandwalk to their first joint attack on a Harkonnen spice harvester, Villeneuve makes sure to chart their relationship as one of equals. Paul even tells Chani outright he'd like to be considered as such — a statement that leads to their first kiss, a sweeping moment of sweetness shared among the vast dunes. However, that equality invariably shifts as Paul's influence grows, and Chani must reckon with the fact that the man she loves is gaining control over her people. While Chalamet dips deeper into Paul's darker side, Zendaya layers Chani's stoic warrior countenance with wounded betrayal. If there was ever any doubt that Paul is not a hero, all it takes is one look at Zendaya's troubled face during the film's climax to realize we're witnessing tragedy in motion.  As Dune: Part Two makes very clear, this is not a story that glorifies a white savior, nor is it a joyful epic of good triumphing over evil. It's a portrait of the insidious ways in which faith can be manipulated. Chani, with all her loyalty to the Fremen and desire to see them prosper independently, is our gateway into understanding that horror from a Fremen perspective. Without that focus on Chani, and without Zendaya's effective surfacing of her growing mistrust, Dune: Part Two would crumble. As somber as Dune: Part Two can get, Villeneuve never loses sight of its potential for blockbuster action. He and cinematographer Greig Fraser create arresting tableaus as the battle for Arrakis rages on. An eclipse turns the sky and sands a dark orange. Fremen warriors burst like ghosts from beneath the sand. A figure in a billowing cloak strides across the desert, their sandworm mount breaching the sand behind them. Dune: Part Two's most rousing action sequences are those that understand Dune is at its most exciting when it embraces the epic as well as the weird. Here, that takes the shape of an extended stay on the Harkonnens' home planet of Giedi Prime, where a dark sun renders everything in stark black and white, and where architecture bulges and bends in ways that recall insects and bodily organs alike. We're already familiar with the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista): two totally bald, pale baddies with a propensity for brutality, hoarse whispers, and floating menacingly above others with the help of biomechanical implants. Yet their glorious strangeness is just an appetizer for the bizarro lightning in a bottle that is Austin Butler as the Baron's younger nephew, Feyd Rautha. Feyd bursts onto the scene like an angular, greased-up stick of dynamite. He's part supermodel of the future, part sadist, and all killing machine. Marvel at Butler's pitch-perfect Skarsgård voice (no trace of Elvis here, folks!), the gusto with which he attacks his gladiatorial combat scenes, and the sheer fun he seems to be having. This is why we come to the movies: to see actors letting their freak flags fly against a backdrop of strange new worlds. For all its thematic resonance and unforgettable set pieces, there are times when it feels as if Dune: Part Two is holding itself back. Take its treatment of Paul's visions of the future or Jessica's ritual to become the Fremen's new Reverend Mother. These should be overwhelming sensory experiences, ones that tear at a character's very understanding of space and time. Instead, Dune: Part Two falls back on the first Dune's tried-and-true tactic of flashes of repeated imagery and distorted voices. These can only do so much. Elsewhere, Pugh and Walken are mostly shoved to the sidelines for expository purposes, a choice fairly in keeping with Herbert's work that unfortunately squanders the star power at Dune: Part Two's disposal. (Like with Zendaya in Dune, though, there are teases that both the Emperor and Irulan may have greater roles to play in a potential future installment.) Jessica's pregnancy, revealed in Dune, presents another missed opportunity. We get glimpses of her growing child throughout the film thanks to some close-ups of a growing fetus. It's a bold move from Villeneuve that recalls Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, another sci-fi great. Yet those same close-ups, which initially promise something new and strange (and very exciting for fans of Herbert's novel), slowly plateau into stagnation, with the promise of true boldness pushed down the line.  Speaking of pushing things down the line, it's hard to discuss Dune: Part Two without bringing up its ending (which we can without spoilers). On one hand, the film's final moments left me in a state of shock and awe, buzzing to see more. On the other, Dune: Part Two lacks a sense of closure — the same problem as its predecessor. If the first Dune plays like one half of a whole movie, Dune: Part Two plays like the second act of a whole movie, instead of its conclusion. And I say this as someone who desperately wants Villeneuve to make Dune Messiah, the next book in Herbert's series of six Dune novels. Dune: Part Two isn't the only major blockbuster to unceremoniously cut itself off to tease a sequel. In 2023 alone, we saw this trend pop up to varying degrees with the likes of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Fast X, and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One. No matter how great those movies are, their cliffhanger endings feel like a glass of cold water to the face — and a reminder that you'll need to come back in order to get the full story. In the case of Dune, I'm certainly excited to be getting more. But man, am I frustrated that the movie industry seems to think that this is how we have to end films in order to keep people interested. Neither the abrupt ending of Dune: Part Two nor its moments of holding back keep it from reaching greatness. The film's renewed focus on Chani cuts straight to the core of Herbert's work, while its vast scope and intricate worldbuilding make for an immersive, otherworldly experience. Because of this, I still firmly believe Dune: Part Two belongs in the ranks of film's best sequels and sci-fi offerings. Still, like Paul and his myriad versions of an uncertain future, you can't help but wonder what might have been had the film taken a slightly different, maybe even riskier, path.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," If audiences were surprised and impressed by the first installment of director Denis Villeneuve’s awe-inducing adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel, DUNE, they will be absolutely floored by his follow-up, DUNE: PART TWO. The visionary Quebecois auteur continues to see his imaginative iteration through, having laid the substantial building blocks on which this second part rests comfortably, conjuring plenty of cleverly conceived thrills and gripping, jaw-dropping spectacle. It redefines the sci-fi genre. Immersive, impressive, and wildly exhilarating, it’s an adrenaline rush to the head and heart, soaring in its breathtaking action sequences as much as it sings in its refined, evocative stillness. We pick up with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) directly after the events of the first film, having escaped the Harkonnens’ genocidal, hostile takeover of Arrakis – at the chubby hands of Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård, who’s as fat and sassy as ever) and commander Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) – and proven themselves worthy to the Fremen – specifically leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem). This has also led Paul to the woman of his literal dreams, fighter Chani (Zendaya). After being temporarily waylaid by Harkonnen soldiers, the group is returning to their home to give Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) a proper burial. There’s a prophecy that a great leader – Lisan al Gaib – is due to appear, and the signs pointing to his imminent arrival have made clear to believers that it’s Paul. However, not everyone is eager to accept this outsider as their messiah. Half of the Fremen don’t – and neither does Paul, who continues to struggle with his destiny and the disturbing visions plaguing him. He’s worried he’ll start a holy war. As the Baron greedily ups his demands for spice, Paul learns to fight alongside the Fremen, putting his patented Atreides military strategy to the test, disrupting production in hopes of restoring the planet to his newfound family. Yet there are unseen forces conspiring to make Paul’s rise to glory a treacherous one – and there are lots of twists and turns in his journey towards being hailed as the Kwisatz Haderach, a man of immense power and precognition. Ascension is a key concept in this second chapter, both in the thematic and narrative sense. It’s akin to THE GODFATHER 2’s character evolution. Characters ascend into their power. Some are hoisted by their own petard through careless, calculated grabs for eternal supremacy. We even spot some common connections between the tribulations and triumphs. With Paul, we feel the entrancing push-pull of his continually unfolding arc. It’s electrifying – as is Chalamet’s captivating performance, depicted in sequences where Paul commands attention as the charismatic leader everyone has told him he could be, and in other scenes where he honors his father’s legacy, once a burden but now a blessing. Lady Jessica’s transformation into the Fremen’s Reverend Mother is also rather entrancing, given her shady machinations guiding her son to his future. Ferguson eats up every morsel of her rejuvenated, meaty role. Hans Zimmer’s compositions, tapping into a foreboding, unsettling undercurrent that ties mother and son together, are pure genius. While Chani was a more ethereal presence for much the first film, earning her eventual introduction, she factors in so much more here, gifting the film with its beating heart and soul. Zendaya turns in singular work, nimbly combining strength and vulnerability. Her expressive, nuanced reactions are amongst the picture’s most indelible images. Zimmer’s tender love themes for the couple are sonically beguiling, pulling at the heartstrings. Bautista, with all Rabban’s bluster and intimidating physicality, gives another ferocious performance, bringing out multiple facets of the character whose rage percolates on the surface. Plus, Brolin’s Gurney returns and brings a hot dose of revenge with him. As for the new cast, Austin Butler is seductively unhinged, playing the Baron’s nephew Feyd-Rautha, who’s brought from Giedi Prime’s black and white world to unleash his brutality on Arrakis. His scenes with Léa Seydoux, who plays the Bene Gesserit’s Lady Margot Fenring, are deviously sexy. They ignite the screen, making us wish those sequences were longer. Though used sparingly, Florence Pugh, who plays Reverend Mother Mohiam’s (Charlotte Rampling) student Princess Irulan, turns in career best work. Costume designer Jacqueline West cloaks her in regal creams and metallic silvers to emphasize the gray area she and her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken), find themselves in. Villeneuve keeps the action scenes lean, clean and mean. From the stellar photography of the fight choreography either in the dry desert daylight or murky orange fog of war, to the Fedaykin’s ambush of the Harkonnen harvester, where Paul helps Chani and her people obliterate the first of many mechanical monsters, these sequences deliver a visceral sensation where we can’t help but get a contact high. Villeneuve masterfully builds tension and thrills within the construction of Paul’s sandworm riding test. The 360-degree sound design bores into our chests. This is why we go to the movies. Later, Paul and Feyd’s face-off at sunset showcases beauty and brutality in equal measure, as aided by cinematographer Greig Fraser’s ace skills, illuminating character and movement. With shocking reveals, wily betrayals and political scheming, DUNE: PART 2 is certainly the juicier of the two chapters. While it ends in a similar manner to the first, hanging on a slight edge of a new adventure for these characters, it leaves the door open for a necessary third feature (to complete a prospective trilogy that’s bound to be announced once big box office receipts return). Made for repeat viewings, its bold, daring, and epic scale must be experienced on the largest screen possible."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," For the billions of science fiction freaks across planet Earth; the Timothée Chalamet fanatics; the Zendaya zealots – the tantalising wait is over. The second instalment of the Dune trilogy is probably 2024’s most anticipated film, but these are the only three words you need to hear: IT’S! EVEN! BETTER! Yes, it deserves all those !!!s. While we’re at it, here’s another three: HARDER! FASTER! LOUDER! But not by throwing any old noise and shitty CGI at a blockbuster to make it more shouty, because Denis Villeneuve is a director who knows how to please a crowd while also satisfying the cleverati. From the initial brutal skirmish, when attacking soldiers glide majestically through the air before their annihilated bodies smash to the ground with ear-splitting thuds, it’s clear Villeneuve has learnt how to out-Dune Dune. This is sharper, slicker, more resonant than the first installment. The first film ended with nearly the entire House Atreides massacred by House Harkonnen and the Emperor of the Imperium’s forces on Arrakis, the desert planet rich in spice (the mineral key to mastering the universe). Paul (Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are the sole surviving family members, and in Part Two they seek out Arrakis’s indigenous Fremen people (fierce warriors of whom Zendaya’s Chani is one) to form a revenge pact. The ongoing plot is fiendishly complex, but the evil Harkonnen (led by a deliriously hideous Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron) are hellbent on exterminating the Fremen; the Emperor (hello Christopher Walken) has his own agenda; the shadowy women of the Bene Gesserit (Charlotte Rampling, Léa Seydoux and Florence Pugh, who’s also the Emperor’s daughter) are meddling with bloodlines. And then there’s the whole mystical mumbo jumbo about whether Chalamet is “The One”, a messiah come to save the Fremen. New faces Pugh, Seydoux and Walken don’t make much of a mark. However, the introduction of Austin Butler as Skarsgård’s son is when your tongue will dangle to the floor in gob-gibbering awe. This is truly next level über-cinema. The camera flips to silvery black and white as Butler’s monstrous sociopath enters a monolithic gladiatorial stadium (reminiscent of Hitler’s Berlin Olympics, but designed by a unimaginably talented team of fascist architects) for a touch of ritual slaughter. Utterly hairless and fabulously repellent, Butler will set back the cause of bald men by 100 years. There’s more brilliance, way more (Hans Zimmer’s seat-rattling score, those sandworms!), and you don’t need to know the end because there isn’t one; Part Three is still to come – Zendaya’s eventual moment in the desert sun?"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21 (UPI) -- Dune: Part Two, in theaters March 1, drops viewers right back into the world of Dune. It is a seamless follow-up to 2021's first part, with some new additions to the tale. Action ensues quickly as the Fremen attack Harkkonen harvesting equipment in epic desert battles. Dune: Part Two doesn't spend any time catching up new viewers, as it clearly is intended for people who are following the story from Part One. Science-fiction that looks real has become less of a novelty since 2001 and Star Wars. What sets director Denis Villeneuve's rendition of Dune apart from the usual special effects fantasy is that it is designed more for function than appearance. Villeneuve uses the technology not to create an animated fantasy, but to render what Dune could look like if armies and industries were operating what author Frank Herbert described. To traverse or mine vast deserts requires heavy machinery, and the film conveys the weight of those lumbering machines. Arrakis is inhabited by sand worms, and those giant creatures, too, are lumbering beasts. In Part One, Paul dreamed of a Fremen girl, Chani (Zendaya) and only met her at the end of the film. When Part Two picks up, they are not yet in love. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes Paul can fulfill a prophecy that will free the Fremen. Paul and Chani oppose using mythology to manipulate people, to which Stilgar essentially counters that if Paul plays his role, the prophecy will be true. Though Herbert may have intended Paul to prove himself to be the messiah, the film leaves the accuracy of the prophecy ambiguous enough to interpret either way. Stilgar could be right or Paul just could be using the prophecy to achieve his ends. This is still a world in which some characters employ psychic powers, so who's to say what is religion and what is physics in science-fiction? New characters join the story, like the Emperor (Christopher Walken) above Baron Harkonen (Stellan Skarsgard). The Emperor's daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) gets involved, employing psychics like Lady Margot (Léa Seydoux) to inform the empire. Dune: Part Two is the continuation of the story promised by Part One. It still tees up more story from future Herbert books, and if the quality of presentation remains this high, further adventures of Dune will be welcome.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," There are moments in Dune: Part Two that feel so audacious, they play out as if they were already etched onto the cinematic canon. A lone figure stands astride a mountainous worm as it pummels through the sand like Moses parting the Red Sea. A man is trapped by a psychic seduction, its effects splintering across the screen in what could only be described as an indoor thunderstorm. Gladiatorial combat takes place on a planet with an environment so inhospitable, its colours so drained, that it looks almost like a photographic negative.  Dune: Part Two, like its predecessor, is a work of total sensory and imaginative immersion. As precious as the spice of Arrakis itself, it’s the ultimate payoff to 2021’s great gamble, when filmmaker Denis Villeneuve chose to adapt half of Frank Herbert’s foundational sci-fi novel, with no guarantee a sequel would ever be made. Despite its release at the height of the pandemic, with a same-day launch on streaming services, Part One earned a hefty $400m (£317m) at the box office and 10 Oscar nominations. If that film seeded foreboding into each frame, then Part Two is entirely consumed by it. Herbert’s work eviscerates the idea of heroic destiny by exposing it as a lie built by others for the purposes of colonisation and control. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) arrives on the desert planet of Arrakis on his father’s orders – only to discover that he’s the product of generations of genetic manipulation by his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and her Bene Gesserit clan of space-witches. Their work has spread whispers of a prophet, the Lisan al-Gaib, who will lead the indigenous Fremen people towards freedom from their oppressors. By Part Two, the House of Atreides has fallen, as Paul and Lady Jessica seek sanctuary and, eventually, acceptance with a Fremen tribe and their leader, Stilgar (Javier Bardem). Paul yearns for Chani (Zendaya), the Fremen warrior who’s walked right out of his dreams but has grown suspicious of claims that he is the tribe’s long-awaited saviour. Elsewhere, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), daughter of the Padishah Emperor (Christopher Walken), worries about her father’s inaction. Herbert wrote the sequel, Dune Messiah, partly in response to those he believed had failed to grasp the complicated, sinister implications of Paul’s ascendancy. Villeneuve, in interviews, has already expressed his ambition to turn Messiah into a third film. But it, too, is no guarantee – and so he and co-writer Jon Spaihts have altered Herbert’s text in key places to make the second book’s thematic points here. And, my God, does the final third of Part Two emanate pure menace. It’s unlike any other blockbuster in existence.  Chalamet and Ferguson take all that was regal and dignified about their performances, and apply to them a poisoned tip. Chani is critical here, too, with a significantly expanded role as the film’s moral centre – Zendaya holds the film in her palm, with resolution and clarity. Granted, the traditional baddies are still here: Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron Harkonnen returns, still floating around in his evil little nightgown, and we’re finally introduced to his nephew and heir, Feyd-Rautha. He’s played by Austin Butler without a trace of the Elvis drawl, but with such an uncanny Skarsgård impersonation that sons Alexander, Gustaf, Bill and Valter should be concerned they’re about to be replaced. Butler not only cleanses the mind of any memory of Sting in metal underpants (from David Lynch’s notorious 1984 take) but commits every cell of his body, from his bald head to ink-stained teeth, to snarling and slaying his way across the universe. Anyone turned off by Dune: Part One’s portentousness won’t be converted here. But unlike, say, The Lord of the Rings, Herbert’s vision was always a funny, slightly disorienting clash of impenetrable lore and informal language (he named one of his characters “Duncan Idaho”, after all).  Villeneuve has honoured that tone, in his own way. Josh Brolin, as Paul’s mentor Gurney Halleck, performs a brief ditty about how his “stillsuit is full of piss”. And the film’s stacked with fiddly, HR Giger-inspired machines, like the desiccation pump that sucks vital water out of the Fremen dead. Part Two is as grand as it is intimate, and while Hans Zimmer’s score once again blasts your eardrums into submission, and the theatre seats rumble with every cresting sand worm, it’s the choice moments of silence that really leave their mark.  But, just as Herbert warned of hero worship, it’s critical not to treat Dune’s creative triumphs as a kind of blanket absolution. Part One was rightly criticised for its erasure of the book’s Middle Eastern and north African influences. Here, it appears someone may have listened. The Fremen’s Arabic-inspired language is now foregrounded, and onscreen representation is mildly improved – Souheila Yacoub, for example, an actor of Tunisian descent, plays Shishakli, Chani’s closest ally. On the other hand, it’s even harder now to watch Bardem pronounce Paul the prophesied Lisan al-Gaib, or use something not entirely unlike a prayer mat, and not interpret it as a form of whitewashing. Yet, as Part Two makes clear, Villeneuve isn’t done with Dune, even if he’s already made his mark on sci-fi history. Now, the most compelling question is – what comes next?"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," ""Dune: Part Two"" is a rare big, expensive blockbuster with a lot on its mind. Not content with just spectacle (and boy, there is a lot of that), Denis Villeneuve's sequel packs in heavy thoughts on religion, war, revenge, romance, and yes, really big worms. It's not entirely successful, but gosh, you gotta appreciate the attempt. I thought Villeneuve's first ""Dune,"" adapted from the tome by Frank Herbert, was pretty good, but it also felt like standard sci-fi stuff. Not so with the sequel, which is one of the bleakest blockbusters ever made. This is not the whiz-bang entertainment of ""Star Wars,"" it's something far more serious. Perhaps too serious — don't be surprised if you come out of this movie feeling rather morose.  At the center of ""Dune: Part Two"" is a story of faith — faith both pure and manipulated. This is a saga of a messiah in the making; a very human man thrust into the role of the divine. And what would happen if that newfound savior used his recently bestowed holy gifts to launch a plot for revenge? Would the faithful see through the plan, or would they fall in line and follow their new prophet into oblivion? Not an easy question to ask, and yet ""Dune: Part Two"" wants to ask it — in between scenes of brain-rattling explosions and giant sandworms wrecking stuff, that is.  When we last saw Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), his entire life as he knew it had been obliterated. His father, a Duke assigned to oversee the spice mines on the desert planet Arrakis, was betrayed and killed by the evil Harkonnen family. Almost all of the Atreides' soldiers and subjects were slaughtered while Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) escaped into the desert. Paul and Jessica were eventually taken in by the Fremen, the native people of Arrakis. And then the movie ended! It was a lot of setup with no real payoff.  ""Dune: Part Two"" picks up almost immediately where the first film concluded. Paul, who understandably wants revenge, and Jessica have gone deeper into the Fremen territory, while the Harkonnen, lead by the massive, frequently floating Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), try to take over Arrakis. Lurking in the background is the treacherous Emperor of the Universe, played by Christopher Walken, and his distraught daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). Neither Walken nor Pugh has a whole lot to do here, but it's a treat to watch Walken work — he shows up, delivers his ominous lines with a whisper, and wipes the floor with anyone he's acting against. Show 'em how it's done, Christopher Walken. There's also a new villain on the scene: the psychotic Feyd-Rautha, nephew of the Baron. Played by Austin Butler, who has dropped his Elvis voice to do a pretty good impersonation of Stellan Skarsgård, Feyd-Rautha is a violence-loving creep with dreams of power. Meanwhile, out in the desert, Paul is becoming something else. Taking on the Fremen name Muad'Dib, Paul leads bands of Fremen fighters against the Harkonnens. Why do the Fremen follow this outsider? Because they think he's the messiah.  This is loaded material. The Fremen are portrayed almost entirely by people of color, and the story has them bowing down to Timothée Chalamet, who is quite white. Villeneuve doesn't shy away from this element, and the film has several characters point out that the real Fremen messiah should be an actual Fremen, not some outsider. Ferguson's Jessica, meanwhile, recognizes these doubts and decides to exploit and manipulate things behind the scenes to get what she wants. But what of Paul? For most of the runtime, Paul is a rather passive character; a reluctant savior going about his business. He's happy to become one of the Fremen, but he's shy about the whole ""messiah"" thing. His paramore Chani (Zendaya, who has a lot more screen time here than she did in the first film), loves Paul, but she also doesn't believe in the prophecies. This clashes with the Fremen Stilgar (Javier Bardem), who is all-in on Paul being divine.  Again: this is deep stuff, but ""Dune: Part Two"" only flirts with it for most of its length. As a result, the film begins to grow repetitive. It's never boring, and its hefty runtime moves at a brisk pace, but Paul's indecision and reluctance make the narrative stagnant. Eventually, Villeneuve rectifies this with a stunner of a third act; a big, loud, terrifying finale that caught me by surprise. I just wish the rest of the movie was as effective.  That's not to say ""Dune: Part Two"" is a disappointment. It's a grand, overwhelming sensory experience. Villeneuve has a great grasp on scale, and everything here feels appropriately huge. A shot of those giant sandworms bursting forth through a sandstorm is genuinely frightening because we can sense how massive these things are. The costumes pop, the scenery stuns, and Hans Zimmer's score booms and drones until you can feel it rattling your ribcage. If nothing else, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a triumph of production design.  But the script, by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, is too aimless for a large chunk of time. It wanders around the desert, occasionally picking up signs of life here and there. This is a frequently awe-inspiring movie that also can't quite tell a compelling narrative. Part of the problem, I suspect, lies in the fact that like the first film, this isn't a complete story — it's only part of one.  Perhaps viewing the first ""Dune"" and ""Dune: Part Two"" back-to-back is the best solution, but I suspect most people aren't going to do that — they're going to see a new movie. And what they'll get is half of one. Maybe that won't matter, though. Perhaps audiences will be so wowed by that final act that they'll come away from ""Dune: Part Two"" appropriately stunned. And maybe whenever Villeneuve returns to this world — and it sure seems like he wants to — he can finally find a way to tell a complete story. "

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part One was, in many ways, the antiblockbuster. It’s a movie that began at the end — at the end of a centurieslong secret battle between noble houses we only see glimpses of and amid a sea of change that we can’t even begin to understand. There was no emotional anchor because most of the characters were doomed from the moment we met them and no catharsis because the story wasn’t really over. It’s an incredibly ballsy way to start a sci-fi franchise, and Dune: Part Two, Denis Villeneuve’s electrifying, stupendously action-packed sequel, is no less bold. But while it would be easy (and cliche) to say that Dune: Part Two delivers on everything the first film built up — and more! — the film is more than the sum of its jaw-dropping spectacle and rousing battle scenes. Dune: Part Two is a sci-fi epic for the ages: a sweeping tragedy of mythic proportions, a cautionary tale of the perils of zealotry, and maybe most importantly of all, a love story. It’s a towering feat of sci-fi cinema that will put Dune: Part Two in contention for the pantheon of greatest sequels ever. Dune: Part Two picks up immediately after the events of Part One, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the Fremen in their long fight against the Harkonnens. While the zealous Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and his followers believe Paul is the fabled Mahdi, a messiah prophesied to “lead us to paradise,” the younger Fremen, including outspoken guerilla fighter Chani (Zendaya), are more skeptical. As Paul slowly wins over the Fremen by proving his dedication to their cause and leading a renewed campaign against the Harkonnen armies, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) calls in his savage nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to bring Arrakis back under their control. Little do they know the “Fremen demon” Muad’Dib, whose troops terrorize their warriors and dismantle their spice production, is actually the last surviving member of their House Atreides massacre — a secret that threatens the Baron’s ambitions for the throne and could topple the reign of the figurehead Padishah Emperor (Christopher Walken) altogether. The second half of Frank Herbert’s Dune is where things start to get weird. The political intrigue and subterfuge of the first half give way to a messianic Lawrence of Arabia-style epic punctuated by strange rabbit holes into the surreal — when Lady Jessica imbibes the poisonous Water of Life to become the Fremen’s new Reverend Mother, her story could, in any other filmmaker’s hands, threaten to overwhelm an audience with startling visions and phantasmagoria (and, as many nerds will love to tell you, talking omniscient babies). And at times, Villeneuve’s Part Two does overwhelm, with its sheer, seismic scope; its new achievements in immersive, tactile cinema; and its frequent dips into the surreal. Every other scene is a headrush of awe-inspiring images, and every other image is a picture of jaw-dropping sci-fi splendor lovingly crafted by cinematographer Greig Fraser. But Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts manage to deftly weave the intricate stories and intersecting ambitions of Dune: Part Two by couching it in something universally recognizable: a love story. The budding romance between Paul and Chani is the emotional anchor of the movie. Chalamet has always been an expert yearner (see: Call Me by Your Name and Little Women), but his chemistry with Zendaya manages to immediately sell a romance that is essentially on fast-forward. There’s a tenderness and sincerity to their scenes together — whether Chani is teaching him to sandwalk or Paul is saving her from an oncoming missile — which provides a warm and welcoming contrast to the brutalism that pervades the rest of the film. If Dune left audiences cold for its alleged lack of an emotional core, Part Two satisfies that lack on all accounts. Despite its stacked and exceptionally talented ensemble (all of whom vie for scene-stealer at some point), Dune: Part Two is very much a two-hander between Chalamet and Zendaya. With Part Two, Villeneuve gets to take Paul’s hero’s journey to new subversive extremes. Herbert always intended Dune to be a takedown of the charismatic Chosen One leader, but Villeneuve dials up the criticism of the story’s inherent white savior tropes by layering in a sense of foreboding doom, allowing Chalamet’s Paul to truly grapple with consolidating his need for revenge and his fear of his devastating destiny. Chalamet gives a truly inspired turn while playing up Paul’s all-consuming dilemma. He’s angry, despairing, impassioned, and even at times sinister. (Part Two makes a good case for Chalamet to play a villain in the future.) When destiny is manufactured and belief is only a thing to be weaponized, what does heroism even look like? The answer is Zendaya’s Chani, who provides the movie’s beating heart and lone moral compass. Her arc is dramatically expanded from Herbert’s book, with Chani becoming the de facto hero as Paul gets further lost to the fanaticism surrounding him. Zendaya lends a tough weariness and resigned sadness to Chani, as she realizes the inevitable end of their cause. The rest of the cast is just as magnetic, even those with the shortest screen time. Bardem provides a comforting foundation amid the Fremen community, even as his Stilgar becomes fervid zealot. Ferguson is impeccably freakish, especially once Lady Jessica is imbued with the genetic memory of the Fremen. Making up for the loss of her political maneuverings in the first film, Villeneuve lets Ferguson run wild with her schemes to build Paul up to be the Fremen’s prophesied messiah in Part Two, becoming Paul’s best ally and most unlikely antagonist. While Part One’s main antagonists — Skarsgard’s Baron Harkonnen and Dave Bautista’s Rabban — are sidelined in Part Two, Butler’s unhinged Feyd-Rautha takes on the mantle of chief villain with a psychotic glee. Sporting a bald head and a growly, accented voice that can only be described as “Stellan Skarsgard impression,” Butler’s Feyd-Rautha is barely human. Rather, he’s like raw, untempered violence made flesh. Elsewhere, Léa Seydoux transfixes as the unreadable Bene Gesserit agent Lady Margot Fenrir, while Florence Pugh’s Princess Irulan (basically stuck in the minimal Zendaya role of Part One) is mostly tasked with delivering narration that contextualizes the broad beats of the story while teasing the hidden machinations of the Bene Gesserit. It’s an impressive amount of storylines for Villeneuve to juggle, even within the film’s mammoth 165-minute runtime. But despite the sheer volume of plot, not once does Part Two buckle under the weight, moving at a brisk pace that rivals the most audacious action flicks. By virtue of its foundational nature in sci-fi, there’s a sheen of familiarity to Dune (it’s space Lawrence of Arabia, on drugs!), but Villeneuve manages to streamline its more esoteric elements into a saga that’s part Hamlet, part Greek tragedy, and part Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. That’s because in between all its moving parts and apocalyptic visions, Villeneuve stages some of the most impressive battle sequences since Peter Jackson’s fantasy epic — bloody battles through which you can chart every character arc and subplot, and white-knuckle fight scenes that knock the wind out of you. Part Two is a new achievement in tactile action cinema, from its vision of brutalist, inky planets and Metropolis-meets-Atlantis ancient civilizations to its breathtaking sound design and production. On a technical level, it’s the kind of total escapism few films achieve. “In so many futures, our enemies prevail. But I do see a way. There is a narrow way through,” Paul tells his mother at one point in the film. Like Paul’s vision of the future, there were many ways for Dune: Part Two to fail. But not only does it succeed, it surpasses the mythic tragedy of the first film and turns a complicated, strange sci-fi story into a rousing blockbuster adventure. Dune: Part Two isn’t a miracle, per se. But it’s nothing short of miraculous."

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Has Denis Villeneuve’s road always been leading into Frank Herbert’s desert? In 1998, his debut August 32nd on Earth showed a poetic feel for character and sandy landscapes; fish-eyed follow-up Maelström, meanwhile, revealed a surreal flair. His clout as an action director emerged later, but be assured: with outsized pomp, punch and weirding business, Part Two positions his Dune duology as one of the great mind-melds of director to material in modern fantasy filmmaking. Blockbuster as grand tragedy? War movie as political, psychological and romantic fable? Sci-fi spectacle as colonial, conspiratorial allegory? However you cut it, Villeneuve wrangles coherence from Herbert’s unruly elements to deliver a sequel that ranks alongside The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back – and Blade Runner 2049. No mere expansion pack for the dreamier Part One, it’s a completion (maybe…) of a story that might have appeared misleading, certainly incomplete, without it. The action picks up shortly after Part One’s finale. Their people massacred by House Harkonnen, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) join the Fremen, who live as one with the sandy, spicy planet Arrakis. As Paul mourns his father and bonds with Fremen scrapper Chani (Zendaya), he has nightmares of grim destiny and a blood-soaked holy war. Will he convert his Fremen doubters and become the messianic Muad’Dib, as prophesied? Following the Harkonnens’ deadly coup, the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) hears of a new leader rallying the Fremen to disrupt production of spice, the mystical unobtanium of Arrakis. Oozing cruelty, the Baron channels his grump into indiscriminate strikes against these rebels. Meanwhile, his psychotic nephew and heir Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) skulks and schemes on the sidelines, beady-eyed and murderous with anyone who, you know, looks at him a bit funny. With the stage set for multi-tiered conflict, Villeneuve delivers with forceful style. Part Two is an inarguable marvel technically, almost leaving its Oscar-grade predecessor for dust. Hypnotic and horrifying images mount, from the graceful spectacle of soldiers floating above the sand for safety to their slamming thud as they fall, dead. A raid on a spice depot offers a startling show of visceral conflict made tangible and clear; ornithopters swarm like insects in an airborne stand-off; and Paul’s worm-surfing ride of passage roars with heart-in-mouth, sand-in-everything dread and awe. The sound mix is a character in itself too, thumping your torso while Hans Zimmer’s ecstatic score matches sand, architecture and machinery for wonder, scale and impact. This is maximalist filmmaking made artful and immersive, wild and weighted, trippy and textured. And again, DoP Greig Fraser rules the desert, honoring legendary cinematographer Freddie Young’s (Lawrence of Arabia) spirit majestically. Equally, Dune 2 honors Herbert in terms of ideas. Themes of fundamentalist zealotry and blind fealty to leaders with awesome hair are less subtexts than surface texts, twisting ‘chosen one’ conventions into intriguing shapes. Hints of satire show, such that you half expect someone to say, ""He’s not the messiah, he’s a very…"". Smartly, Part Two recognizes the leavening worth of humor in the abyss, thanks notably to Javier Bardem’s impish turn as Fremen leader Stilgar – mind those ‘little’ desert centipedes, indeed. Among an outrageously well-appointed cast, Ferguson remains a potent presence as Jessica’s mystique grows. Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh suggest complex histories despite limited screen time as, respectively, the Padishah Emperor and his daughter Princess Irulan. Should all that sound too subtle, Dave Bautista is a brusque riot as the Harkonnen Beast, smashing lackeys’ skulls in like Drax with a cob on. But the lead trio shine brightest. Zendaya invests feeling in a character smartly built up from Herbert’s vision. Exchanging hoverchocs for hallucinogenic worm bile, Chalamet blossoms in tandem with Paul, showing previously untapped reserves of command. And post-Presley, Butler oozes toxic trouble as the smirking Feyd-Rautha, a soul-blackened villain for the ages who enjoys killing on his birthday like most people enjoy cake. Even if his voice sounds a bit like Kevin from The (US) Office. Smartly, Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts punch up Feyd-Rautha’s fights from the book, notably in a bleached-out gladiatorial throwdown on Giedi Prime. Elsewhere, some of Herbert’s ideas are judiciously teased out and others dampened without diluting the novel’s fever pitch. The Bene Gesserit’s movements are developed, aided by Léa Seydoux’s stealthy manifestations. A starry dream cameo and the most strategic fetus since Prevenge also offer bold, skewed reinventions of a character who seemed a bit daft in Lynch’s Dune. The climax here is sharply judged, sustaining what worked on page while making the outcome more discomforting. It’s a finale that might throw off anyone unfamiliar with Herbert, or anyone expecting conventional pay-offs. But it does answer the story’s themes and, tantalizingly, leave room for more. Could Herbert’s trippy Dune Messiah be adapted next, as teased? Tall order, that. But on the strength of this extravagantly, rigorously realized vision, make no mistake: Villeneuve is the man to see a way through that delirious desert storm.

"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE," 
	In one of the most arresting sequences in Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two, the Fremen fighter Chani (Zendaya) teaches the Atreides Duke Paul (Timothée Chalamet) the correct way to sandwalk.  
	The film, written with Jon Spaihts, picks up hours after the destructive events of the first film. Paul and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined Chani’s Fremen group, their integration met with equal parts curiosity and suspicion. Some members easily embrace the Atreides nobles, while others wonder if they are spies. Meanwhile, the Harkonnen, led by the bloodthirsty Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgard), have regained control of spice production on Arrakis and launched a genocidal war on the Fremen.  
	Running close to three hours, Dune: Part Two moves with a similar nimbleness to Paul and Chani’s sandwalk through the open desert. The narrative is propulsive and relatively easy to follow, Hans Zimmer’s score is enveloping, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography offers breathtaking perspectives that deepen our understanding of the fervently sought-after planet. All these elements make the sequel as much of a cinematic event as the first movie.  
	It’s not that Villeneuve is uninterested in the Fremen. Paul’s integration with the Arrakis natives makes up most of Part Two; the director does explore how their society works. After killing Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) in Dune, Paul earns the respect of Stilgar (a sharp Javier Bardem), a religious Fremen army leader waiting for the Messiah, and the tentative approval of Chani. The pair help the eager royal acclimate to life in the desert by teaching him how to have a relationship with the land. Through their lessons, Paul sees the planet as more than a place from which to extract the psychotropic melange known as Spice. He learns to work with the parched terrain instead of trying to dominate it, an approach that improves his combat skills.  
	Villeneuve stages impressive fight sequences, which show how the Fremen’s small army consistently outwits the technological muscle of the Harkonnens. From riding extraterrestrial worms to using the sandstorms as cover, they draw upon their natural world to maintain an upper hand. In some scenes, the bright, bleached sand surroundings become engulfed in deep, almost blood-like terra-cotta clouds of dust that disorient Fremen enemies. As the opposing soldiers try to find themselves, the Fremen move swiftly to disarm and dismember them.  
	Instead, Dune: Part Two undercuts attempts to complicate this more textured understanding of imperialism by repeatedly and subtly playing the Fremen’s religiosity for laughs. It would have been far more interesting to parse, even briefly, why there are intra-Fremen divisions about the existence of a Messiah in the first place. Why does Chani (a compelling Zendaya) vehemently fight Paul’s increasing popularity, whereas Stilgar falls over himself to embrace it? Can these factions be attributed to more than Bene Gesserit machinations?  
	Even as the Duke learns from the Fremen, wrestles with the existential crisis of submitting to the Bene Gesserit prophecy, and falls in love with Chani, he keeps his father (played by Oscar Isaac in Dune) close to his heart. Much of Paul’s personal journey and character development are tied to a desire to avenge his father and the people. It’s within the spirit of the young fighter that the stakes of Part Two’s most interesting questions about destiny and loyalty, individual grievances and the greater good, and the future of Arrakis in general, are truly felt."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," 
	A massive gamble at a time of diminished moviegoing, Warner Bros. and Legendary's multipart adaptation of the Frank Herbert novel graduates from the world-building thrills of the 2021 original to a meaty, all-encompassing narrative. 
	On Earth, human beings have evolved to enjoy a fairly comfortable place in the food chain. You have to venture far from other people to risk being eaten by an apex predator — by straying from the path on safari, say, or swimming in dark, shark-infested waters. By contrast, no one takes his safety for granted on Dune, the spice-rich desert outpost of Frank Herbert’s early-’60s pulp serial, where surface-dwellers live in fear of giant sandworms that slither at great speed to gobble anything remotely edible up above. 
	To skip “Dune” and start here means depriving yourself of essential context. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts pick up in the wake of a brutal genocide — as ruthless an extermination as America’s PG-13 rating permits — in which the corpses of countless good men lie stacked in piles, fodder for Harkonnen flamethrowers. The film’s opening words belong to Princess Irulan (a new character, played by Florence Pugh), daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken), who conspired with a sect of psychic witches called the Bene Gesserit to purge Paul’s clan, the House of Atreides, and hand control over to the Harkonnens, the pale, baldheaded villains of the first movie, led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgård). 
	The antagonists are easy to identify; less so the heroes in Herbert’s book series, which tracks the rise of Chalamet’s character — the apocryphal savior, or Kwisatz Haderach — with great skepticism. The movie asks: Is Paul the messiah or merely a self-fulfilling prophecy? Could centuries-old religious beliefs have been implanted with the express purpose of manipulating the masses? While it’s satisfying to see Paul get his revenge in “Part Two,” he’s tormented by visions of the holy war to come and right to question his own destiny. 
	Like both Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke in the “Star Wars” series (which Herbert’s “Dune” obviously inspired, even though George Lucas beat it to the big screen), this powerful leader is drawn to the dark side. The morality of “Dune” isn’t nearly so binary, and many will miss — or else misinterpret — the deeply ambivalent tone of the movie’s final minutes. What looks like triumph could well be a turn for the worse. 
	No one would fault you for struggling to keep things straight on Arrakis, the remote, water-starved planet otherwise known as “Dune.” Practically everything here has two names, for this is a world of diametrically opposed peoples with competing languages, some guttural (like the deep, unsettling blast that barks “Power over spice … is power over all” before the shield-like Warner Bros. logo even appears), others silent, communicated via hand signs. 
	Herbert’s dense novel can be a daunting slog for the average reader, who can’t tell a Sandworm from a Sardaukar — which is one of the reasons Villeneuve’s approach felt like such a breakthrough: It pared the mythology down to something manageable, serving up visceral action set-pieces at regular intervals. The movie air-dropped audiences in a world where foreign customs, politics and technology had long been established, never letting the complexity of those elements slow down the storytelling. 
	Paul may be some kind of messiah, but the movie puts Chani on equal footing, siding with the Fremen rebels as the Harkonnens launch wave after wave of soldiers to extinguish these “rats.” Considering where the story leads, however, Villeneuve clearly intends to suggest — and subvert — some of the racial dynamics of the real world, casting darker-skinned characters in Fremen roles (the group is led by Javier Bardem, who leans into Stilgar’s thick accent), while questioning Paul’s white savior arc. Stilgar himself is Paul’s most enthusiastic follower, putting him through several exciting tests, which include riding a sandworm and drinking the toxic blue Water of Life. 
	Those trials engage, largely because Villeneuve invests equal time in Paul’s emotional evolution, reflected in the night-and-day transformation between the callow young man seen at the beginning of “Dune” and the assertive, even domineering persona Chalamet puts forth in this film. Villeneuve works closely with DP Greig Fraser to orchestrate striking contrasts, cutting between light and dark, wide macro views of sun-scorched Arrakis and more intimate close-ups, even going so far as to check in on the fetus Jessica is carrying. In one prophetic flash-forward, Paul stands face-to-face with his sister (played by an uncredited Anya Taylor-Joy), though the events of the film take place entirely before her birth. 
	The more significant new character here is the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha (a hairless Austin Butler, assuming the role made iconic by Sting, his teeth blackened behind a diabolical smile). Unlike his uncle, who’s constantly soaking his bloated body in oily spa treatments, the ferocious na-Baron appears to have been chiseled out of marble, gleaming white during the gladiator match that marks one of the film’s high points. Given Feyd-Rautha’s own proximity to power, it’s no wonder the Bene Gesserit (especially Charlotte Rampling’s Reverend Mother) position him as a rival prospect in their own shadow games.  
	Audiences spoiled by TV series such as “The Sopranos,” “Succession” and “Game of Thrones,” which juggled intricate strategizing with explosive confrontations over runs of many years, will find in Villeneuve’s multipart saga a satisfaction few films can offer. It’s an enormous gamble, given the expense of creating at this scale, and a vote of confidence in cinema, which still hasn’t recovered to the pre-pandemic level at play when the franchise was conceived. The fate of far more than Arrakis is riding on “Dune.”"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," It’s really a miracle that the first of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune films penetrated the public consciousness as well as it did. It was released amid a worldwide pandemic; it was an IMAX-ready blockbuster that was simultaneously dropped onto people’s streaming subscriptions same-day; it’s based on a dense, impenetrable sci-fi novel Villeneuve patiently chose not to wholly adapt in one film. The results, blessedly, were commercial and critical success and a host of technical Oscars the following year.  That success was enough to secure Dune: Part Two, a chance for Villeneuve to complete his vision of Frank Herbert’s seminal work of political science fiction. Where Part One worldbuilds, Part Two barrels down the road of its inevitable conclusion in satisfying style, even as it makes some noted changes from the novel or any previous adaptations — some for the better, some for the worse.  Picking up not long after the events of the first film, Part Two follows the recently-outcast heir to the throne of House Atreides, Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), as they attempt to ingratiate themselves to the native Fremen of Arrakis who’ve taken them in after the brutal destruction of their house by the rival Harkonnens. Luckily for them, the ground has been laid for their integration by thousands of years of religious indoctrination by the Bene Gesserit, who’ve spun wild tales of a Messiah, a Voice from the Outer World, who will lead the marginalized people of Dune to freedom. Paul sees a path to getting his revenge, and usurping the Emperor (Christopher Walken, compelling in his frailty), through the Fremen’s “desert power” and positioning himself as said savior. But such a path may lead him down choices that would spell doom for the universe. It’s this dilemma that offers the emotional and thematic core to Dune: Part Two, a more character-driven piece than the plot- and atmosphere-heavy setup of the first. Villeneuve is, to some people’s delight and other’s consternation, a remarkably literal director: He tends to show us what’s on the page, albeit in staggering visual style. Greig Frasier’s cinematography is still stunning, capturing Patrice Vermette’s production design and Jacqueline West’s angular, imaginative costumes with remarkable sweep — not to mention the stunning, sandy vistas of Jordan standing in for Arrakis. Hans Zimmer’s score, appropriative as it can feel at times, is still suitably booming and bass-heavy; no one’s working harder than him to sell the capital-I Importance of what you’re seeing.  But amid all the visual and aural mastery on display (adding my voice to the chorus that predictably shouts, “see this in the largest theater you can”), Dune: Part Two uses all this spectacle to tell a jagged spin on the old hero’s journey. Its first hour commits itself to settling Paul and Jessica into the ecosystem of the Fremen — one heavily informed by the language, garb, and customs of Arabic peoples, though the film still frustratingly leaves MENA actors out of the main cast. (A few show up as minor Fremen council members, and make an immediate impression.) Still, these early scenes work well to show Paul’s growing mastery of the Fremen ways, as well as his budding relationship with Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya). The supporting cast is just as expansive as the first, even as half of that film’s cast was slaughtered in the previous film. But everyone gets their moments to peek out of the shadow of Paul’s growing cult of personality, and their most interesting angles come from the ways they play their part in his ascension. Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) quickly grows to believe his part in the prophecy, and his belief in Paul complicates their relationship in fascinating ways. Jessica is admittedly quickly sidelined as she becomes the tribe’s Reverend Mother, but remains in the shadows, plotting and paving the way for her son’s rise.  Meanwhile, new characters like the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Lady Margot Fenring (Léa Seydoux) investigate the goings-on of Arrakis from the other side of the fence. Frustratingly, the Harkonnens themselves get little to do besides play grimy villains: apart from Dave Bautista’s terrifying impotence as the Beast Rabban, the focus turns to Austin Butler’s bald, sneering Feyd-Rautha, who pairs an imposing physicality with a Scandinavian growl reminiscent of Stellan Skarsgård’s slovenly Baron. (He’s a great addition, even as, just in the book, he kind of exists just to give someone for Paul to definitively punch at the end.) But the most interesting angle, amid all the well-staged action and compelling gadgets and creatures, is Chani’s, which takes engrossing deviations from previous takes on the material. In the book, and all previous adaptations, Chani is an uncomplicated love interest to Paul, one committed to the Fremen cause and the soon-to-be father of her children. Here, the twists and turns of prophecy take their toll on Chani; she sees the pull Paul has on her people, and the dangerous path he must go down. Where Part One was Paul’s story, the back half of Part Two very much zeroes in on Chani as the emotional center of the piece — looking with clear-blue eyes at the person Paul must become to accomplish his goal, and the deep, painful cost of victory.  Amid these heady ideas linking religious fanaticism and geopolitics are some of the most dazzling action sequences we’ve seen in science fiction in decades: Harkonnen troopers floating up and down mountains at sunrise with gravity boosters, giant sandworms snaking through the desert towards unsuspecting prey, gladiatorial fights cloaked entirely in black and white with ink-blot fireworks bursting overhead. The world of Dune as presented here is beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, a universe in desperate need of an enema. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts, to their credit, take Herbert’s more cerebral ideas seriously, sneaking them into something akin to a four-quadrant blockbuster — teasing a universe where the hero’s victory might just make the universe even uglier. For all of its mastery, there’s a fair bit that still doesn’t work — some changes from the book detract rather than embellish (characters are excised, or their births are delayed, for the hopefully inevitable conclusion to Paul’s story in a future movie), and there’s a chugging sense of inevitability that robs a sense of stakes from the proceedings. But that also feels like the point; like Paul, we all know where this story will end up, and the tension comes from the faint hope that somehow, somewhere, he can turn the tide of holy war while still earning justice for his family.  The difficulty in adapting Dune is that it’s a story about the inevitability of empire — Part One points out the short span of time even ostensibly virtuous kingdoms have before they’re usurped, and Part Two demonstrates the other end of that cycle: revenge, mercilessness, and fanaticism. Villeneuve’s bold, brash presentation can sometimes feel bereft of personality, but it’s not short on vision, which it has in spades. I was cautious about overpraising the first Dune on release, recognizing that it felt like half a movie. With Part Two, that story feels, in a sense, complete, and it’s now possible to bask in its horrifying wonder.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The long awaited follow-up to Denis Villeneuve’s awe-inspiring adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, Dune is finally upon us and it is every bit as impressive as expected. Often dubbed as unfilmable – David Lynch’s ill-fated adaptation of the novel in 1984 being a prime example – Herbert’s tome has clearly benefited from Villeneuve’s decision to break the story into several parts – Part 3 is undoubtedly in the works. The forthcoming sequel reunites audiences with Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides and his Fremen allies in a gripping battle to reclaim their homeland against the encroaching threat. Meanwhile, Zendaya, whom we briefly saw in the first film, reprises her part as young Fremen warrior Shani, who also happens to be Paul’s love interest. Chalamet and Zendaya are this time around also joined by a veritable “who’s who” of young Hollywood powerhouses, with Elvis star Austin Butler, British acting sensation Florence Pugh (Midsommar, Oppenheimer) and the always brilliant Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen’s Gambit, Last Night In Soho) all making their debut in this second instalment.  Dune: Part Two emerges as a monumental triumph, surpassing even the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. From the moment the opening credits roll, director Villeneuve’s visionary storytelling takes hold, immersing audiences in a world of unparalleled scope and grandeur. The film dives deeper into the intricate politics, rich mythology and compelling characters of Herbert’s story. Seeing Herbert’s vision of Abrahamic mythology and Arabian inspired aesthetics come to life as it was always intended, is simply awe-inspiring. Villeneuve’s usual aversion to spoon-feeding his audience with unnecessary exposition, is perhaps what makes this into both his most complex film and most rewarding narrative.  With breath-taking landscapes, incredible special effects and awe-inspiring action – a black and white German expressionism-inspired sequence featuring a beautifully devised gladiatorial battle is simply jaw-dropping in its perfection – Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser deliver a masterclass in seamless, powerful filmmaking. Chalamet’s portrayal of Paul Atreides is nothing short of mesmerising, showcasing a depth of emotion and complexity that firmly establishes him as one of the most compelling protagonists in recent memory. Those among us who have remained immune to the young actor’s charms hitherto, might have to finally admit defeat."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," 
	As we know, however, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalomet) is still on the loose, with his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). As per the end of Part One (Part Two follows directly on from the deadly duel with Jamis, whose body is still lying there, neatly wrapped), Paul is now embedded with the sand-dwelling Fremen tribe, led by Javier Bardem’s Stilgar, although it will be a full 45 minutes before Paul gets intimate with Chani (Zendaya), the warrior girl he has been dreaming about from the get-go. 
	This conflict is the dramatic motor of Part Two, as Lady Jessica manipulates the prophecy of the lisan al gaib (“The Voice from the Outer World”), planting the seed that Paul is the chosen one. Some swallow it, like the wide-eyed Stilgar, who has an almost Python-esque obsession with the coming messiah and marvels, “As written!” every time Paul’s actions check some mysterious messianic box. Others, like the increasingly grumpy Chani, see through this mumbo-jumbo. “You want to control people?” she says. “Tell them a messiah is coming, and they’ll wait for centuries.” 
	Meanwhile, the Emperor has shifted his attentions to the Harkonnens, who, under the rule of Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista), nephew of the increasingly fat and repulsive Baron Valdimir (Stellan Skarsgård), are being run ragged by the Fremen. In conjunction with Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling), newcomer Lady Margot (Léa Seydoux) suggests that a better option is the Baron’s other nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), a cold-blooded psychopath they believe to be “sexually vulnerable” and thus has the potential to be manageable (“Desire and humiliation — those are his levers”). 
	Intrigue is the key word in Part Two, as some old faces reappear and new ones are teased. But whenever we’re away from Paul, the story starts to drift, and the plotting — so seamless in Part One — now seems episodic, in a serial TV kind of way, even though the production values are obviously much, much higher than that. The world of the Harkonnens is heavily stylized, recalling Ridley Scott’s Alien worlds, and yet there’s also the faint whiff of prog-rock about it, as if this were the subject of a lost 1970s Rick Wakeman concept album, the kind that would usually be performed as a rock opera on ice.It’s telling that, of the two episodes so far, Part Two is the first to double up on images from David Lynch’s near-disastrous Dune — notably in the portrayal of the ever more grotesque baron, and scenes in which Paul rides the mighty sandworm — and offer an inadvertent reminder that this really is a tough story to crack on screen. The war scenes, initially so compelling, can sometimes be confusing, especially with so many faces in helmets, scarves and masks being enveloped in endless clouds of sand. Luckily, the effects are at all times breathtaking, which is helpful when covering for the sometimes stilted script. 
	To be fair to Villeneuve, it was never a given that there’d be a thirst for this franchise in the first place, and audiences went into Part One not knowing that they’d want a Part Two just as soon as it finished. Part Two would be an epic achievement from any other director, but it feels that there is something bigger, better and obviously more decisive to come in the third and hopefully final part of the trilogy. “This isn’t over yet!” says Chani, and if anyone can tie up this strange, sprawling story and take it out with a bang, Villeneuve can.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Glorious&#33; A cinematic masterpiece in all of its splendor&#46; Villeneuve has outdone himself&#46; Even better than Part One&#46; The production and filmmaking are god tier&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is more than a mere sequel. It’s a continuation, culmination, and ultimately a fantastic elevation of everything you already loved about director Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 film Dune: Part One. That film ended with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) embracing a new way of life after almost everyone he loved was massacred. Here, after a brief interlude, things pick up right where they left off and weave a sweeping, cautionary tale of a young man burdened by destiny and how he’ll act to fulfill it. The film is dense and complex but also majestic and engaging on a level the first film merely touched upon. That’s saying something too because Dune: Part One—which won six well-deserved Oscars for technical achievement—was itself a remarkable accomplishment. This time, that level of skill is not just back, it might be better. Dune: Part Two looks stunning, filled with shots you’d be glad to hang on your wall. The attention to detail in every frame is masterful, with costumes and props that could be works of art on their own. You feel every sound and note of music in your bones as well as your heart. It’s also quite weird, fully embracing author Frank Herbert’s voice and originality. Much like the first film, the script by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts is crafted in such a way that while every name or concept may not stick,  the most crucial parts of the story are easy enough to understand. So even if you don’t know your Kwisatz Haderach from your Sietch Tabr, you get enough to enjoy it. But, again, you can say most of that about the first film. What distinguishes Dune: Part Two from its predecessor are the more complete and layered performances and characterizations, the escalation of tension via editing, and new additions to the cast elevating already exciting material. All of which starts with Paul Atreides.  This is Paul’s story. The first film was his story too—but now that he’s broken, lost, and in a whole new culture, Villeneuve fully focuses on the character’s growth, humility, and burgeoning purpose. Take a snapshot of Chalamet in the film’s first scene versus its last and it would look like two different people. To earn that, Part Two traces Paul’s accomplishments, decisions, and ever-changing mental state beautifully, anchored by an award-worthy lead performance by the actor. Anyone who thinks of Chalamet as a generally cute and unthreatening on-screen presence will have  those preconceptions blow up in a big, big way with Dune: Part Two. He goes dark, and it’s fantastic. As Paul slowly starts to realize he may be this messiah the Fremen of Arrakis have been waiting for, he’s constantly checked by the rising romance he has with Chani, played by Zendaya. Dune: Part Two considerably beefs up her role, not just from the first movie but the original novel too, giving Paul both a worthy partner as well as a formidable voice to challenge his own. Chani takes no shit, speaks her mind, and is never scared to be defiant, even in the scariest of circumstances. Zendaya’s intense, confident performance creates a character with an equally interesting and important arc in the film as Paul’s. One that embodies many of the film’s most noteworthy themes about religion, prophecy, and loyalty. And while Dune: Part Two focuses mostly on Paul’s side of the story, the villains are much more prevalent and entertaining this time around. Part One saw the Harkonnens, led by the Baron (Stellan Starsgård), massacre the entire Atreides family, or so they thought. In the sequel, we spent more time with not just him, but his nephews Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Feyd-Rautha, played by Austin Butler. Butler’s Feyd-Rautha is a new addition and he gives as chilling a sci-fi performance as we’ve seen in some time. Rautha is clearly being set up as a force capable of dethroning Paul and though we don’t spend as much time with him, every time we do, it’s terrifying and intense. Through Rautha, and Butler’s interpretation of him, we see a whole other perspective on this world and almost a mirror of what Paul could become. The Harkonnen genocide of the Atreides was done on behalf of the Emperor, a character absent from the first film, but brought to life here by the one and only Christopher Walken. He’s often joined by his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), who acts as a go-between for all the characters and partial narrator. As per Herbert’s novel, neither gets a ton to do in this movie but each actor still has enough presence that their characters fit effortlessly into the world, exhibiting presence and authority befitting of royalty. Every time they appear, you want to see more of them. Villeneuve is able to simultaneously bolster Paul and the Harkonnens by finding an almost superhuman balance in editing between the two sides. Early sections of the movie are long and consistent. Then, as the action continues to rise, the parallel editing increases in speed. Dune: Part Two starts with over an hour of just Paul and the Fremen on the bright, sandy surface of Arrakis. There’s no break in the story. No cutaways. We get a nice, long, noteworthy chunk that could be an entire movie on its own. Only later does the film completely shift gears to the Harkonnens, spending a shorter but still noticeably long (about a half-hour) uninterrupted section with them. The transition is so jarring it almost feels like a sequel within a sequel. As the film progresses from there, the handoff between scenes gets shorter and shorter as the two stories start to blend and, eventually, explode in a briskly paced, multi-faceted third act. The deliberate increase in pacing means that Dune: Part Two, even at almost three hours, is never ever boring. So we’ve established Dune: Part Two looks great, sounds great, has wonderful performances, and an exciting pace. Is that it? Nope. It’s fun as hell too. Dune: Part One certainly had its share of thrilling, action-packed set pieces, but they somehow pale in comparison to the ones in Part Two. From the first time Paul rides a sandworm, to an epic showcase for Feyd-Rautha, to a full-fledged war with Lord of the Rings scale, and the personal, poetic, powerful final showdown, the action scenes provide a cathartic blend of anticipation, excitement, and payoff. You feel like you are on that sandworm, in a close-quarters knife fight, or flying through the air. Villeneuve makes sure, no matter what the scale, that his action has energy but is also easy to follow, which adds to the enjoyment. Scenes of Paul falling through sand for example are completely chaotic and blurry. And yet, somehow, we can still see and follow it all perfectly. Plus, the set pieces are spread out just enough to add to the film’s pacing, keeping the ebb and flow of it engaging throughout. Probably the most challenging thing about Dune: Part Two is the story of Paul’s mom, Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson. Following Herbert’s lead, the film quickly sends Jessica on her own journey. One that’s crucial both to the all-important lore of this story and the overall world. However, Jessica’s story is by far the least accessible in the film, simply because she doesn’t adhere to the usual mythology or the rules of reality. She sees the past, the future, constantly talks to her unborn baby, and is rarely easy to get a read on. It’s a lot. And still, through Villeneuve’s expert direction and writing, everything that feels weird and awkward about her character and story ends up adding so much to the decisions Paul, Chani, and the rest make in the end. So while it at first might seem as if Lady Jessica is a liability to the film, you have to trust Villeneuve that the tiny speedbumps are necessary and ultimately beneficial. That’s what it all comes down to. To be a great director, you must have a vision, and Denis Villeneuve has vision to spare. In deciding to adapt Frank Herbert’s seemingly unadaptable book Dune, that vision was an ambitious gamble to split it into two halves, without a guarantee that the second part would ever be made. Many probably thought it would never happen. But, in Villeneuve we trust. He turned Part One into an award-winning hit and now Part Two completes, elevates, and integrates that already classic movie into something new and wonderful. So if you liked the first Dune and were eager to see the story play out in a way that enhances the original, Dune: Part Two is all that and then some. It’s an excellent character piece told on a grand scale with all the action and visuals you’re craving. Stars like Chalamet and Zendaya shine, while new characters played by the likes of Butler and Pugh elevate everything around them. In keeping the story close to the original novel, Villeneuve does end the film rather abruptly, once again leaving us wanting more. But even if the film wrapped up in a bow, Dune: Part Two is so good, we’d want more regardless. It’s the price we pay for the privilege of watching the work of a seminal filmmaker who has just completed a definitive sci-fi saga for the ages. Want more io9 news?

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve's first ""Dune"" movie in 2021 had many impressive qualities: a script that made clear sense out of infamously complicated material, a game all-star cast, immersive IMAX-scale grandeur, and technical achievement worth all six of its Oscar wins. And yet as an adaptation of only the first half of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novel, it also had a serious case of ""When are they gonna get to the fireworks factory?"" It was a movie begging for a sequel, teasing future events via spice visions and literally ending with Chani (Zendaya) announcing, ""This is only the beginning."" Two and a half years later (half a year longer than previously anticipated as a result of the SAG-AFTRA strike), Villeneuve has finally brought us to the fireworks factory. ""Dune: Part Two"" is as huge an improvement upon its predecessor as ""The Dark Knight"" was to ""Batman Begins."" With the characters, setting, and conflict having been solidly established in ""Part One,"" ""Part Two"" is able to build off that foundation to go bigger, weirder, darker, and more entertaining. Though ""Part Two"" once again concludes with an ending that's ""only the beginning"" — and there's no doubt in my mind that ""Dune Messiah"" will be greenlit within days of ""Part Two"" hitting theaters — this time around, we've experienced the full satisfaction of watching a great movie in its own right rather than merely being teased by the promise of one. I've long described Denis Villeneuve's cinematic approach to ""Dune"" as an attempt to make ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" at the same time, combining the bold sci-fi imagery of the former with the desert imperialism drama of the latter. ""Dune: Part Two"" goes further into both of those comparisons; Stanley Kubrick's ""Star Baby"" is homaged through surreal shots inside the womb of Lady Jessica (Rebecca Fergusson), and Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is now fully in the T.E. Lawrence-esque ""going native"" part of his story arc. While Villeneuve's style has traditionally leaned towards Kubrickian detachment, the story of ""Dune: Part Two"" pushes him closer to the more emotional strengths of David Lean's work. The early goings of ""Dune: Part Two"" also invite another movie comparison that might come more unexpected: ""Monty Python's Life of Brian."" Obviously, this isn't a farce like the Python film — though there is more humor here than you might expect from the generally serious tone — but there's a similarly critical approach to Messianic mythology and religious fervor, and some scenes play out as just slightly more serious versions of ""Life of Brian"" scenes. Is Paul Atreides the Lisan Al-Gaib, or a very naughty boy? The answer might very well be both. How we're supposed to feel about Paul at this point is complicated. Do we view him as a hero or a villain? Are we rooting for him to get revenge on the grotesquely evil Harkonnen family or afraid he'll become just like his enemies? Is he helping the Fremen as their equal or acting as their savior to use them for his own ends — and to what ends are the Bene Gesserit using him? Chani's role is important for providing a lens through which to look at Paul: She's critical of this outsider coming in as a savior to her people and skeptical of all the prophecies surrounding him, and yet she knows she's caught up in these prophecies with him — and damn it, she falls in love with him despite her doubts. In ""Part One,"" Zendaya does a lot with very little screen time; in ""Part Two,"" she's the tragic heart of the whole movie. 
""Dune: Part One"" had a few great battle scenes, but ""Dune: Part Two"" goes above and beyond with the thrills. From sandworm-riding to strategic military operations to brutal knife fights, there's never a long wait for the next big and beautiful action set piece. A strikingly photographed black and white gladiatorial match introducing the sadistic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler, no longer talking like Elvis) and one particular explosion that's even scarier than the one in ""Oppenheimer"" are among the highlights of Greig Fraser's masterful shooting of the action. Though my advanced screening wasn't in IMAX (I plan to see the film again in the larger format), I did get to experience the Dolby Atmos sound mix, which offers its own sense of incredible immersion as you feel the vibrations of each ornithopter flying across the screen.





Among the supporting cast, Javier Bardem is doing particularly compelling work as the Fremen leader Stilgar, capturing his sense of faith and the excitement of experiencing miracles with warmth and humor. The return of Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) is also enjoyable, though admittedly my perspective on his scenes is forever skewed after reading Brolin's poetry about Chalamet, and Dave Bautista lends a strong presence to the evil role of Glossu Rabban Harkonnen. Of the new cast members, Butler makes the strongest impression, but his potential impact is somewhat lessened by the film's need to keep its depiction of violence within PG-13 limits. Though narration by Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan opens the film, she's more a plot device than an interesting character in her own right; more than anything about the character herself, I remember her great outfits. Christopher Walken's Emperor Shaddam IV is also more of a plot device than an interesting character, though with the benefit of being Christopher Walken.





Everything that ""Dune: Part One"" promised, ""Dune: Part Two"" delivers. It's a thinking person's blockbuster that works equally effectively as the middle act of an epic tragedy and as top-notch popcorn entertainment. (Hey, what did you think those sandworm buckets were for?) I have to imagine everyone else with an awards-contending movie out last fall breathed a sigh of relief when it was delayed, because the 2024 Oscar race would look pretty different with ""Dune: Part Two"" in the mix. Is it too early to make predictions for the 2025 Oscars? Long live the fighters!

Denis Villeneuve has insisted that “Dune: Part Two” would be a direct continuation of its predecessor rather than a sequel, and the man has absolutely made good on that promise: Not only does this new movie pick up exactly where the last one left off, it also carries over the strengths and weaknesses that made the previous chapter so astonishing to look at but stultifying to watch.  If “Dune: Part Two” is more nuanced and action-packed than the previous installment, and Chalamet’s twiggy princeling a far less passive hero than he was the first time around, the relative density of the drama that Villenueve has packed into this movie is deflated by a similar uptick in the grandiosity of the spectacle that surrounds it. Much like his protagonist, the filmmaker is straining to reconcile a larger-than-life sense of predestination with the intimate pain of a moral dilemma, but his own failure to achieve that balance makes it all but impossible for Paul to succeed on the same terms.  Yes, this is a vaguely Oedipal tragedy about a manchild lurching towards the same violent outcome that he’s so determined to avoid (you’ll have to wait for the not-yet-announced but inevitable “Part Three” to see how that plays out), and of course there’s an ancient power in the story of someone fighting against the fate that’s been written for them. But the iron grip of that inevitability should only make it more heart-wrenching to follow Paul as he tries to find his role among the Fremen of Arrakis and avenge his father without instigating an intergalactic holy war.  This time, however, the road towards that colossal letdown is a bit smoother. Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts have already teased out the lay of the land, and so “Dune: Part Two” is able to dig a little deeper from the moment it starts — to actually show us some of the places that were alluded to in the previous movie, and to complicate the white savior myth that Paul brings with him when he and his pregnant mom (Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica) are escorted to the secret Fremen community of Sietch Tabr.  These early scenes represent the very best of what Villeneuve can bring to this story, as they viscerally bring to life “a place where nothing can live without faith.” It’s because the arid deserts are so merciless that we can understand why the Fremen suck the moisture out of their enemies’ bodies and honor their own dead by pouring their water into a giant pool, and it’s because of an indelible new track from Hans Zimmer’s semi-recycled score — a bittersweet wail that cuts deeper than any of the music he wrote for “Part One” and sustains the emotion of this movie long after the script has run out of steam — that we can parse the complicated roles that anger, pride, and resentment play in the Fremen’s need for outside help.  That clarity lends a welcome shot in the arm to the thrilling action sequences that Villeneuve stages on the sand, which are clear and concussive enough to compensate for their brevity. These setpieces — which peak with a sandworm-riding trial so exhilarating that the rest of the movie can’t help but feel like a letdown — are also more exciting than anything that follows because they allow Paul to forge his relationship with the two Fremen who will most directly impact his fate.  And then, of course, there’s Chani. The skeptical and self-reliant Fremen was the patron saint of everything that didn’t work about the last movie, as Spaihts and Villeneueve reduced her character to a living reminder of all the sacrifices their adaptation had to make on its way to the screen. In “Part Two,” Chani is allowed to take her rightful place at the heart of Paul’s story, even as she questions whether or not it should belong to him (and even as the script dramatically streamlines her role in it).  Zendaya is more than up for the challenge. Not to belittle Chalamet, whose furrowed brow sows doubt in all the right places, but the most interesting thing about Paul’s trajectory is how it’s reflected across Zendaya’s face. So much of this increasingly interminable film is spent on slow-motion shots of silhouettes walking towards the sunset as Zimmer goes ham over the soundtrack, but all it takes is a single reaction shot of Chani for the drama to snap back into focus.  And bless the Maker and his water for that, because as soon as “Dune: Part Two” begins to shift its attention away from the Sietch, palpable emotion becomes as precious and hard to find in this movie as moisture in the deserts of Arrakis. The problem starts with the villainous Harkonnen, who are somehow even less compelling here than they were in the previous movie. Parodies of colonial evil, these hairless world-eaters are such one-dimensional rage cases that they make the Sith feel almost Shakespearian by comparison. Dave Bautista still cuts quite a figure as Glossu Rabban Harkonnen, but his entire character amounts to a distended scream — there are no fewer than three scenes in this movie where Rabban or one of the other Harkonnen murder a henchman just to release some steam.  Villeneuve introduces him in a hideous, monochromatic fight sequence that so clumsily literalizes the film’s black-and-white moral binary that it feels like a detour into a Zack Snyder movie, and from that point on Feyd-Rautha never has a chance to rise above his look to become a rival worthy of Paul’s ascendance. His only scene that doesn’t bring “Part Two” to an absolute standstill involves Léa Seydoux dropping by for some light “Under the Skin” cosplay.  The Emperor’s arrival is meant to reflect Paul’s discovery that power cannot be tamed, and that “the heart is not meant to rule,” but his non-presence only manages to incite one of the largest and most underwhelming final battles a sci-fi blockbuster of this scale has ever served up. That anticlimax may be true to the plot of Herbert’s novel, but it reflects the missteps of Villeneuve’s stolid adaptation. In a film so booming and immense that it seems like sandworms are rumbling under your feet, a film that best identifies with the Bene Gesserit’s detached and ultra-wide POV on this story, even the most significant events tend to blow over like farts in the wind. Even the oldest and most oft-told of myths feel more alive in the moment. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The Pitch: It’s been two and a half years since the first Dune film brought us to a faraway future on the desert planet Arrakis. That’s the world where, as you might remember (two and a half years is a long time!), a young man named Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) survived a devastating attack on their family, thanks to a power grab orchestrated by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his family. Escaping into the desert, Paul and Jessica were able to form an alliance with a tribe of Fremen (the natives of Arrakis), an alliance seemingly foretold by Paul’s visions of a young Fremen warrior named Chani (Zendaya). Dune: Part Two picks up right after the events of the first film, as Paul learns the ways of the Fremen and grows closer with Chani. There Is Beauty In the Desert: Hooboy, it’s easy to forget just how much is going on in a Dune movie until you attempt to summarize it. Director Denis Villeneuve’s follow-up to the Oscar-winning epic probably requires a rewatch of the first film (now streaming on Max or Netflix) in order to properly prepare, because even with a runtime of two hours and 46 minutes, there’s no time for recapping what came before — not with a half-dozen new characters and a whole messianic ascent to follow. In so many ways, Part Two takes what Villeneuve did with Part One and expands upon it, bringing that same sense of epic grandeur to the storytelling as well as its visual craft. In the year 2024, the memory of feeling awe over a filmmaker’s choices can be a dusty one, especially in genre storytelling. Yet somehow Villeneuve does it again, with Greig Fraser’s rich painterly cinematography and top-notch VFX creating new and dazzling visual spectacles. Even something as simple as Harkonnen foot soldiers eschewing gravity to leap atop a rock formation stands out as magical. The true hero of the Dune films, though, is costume designer Jacqueline West, whose work here features some breathtaking pieces of craftsmanship (like, as one example, literally everything worn by Florence Pugh’s space princess). More importantly, West’s attention to detail gives a grounded feel to everything worn on screen, especially the various types of suits worn to survive on Arrakis, hard-selling the audience on the idea that everything is real. Dune could easily feel like over-the-top costume drama, but the costumes being so damn good is somehow, paradoxically, why it doesn’t."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," The word that will likely be used most often to describe Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two” is “massive.” Expect a whole lot of variations on the words “epic” and “spectacle” too. Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not approach Frank Herbert’s beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations, and it’s his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to the Oscar-winning 2021 film. While that beloved blockbuster often felt like half a film, “Dune: Part Two” locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the old-fashioned storytelling. More than a simple savior or chosen one story, “Dune: Part Two” is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair. “Dune: Part Two” has been compared to “The Empire Strikes Back” in the run-up to its release, and that’s not quite right. The better comparison is “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,” another film that built on what we knew about the characters from the first film, added a few new ones, and really amplified a sense of continuous battle and danger. Like both films, a third chapter feels inevitable. Critics will have to come up with a new synonym for massive.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- “Dune: Part Two” lives up to the hype. Denis Villeneuve’s super sequel is a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals, incredible action and where sci-fi meets Shakespeare. But consider this a fair warning: the film will break your heart. Behind the grand scale, world-building and mythology, this messianic tale is a love story. Following a brief prologue, part two dives right into the deep end, picking up where the, ahem, eventful part one left off. Study up if you have to! On the desert planet of Arrakis, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have just joined the native Fremen in their fight against the soldiers of House Harkonnen, who continue to ravage the planet for its precious spice.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Three years ago, when Denis Villeneuve‘s first Dune installment hit screens, I had only read the first book of Frank Herbert’s seminal space opera series. As I mentioned in that review, I thought it was a solid if unspectacular take on what is basically the second most influential genre novel in all of modern publishing history. A more palatable adaptation that David Lynch’s truncated attempt of the early 80’s, but still one that was stifled by the need to curtail Herbert’s wilder eccentricities to adapt to the current tastes towards minimalism. In short; while sequences like the Fall of Arrakeen are arresting, and some of Villeneuve and team’s additions to the story (the visions of Jamis that Paul has before meeting him) are poignant, Dune: Part One was overridden by a general flattening of SF’s arguably greatest epic that was hard to escape. Dune: Part Two suffers from the same general aesthetic challenges. It’s still guys in black space suits fighting guys in gray space suits, with the occasional appearance by guys in white space suits. But, where the first film was all set-up and ambling preamble, this second half of the story is where Herbert’s much more interesting material lies and the audiences are much the benefactor for it. It’s saying something that for a book that contains things like giant desert worms, a substance that can allow you to see into the future, and galactic empires that its most compelling facet is its preoccupation with political intrigue and the fiction of prophecy. Yes, long before George RR Martin was leading you along with doomed hero Ned Stark and “the stallion that mounts the world” in Khal Drogo, Herbert was diving deep into the Machiavellian plotting of secret societies and the work that goes into creating a sense of belief around messiah figures. The first film touched on this briefly, as Paul struggled to come to terms with his abilities as the Kwisatz Haderach, but Part Two is where all of this takes bloom. Living up to Chani’s (Zendaya) promise that “this is only the beginning” and picking up from that moment, we see Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) wandering the desert with the Fremen under the lead of Stilgar (Javier Bardem). While the pair of outsiders are beginning to fully adapt to the Fremen’s ways and customs, Stilgar and a group of true believers are starting to believe that there’s more to this Duke’s son than initially thought. A rift begins to grow between both the more devout tribal leaders and the younger generation (with Chani among their ranks) about their coming messiah (the “Lisan al Ghaib” if you’re keeping track at home). How Paul is able to bridge that divide while Jessica also begins to commune with her unborn daughter and the role she plays, is what unfolds over the course of the film. Granted, that also ignores that there’s an entire plot around Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) and his two nephews, Beast Rabban (Dave Batista) and Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) struggling to battle against the growing tactics of the Fremen under Paul’s ever-expanding guidance. This is troubling for the Baron, not the least of which because it stalls out his spice production and brings the attention of the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). It’s a complex and heady brew, yet also a rousing one. While the first film was a bit imbalanced in its need to worldbuild, explain, and then still try to provide some semblance of thrills to the point of tedium, this is an effort that finds everything clicking. Action bursts are shorter and served in much more satisfying chunks, while character dynamics are better served here too. Instead of relying on the actors to parlay relationships that largely go unspoken and causing some of them to work overtime (like Jason Momoa and Josh Brolin), here we finally get a better sense of who Gurney Halleck is, and the more time we spend with Stilgar, the more we like him. I haven’t seen a Bardem performance I’ve enjoyed this much in a while, dryly funny sits especially well on him. That Villeneuve finally embraces the more surrealistic aspects of the source material has its thrills as well. Granted, his vision of Paul’s heightening awareness still is only slightly elevated beyond Christopher Nolan-style grounding, but these sequences are just dreamy enough and drive home the building struggle of Paul’s decision between vengeance and ending the tyranny of the Harkonnens and the possibility of greater atrocities with an advent of a future empire in his name. Speaking of the Harkonnens, I think calling Oscar nominee Austin Butler a revelation is a bit silly at this point, but he gives the already iconic Feyd-Rautha (Sting in a speedo!) a more terrifying spin that creates a nice “Paul gone wrong” sort of foil. And he mimics Skarsgard’s accent in a way that makes him sound a lot like Bill and underlines Butler’s clear love of voice work. In the lead-up to the film, I was somewhat puzzled by how little narrative time either Feyd or Irulan actually have in the book and how that would be managed on screen given the star power of the actors involved. Happily, Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts have crafted a few additional scenes that better situate these key characters in ways that aren’t canon breaking in any way and likely serve to set up the inevitable third film. To that same point, while I’m loathe to say the film actively improves on the book, when it comes to Chani that might actually be the case. Despite their relationship being a bit speed-ran, Chani is a much more active presence – both in her reticence to Paul ascendency throughout up to the film’s closing. I love the book, but you’ll never see me argue that it’s final pages are its strongest, and the filmmakers realize that too. In all, color me impressed. I came in with no small amount of reticence around Villeneuve’s vision of Dune. While I still think he has blindspots to how utterly weird this stuff should be, Dune: Part Two brings to life the more vital facet of the book’s themes and plans within plans in a way that a blockbuster hungry audience will gobble up. This is getting into the rarefied company of Peter Jackson working on Lord of the Rings, or darn close. Go ahead and mark this one down as a leading Best Picture contender for next year’s Oscars."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," In the three years since Denis Villeneuve immersed audiences in Frank Herbert’s world, few Hollywood blockbusters have come close to matching Dune: Part One’s epic scope, technical bravura or seriousness of purpose. Part Two picks up where the first instalment left off, literally and figuratively, delivering another stunning set of gorgeous visuals and exceptional action sequences. Following Timothee Chalamet’s fledgling leader Paul Atreides as he prepares to battle the evil Harkonnen who wiped out his people in the first chapter, this sequel may not quite reach its predecessor’s heights, but this remains a franchise that is galaxies removed from standard studio fare in its ambition and confidence. Warner Bros. unveils Part Two on March 1 in the UK and US, hoping to eclipse Dune’s $404 million worldwide gross – a seemingly achievable goal considering the 2021 picture came out when Covid was still severely impacting theatres. Initially scheduled for a fall 2023 release before the writers and actors strikes precipitated a need to move the film to the spring, this star-studded sequel will benefit from rave reviews, not to mention a marketplace without many must-see pictures. Part Two’s suitability for IMAX screens will only further boost commercial prospects. Teaming up with Arrakis’ desert-dwelling people the Fremen, the enigmatic warrior Chani (Zendaya), Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) vow vengeance against Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard), the monstrous head of House Harkonnen responsible for the death of Paul’s beloved father, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac, seen in the previous instalment). Vladimir recruits his vicious nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to kill Paul and ensure that Arrakis’ invaluable spice reserves are secured. Part Two matches the high bar set by the original film, which won six Oscars and five Bafta awards in technical categories. Greig Fraser’s cinematography and Patrice Vermette’s production design conspire to create an otherworldly environment populated by vast deserts, spartan coliseums, inventive spaceships and spectacular sunsets. But, remarkably, the meticulous care that Villeneuve brings to every visual detail never leads to cluttered frames — rather, this sequel is just as strikingly spare, with the battle scenes always clearly presented and the hand-to-hand fight sequences intimate and intense. So much of modern filmmaking obsesses over world-building, but Villeneuve and his team’s imagination clobbers that of their competitors. Several new cast members join Part Two, including Lea Seydoux as a member of the powerful Bene Gesserit, Christopher Walken as the ageing emperor, and Florence Pugh playing his loyal, protective daughter. But the most commanding new presence is Butler, whose Feyd-Rautha is rightly described as psychotic. A brutal, sadistic enforcer who relishes tormenting his adversaries, Feyd-Rautha sneers and prowls as he stalks his prey, allowing Butler to exude a disturbingly coiled menace. Eventually, this villain squares off with Paul in a third-act showdown that lives up to its billing, the choreography of their gripping knife fight both realistic and dazzling.  In this new chapter, Paul will fulfil his destiny as the chosen one meant to bring down the forces of evil — a mighty task for any actor, and one that Chalamet mostly pulls off. With his slight frame and youthful face, he intentionally lacks the strapping presence and overt machismo that audiences have come to associate with their action heroes. (Kyle MacLachlan, who played the role in David Lynch’s 1984 Dune, was similarly wiry and boyish.) But Chalamet harnesses his quiet presence and soulful expressions to suggest a leader who finds his calling out there in the desert, more than capably portraying Paul’s transformation into a formidable fighter. Villeneuve’s visionary approach to Herbert’s classic (and believed to be unfilmable) sci-fi novel is a testament to the director’s faith that embracing the story’s grandeur and eternal themes could result in arresting cinema. To be sure, Part Two shares with the first film a grave solemnity in which questions of faith, power and fate are elevated to the level of the mythic, although this sequel is not as nimble at locating the emotional nuance in this epic struggle, occasionally sacrificing the quiet character moment for the sake of the next muscular set piece. In addition, as breathtaking as Part Two looks, it is forced to compete with Part One, which was inherently more novel and groundbreaking because it came first. But, ultimately, such quibbles are crushed by the sheer audacity of Villeneuve’s execution. As Hans Zimmer’s propulsive score juices the drama and thrill of Paul’s quest, Part Two achieves the sort of big-screen momentousness that is too rarely dared in contemporary cinema. Anyone swept away by the 2021 film will hunger to return for a second helping — and be richly rewarded.  Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune Part 2 left me speechless&#46; A powerhouse epic masterpiece that becomes the TWO TOWERS of this decade&#46; A special type of movie that only comes around every so often &amp; will make you believe in what the magic of filmmaking can create&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,DUNE&#58; PART TWO is nothing short of MONUMENTAL and one of the BEST sequels of all time&#46; Denis Villeneuve accomplishes the impossible in crafting a massive and intricate film you need to see to believe&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villeneuve is one of this generation’s most profound Hollywood blockbuster visionaries. In a big-budget landscape filled with spandex-wearing superheroes, he led the charge in bringing one of science fiction’s most notable novels to the silver screen, making it look even more expensive than it already is. Dune: Part Two follows in the footsteps of the book’s second half, expanding the scope, scale, and grandiose action spectacle to another level.  After the bloodbath on Arrakis, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), now live among the Fremen. They struggle to adjust to their differing customs and their status as outsiders. Paul develops a bond with Chani (Zendaya) along his path in seeking revenge on all those who participated in the annihilation of his family, putting his relationships and moral compass to the ultimate test. The unforgiving deserts of Arrakis define its inhabitants’ struggles, placing water as one’s greatest currency. A degree of nuance is given to the Fremen, differentiating one tribe from another within the context of religious devotion, or the lack thereof. Faith proves the most formidable asset within their forces, simultaneously acting both as Paul’s path to power and control, but also his greatest conundrum. Power within the world of Dune is constantly expressed through showmanship and pride, which is especially conveyed through House Harkonnen’s ruthless Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). The story primarily lives within the themes of the original novel, never truly breaking through broad characterizations that feel notably thin living within the expansive mythos that makes their interpersonal stakes feel small and unmoving. Paul isn’t a particularly engaging character, but that’s entirely the commentary being made on the “chosen one” narrative. Chalamet plays him in line with the story’s themes, although he’s given much more to do here than in the film’s predecessor. The same can be said of Zendaya as Chani, although their romantic chemistry doesn’t shine as it should. Ferguson as Jessica and Javier Bardem as Fremen leader Stilgar are clear standouts. Butler is ferocious as Feyd-Rautha, easily shaking the baggage from prior roles. Notable names, such as Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, and Léa Seydoux appear in smaller parts, although there isn’t a whole lot for them to do. The top-notch crafts flex their muscles in every frame. From Jacqueline West’s breathtaking costume design to Hans Zimmer’s epic score and Greig Fraser’s astonishing cinematography, Dune: Part Two is a visual and audible marvel that fully immerses the audience in its world. The action spectacle is masterful, maintaining a stunning rhythm through battle sequences. Dune: Part Two is a visually-monumental blockbuster that excels in cinematic spectacle. Similar to Part One, the characters remain paper-thin, lacking emotional depth. This isn’t necessarily an adaptation issue, but it does make for unengaging personal stakes. Nevertheless, the experience is a special one with a world worth investing in, and hopefully we will get the chance to see Villeneuve’s take on Dune: Messiah next."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Everything about 2021’s Dune was colossal—except its conclusion. Closing on a cliffhanger at the very moment its tale was getting started, Denis Villeneuve’s 155-minute epic couldn’t escape the fact that, for all its breathtaking strengths, it was a prologue in need of a follow-up. That now arrives with Dune: Part Two (March 1, in theaters), a dense and action-heavy sequel that estimably expands this titanic adaptation of Frank Herbert’s landmark 1965 sci-fi novel. Boasting a gargantuan aesthetic design that demands to be experienced on the biggest screen if possible, as well as an ambitious and exhilarating story that matches its style, it’s not only the finest thing Villeneuve has helmed—it’s the 2024 film to beat for outsized sci-fi showmanship. Dune wrapped up with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) heading into the deserts of Arrakis with Chani (Zendaya)—the literal woman of his dreams—and her indigenous Fremen pals. After his father (Oscar Isaac) was assassinated, House Atreides met its downfall at the hands of the treacherous Harkonnen led by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). While bred by his witchy mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) to be the long-prophesied messiah (a status that she thinks will keep him safe), Paul cares little about being the chosen one except insofar as that reputation allows him to remain with the Fremen. He covets this not only because of his budding feelings for Chani, who doubts his divinity, but also because he’s partnering with true-believer Stilgar (Javier Bardem) to attack the Harkonnen spice-harvesting apparatus. The hope is that this will spark a conflict that will earn him a confrontation with Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), who rules alongside his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), and Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). Prophesy is both a power unto itself and a tool to manipulate in Dune: Part Two, but it’s also something that can’t be easily controlled. Villeneuve's film (co-written by Jon Spaihts) distinguishes itself from the pack of prior adaptations of Herbert’s book by anchoring itself in thorny issues of sovereignty, exploitation, and the various (earnest and treacherous) ways in which religious beliefs are formed, spread, and utilized—and, ultimately, made real. Until its climactic passages, Paul repeatedly rejects claims that he’s a holy savior. Yet even if those protestations are sincere, they’re only partially so; he’s simultaneously guided by his visions, the most terrifying of which indicate that, should he follow a mysterious female figure to the south, doom awaits. Much of Dune: Part Two’s opening hour concerns Paul’s efforts to train with the Fremen and, in doing so, earn their trust and respect—a difficult process given their view of outsiders, and one that only concludes when he successfully rides one of Arrakis’ giant sandworms. That feat is the first of a handful of showstoppers staged with muscular electricity by Villeneuve, who further establishes himself as one of the medium’s masters of massiveness. He creates a deft interplay between mammoth scale and up-close intimacy as well as light and dark, warmth and cold, and anxious silence and thunderous cacophony—the last courtesy of Hans Zimmer’s chest-rattling score and its ominously euphoric main theme. In so doing, the director keeps tension at a fever pitch throughout, be he orchestrating huge battles between armies, showdowns between individuals, or quieter exchanges between Paul and his Fremen mates, whose love and loyalty for him are as hazardous as they are comforting. Paul recognizes that becoming what his mother and Stilgar (and countless fundamentalist Fremen) want is to court a dangerous authority, and Dune: Part Two derives its central tension from various intertwined ideas: that Paul’s deification is a ploy crafted by forces with their own agendas; that it might bring about suffering and annihilation; and that it may be inevitable, regardless of Paul or Chani’s feelings about embracing such a dark destiny. Less conflicted about the throne, however, is Baron Harkonnen. In the wake of multiple failures to wipe out the Fremen by his rage-y nephew Glossu Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista), he turns his eye to his younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler). Feyd is a homicidal “psychotic” whom the Baron—and Mohiam, who’s pulling many of these strings—thinks would make for an outstanding new emperor, should Shaddam IV perish in a forthcoming conflict with Paul. Such intrigue fuels Dune: Part Two’s drama while its IMAX-grade set pieces provide it with its thrills, from Paul and Chani collaborating on an early assault of a giant Harkonnen convoy of insectoid vehicles, to Feyd-Rautha demonstrating his viciousness in a gladiatorial colosseum, to Paul leading a charge on the emperor’s mirror-pyramid stronghold during the home stretch. On a couple of occasions, Villeneuve and editor Joe Walker’s transitions prove a tad clunky, hopscotching forward somewhat abruptly. Yet by and large, the film is at once light on its feet (as when soldiers float silently to and from their crafts) and scarily weighty, crashing and roaring from one magisterial sight and skirmish to the next. It's a quiet-loud-quiet beast that rattles the nerves and overwhelms the senses. Headlined by a commanding Chalamet, who despite his physical litheness manages to exude an impressive degree of ferocious, zealous intensity as Paul evolves from hurt boy to determined warrior king, Dune: Part Two is awash in superb performances. It’s Ferguson, though, who proves the ace up its sleeve. A conniving figure who accepts her prophesied role as the Fremen’s new Reverend Mother by drinking the sandworm-procured Water of Life, and who routinely communes with the (now-mutated?) unborn daughter who gestates in her womb, Lady Jessica is a devious schemer intent on keeping her finger on the proverbial scale. Ferguson radiates a cagey menace that ultimately typifies so much of these portentous proceedings. There are fearsome fights galore in Dune: Part Two, as well as reunions with long-lost friends, struggles of the heart and conscience, and troubling questions about altruism, aspiration, leadership, and retribution—not to mention faith, and whether God creates believers or if it’s the other way around. Transforming his lore-laden source material and its many Middle Eastern flourishes and dynamics into a gorgeous and gigantic portrait of liberation and conquest, sacrifice and vengeance, Villeneuve continues to bring Herbert’s beloved standard-setter to brilliant life—emphasis on “continues,” since no matter its satisfying wrap-up, its last notes are far from absolute. Couple that with Léa Seydoux’s tantalizing appearance as a Bene Gesserit witch and a brief A-list cameo that itself serves as proof of Villeneuve’s prospective designs, and it’s clear that Dune: Part Two is merely a prelude for a true finale. Considering this franchise installment’s excellence, that future can’t come soon enough."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," “Whether [Denis] Villeneuve gets to make Part Two depends largely Part One’s success. Call me a cynic, but I suspect that means we’ll never see this story finished. Either way, I would rather have one magnificent portion than a frenzied, nonsensical whole.” Back then, I was glad Villeneuve chose to adapt only the first half of Frank Herbert’s epic sci-fi novel, even if it meant I might never see the conclusion of the story. That first half was so beautiful and smart and well-acted it seemed like a much better outcome than another “complete” Dune like David Lynch’s overstuffed, bizarre (yet bizarrely endearing) mess. It took a while, but Villeneuve managed to make Dune: Part Two, reassembling his cast and creative team to conclude Paul Atreides’ transformation from inexperienced kid to battle-hardened warrior-prophet. It was worth the wait. Looking back on my earlier review, I find that all its critical hosannas — “the future it conjures feel so complete and tactile that some segments play like a documentary of the world to come,” “totally clear in its premise, politics, and operatic sci-fi story,” “filled with the sort of epic grandeur of vision that Dune fans always insist makes the original text special” — apply equally well here. Picking up precisely where the last Dune left off, Villeneuve rejoins Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) as they continue to acclimate to their life among the native Fremen people of the inhospitable desert planet Arrakis. Following the destruction of their home (and the death of Paul’s father) at the hands of the evil House Harkonnen, the Fremen leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes that Paul may be a messiah prophesied to defeat Arrakis’ colonizers — a belief that Jessica is all too happy to encourage to suit her own political motives as a member of “Bene Gesserit,” an all-female group of spiritual advisors who have spent countless centuries trying to bring about the “Kwisatz Haderach,” a super-being capable of lording over the universe on their behalf. Paul himself isn’s so sure about his supposed destiny — and he’s plagued by nightmarish visions of cataclysmic death and pain that would befall the universe if he accepts Stilgar and Jessica’s prodding and embraces his status as the Fremen’s leader. Paul’s Fremen lover Chani (Zendaya) isn’t too keen on the whole my-boyfriend-is-actually-a-god-sent-to-start-a-holy-war component of the equation either, although she does fight alongside him against the Harkonnen army. While Paul wrestles with self-doubt, his enemies bear no such concerns. They include the sloth-like Baron Harkonnnen (Stellan Skarsgard), his slightly incompetent and overmatched nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista), and his slightly psychotic and ambitious other nephew Feyd-Rautha (Elvis’ Austin Butler). As the battle for control of Arrakis and its all-important spice escalates, it also becomes of increasing concern for the emperor of the entire universe (Christopher Walken - and just imagine all the emails he has to answer every day with that job title) along with his politically savvy daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh). As always, trying to explain the plot of Dune makes you sound slightly unhinged, but Villeneuve once again found a way to make a movie that involves telepathy, hallucinogenic cocktails, alien religions, and massive sandworms with sphincter-like faces that people ride on like giant rideshares with buttholes for bumpers feel totally lucid and plausible. Unlike so many blockbusters these days with their cheap and obviously phony CGI, both of Villeneuve’s Dune feel real — and stunningly gorgeous, even in their moments of horror and terror. (See: The massive sandworms with sphincter-like faces.) Dune also stands in stark contrast to so many other shallow tentpoles of recent years in also investing an enormous amount of time and energy into treating its characters as fully realized and deeply flawed people, not merely props to be scanned and programmed into computers so they can do cool-looking but physically-impossible things onscreen. Paul faces a dilemma that’s rare for a movie this scale; not whether he will win or lose his war with the Harkonnens, but whether he should even enter into such a war in the first place, and if the moral sacrifices he will have to make to do so are worth gaining revenge against the perpetrators of his father’s murder. And while most of the other characters work to convince Paul to embrace his ubermenschian destiny,  Zendaya gives an incredibly rich performance as Chani, who loves Paul the man, but is deeply ambivalent about his ambitions and about the political leader (or maybe political puppet) he’s becoming before her eyes. Her mostly silent performance in the movie’s final scenes is really remarkable — all the more so because it grounds this epic story in the emotions of this one person. Watching Paul through her eyes shifts Dune from a hero’s journey to a cautionary tale. If Dune: Part Two has an issue, it may be that Villeneuve did such an incredible and surprising job with the first film, that the second movie doesn’t feel quite as groundbreaking or as original. It finishes the story, in thrilling and thoughtful fashion, but it didn’t quite leave my jaw on the ground the way the first Dune did. Then again, maybe it doesn’t finish the story. Dune: Part Two leaves so much room for a Dune: Part Three that you could practically ride a sandworm through it. That’s not to say I wouldn’t want to see a third Dune, especially from this director and cast. They brought this fantastical future to life in a way that seemed impossible after Lynch’s Dune.  Villeneuve has already made it clear he hopes to direct a third Dune at some point; if he wants to make it, I want to see it. And this time, I wouldn’t bet against it happening."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"  After walking out of Dune, I felt assured that Denis Villeneuve's vision of Arrakis and Paul Atreides couldn't be topped. Villeneuve did what many failed to do: adapt the unadaptable. With Dune: Part Two though, it's about sticking the landing for that adaptation. Part Two achieves the impossible by fully realizing Villeneuve and author Frank Herbert's vision, but nothing is perfect. Part Two offers a lot more on the visual cinematic front, with impressive visuals and a fantastic score, however, where it struggles is with its widening scope. The larger cast and a dive deeper into the mythos of the story creates some issues, especially if you're stepping into the story as just a casual movie watcher. While Part Two is impressive on multiple fronts, it doesn't make it to the finish line without stumbling first.   Part Two picks up mere hours after the first movie and follows Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), as they adjust to their new normal now living among the unfamiliar Fremen in the vast deserts of Arrakis. Paul learns from both Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya) about how to navigate the desert as Jessica continues to fuel the belief that Paul is the messiah. Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) oversees his new control of Arrakis as it mines the precious and valuable spice. When his nephew, Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista), fails to fight off the attacking Fremen and obtain command of the planet, the Baron sends in his other nephew, the sadistic Feyd-Rautha (a perfectly menacing Austin Butler), to the planet in his place. On top of all of that, we also meet Princess Irulan (a fleeting Florence Pugh), the daughter of the Emperor (an enigmatic and restrained Christopher Walken), who played a large part in the fall of House Atreides.   Part of the problem with Part Two was always going to arise when tackling Dune. With the expansion of the world comes more characters. Where we mainly circled the Atreides family in Part One, the second part not only throws us into the world of the Fremen, but also introduces more Bene Gesserits, more Harkonnens, and the Emperor and his family. If you're familiar with the Dune book series, you'll know that these characters are quite important and need to have their time on screen. But if you're not familiar with the books, you might be wondering why there's a new character popping up on screen every few minutes.   As the world expands, Part Two is somehow both too long of a movie and too short. It became clear to me that if television shows had the budgets that movies had, these two movies would have been better served as a multi-episode series rather than two massive films. In one instance, when Paul is first learning how to survive in the desert with the Fremen, we might expect the film to go through a montage of endurance and inner strength. Instead, it cuts immediately from him preparing to face this challenge to his success a vague number of days later. These cuts make sense given the long runtime of the film, but weaken the narrative with an inconsistent timeline and achievements that are unearned.   Newly introduced characters like Princess Irulan or Feyd-Rautha barely have any personality beyond the trope they are meant to embody. Irulan acts as a privileged and emotionally distant figure who serves partially as a narrator. And though we get glimpses into Feyd-Rautha’s psychology in his time on his home planet, there is little depth to the character who simply acts as an agent of cruelty and domination. Despite marketing leaning heavily on Florence Pugh and Austin Butler’s star power, much like Dune: Part One’s Zendaya, they are in less of the movie than you might think.   In his attempt to cover the totality of Dune, Villeneuve must pack in all the universe-building that exists in Frank Herbert's books while also trying to tell a compelling story. There are scenes where one character must explain, in detail, an aspect of the universe to the other for the benefit of the audience. The result is a film that is heavy in exposition. It isn't until the final third of the movie that we rush toward the conclusion of the narrative. Up until then, the pacing of the film is inconsistent, leading to a feeling of aimlessness. It’s clear halfway through that this is not the end of Villeneuve’s storytelling. He is setting the stage for future installments of the franchise, and it’s hard to tell at this point if his gamble will pay off.   While the acting is by no means bad, it pales in comparison to the technical mastery of Dune: Part Two. Ferguson, who had such an impactful performance in Part One, is relegated to the position of a mysterious religious leader, while Chalamet must now pick up the mantle of a would-be messiah. The vague white savior vibes that Dune has always given off are still here in Part Two. No matter the complexity behind it, the optics of a white kid walking into a sea of brown people bowing to him and calling him a messiah is going to turn him into a white savior. The saving grace is Paul's own belief that his identity as a savior is merely manufactured by his mother and the other Bene Gesserit. Chani and the other younger Fremen's doubt of his position as a messiah also adds a counterpoint to the zealous believers in Paul's destiny.   With more time on-screen, Chalamet primarily shares his scenes with Zendaya, who is a bright spark as Chani. Although we only got glimpses of her in Part One, Part Two reveals that Zendaya and Chalamet lack the romantic chemistry to make the couple feel believable, and perhaps the relationship is best seen only in small amounts. Instead, Chalamet has far more exciting and electric chemistry with Austin Butler, especially when the two characters finally face off against each other in a duel in Arrakeen. Similarly, the film only gives us a bit of Irulan and Paul. For those who enjoyed Greta Gerwig's Little Women where Chalamet charmed as Laurie and Florence Pugh won our hearts as the flawed Amy, this will be a disappointing reunion. But, the promise of more interactions between the characters might be enough for fans anticipating a sequel to Part Two.   However, more time in the desert means more time on the sandworms and that turns this film into a full-on spectacle to witness. While we might have only gotten a glimpse of the sandworm riding in Part One, Part Two triples down on them. The special effects are magnificent anda masterpiece of filmmaking. Watching Paul master riding the shai-hulud (as they are called in Arrakis) is a heart-pounding experience and the masterful sound editing in Part Two is a major contributor to this as well. Villeneuve takes us into the sandstorm, putting us in Paul's shoes as he struggles to ride the massive beast, throwing the viewer into confusion and disarray with the movement of the camera. It is only after pulling away that we see his triumph from the eyes of the fellow Fremen. It's an exhilarating experience made better through the different perspectives Villeneuve employs.   While I had my criticisms of Part One's sound editing and soundtrack with its loud female vocals that sounded off like an alarm in every other scene, Part Two finds a perfect harmony in the visual and the aural. The action sequences are also a delight to watch. Whether we’re on the Harkonnen planet, bathed in black and white and among the crowd of cheering fans in a gladiatorial stadium or watching from the ground on Arrakeen as three monstrous sandworms come barreling toward us through a haboob accompanied by thousands of Fremen, it’s impossible to capture the immense scale of these scenes on a small screen.   One of the highlights of the first film was the first attack on Arrakeen, where Villeneuve matched sweeping shots of the planet with close encounters between characters within the palace. The same exists here in a parallel as we watch the Fremen launch their attack on the Harkonnen in wide shots that linger over the city to show the scale of the battle. Within the palace, the setting sun behind Paul and Feyd-Rautha as they fight makes it look like they're on fire. As much chaos as there is on the ground, there is tense control held by these two men in their fight to the death. Unlike most big-budget movies today, Villeneuve doesn't employ heavy cutting that confuses the viewer as to where the characters are. Instead, the way the camera lingers during fight sequences ratchets up the tension during the one-on-one face-off. Movies are always best enjoyed on the biggest screen, but never has a movie demanded an IMAX screen more than Dune: Part Two. Get yourself to the biggest theater you can to enjoy this.   As the movie draws to a close, it would be hard to say that there's any true tone of finality in Part Two. Instead, the sense is that this is merely the end of the beginning of Paul's story. It feels like a prequel — one where we, as the audience, should already know where Paul ends up. Villeneuve has set up a lot and I left Dune: Part Two excited for more of this story, especially with surprising cameos that hint at a fantastic future. I’ve criticized a lot of this movie, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a joy to watch on screen. Villeneuve has achieved the impossible, and I’m sure he’s converted many people into becoming Dune fans. But, I can't help but think that this is how I felt in 2021 when I first saw Part One. Will Dune: Part Two become a pivotal part of a movie franchise or a harbinger of worse things to come?

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune: Part Two is as visually stunning and epic as the first movie, wrapping up this near-perfect two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert's book with an even more impressive cast in an action-packed epic.  Where Dune: Part One felt like a prologue, this sequel feels like a more satisfying second arc. Director Denis Villeneuve dives deep into Arrakis' lore while exploring the story's central themes (from zealotry to the corruption of power and postcolonial politics) and the personal relationships that define the main character's hero-to-potential-anti-hero journey.  Following the events of Dune, the sequel follows Paul and his mother Lady Jessica as they try to find a place among the Fremen and help them free Arrakis from the Harkonnen.  The sand people are divided by their presence, with elders like Stilgar (Javier Bardem) eager to believe that Paul is the Lisan al Gaib (their long-awaited Messiah) thanks to the prophecies spread by the Bene Gesserit, and a younger generation refusing to embrace a white saviour.  In the meantime, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) observe the aftermath of the Arrakis war and the fall of House Atreides from afar, plotting alongside the Bene Gesserit's Reverend Mother Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) to remain in power.  In House Harkonnen, Feyd-Rautha, nephew of The Baron (Stellan Skarsgård), quickly becomes an important player in the conflict as his violent tendencies and ambition come to surface.  One of the essential pillars in this story is the romance between Paul and Chani, as the Atreides heir is trying to avoid his anticipated fate as a Messiah while Chani fights for her people to be free. Their connection grounds the epic and brings the human aspect forward, but it still feels occasionally flat.  As proven before in movies like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve is an absolute master of cinematic sci-fi. He is capable of bringing every piece of the puzzle together through an accessible narrative that doesn't take away from the complexities of the source material.  It takes a special talent to make the sandworm-riding scenes look so incredible. No matter how weird it gets – or how much sandworms look like a-holes – the movie always remains dignified.  Whirling around this high-fantasy maelstrom, the star-studded cast stand their ground. However, some fascinating characters like Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan, Christopher Walken's Emperor and in particular Léa Seydoux's Lady Margot Fenring don't get much screen time, eaten up by the monumental story. Hopefully we'll get to see more of them in a potential third movie.  After all, there is little doubt that Villeneuve will indeed get to adapt Dune: Messiah, Herbert's second book in the Dune saga. If Anya Taylor-Joy joining the cast is not enough indication, this terrific sequel is an unassailable argument for keeping Dune alive on the big screen for a little bit longer.  • Everything you need to know about Dune 3• Dune 2 ending explained• Dune 2 makes a major change with Alia• How long is Dune 2?• Why Dune 2 fails to address Dune's biggest issue• Is Dune 2 available to stream?• Why Dune 2 didn't bring back Thufir Hawat• Does Dune 2 have a post-credit scene?

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," What a difference a few years makes. I went into Dune (reviewed out of TIFF here) with trepidation, wondering if this would just be another grandly ambitious misfire. I walked out of that festival screening turned around on the property and actually excited to see what was next. At the same time, I did have a bit of worry in the back of my mind about the second part. Could it maintain momentum and work as well as the first one? Or, would having a little over five hours to tell Frank Herbert‘s book in total lead to bloat and perhaps even too much of a good thing? Well, I’m here to report that Dune: Part Two is none of those things. Filmmaker Denis Villeneuve has managed to improve on every aspect of Dune, which is saying something. The first part was just a great setup for a grand science fiction tale that’s also Villeneuve’s epic war film. I once again stand corrected, as my fears and worries were for nothing. Dune: Part Two manages to complete the novel’s story while raising the stakes in all regards. The action is bigger, the scale is incredible, and the actual ideas of the novel, as well as the complicated themes of religious fanaticism, come across with crystal clarity. Even if I won’t go quite as far as to call this The Empire Strikes Back for our time, those who are saying it are not completely speaking in hyperbole. Picking up where the first movie left off but with a small time jump, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has become one of the Fremen, participating in raids against House Harkonnen as he pursues vengeance for the murder of his father. Paul’s mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), cautions him that his father didn’t believe in revenge, but his thirst is strong. He’s also attracted to Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), while their leader Stilgar (Javier Bardem) believes Paul to be a messianic figure. Many of the Fremen don’t believe, but he does, seeing in Paul the way forward. While the attacks are coming, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) grows displeased and replaces Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) with  the vicious Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) as the point man on Arrakis. We also learn more about how the Baron was working under the instructions of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) to take out Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). As the Fremen build towards an epic showdown with the Harkonnen warriors, much more than Arrakis hangs in the balance. There’s a ton more going on, but that’s a good set-up, especially if you’re unfamiliar with what happens in the book. Everyone in the cast is all-in here, which is crucial. They have to say some fairly silly things, but if they didn’t take it seriously, the cards would all crumble. The commitment they display not only fits with the characters, but it serves the movie well. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are best in show, really growing into far more complex roles this time around, though Javier Bardem and Austin Butler are memorable, to say the least. Returning players like Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferguson, and Stellan Skarsgård are solid, while newcomer to the story Christopher Walken brings added gravitas. Florence Pugh is a bit underutilized but she provides a form of a framing device, while also becoming important to the third act denouement. Josh Brolin and Charlotte Rampling return in small but crucial roles, while the huge supporting cast also includes Léa Seydoux, Souheila Yacoub, and more. Director and co-writer Denis Villeneuve is in full command of his craft. The script he once again penned with Jon Spaihts feels both as part of a whole while also having its own structure. That being said, it’s technical wizardry and visuals on display that really sing. Once again, there’s impeccable work from cinematographer Greig Fraser, composer Hans Zimmer, editor Joe Walker, and production designer Patrice Vermette. The scale in Dune: Part Two is so much bigger feeling, and the first flick was plenty epic itself. Spaihts and Villeneuve have some complicated themes they’re working with but never dumb it down. Pacing wise, Villeneuve never lets up, almost as if he’s making sure we all know that he was just getting started last time around. Oscar-wise, Dune: Part Two should again be a below the line juggernaut. Best Picture remains to be seen, of course, and Best Director for Villeneuve will be very much a question mark. Look for the movie to potentially be a player in Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects. Depending on how things go, Best Adapted Screenplay for Spaihts and Villeneuve is hardly unachievable, either. It’s early, but the film could be a similar Academy favorite.  Dune: Part Two impressed me in almost all regards. Does it run the risk of being a bit silly to those who don’t dig on sci-fi? Sure, but it’s still an epic blockbuster, regardless. It should be a big hit, one of the better reviewed films of the year, and a potential awards player. What more can you ask for? If we have Dune Messiah on the table next, I won’t be a doubter. Villeneuve and company have sold me on Dune."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Dune was one of my favorite films of 2021 and almost immediately as the credits started rolling I was counting down the days until Part Two. After multiple delays due to the writers/actors strike, the epic space sequel is finally here, and boy has it been worth the wait. Dune: Part Two builds upon what the first film established, expanding and improving this deeply rich and complex universe in nearly every aspect. The visuals are stunning, the sound design and score are booming, and the story dives deeper than ever before into faith and the prophecy surrounding Paul Atreides. It’s director Denis Villeneuve who is the film’s true messiah, however. Dune: Part Two immediately continues from where the first film ended with Paul (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the Fremen after winning a duel to the death against Jamis. Following in his late father’s advice, Paul seeks to harness the power of the Fremen to get revenge against the Harkonnens and return Arrakis to the people. Meanwhile Lady Jessica continues on the path of the Bene Gesserit and fans the rumors that Paul is the Lisan al-Gaib, a prophet of legend who will lead the Fremen to paradise. Paul is determined to not follow the path laid out by his mother and generations of Bene Gesserit which he has foreseen leading to a holy war and billions of deaths, but as his powers grow he finds himself headed there regardless. Despite his best efforts war seems inevitable. Fans of Dune are without question going to love Dune: Part Two. After the success of the first film, Part Two is the result of everyone involved firing on all cylinders and delivering their best work. The story is vastly more complex and engaging as Paul comes to terms with the pressure of being this so-called prophet to the Fremen that the Bene Gesserit have laid out. He doesn’t want to be their savior because he has seen the future and the devastation that lies ahead should the prophecy come to pass. And yet his decisions inevitably lead him towards the same fate. Paul is a good fighter and leader and as he gathers wins against the Harkonnen army his legend continues to grow among the Fremen people. They want to believe he is their prophet, both because of the propaganda implanted in their minds from the Bene Gesserit and because they simply yearn for a better life. Even as Paul blatantly rejects the prophecies, there is no changing in their faith because that is exactly how the Lisan al-Gaib would react. Timothée Chalamet fully embraces Paul as well. You can see on his face the burden he carries as he sees the future that he continues to march towards regardless of his actions. He is controlled by fate, for better and worse. Even so, he is commanding as a leader as well. The passion and ferocity in his speeches is enough to make anyone believe he is their savior. Everyone except Chani that is. After what can be considered a brief cameo appearance in the first film, Zendaya delivers a strong performance as a lover, fighter, and unbeliever. As an outsider, Chani is hesitant to trust Paul initially but she sees that his intentions are good and the two quickly become lovers. Tensions rise as Paul becomes more and more in line with being the Fremen savior, however. Chani believes in herself and her people and not some lies told by those in power. She reluctantly follows because it is still the best option forward, but seeing those around her blindly put their trust in someone only puts more walls up between her and Paul. It’s the dynamic between Chalamet and Zendaya that drives Dune: Part Two. Denis Villeneuve isn’t afraid to get weird with Dune: Part Two either. The film is massive in scale. Even though it only covers the second half of the novel and it nearly three hours long, you can help but feel how dense the story is. There are a ton a new characters in addition to all of the returning ones. Austin Butler’s pyschotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is a definite standout. His introduction is absolutely stunning and takes place in an arena battle on the Harkonnen homeworld where everything is bathed by a sun so bright everything is shown in black and white. Villeneuve’s use of shadows and lines is gorgeous and hammers home how beautiful yet unsettling the Harkonnen’s can be. The rest of the film delivers with the same attention to detail as well. From the Fremen reclaiming water from fallen soldiers to the riding of sandworms, the world building of Dune: Part Two is some of the best I have ever seen. It can honestly be a little overwhelming at times. There is so much content here that even as dense as the film is, it can feel rushed as well. I would have liked to see more of the Emperor and Princess Irulan. It’s also strange with Lady Jessica having conversations with her fetus even though it makes sense within the context of the film. There is so much lore involved that it can be confusing at times and easy to miss some things. Still, between the overarching story and the gorgeous cinematography, I will have no issue with watching this movie over and over again in order to soak up every last drop of detail. Dune: Part Two is every bit as good as the first and in some parts even better. The new car smell might be gone, but the film more than makes up for it with a vastly superior story that entrances you with its beauty and world building and stellar performances from the entire cast. The spice is stronger than ever. Let’s hope that Denis Villeneuve gets the greenlight to do a third film because Dune has the potential to be one of the best trilogies of all time. Dune: Part Two builds upon what the first film established, expanding and improving this deeply rich and complex universe in nearly every aspect. The visuals are stunning, the sound design and score are booming, and the story dives deeper than ever before into faith and the prophecy surrounding Paul Atreides. It’s director Denis Villeneuve who is the film’s true messiah, however."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Dune&#58; Part 2 is the year&apos;s first great film&#44; and you won&apos;t see a bigger or better blockbuster all year&#46;&#46;&#46; a sophisticated sci-fi masterpiece&#44; an instant classic&#44; and an unprecedented sequel&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Director Denis Villeneuve returns to finish the spectacle he started, reuniting with a stacked cast led by Timothée Chalamet in Dune: Part Two. The result is a stirring piece of grown-up sci-fi, delivering huge amounts of spectacle, writes Matt Glasby. If the first rule of sequels is that they need to be bigger than the original, then Denis Villeneuve’s second stab at Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel might be the biggest ever made. Running at a whopping 166 minutes—just under three hours—and concerning the battle for an entire planet, it’s an absolute behemoth. Dune: Part Two deals with huge topics such as faith and fundamentalism, empire and sovereignty, and its hero, Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet), gains at least two names along the way. It’s so huge you feel it ought to have an intermission like they used to in the 1980s. Or perhaps the 15-month wait between movies was an intermission and Dune should be viewed as a 321-minute epic cut in two. The plot goes something like this. With the desert planet of Arrakis in the hands of the evil Harkonnen dynasty, Paul and his pregnant mum Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) hide among the Fremen, led by Stilgar (Javier Bardem). While she becomes the Reverend Mother—a kind of holy seer—he learns how to survive in desert, has disturbing visions and gets close to Chani (Zendaya). But is he really the chosen one, destined to free them all? And if so, can he win the battle for hearts and minds before defeating the Harkonnen? If all this sounds too confusing, it is. At least most of the bad guys are bald and painted white, so fairly easy to spot. Who Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Lady Margaret Fenring (Lea Seydoux) are is rather harder to establish. Meanwhile, characters who we thought were dead return, and others prove to be connected in unexpected ways. Villeneuve and co-screenwriter Jon Spaihts do their best to keep us in the loop, but it’s a lot to take in, perhaps too much for one film. The cast is similarly stacked—so much so that even the unborn characters are famous. Chalamet does well in a demanding role, moving convincingly from gap year twat to revolutionary leader, while sidestepping the worst white-saviour accusations. “I’m not here to lead, I’m here to learn your ways, let me fight alongside you that’s all I’m asking,” he begs Chani. After a kickass start, Ferguson is relegated to doing witchy stuff in the background; but Zendaya is suitably fierce as a woman who’s suspicious of false prophets, but is also falling in love with one. Bardem, meanwhile, is what gravitas would look like if it had slept rough for a month, and gets the film’s best, and perhaps only, laugh as he lists all the things that can kill you in the desert, from sandworms to spiders, centipedes to evil spirits—basically everything. The bad guys have much more fun. In the kingdom of the baldies, Walken is the picture of magnificently coiffed, oddly cadenced charisma; Dave Bautista’s Glossu Rabban Harkonnen smashes faces against monitors in cold fury; and Austin Butler is all shark eyes and lethal cheekbones as sadistic perv Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen—a role made famous by Sting in his big blue budgie-smugglers. Villeneuve is a director at the top of his game, and he marshals a talented team. Cinematographer Grieg Fraser’s visuals are stunning; Patrice Vermette’s production design makes everything feel textured and real; and there’s an integrity to the way the film-makers commit to the world of the film. The setpieces are especially striking. The maddest—in magisterial black and white—introduces Butler’s character at a gladiatorial contest styled like the largest Nazi rally ever held. When Paul surfs a grandfather sandworm—the biggest of its kind, naturally—we see him dashing across the top of the dunes in quasi-silhouette, the thumper (a device for calling sandworms) filling the soundtrack like a panicky heartbeat. An opening skirmish, shot in the dip-dyed red of the desert sun, is a masterclass in simmering tension. If there’s a criticism to be made, it’s that, at times, it all runs the risk of being a little too much. Too much mystical blah and po-faced politicking; too much of Hans Zimmer’s patented droning and wailing; too much of too many good things. Dune: Part Two has, deservedly, been mentioned in the same breath as The Empire Strikes Back (not least because it features an emperor striking back), but viewers would be forgiven for needing a little Return of The Jedi too—not necessarily the full teddy bears’ picnic, just a little levity to grease the wheels of endless grandeur; a touch more human emotion to ground all the interplanetary intrigue. But these are minor quibbles in face of a staggering achievement; a stirring piece of grown-up sci-fi delivering more spectacle than you’d see in several ordinary blockbusters stitched together. If it only wins our minds, not our hearts, it’s still one hell of a battle."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Immense, remarkably captivating, imposing, and right on the edge of overblown, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune: Part Two” is a spectacular blockbuster epic in the grandest sense of the tradition. Picking up where ‘Part One’ left off, this darker, bleaker, moodier sequel is a grand war movie but also a devastating cautionary tale about messiahs, idolatry, and the dangers of false gods. Likened to “Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,” with apologies to George Lucas, his film is a simple defeat and setback to the valiant heroes. And ‘Part Two’ is much more complex; a tragedy that is much more brutalist and morally complex, making the audience squirm in the way they’re faced with reexamining their sympathies for the protagonists, their questionable purpose, and dubious beliefs. Villeneuve’s escalating sense of scale and emotional stakes are enormous, his craft impeccable, and the film’s visceral intensity radiates and growls like a raging supernova star about to implode; imagine if one were to mash “Lawrence Of Arabia” and ‘LOTR’s The Two Towers’ together into an unholy mystical sci-fi alliance. Verging on overwrought at times, Villeneuve manages to ride the sandworm lightning beyond the thundering abyss that always seems to be on each side of his stunning creations (and those sandworm scenes are jaw-dropping and gargantuan). Reminiscent of the way Zack Snyder always goes maximum-effort operatic, but with a sense of discerning taste, Villeneuve’s film is ultimately awe-inspiring and an immersive cinematic spectacle that is often breathtaking. Villeneuve’s inaugural film began with the enigmatic quote, “Dreams are messages from the deep,” an allusion to the prophetic and sometimes nightmarish hallucinatory visions that young Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) begins to experience once he’s subjected to the mystical spice of the desert planet of Arrakis. ‘Part Two’ launches with “Power over spice is power over all,” an ominous admonition about subjugation and where misguided paths to revenge and power can lead. And this is where it gets complicated for the conflicted and troubled Atreides, who grapples with internal struggles about duty, vengeance, and cataclysmic prophecies throughout. “Dune” ended in catastrophe for House Atreides; a sneak attack from the Harkkonen and the Emperor laid waste to their empire. The film was essentially an impressive palace intrigue drama, a noble family and leader whose blind loyalty to the call of duty—even when they sensed something underhanded and amiss—was their undoing. In ‘Part Two,’ having witnessed this terror, facing some of his initial fears, and becoming integrated with the indigenous guerilla warfare warriors of the Fremen, Atreides is now looking to avenge his father and family name. But heavy is the head that wears the would-be crown of thorns, and Paul’s journey in chapter two is the burden of prescience, regnant control, and the price of playing God. But the lengths he’ll go to foresee the future in his quest and the costs encumbered along this odyssey are laced with dangerous precedent that could unleash the jihad holy war that has haunted his dreams. Jeopardy and peril lie on all sides of his venture, and Atreides—seen as a potentially chosen one the people of Arrakis have been waiting on for centuries—must thread a very small needle for any chance of hope or success. Exacerbating issues are his tenuous relationship with the Fremen and his outsider status. Half of the Fremen believe Atreidis to be the messiah their prophecies foretold, while others view him with disdainful skepticism. And his mother, the now-pregnant Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), fearing for Paul and the safety of her unborn child, schemes far more than ever, stoking the fires of religious fervor in the devout sections of the Fremen population in order to secure their foothold of safety Atreidis takes on the adopted moniker of Muad’Dib, the Fremen name for the desert mouse found on Arrakis. It’s an appellation that evokes something humble but belies his growing confidence and his need for retribution. Duplicity, hidden agendas, and treachery were already a vast component of the political machinations of “Dune”—Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) and the Padishah Emperor both conspired with the Harkonnen Imperium to thwart and undermine the House of Atreides rule on Arrakis in the first chapter— but trying to chart them all here would be a fool’s errand. Suffice it to say, the jealous and insecure emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken) and his ambassadorial daughter Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), finally come out of the shadows and onto the chess board, and the wicked Harkonnens, Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård), Glossu Rabban (Dave Bautista), and newcomer Feyd-Rautha (a menacing Austin Butler), are as merciless and cruel as ever. Allies are far, few and between, but the once-unconvinced Stilgar (Javier Bardem), leader of the Fremen tribe at Sietch Tabr, finally becomes a full-blown believer in Paul, and Atreides loyalist Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) returns to the fold, after a brief turn as spice smuggler (newcomers fit into the ensemble perfectly, and “Dune: Part Two” features one of the most stellar casts on screen in recent memory, but newcomers like Pugh and Butler are arguably the standouts). But the true enemy is within: the ill-advised lust for vengeance, the desperation for control, the hubristic desire to fathom the uncertain future, and the blinding arrogance of believing your own hype. If the moral clarity in “Dune” seemed faultless, “Part Two” perhaps casts all interlopers of Arrakis as potential would-be oppressors, the indigenous Fremen perhaps the only truly empathetic people worth a damn at the heart of its story. It’s what Herbert would have wanted (and intended), but it’s a bold choice for mainstream audiences to experience— these road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-intentions thematics at its center. And maybe this sprawl of big concepts—love, survival, inner conflict, retribution, holy wars, political conspiracy, messianic complexes, and prophetic divinations— is where ‘Part Two’ starts to buckle and perhaps get a bit unwieldy. Co-written by Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts, if ‘Part Two’ falters anywhere, it’s perhaps just in the sheer colossal scale and scope of the film. At two hours and 45 minutes, you feel the runtime, and the theatrical drama begins to sag a little in the back half, especially when your empathy towards the heroes is weathered. Additionally, the faction of critics who often charge Villeneuve with a humorless and self-serious approach will have even more ammo in this regard. ‘Part Two’ is grim, bleak, and arguably joyless. But what Villeneuve lacks in humor, he more than makes up with muscular craft, visceral intensity, and dynamic visual rapture."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Given the weight and scope of Frank Herbert’s Dune, Denis Villeneuve’s decision to split his adaptation of the 1965 epic science-fiction novel into multiple parts not only makes sense, but it also allows for a clean division at the moment the story tips over from a narrative rooted in court intrigue and hostile power plays redolent of Old World Europe into one steeped in a lysergic blend of ecological fable and Islamic mysticism. The first film ended with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) escaping from a coup that left his ducal father dead and House Atreides’s hopes for control of the planet Arrakis shattered by their noble rivals, the Harkonnens. Left in Arrakis’s vast desert with his mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Paul falls in with the indigenous Fremen people, who view him as their possible messiah in a fight to regain control of their colonized planet and its invaluable spice resource. While the first film is full of intercut images displaying Paul’s bourgeoning psychic powers, Dune: Part Two becomes increasingly detached from material reality as Paul’s visions grow in intensity. Akin to the structure of Villeneuve’s Arrival, the film regularly shows glimpses from later in the story that slowly come into narrative focus as Paul catches up with his premonitions. The second film largely remains true to the aesthetic of the first, with the muted color palette regarding the vast dimensions of palatial homes and the Fremen’s underground network with an almost clinical detachment. This is a surprising route to take for material that many adore for its psychedelic dream logic, but there’s a sharpness and purpose to Villeneuve’s approach. The director doesn’t play up the oddity of Herbert’s setting but its history, conveying the many thousands of years of human life between our own time and the novel’s in order to lend the various political systems at war with each other more significance and legitimacy. That’s not to say that Dune: Part Two dispenses with imaginative designs. The costumes are memorable for their mix of styles and how they draw on the ancient past, as in the Fremen’s desert shawls and the burqa coverings of the Bene Gesserit witches. Elsewhere, the dragonfly-shaped ornithopters and skittering spice-mining vehicles almost suggest they’ve evolved into being, recalling the massive millipede-like creatures from Miyazaki Hayao’s Nausicäa of the Valley of the Wind. The film also conveys the vastness of the novel’s setting through precision craftsmanship on a gargantuan scale, as in the way locations and vehicles dwarf the characters. This factors into the film’s action, which depicts the outnumbered and technologically inferior Fremen’s effective asymmetrical warfare through ingenious framings. The Fremen take advantage of the land they intimately know to ambush Harkonnen troops, and they often trigger explosions of sand that blind their foes to further even the odds. Despite such visual obfuscations, battle scenes never lose track of the Fremen’s methodical, brutal attack patterns. Frequently, the camera pulls out to show a vehicle or building being destroyed by rocket fire that backlights the battlefield in gouts of flame at the horizon point of the frame. Neither David Lynch’s Dune nor SyFy’s miniseries came close to capturing the awe-inspiring terror of Arrakis’s colossal sandworms, which here burst from the ground in volcanic eruptions of sand and so radically disrupt the landscape that watching them roll along the surface is like seeing billions of years of tectonic shift compressed into seconds. In a time when so many blockbusters mistake grandiosity for scale but limit their own spectacle with flat, open-matte compositions crafted in post-production, Villeneuve’s Dune films offer an object lesson in the visual splendor made possible by meticulously storyboarded minimalist maximalism. Amid this spectacle, the actors never get lost in the shuffle. Paul Atreides isn’t an easy role to play (it defeated a young Kyle MacLachlan back in 1984), operating simultaneously as a vulnerable young man thrust prematurely into great responsibility, a confident warrior king, and a horrified Cassandra unable to alter the terrible consequences of his fate. Chalamet never overplays any aspect of Paul’s motivations: He so subtly weaves together the character’s terror of becoming a religious figure and willingness to play on the Fremens’ increasing belief in him for his own gain that it’s impossible to tell where the young man stops fighting his destiny and where he starts warping his erstwhile respect for the Fremen into a new form of subjugation. Ferguson matches Chalamet’s conviction, fully leaning into Jessica’s most manipulative qualities, especially in the way her interactions with the Fremen work to massage their faith into zealotry. Equally impressive, Austin Butler cuts a terrifying profile as Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha. Lips ink-stained like a feudal Japanese courtesan, he grins as if through a mouth full of blood, his head bobbing and darting quizzically, suggesting a bird of prey sizing up a meal. Butler gives Feyd a nakedly feral quality that contrasts with the more calculating evil of his uncle, Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård, doubling down on his oozing contempt from the prior film).  Zendaya has the least flashy main role as Paul’s Fremen love interest, Chani, but the character comes across far more studious and aware of her paramour’s mounting bloodlust than she does in the book. Indeed, Zendaya gives the material a moral core that it otherwise lacks, most evident in Chani’s ambivalent reaction to her people’s corrupted quest for independence. Throughout Dune: Part Two, the actors channel the strangeness of the novel that’s otherwise muted by Villeneuve’s aesthetic approach. But if his adaptation looks relatively sedate compared to the oddities of Lynch’s version or the putative concept art of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s treatment for his unmade adaptation, Villeneuve merely weaves the novel’s unnerving, untameable intensity the surface of his film like a sandworm. All of the contradictions of the material are still there, but they now exist in a harmony that not even Herbert achieved.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," An incredibly innovative film, with jaw-dropping visuals, powerful performances, an impeccable score, and complex themes, Dune Part II is the closest a blockbuster has been to perfection since The Lord of the Rings. Denis Villeneuve is at the top of his directing powers with Dune. Considered one of the most unadaptable science fiction novels of all time, Villeneuve feels uniquely attuned to bring it to life given his track record and visual language. Coming off of films like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, his two Dune films may very well be his best work yet.  Dune Part II completes the second half of Frank Herbert’s epic and the film feels every bit as impressive. Led by an ensemble of talented actors like Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem and Austin Butler, Dune Part II has no shortage of the best of Hollywood’s talent. In many ways, the cast treats Dune as if they are on set of The Lord of the Rings. The chance to be a part of a sci-fi fantasy film series that will live on for generations a jewel of the genre is too good to pass up. This pays off spades as each actor brings out their best performance, particularly with Chalamet. While readers of the novel won’t be too surprised by the character arc of Paul Atreides, Chalamet plays that arc with a sense of bleakness that carries the film with a unique voice. Less of the Frodo or Luke Skywalker archetype that film might fake-out the audiences with in Part I, Paul Atreides comes across as present danger in the midst of his heroism in the latest installment. As the Fremen of planet Arrakis debate whether Paul fits the prophecy to ultimately free them, there is a looming sense of destruction ahead. In Part I, flash forwards are briefly shown to the audience featuring Atreides leading armies and conquering worlds. Part II follows up on these premonitions and Paul’s ultimate character arc comes to a crescendo. There are many reasons why Dune is considered difficult to adapt. Whether it’s the surreal sci-fi elements hard to translate on screen or  the dreamlike future installments to come, the series requires an incredibly strong director and cast to put it together. With Villeneuve and Chalamet leading, Hollywood found its perfect pairing.  The supporting cast of Dune Part II is phenomenal as well. Zendaya, playing the character of Chani, is more of a co-star to Chalamet rather than a supporting star. She plays the role with a somber strength and is vibrant on screen. Rebecca Ferguson is particularly fantastic in the film, playing Paul’s mother, Jessica. As her character becomes fully engrossed in the prophecy of her son and uses her abilities as a Bene Gesserit to manipulate others, Ferguson effortlessly blends a motherly instinct to protect with a frightening and powerful aura to destroy. Simply put, she stole every scene she was in. Austin Butler is also a standout as Feyd-Rautha. A highly coveted role, Butler loses himself in the role and plays an incredible antagonist. In a film series where the lines of good and evil are blurred and no one is altruistic, Butler’s character is a welcome sense of pure dread. Bardem, Brolin, Pugh, Bautista, and Seydoux all shine as well. Technically, Dune Part II is unmatched in comparison to recent blockbusters. Where most big-budget films from Marvel and DC look to maximize profit by appealing to the lowest common dominator of audiences, Dune feels like a product of a bygone era. The VFX has a level of polish that hasn’t been seen since The Lord of the Rings, the prequel Star Wars Trilogy, or Pirates of the Caribbean. The score by Hans Zimmer has gravitas and weight, a far cry from the mostly forgettable scores of today’s blockbusters. The cinematography and shot structure is incredibly grand, a credit to Greig Fraser being one of the best in the business. Expect Dune Part II to be well-represented during the next awards season. In an era of Hollywood where blockbusters have largely felt like fast food, Dune Part II feels like it was made to be art instead of content. Pending a strong box office performance, here’s hoping all studios return to form and make films with this level of craft and care.  While Dune Part II is a masterpiece and brilliant from a technical, storytelling, and performance perspective, it is also not without an inherent flaw. For a series that is heavily inspired by Arab culture and Islamic themes, there’s a severe lack of Middle Eastern or North African representation. While you may see some MENA actors in the background as extras, there is no excuse to not cast someone Arab in a film series that borrows clothing, words, themes, and more from Arab culture. This is exasperated given the crisis in Palestine and Hollywood’s overall lack of empathy on the issue. The industry is still very behind on Arab and Muslim representation on screen and sadly Dune was another missed opportunity. Overall, Dune Part II is a cinematic achievement. The film is a collection of some of the best filmmakers, actors, composers, and artists coming together to create a true masterpiece. Like The Lord of the Rings, Villeneuve’s Dune films are destined to stand the test of time."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Is Dune: Part Two safe for kids? Is Dune: Part Two OK for kids? Read the Dune: Part Two Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, an honest parents guide and mom review of the all-new Warner Bros. Pictures Dune 2 sci-fi fantasy adventure film sequel Dune: Part Two 2024, starring Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and Zendaya as Chani. No spoilers! #DunePartTwo May contain commissioned links. Award winning, all-star casting, ambitiously thrilling – even with slow source material and an admittedly slower book-to-film story adaptation – there’s a lot riding on director Denis Villeneuve to carry Dune: Part Two into a sequel worthy of the fandom’s acceptance. In the highly anticipated 3-year follow-up film sequel to the 6-time Academy Award winning Dune 2021 starring some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, Dune 2 is finally here. And the spice is up for grabs. In this Dune: Part Two Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, I’m breaking down the visuals, the story, a full PG-13 age rating explanation for violence, adult themes and language, and what kids’ age recommendation is suggested to watch in this new 2024 Dune: Part Two parents guide to the new Warner Bros. Pictures live action sci-fi adventure film sequel. A no-spoiler parent review of Dune: Part Two 2024, can Dune 2 visually thrill fans – again? Dune: Part Two is more than a visual feast. It’s a whole sensory experience. Spanning vast desert landscapes to costume pageantry to audio vibrations that are pulsating throughout the film like a living, breathing character of the movie itself, there is no argument from me that Dune 2 shatters visual effects and CGI enhancements for a full-on immersive viewing rivaling that of Avatar: The Way of Water, Lord of the Rings, or Interstellar. Breathtakingly beautiful. Audio disclosure: I caution that those sensitive to strong vibrations, loud and low tone audio sensations and sensory processing issues may want to skip this film and/or watch in the comfort of home. The sound enhancements are quite a feat for this Dune: Part Two sequel, however at times even I was overstimulated by the loudness and length of some of the auditory sequences. That being said, I highly recommend that fans upgrade their viewing experience to see this Dune sequel in IMAX. It is definitely worth the cost to for full surround sound and visual depth to watch. Photosensitivity Warning. For viewers prone to epilepsy and photosensitivity, there are a few scenes with bright flashing and/or strobing lights. One scene has background flashes – similar to lightning strikes and fireworks – that occur down a dark hallway, about one-third of the way through the film. Another scene occurs after a character ingests a liquid – with bright flashes of light and images of zoomed in faces quickly passing. The Dune saga continues as returning director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival“) embarks on the sequel “Dune: Part Two,” the next chapter of Frank Herbert’s celebrated 1965 novel series. The cast includes new and returning stars Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka”) as Paul Atreides, Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home”) as Chani, Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”) as Lady Jessica, Josh Brolin (“Avengers: Endgame”) as Gurney Halleck, Austin Butler (“Elvis”) as Feyd-Rautha, Florence Pugh (“Black Widow”) as Princess Irulan, Dave Bautista (“Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise) as Beast Rabban, Christopher Walken (“Hairspray”) as Emperor Shaddam IV, Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise) as Lady Margot, Souheila Yacoub (“Climax”), along with Stellan Skarsgård (“Good Will Hunting“) as The Baron, Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years”), and Javier Bardem (“Lyle, Lyle Crocodile”) as Stilgar. The follow-up to 2021’s six-time Oscars® award-winning film “Dune,” Dune: Part Two is the long anticipated sequel film covering the second half of the first book of Frank Hebert’s 1965 Dune Chronicles. (Try saying that three times fast.) Picking up immediately where the first Dune movie ends, we join Paul Atreides and his mother on their journey with the Fremen – filled with grief and revenge while also discovering love and foreseeing the possibility of hope. Thankfully, this Dune 2 sequel focuses less on landscape building and character development and more on the climactic action and storyline. Zendaya and Timothée’s chemistry on-screen is passionate and convincing but it’s Austin Butler’s performance depth that sold me. A pleasant surprise for the slight uptick in the usual slow pacing and dry source material, Dune fans will appreciate the care that director Villeneuve takes in bringing this first chapter of Dune to a close – using full visual and audio enhancements for explosive results. Throw in a few unexpected jokes, a surprising cameo, and an ending twist from the 1984 original film – and we may have a rare spice in the desert – and perhaps an even rarer sequel that the entertainment world has not seen in many years. Is Dune: Part Two safe for kids? A Dune 2 sequel rated PG-13? Should parents be concerned? It’s no secret that I am highly skeptical of all MPAA ratings (um hello, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not disclosing any language??). And as we know, not all movie and TV age ratings are the same. As a parent, it’s been rather heartbreaking to witness how ratings have shifted over the years with a G-rating no longer an option to help guide parents. PG ratings now oscillating between Turning Red intense to Christopher Robin calm, and even PG-13/TV-14 age ratings teetering on the edge of R or MA ratings (Moon Knight and Werewolf by Night, I see you!), there’s a wide range between the age of 0-14 years old for parents to consider. Having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or show is kid friendly – and safe for the whole family to watch together. Why is Dune: Part Two rated PG-13? In this Dune: Part Two Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, this 2024 sci-fi Dune 2 film sequel from Warner Bros. Pictures is rated PG-13 for “sequences of strong violence, brief strong language, and some suggestive material.” With film and TV ratings also unpredictable these days, having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or television show like Dune: Part Two is kid friendly. Is Dune: Part Two too scary for kids? Is Dune: Part Two not for kids? Let’s breakdown that PG-13 age rating in this Dune: Part Two parents guide. Violence/Suspense. Dune: Part Two violence and suspense is on par with the first film with the addition of added sci-fi “war” scenes. Expect lots of fist fighting, hand-to-hand combat with knives, kill shots and slit throats (one very prominent scene that may be triggering), deaths and inferred deaths, bone crunching noises, sci-fi creatures and human-like monsters/deformities, minimal animal and monster violence and death, anger and revenge, and a variety of weapons and machinery including guns, knives and explosive devices. Expect moderate amounts of blood and gore (again on par with the original Dune 2021 film) with the addition of vomit noises and visuals. There are also multiple video shots of a fetus in different stages – this may be triggering for some. There is also more medical instruments and devices used – including needle injections tubing and violent convulsion/seizure like movements. Adult Themes. There is a mild use of drug and smoking content in Dune: Part Two A character smokes from a huge “bong” like device in a couple of scenes. There are visuals and dialogue reflecting characters being “drugged,” with stumbling present. There are multiple scenes inferring intentional first person poisoning. There is one mention of acting “drunk.” Other adult themes include the toilet dialogue of “drinking his warm piss” and many religious ceremonies and pageantry referring to prophecy, prayer, and worship of a “messiah” like figure. As stated above there are many images and video of fetuses in various stages throughout the film that may be triggering for some. Did someone say Dune Part: Two sex scene?! Some suggestive material and sensual innuendo is a new realm in the Dune: Part Two sequel. Sexual content in Dune: Part Two includes one fully naked body seen from the backside (not fully human in form but the nudity intention is there), one scene of two characters panting with one character laying on top of the other while talking (nudity sex scene implied but not shown) – scene shown of characters from chest and up, multiple kisses between characters, professions of “love,” being “sexually vulnerable” and implied relations/pregnancies between characters – including possible incest. Language. Should parents be concerned about the brief strong language in Dune: Part Two? Foul language phrases and swear words include: 2 “sh!t,” and 1 “H-E-double-hockey-sticks.” Milder bad language phrases and insults in Dune: Part Two include: “stupid,” “morons,” “psychotic,” “holy mother,” “hate,” “piss,” “demon,” and “g-d.” Overall, Dune 2 is very light on language – similar to the first film. With a runtime of 2 hours 46 minutes, this Dune: Part Two 2024 film runs a little long but feels even longer. Long ritual sequences and longer dialogue scenes may drag for young kids. Violence is rampant throughout. The addition of new sexual content may also sway parents from allowing kids to see this sequel.However, the addition of added action/war scenes, explosive elements, audio and visual enhancements, and a somewhat faster paced story with interesting new characters may entice little Dune fans. And if your kids have already watched and loved the first movie Dune: Part Two is a no-brainer must see. Dune: Part Two is most like the the original Dune 2021 science fiction film after the 1965 Frank Hebert sci-fi novel – inspiring films like Star Wars and The Matrix. This 2024 sci-fi Dune 2 film sequel from Warner Bros. Pictures is rated PG-13 for “sequences of strong violence, brief strong language, and some suggestive material” by the MPAA. No, there is no mid credit scene in Dune: Part Two which is on par with the first film. I thought the director may have slipped in a little something for the end of the first Dune Chronicles book, sadly there’s nothing extra for Dune fans.  Based on my Dune: Part Two parents guide and mom review above, I would not recommend Dune: Part Two to kids younger than the age of 12-13 years old. With multiple scenes depicting graphic violence and suspense, along with language, Dune: Part Two is a sci-fi fantasy film sequel that is the next level above more kid friendly sci-fi films like Star Wars. I advise parents to prescreen the film for strong violence and new sensual content added into this sequel.Considering the full PG-13 age rating breakdown above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Dune: Part Two to kids younger than the age of 12-13 years old. This Dune: Part Two PG-13 rating is pretty spot on and comparable to the first Dune 2021 film (plus the addition of sexual innuendo). If your kids have seen the first Dune movie, they will most likely enjoy the end of the first book to film adaptation. A slow yet spicy sequel that is ultimately a full sensory experience, I daresay that Dune: Part Two is one of the rare film sequels that is better than the predecessor. While still slowly paced and relatively reflective of the dry source material, the addition of extra explosive action sequences and CGI elements as well as the introduction of strong supporting characters (how amazing is Austin Butler’s performance range?) really stretches this film into more than a cult franchise, but a religious experience that honors the breadth of influence of the 1965 sci-fi fantasy book. Full disclosure, I’m not a Dune hype girl. I don’t understand the fandom of folks who “struggled” fifteen times to get through the first book – but still love the movie. What I can appreciate is how a 1965 book series laid the foundation for so many sci-fi and fantasy film premises that we have loved and appreciated over the years – still do. And how Dune finally has the spotlight (not the 1984 version) to shine on it’s own merit. Exhale. Dune: Part Two is surprisingly satisfying for fandom and movie lovers alike. And Dune: Part Two will be a sci-fi fantasy film pillar that will continue to be influential for decades to come. Which begs the audience to ask…Will there be a Dune 3? While I don’t foresee director Denis Villeneuve coming back for a reboot, I definitely see the saga continuing in the hands of Warner Bros. Pictures. But anything less than this Dune caliber would be a huge mistake. I was invited to screen Warner Bros.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Villeneuve has fully realized his dream of adapting Frank Herbert&apos;s beloved novel with the profoundness&#44; respect&#44; and scale it deserves in a tour de force of filmmaking we rarely see anymore&#46; This is why we go to the movies&#46;
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Denis Villenueve‘s highly-acclaimed 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert‘s 1965 sci-fi novel ended on a cliffhanger that may have thrown a few people off, who were otherwise appreciating the grand spectacle of it all. The movie went on to win six Oscars, all in below-the-line crafts categories, as fans chomped at the bit for its conclusion, which was delayed by last year’s strikes. When last we left Timothée Chalamet‘s Paul Atreides and his mother, Lady Jessica, (Rebecca Ferguson), they had joined up with the wary Fremen in the desert wastelands of the planet Arrakis. The planet’s indigenous people have begun to accept the outsiders, Jessica even being asked to become the Reverend Mother for the tribe, while Paul is thought by many to be the “Mahdi” aka the Messiah. In other words, white saviorship is mostly alive and well on Arrakis. After wiping out Paul’s family, the Harrokens’  next war is with the Fremen, who have made their harvesting of the planet’s precious “spice” nearly impossible. Considering that the previous chapter ended in a relatively disappointing way, it’s surprising that Part 2 can start in the exact same place and find a way to make it far more interesting by delving further into faith and spirituality, while making a commentary on the impact of globalization on indigenous societies, while also taking cues from the situation in the Middle East. Some of this stuff was in Herbert’s novel for sure, but Villeneuve and his co-writer Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) have found ways of instilling elements of what’s going on in the world these days to make the story of Dune feel so much more relevant to our own times, and not necessarily “science fiction.” Part 2 wisely puts more attention on Paul and his mother, and their relationship with Fremen like Zendaya‘s Chani, essentially a glorified love interest, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the tribe with whom Paul and his mother settle. They both bring so much more to their characters than we were able to see in Part 1. This also creates quite a contrast to when, an hour into the movie, we finally meet Austin Butler‘s Feyd-Rautha, the sadistic younger nephew to Stellan Skarsgård‘s Baron Harkonnen, and the film begins alternating between Arrakis and the homeworld, building to a final confrontation. Those who saw David Lynch‘s 1984 take on Dune might remember that the character was played by pop star Sting, but Butler brings an overwhelming ruthlessness to the character that makes his scenes pop. Maybe the eventual confrontation between Feyd-Rautha and Paul might seem like somewhat of a letdown, but it is done in a better way than in the Lynch movie, where the fight was over and done in mere minutes. (The Emperor, played commendably by Christopher Walken, and his daughter, played by Florence Pugh, appear in a prologue of the film but don’t appear much in the film until the third act.) There’s little question that Villeneuve may be one of the top filmmakers on the planet  (Earth, that is) right now, his mastery of all aspects of cinema evident from every decision made in concluding this chapter of his Dune. The sequel ends up being even more gorgeous than the first part with all of Villeneuve’s below-the-line collaborators upping their game, especially when it comes to the film’s color palette, which goes from the red and browns of Arrakis to a striking black-and-white sequence involving Feyd-Rautha fighting in a Gladiator-style stadium fight. This is one of those films where every scene will cause the viewer’s jaw to drop, and thankfully, there won’t be options to see it on television sets and iPads (hopefully) for many, many months. As well as the first part of Dune did theatrically – despite the ongoing pandemic and a concurrent streaming release on HBO Max – Part 2 is going to benefit greatly from the first part being so readily available to watch over the last two years, including a recent theatrical re-release. Dune: Part 2 has to be one of the most anticipated movies of the year in a box office that’s been stagnating from a lack of strong, new releases. Some may be disappointed that Part 2 once again ends on a cliffhanger, and it might be even longer for the next chapter, but Dune Part 2 offers so much rewatchability, it should have a strong presence in theaters for most of March into April. Dune: Part 2 is a bonafide masterpiece that delivers on the promise of the first movie, while adding so much more in terms of layers and depth. It will be shocking if this is not front and center in many Oscar races a year from now. Awards Potential: This is going to be a huge Oscar player, not just with similar below-the-line nominations and wins as the first movie, but Villeneuve should get nominated both for his directing and for his adaptation with Jon Spaihts, as well as another Best Picture nomination. Austin Butler stands the best chance at a supporting acting nod, but for the rest of the year, this will be the movie that all others are compared.
Box Office Potential: As with awards, this is going to be HUGE. One of the top grossers of the year worldwide.
Renewability: Dune: Chapter Three (aka Dune Messiah) will definitely happen. It might take five years or more, but Warner Bros. should pay Villeneuve whatever he wants.

"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," Every few years, a film arrives that becomes the cinematic event of the calendar year. In 2008, Iron Man was released, and the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe began. Since then, the blueprint for studios has included a known intellectual property that guaranteed box office success. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, there has been a change in the types of generational films attracting cinephiles. There is no better example than 2023 and Barbenheimer, as it was not just the cinematic event of the year but also one of the most critical events in cinema history. While Barbie is a known entity, the film was a fresh and inspired story. At the same time, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer was the crowning achievement of the year as it not only became the highest-grossing biopic of all time but showed that if a great filmmaker builds it, cinephiles will come. With that being said, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune laid the foundation for the beginning of a new expanded universe not seen since a galaxy far, far away, and with Dune: Part Two finally here, it was impossible not to be excited for a return trip to Arrakis. Dune: Part Two is Denis Villeneuve’s Empire Strikes Back & Lawrence of Arabia. It is a sci-fi opera that is grand in scale with a hypnotizing and emotionally devastating story. Austin Butler will be a talking point for many, but Timothée Chalamet left my jaw on the floor. Villeneuve’s immersive cinematic nirvana is a sci-fi masterpiece.  Dune: Part Two picks up where its predecessor left off as Paul Atreides continues on his journey of self-discovery. As Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen, he seeks revenge against those who wronged him and eliminated his family and, along the way, accepts his rightful place as the Muad’Dib. Writer/director Denis Villeneuve and his co-writer Jon Spaihts’ screenplay follow suit with the first entry as the duo honors Herbert’s novel with a fully immersive experience into the world of Dune. While the first entry was quite a reflective piece, Dune: Part Two rewards a cinephile’s patience with a grandiose exodus into war, corruption, and sandworms. Another award-worthy work by cinematographer and Academy Award winner, Greig Fraser, aids Villeneuve’s vision. Fraser’s Oscar-winning work on the first entry was followed up with a mesmerizing lens on The Batman, and with Dune Part Two, Fraser offers another masterclass as his cinematic eye mirrors the cinematographic space of Lawrence of Arabia. Has sand ever looked better than when Fraser shoots it? I think not. After winning the Academy Award for Best Original Score, Hans Zimmer returns with a score that creates an epic sound that matches the technical marvel and magnitude of a film like Dune Part Two requires. His work on the first film was one of my favorites of the legend’s career, and there’s little question that this score will not only be on repeat but should land the award-winning composer another Oscar nomination at the 97th Academy Awards. Timothée Chalamet continues to cement himself as one of this generation’s best actors. His iteration of Paul Atreides is not just haunting, but it screams “movie star.” His charisma and charm are infectious, and by the film’s conclusion, Chalamet embraces Paul’s journey to perfection! It may be my favorite Chalamet performance thus far. Complementing Chalamet is the rich supporting ensemble that may be the year’s best. The always-reliable Rebecca Ferguson is excellent, while Zendaya is given much more to work with. In turn, she shows how immensely talented she is. With her Emmy-winning work on Euphoria and Dune Part Two, Zendaya continues to carve out a place as one of Hollywood’s best young actresses. While Academy Award winner Javier Bardem was provided a stoic and quiet take in the first film, he gives the film some surprising light-hearted moments that are sure to evoke some laughs from cinephiles. Along with laughs, Bardem’s performance can also be viewed as the most fear inducing. Why? Bardem channels a very real look at an ideology in today’s current society and by the films conclusion, it will be both hard to ignore or not discussed. As a fan of Lynch’s Dune. There’s no denying that Sting’s Feyd was one of the talking points of that film. Denis’ Dune is no different as Academy Award nominee Austin Butler carves up a delicious villainous treat for all cinephiles to devour. There’s not a moment where Butler is on screen where he’s not offering a tour de force take that steals the film. Dune Part Two acquired what would seem impossible expectations over the past three years. Leave it to Denis Villeneuve to surpass expectations with a film that is a blueprint of successful and impactful adaptations. While only February, it’s impossible not to gaze into the future where the Oscar Chariot awaits Dune Part Two and its incredible team."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," We find ourselves launched back into the cinematic world of Dune right where we left off, as Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), are following Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Chani (Zendaya), and several other Fremen back to Sietch Tabr, the place where they live on Arrakis in secret away from the Harkonnen. House Atreides has fallen after it was massacred by the Harkonnens and their leader, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård), and now have taken back their control of the planet that was lost at the beginning of the first film. But things are escalating to another conflict as the Fremen are taking down packs of Harkonnens at an alarming rate, one that is infuriating not only the Baron but his nephew Glossu Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista), who has been made in charge of picking back up the spice production for his family and for the Empire. In one of the better action sequences of the film, we see Paul and Jessica go one-on-one with Harkonnen soldiers on the ground while Stilgar and the Fremen fight them from above, leaving Harkonnen bodies to drop to the ground like flies. Oscar-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser effectively uses the shadow from dusk to aid the scene, making for excellent dramatic tension. It is a shame from this moment, his work is rather uneven in those bigger action-dominated moments of the film, shining only when we branch off of Arrakis to new places we’ve yet seen in the franchise. Once they are out of harm’s way and arrive at  Sietch Tabr, a divide amongst the Fremen people starts to form as to whether Paul and Lady Jessica can be trusted to live as one with them, considering they are foreign outsiders and bring unwanted danger wherever they go. In front of the Fremen council of elders, Stilgar vouches for Paul and becomes his mentor, believing he is “Muad’Dib,” a religious figure who would come back to lead the Fremen to freedom and make Arrakis bloom green as it once did long ago. For Lady Jessica, her fate is set by becoming the Fremen’s newest Reverend Mother when she is forced to drink the Water of Life, a poisonous blue liquid that no man has ever been able to survive drinking, and only Bene Gesserit Sisters have been able to consume. From this, two paths are forged, and while Paul is learning from Stilgar to become one with the Fremen, his mother now sees all (past, present, future) and, with the counsel of Paul’s unborn sister in the womb speaking to her, starts down a path to get more followers behind her son’s new identity to create a Holy War that can only be won once Paul finally believes in who he was born to be. Ferguson, who gave the stand-out performance in the first Dune, is once again best in show here as she transforms Lady Jessica from a sympathetic, protective mother to a focused, sinister, manipulative presence throughout the back half of the film. It is easily the best work of her career, and alongside strong work from Bardem, they are the forces moving Paul into the right place he needs to be to make his transition into their savior. During his time training to become a full member of the Fremen, Paul discovers something that could bring a halt to his plans of getting revenge for his father’s death: his love for Chani. Seen mostly in visions throughout the first film, Chani, a non-believer in the Muad’Dib and the prophecy, sees something in Paul that others around her do not, that he is “sincere” and unlike most other outsiders whom she’s encountered in her lifetime. With this notion, she is drawn to him, teaching him how to properly sandwalk to remain undetected by the worms and being partnered in a raid against the Harkonnen in an impressive sequence where both have to put their full trust in one another to survive. Chalamet and Zendaya shine the brightest in this film when they are on-screen together, showcasing their excellent chemistry by creating a bond that grows into unequivocal love for one another. It’s an even story perspective that Villeneuve intentionally wanted to showcase as he has made it clear that he wanted Dune: Part Two to focus more on Chani, as she is an essential character in this story. Unfortunately, when Paul starts seeing visions of his mother’s Holy War coming, and he takes the dark path down to the southern part of Arrakis to consume the Water of Life, making the prophecy come true, the last hour of the film sidelines Chani, leaving Zendaya very little to work with to save her character’s two-film storylines. She essentially becomes the only voice left in Arrakis who thinks that what Paul is doing is dangerous, as she is screaming into a void as their final attacks start to take fold. For being a vital character to this story and moving forward, there is no emotional throughline found in the writing and the acting, leaving any twists or final moments with Chani to fall flat. While Chani becomes an afterthought and Zendaya is wasted in the back half of the film, Chalamet is given enough room to work to deliver another layered, nuanced performance as Paul, who slowly yet effectively slips into evil Anakin Skywalker mode by the end of the film, crazed eyes and all. His anger within his performance becomes Chalamet’s ultimate weapon and his impressive level of commitment here showcases why he is not only the Fremen’s last hope but why he is very much the best young movie star we have working today. Outside of Arrakis lie the rest of the pieces that are looking to make a play in taking down Paul and the Fremen. The Emperor (Christopher Walken) has heard of the growing disturbance that is the Muad’Dib and wants him destroyed. In giving this order, a chain of events unfolds that leads the Bene Gesserit, led by Gaius Helen Mohiam (an always excellent Charlotte Rampling), to call upon another prospect in their breeding program, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), to take his place alongside his uncle and take care of the Muad’Dib. But when Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) finds out that Paul Atreides is alive and who is responsible for the downfall of House Atreides, she knows that this miscalculation will be the end of her father’s reign over the Empire, and could very well take all of their lives. Revenge is not easily forgiven, as we see Paul and the Freman’s attacks on the Emperor are calculated and vengeful. Butler is absolute dynamite as Feyd-Rautha, the role originally played by Sting in the 1984 version. Gone is not just his hair and eyebrows for the character, but his voice is completely changed, no longer sounding like Elvis anymore. His Feyd-Rautha is unpredictable and menacing in all the right ways. Butler seemed to have the time of his life in this role, and it shows in every frame he is on the screen. Unfortunately, he is not in the film as much as you would want him to be in a nearly three-hour epic. All the new additions to the film have minimal screen time, though they all make stellar impressions with what they do. Pugh (who was underused for the second straight year in Hollywood’s biggest epic of the year) and Walken match well as a father-daughter combo, given two short scenes to display the strong, trustful relationship they’ve built to stay on top of an Empire. Even the great Léa Seydoux has a fun couple of sequences with Butler as a member of the Bene Gesserit sent out to evaluate the dangerous candidate that the religious organization has set to go face to face against Paul. In mentioning the Bene Gesserit selection process, and the battle for Paul and Feyd-Rautha for control of Arrakis, and potentially the entire Empire, Dune: Part Two dives into the social, political commentary of Frank Herbert’s groundbreaking novel with a keen eye on pointing out who exactly is in charge of this world. For Paul, it’s his mother, for Feyd-Rautha it’s the Baron, and for both, it looks as if it’s the Reverend Mother and the rest of the Sisters. With this, every white character is in firm control of the destiny of every man, woman, and child; making for a horrific reality about how cultures have been colonized for centuries in our world. But Dune: Part Two sits firmly on the surface level of this commentary, not diving deep enough to explore a modern, richer connection for this important conversation to take place in this film about how our world destroys various groups of people and their cultures all over the world and doesn’t care about them whatsoever. It’s why underwriting Chani is a vital misstep by Villeneuve in this adaptation, with the casting being an even bigger miscalculation as well considering the voiceless are silenced within the film’s runtime, not given any perspective, dialogue to how Paul’s “heroic” actions, or the Emperors and Harkonnen’s violent responses affect them. If your film is going to step into the conversation pool about the topic of colonization and the overall effects it has on our world by showcasing what it does in this universe, you have to have more than just MENA actors in the background have a line or two and running for their lives. This was bound to be a problem for Villeneuve and co-writer Jon Spaihts when they barely addressed it in the first film. And by round two, it was too little too late and feels like it was not something he was interested in exploring. While the cast overall delivers good to great work, they are let down by the components that made the first film special for many audience members: the technical and visual experiences. As we enter the final forty-five minutes of the film, and the battle sequences start to become more and more frequent, the more they all start to blend together. Comparisons to Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy have been (fairly or unfairly) placed at the feet of this property, and given the size and scale of this second feature, it would be easy to connect this as The Two Towers of the Dune franchise. But what that film was able to do that Dune: Part Two isn’t even close to doing is give the audience a sense of wonder within these action sequences while also making them matter emotionally to the overall storyline. Jackson and his team knew how to build tension and stakes for everyone involved, making each frame matter on-screen and widening our imaginations for what a fantasy-epic blockbuster could be, i.e. the Battle of Helm’s Deep that takes over the back half of Two Towers. Villeneuve and his crew seem to be putting in the same effort Jackson did with his much-maligned Hobbit trilogy, which was the work of a team that was successful with something once and could never replicate the magic they once made. Even when we go to new worlds we haven’t seen before in this series, like the Harkonnen planet where we are introduced to Feyd-Rautha, the effort behind bringing this to life just felt bland on arrival. From Fraser’s inconsistent cinematography to Joe Walker’s uneven editing work to a headache-inducing, recycled score from Hans Zimmer to uninspired work from the VFX department, the technical craftsmanship for Dune: Part Two leaves a lot to be desired. Dune: Part Two leaves a promising franchise with more questions than answers as to whether this is the type of blockbuster we want made going forward: rocky attention to detail with the feeling of being rushed matched with an exhausted runtime. Villeneuve, one of the industry’s top directors, seems to be at odds with himself here. While he is faithful to the original source material, he doesn’t allow himself any room to inject himself into the material. Thus, Dune: Part Two falls short of being the mega-epic he set out to tell. Maybe he should’ve taken a break in between making Part One and Part Two to make something else, or maybe he should’ve made them together back to back instead of splitting the filming of them up. It’s like he is chasing the great epic storytellers of the past and present and not forging a path for himself. Villeneuve’s latest feels stuck in quicksand, waiting for him or someone else to save it so it can reach its maximum cinematic potential before it sinks."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE," There’s a marked attention to grandeur in “Dune: Part 2.” The “world building” of this science fiction saga is more detailed and eye-catching, the sweep of the landscape and grit of those who live on it vastly more pronounced than in Denis Villeneuve’s first film, both of them based on Frank Herbert‘s 1965 novel. With this film, Villeneuve more fully realizes his overarching intent, and “Dune” becomes what it was meant to be pretty much all along — the “Lawrence of Arabia” of science fiction. The sweeping source novel with its array of characters, settings, environmentalism and cultures may not share the subtexts of “Lawrence,” but it and this film of it are smart and large scale, so much so that every frame reminds you “This is Epic.” “Part 2” is the aftermath of the slaughter of  House Atreides, an ancient feudal spacefaring clan entrusted with administering the vital desert planet Arrakis, source of the “spice” that the rich and noble of their galaxy use to gain paranormal powers, make interstellar space travel possible and extend their lives.  The Duke (Oscar Isaac) and his lieutenants are dead and/or gone. But teen son Paul (Timothée Chalamet) survived the massacre, and a fight-to-the-death at the end of it. And he and his pregnant  Bene Gesserit mother (Rebecca Ferguson), from a race of seer women who act as manipulators and puppet masters of the fate of the empire, escape into the desert that covers the once-green planet. Son and mother, with her fetus communicating with her telepathically, pre-birth, find refuge among the Fremen of a planet that’s been enslaved and exploited for its natural resources. Among them, Chani (Zendaya) takes a special interest in Paul due to his bravery, his noblesse oblige and humility. The fact that he’s pretty has nothing to do with her teaching him things like “sand walking” so as not to attract the attention of the gigantic worms, which the Fremen and others worship as “Shai-Hulud,” the makers of the spice.  The villains of House Harkonnen carried out the slaughter, and their monstrous Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) relishes this chance to control the spice supply line. His murderously cruel lieutenant, Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) is charged with doing the actual work, deploying troops to protect spice harvesters and keep the various desert-dwelling native factions at bay. Paul, dosed with spice and other chemicals by the Fremen and his mystic mother, has visions that formulate a plan of action. But he won’t hear of his mother’s plot to “propagandize” the natives with the idea that he is their prophesied “chosen one,” come to lead the people of the planet to liberty. The elderly Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his Bene Gesserit daughter (Florence Pugh) are watching the situation on Arrakis with interest and a hint of alarm. And a “psychopathic” “sociopath, a” young na-Baron of the Hakonnen, Feyd Rautha (a bald Austin Butler of “Elvis”) is angling for status on Arrakis, and within his clan. We foresee a rumble coming, both sweeping and gruesomely personal, as the Atriedes heir and the Harkonnen thug have a date with fate. The novel “Dune” came out in the middle of a 1960s flowering of interest in all things desert Arabic, thanks largely to David Lean’s film “Lawrence of Arabia.” Herbert freely appropriates Arabic words, phrases and water-preserving customs — given icky sci-fi twists for this prototypical “desert planet” tale — for his galactic Bedouin and their world of sand and worms and ritual, with the “Southern Fundamentalists” of the planet the most devout. Villenueve and co-writer Jon Spaihts wisely leave out some of Herbert’s Arabic words that have become commonplace in the half-century+ since “Dune” was published and Middle East and West have spent the ensuing decades in conflict. Refer to your war as “Jihad” and you take the viewer right out of the film. The effects are just as dazzling as the sand-covered production design, with characters floating down (by wire and CGI) from heights on their exotic warcraft/spacecraft or cliffs on rocky outcroppings in the desert. Some sort of gravity gadget of their battered, armored suits? A “spice” benefit? Bardem comes close to becoming the Auda Abu Tayi  of this interstellar “Lawrence of Arabia,” giving us hints of Anthony Quinn’s humor and larger-than-life presence in that movie. Crusty Josh Brolin gives the narrative additional humor and gravitas. Ferguson and  Léa Seydoux are inscrutably cunning sisters of the Bene Gesserit, with Pugh’s Emperor’s daughter character still moral and curious about her sect’s schemes and intrigues. Charlotte Rampling, one of the great beauties of the ’60s cinema, is properly scary as the Reverend Mother of this Women on Top heirarchy. Skarsgård’s Baron is undoubtably the visual model for George Lucas’s “Jabba the Hutt,” a beast of a man so large he needs technology and compliant, slaughterable females to keep him going. But the most interesting thing about the Skarsgård’s turn is the attention Butler, who did a pretty good job impersonating Elvis, pays to the Swede’s accent, tone and vocal cadences. Butler’s “na-Baron” sounds like Skarsgård, which is both apt and kind of cute to hear.  But in terms of performances, this is Chalamet’s star vehicle, and he takes Paul from boyish martial arts training to grieving (tiny bit) son to a Man in Full in this performance. The character wrestles with the morality of power and fearsome responsibility of being or at least play-acting a “chosen one.” Chalamet lets us see the reluctance, the fatalism and the doubts that warn Paul away from taking on this Mahdi role.  His chemistry with Zendaya is workable, although she seems like a character and an actress performing her in a somewhat more conventional “warrior princess” tale.  One thing that sticks with me about the “Dune” novels (there are five, should Warner Brothers find this universe too lucrative to leave idle) after reading them many years ago — OK, TWO things, one being the gigantic sandworms that people who “are one with the desert” can ride bareback — is the attention to water in a world where it is scarce. Suits recycle water. The dead have their water “harvested.” Vomiting is a disaster. Shedding tears will earn you a “Never give your water away” lecture. The second Battle for Arrakis hits a few action highs in the middle and later acts, giving us a welcome break from the exploration of desert mysticism and endless exposition from characters both new and older ones who return to the fold. And the finale feels a tad perfunctory as it hews closely to the novel and every other filmed attempt at “Dune,” with an open-endedness that may be the studio’s demand, but which might be giving Villeneuve Peter Jackson “Hobbit” commiment nightmares.
