"Apr 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies I watched, incredibly boring and pretty confusing with a lot of plot holes"
"Apr 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm a huge fan of diverse casting. It reflects the changing demographics of the US and the world and it allows marginalized groups to see possibilities previously closed off to them (even ridiculous ""possibilities"" like being a superhero). Diverse casting is not, however, a substitute for a good movie, and I suspect that a number of critics thinking that it is explains how this bloated, dull turkey of a film has anyone going to bat for it. Look: we got multiple ethnicticies and queer characters and disabled characters all packed into one film! It must be good! 

But it's not. It's bad as a superhero movie: the fights are dull and lack any sense of danger; the visuals are odd and uninspired; the characters are dour and unsympathetic; it's not clear who we're rooting against and why. 

It's bad as a drama, wasting so much time on a silly backtory in the the ancient world and a getting-the-band-back-togther premise that no one could possible develop the actual personalities amidst the sprawling waste of time that is the plot.

And for all the noise to the contrary, it's not interesting as philosophy: it dangles the provocative possibility that humans and Earth might be expendable in a cosmic utilitarian scheme before deciding, nope, humans are Earth are magic and anyone who thinks otherwise is a nazi. It tempts us with the idea of a real ethical discussion and then immediately chickens out. 

So shave about 20% off of this grade-inflated RT critic average and you get a sense of the movie: it's about as good as the ninth Transformers sequel--long and noisy and pointless and feels even longer."
"Mar 31, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie dragged so much for that sake of presenting us each one of the eternals and yet failed to establish a connection strong enough to make us care about them.

Realy hope they work out this out in the future.

In terms of action and visuals it was ok.

One area were it shines is in the top tier casting, and yet somehow i feel that it was underutilized. The acting is great, but it's something missing, probably that strong connection that i was talking about. They might had leveraged if they had chosen to go as a tv show instead a movie, but idk lets see what the future brings.

I dont say that is a bad movie, but it's not a good one neither.

In the end i recomend ppl to watch it and made their one conclusions. (it's not a wast a time)"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,This would have worked better as a long series.  Time to develop the characters.  Ending wasn't great. Still a fun ride.
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Many say it's the worst thing about Marvel, but believe me, it's not. Visually I consider it good, in the plot part as well and in the special effects as well. recommendable"
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad that I honestly was on my phone most of the time. I tried to force myself to watch it because I wanted to watch the whole MCU timeline, but I couldn't."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It could have been better, but overall I enjoyed it. I think there were just too many new characters to introduce."
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie ,every second of this movie was perfect. I couldn't even blink it was beautifully made. Crossing my fingers and wishing that there is a part 2."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'm not quite sure what Marvel was doing with this one. It gave the same energy as the original Hulk movie and I hope Marvel doesn't end up switching roles and confusing us with this one.
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think it's a very underrated movie, coming out during Covid too. It deserves its sequel. The movie was one of the greats that came out during that period of movie releases.
A Really interesting story, stacked cast, great cinematography. If you shelve this. It's a disservice."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not a perfect movie but it is much better than the numbers say.  It's long but very entertaining and if you love the comics, it's a must see!"
"Mar 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,This was not as good as it could have been but I liked it. Would like to see more about the Celestials.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not the worst movie I have ever seen. But it is the worst Marvel movie I have seen
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,By far the worst marvel movie I've ever seen. I cannot believe they actually put this out.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you ever wanted an artsy, deep, thoughtful, fun superhero movie.  Here it is. Recommend for anyone looking for a marvel formula palette cleanser. Although it can be formulatic at times it seems different, in a good way.  At least to me!!"
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Thank God I waited and recorded it when it was free because I would've been embarrassed spending money on that. What producers and Hollywood people get a boatload of other peoples money and says ""hey, let's make a movie about a group of God type people that no one has ever heard of or read their comic books And tie it into the Marvel universe so we can ride on their reputation of greatness?"" Who does that?
This movie failed in so many ways I can't describe them all‚Ä¶ CGI wasn't half bad, they take one of the best actresses of our time and give her a half a dozen lines in the whole movie, half the time is spent doing mundane and interpersonal relationships And the action, if you can call it that, is short-lived for each encounter and uneventful. I honestly don't see how the audience gave this is 77%. All I can say is thankfully it was free‚Ä¶"
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There's the germ of a good idea here; the ancient gods being resurrected and changing over time; and their modern regime; and it's struggles; and their attempts to stop the apocolypse...But this is such COMIC BOOK writing...Why couldn't they have gotten more serious writers and addressed this on a deeper, cooler, more epic level; as opposed to another stupid episode of Smallville?  The ideas aren't bad but the execution is very mid, very meh, very comic book ..It's the kind of thing that will be laughed at and ridiculed down the road...Much like disco and break dancing movies are now...Or stupid Rom/coms from the 2000s...It isn't SERIOUS.

Overall: Not recommended"
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,Very Underrated film. It will age well.
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"De lo mejor de marvel, creo que muchas de las cr√≠ticas negativas son superficiales."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is one of the most boring movies I have ever sat through. Well I made it to 45 minutes hence the half star. It would have been given no stars but since I walked out I could not speak to the rest of the movie.  I also realize this review is late but it will hopefully stop you from wasting any of your time or at least 45 minutes.
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Lost my intrest halfway then continued watching and then just left
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Freshest MCU movie to date imo. Rewatched it and it still holds up on its own. The world building is perfect, and relationships between the cast members is believable and relatable. The movie gets hate for no reason, actually for bad reason, as all the MCU movies that follow up until the end of 2023 is so bad that you really wish Eternals carried the torch on how to keep MCU movies fresh for the next phases. Audiences need to grow with the movies (most of us are working, married with kids, paying huge bills, etc. now) and we need MCU movies that are completely different with the cookie cutters to be exciting again. 10/10 and I hope the sequel stays exactly the same design-wise, bring back the director please."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Lo √∫nico rescatable para m√≠ es la actriz l√≠a mchugh
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,The fight scenes were fun to watch but pretty short.  The time jumping is annoying.  Unnecessary love interest.  The plot is dumb to me.  Tries making infinity stones irrelevant.  But the celestials are so unnecessary and unneeded.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"A wandering landscape, epic timelines, they fit a novel into the pictures and relationships, but not a ton of dialogue. I enjoyed it for being a chill super hero movie."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I honestly hoped this would be a decent film, but I forget ha;f the characters names, can't even remember the one villain's name is. The story was forgettable, the character development was lacking, the pacing was off, and Kumail Nanjiani is just not a good actor."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Filme mediano! Da para assistir e entreter-se.
Foram muitos personagens novos para introduzir em um √∫nico filme, e pra piorar √© um grupo menos famoso da Marvel. Fora isso, o filme consegue entregar cenas interessantes."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"ODEIO ESTE FILME IDENTIT√ÅRIO, ESTRAGOU OS NOVOS HER√ìIS COM ESTAS MUDAN√áAS E INCOER√äNCIA. DECEP√á√ÉO MARVEL/ DISNEY üò§üò°üò†ü§¨üòàüëø"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just no.. I miss the real Marvel quality..
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,They are not a superheros they are politicians.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Eternals is a complex events of group of synthetic super heroes. Chloe Zhao did not disappoint! from the direction to visual/ vfx it was chef's kiss! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
I appreciate the mythology and marvel approach of this film, I just live every second of it! Cant wait for the sequel of Eternals! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Fun with engaging world building. A drama more than an action flick. The acting can be a little stiff at times and some characters aren't equally balanced and it could use a little more action, but not much. Very solid but missing a pinch of charm."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,probably the best directed Marvel movie since infinity war and I liked it way more than I thought I would!!!
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not sure why it got ripped apart by tbe critics. This is a very good movie, great acting and a fun plot. I love all parts of it and i cant wait for a part 2."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"The most human, beautiful, endearing masterpiece ever to grace the comic book world."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,These movies are getting worse and worse... can't believe I keep going to anything with the Marvel brand.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Despite sone if the other ratings I thought this was a well done movie they are really reaching for some of the marvel stories but this one was pretty and thoughtout and led you think there is more to come. Angelina crushed it and it was cool to see some of the ties to other marvel movies! pretty well done.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete garbage. I don't understand how anyone would like it. It's boring.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Was not a big fan of this movie
"Feb 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"so disappointed this wasn't more successful. I loved it. It was ""evolved"" as a super hero movie. I stopped and rewatched the philosophical debates. I wish a philosophy professor would use it to do an anatomy of the different view points different categories when they ""followed their heart"". and I Laughed out loud so many times. I hope there will be more, and its too bad all those fan boys out there can't see it for what it is."
"Feb 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Finally watched it because it came on tv. I'm glad I didn't pay to watch this in the theaters. Gave an extra star because they spent a lot of money making this üí©
"Feb 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"My God, they never read any of Jack Kirby's 1976 masterpiece. They couldn't even get Ikaris's name right. It's not ""Icarus"" it's ""Ike Harris.""
   This story got so lost in translation. The actual story was 3 races of earth's evolution,  not androids in space. There was an ancient war. The Celestials tried teaching all 3 races is if we don't learn to put the past behind us,we will be destroyed.
   They try to agree to disagree and find commonality to show we're up to trying.
   That's pretty much it.
   This piece of üí© story is so lost in translation Ikaris is not the hero of the story, he's a traitor (and it makes no sense). The Deviants are android jerks and learn nothing. Celestials are the bullies of the story and they stand against their creators.
   In the books, you fight a Celestial, they win you lose, and they can easily kill most Marvel characters.
   What the hell were they thinking?"
"Feb 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, it was epic!"
"Feb 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,Next time you wanna waste my time atleast pay for my ticket
"Feb 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Wow...just wow.   Who thought this was a good idea?
"Feb 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie just recently 2/7/24. I came in with no expectations, since half the reviews were not good. Well I have to say I liked this movie. It told a good story, the acting was good, and it left me anxious for the next movie in this franchise. I really can't understand some of the visceral hate for this movie. It's definitely not another run of the mill marvel movie, and for that I am thrilled . Go on with no expectations, and an open mind then watch and enjoy this movie."
"Feb 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You can see what they were going for but ultimately it's just too long, has too many new characters dumped on you all at once and just doesn't really work especially in comparison to say, Logan which is an artist superhero film that really sticks the landing."
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,A giant hand emerge from the depth of the earth and the avengers... Wait! Where were they!?
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Movies was great can't wait for part two !!!
"Jan 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie, marvels weak attempt at recapturing audiences"
"Jan 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Story of lots of great action, terrible story, typical Disney flick recycling old themes with a new skin."
"Jan 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,worse marvel movie ever. The action scene at the end was fine tho and was the only thing that makes me give it a half star rather than zero. Actually it's not possible to give it zero stars but if it was then I would've done it.
"Jan 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"With the Infinity Saga coming to a close, Marvel is attempting to change their formula to try new things with their films. Eternals however, is not the correct formula. A plot that is filled with holes and lacks anything interesting mixed with characters that change sides and motivations constantly equals rotten. By the end, I just wanted the weightless story to come to a close. Much like Ikaris, if I was in the movie, I would fly to my certain death."
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film is the most majestic and truly marvelous film we've gotten from the MCU to date. It tells a great story of these ten eternal beings throughout Earth's history with very deep pathos, philosophy, and symbolism. Not to mention, the best visuals in the MCU to date with great action scenes. You definitely get a sense of who each of the ten characters is to their core by the end of the film, and the various ways they have evolved throughout their time on earth."
"Jan 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It is almost impossible for the mind to comprehend that the Oscar-winning director of NOMADLAND, one of my favorite films of the last several years, is also responsible for this mess. Quite frankly, it is close to a complete disaster. Overlong, uninvolving with lazy performances and repetitive special effects. Those more familiar with the Marvel universe may understand more about what's going on, but I was totally lost with characters that come and go out of nowhere and a non linear storyline that literally goes back and forth between multiple centuries. Worst of all, the whole enterprise lacks even the smallest amount of joy or enthusiasm. This is the first Marvel movie I've seen (and I've probably seen about half of them) that felt dead on arrival."
"Jan 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Eternals is a rare misfire by marvel. Definitely some good character moments and action sequences. But on the whole, it's a cluttered film with too many characters and plot points. Some of them don't even end anywhere and some aren't even established. This results in an exhausting watch."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved Eternals, great world building & characters. Not sure if Marvel is going to go any further with it though."
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This gets one star as opposed to a half due to one or two competently-done fight scenes, but my word this film is a letdown. I was so hopeful, and all I got was disappointment and boredom."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I didn't know what to expect going in, but I was pleasantly surprised by the end.  The visuals and animations are amazing, and the fight scenes are well choreographed.  It's different but definitely worth a watch."
"Jan 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,The amount of plotholes this movie creates is just incredible.
"Jan 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Real fans of the MCU will love this and I have already self-identified as an old man who liked comic books best when it was Superman, Lex Luthor and damsel-in-distress Lois Lane.
Beyond that I'm like Angelina Jolie in a superhero movie. Wait. What?"
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hey, wasn't this the movie that everyone thought would reshape cinatography forever, before it's release? I feel it didn't live up to that."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I strongly feel that the people involved in the making of this movie have no idea what the point of movies is.  People see movies to be entertained, sometimes even to be educated or enlightened.  This movie did none of these and these people should go directly to movie jail, where they can make no more big budget movies until they can prove their worth making low budget fair."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,So bad. Everything about this film is junk. The only redeeming quality is the amount of good looking people they cast...
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring, aimless, waste of time. How does Disney manage to squander that much acting talent in one film?"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I lost my time watching this movie. Commercials were excellent, but whole movie..."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Very Underrated very different Marvel Studios movie! Loved it. Must watch.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a pretty good movie.  Pretty disappointed that i lottery myself get convinced it wasn't.  Better than Dr. Strange 2 and Thor 3.  Rotten tomatoes should reduce the weight of critics who's results are reguarly inconsistent with audience scores.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,The critics were wrong on this one. It's nowhere near the best MCU film but I love the slow burn and dialogue heavy nature of this movie. The visuals are great as well and they managed to do evil Superman better in this than in the DCEU so it gets a few brownie points.
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring movie. What happend to the action?
"Dec 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"tinha tudo pra ser bom mas por falta de tempo acabou sendo extremamente med√≠ocre, a hist√≥ria √© interessante mas os personagens n√£o tem desenvolvimento, e eu nem julgo, n√£o d√° da desenvolver e aprofundar 7 personagens em 2 horas de filme, mas apesar de tudo √© um filme interessante de assistir e muito subestimado"
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plot is incredibly hard to follow and even when I can tell what's happening I can't SEE what's happening because it's so dark all the time. The cast is too big, I can't remember most of their names, and other than one character none of the powers really stand out as original. I did enjoy certain aspects of the film but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the film. Overall if you're considering renting or buying thus movie it is not worth it."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was surprised that it wasn't as huge of a mess like I heard. It does have too many characters with not enough to do. 
I liked Sersi as a character, but not having enough time to really be her own character, she falls a bit flat. Sprite is such a thought provoking character and I wished she had more time to explore her personal difficulties and explore her attempting adult life but failing and being extremely torn apart about it. I liked Angelina Jolie's character essentially battling mental illness, but like everything it's just half baked. It's sad, I can see a good movie here but this just isn't one. 
It would have been better to make the story based around 3-4 characters, Sersi, Icarus, Sprite and Kinkango or Athena. I think it was a huge misstep to have some of the characters seemingly have huge ideological differences and it not be a problem until the finale.
If I were to redo this, make the whole movie a who dun it. Have the introduction be a funeral, and then spread out and have more eternals die quickly, and then the final few stick together. That way we get more time with the characters we have. Of course, the plot would only change very slightly this way since the auxiliary Eternals aren't really used and feel like they are there because they're in the comics. Boo, don't be so married to it. If you want them, then bring them back to life with the success of the final confrontation, what we have is just bad, but really it wasn't awful."
"Dec 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For better or worse Eternals is an ambitious project that tried to move away from the Marvel standard of fast paced storytelling and characters making non-stop quips. The premise is an intense high-fantasy, a large cast of immortals acting like a dysfunctional family, with their issues and the way they cope with them scaled up as much as their godhood in often Shakespearean fashion.

First, Eternals tries to do a lot. It attempts to fit 10 compelling characters many with their own stories, intelligent relationships and personal dramas into a hyper grand premise, a multilayered mystery plot riddled with provoking moral dilemmas, convince us of a world where the natural order is mass genocide from sentient cosmic forces, hell even the throwaway antagonist has meaningful motive; all into a film with a very reasonable runtime.

It quickly became apparent how easy it was to nitpick at flaws in this massive project so I'll address the most notable ones. It fails to reinforce its most consistent and encompassing theme, what it means to be human. How the film wrapped up certain character narratives unsatisfyingly (Sprite & Kingo), characters making choices that may alienate viewers (Like every Eternal at some point) and the Deviant subplot feeling too separate from the main story by the final act.

However, a lot worked for me too. Starting with the cinematography, the movie was very beautifully shot. Unlike most Marvel productions that are all ADHD & go-go-go scenes actually take their time to bask and settle. Also the film has the viewers often feel the moral struggles of its characters and I love that. I find personal stories from the existential perspective of immortals very compelling and there's a lot of material there in that regard. (I mean, there's 10 of them!) Finally this should go without saying but the action choreography is top notch as always.

Eternals is a success, it may have chewed off more than it can handle but it's one of Marvel's most provoking and complex projects in every sense. It's bloated and borderline convoluted but it was still enjoyable and is exactly the type of ambitious thing I want to see from them instead of churning out the same brainless style/tone over and over."
"Dec 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Truly underrated, better than Iron Man 2 (worst MCU movie)."
"Dec 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A terrible, pointless film with a terrible, pointless plot and terrible, pointless characters."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heh, this is my fauvorite Marvel movie, I have no idea how, it is what it is, and honestly I dont feel the movie slow."
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Thousands of comic characters to choose from‚Ä¶and we get this hot mess. ü§Æ. Plus I'll never watch a movie with parental alienation Queen Angelina Jolie.
"Nov 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow
  Eternals said it's different from any other MCU film but wasn't this is one of the worst MCU films very stupid too."
"Nov 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"To my surprise, considering the negative reviews and the general concensus of the film being 'bad', I went in with low expectations.

I was surprised to find that the film was thoroughly enjoyable, hitting all of the requirements of a modern superhero film. Great action scenes, appropriate levels of humour, adequately good acting and a decent enough plot! Sure, the film isn't full of twists, turns or huge surprises, but there is enough going on to keep me entertained."
"Nov 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is very fun despite it has its flaws. Its different than any MCU movies, i can't wait for the sequel"
"Nov 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have tried to watch this many times, pulled in by the MCU and cast. The movie simply could not grab my attention or create any real excitement, despite big cgi effects, powerful characters and a vast universe of backstory to work with. Unfortunately the first of many MCU dumpster fires."
"Nov 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Los villanos son decentes la acci√≥n es buena los efectos son buenos los personajes regulares es buena pero no tan buena es un 7.6 de 10
"Nov 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't get the negativity towards this movie. I found this movie intelligent and moving. I don't get how this movie gets 47% on Tomatometer, but Blue Beetle gets 78%. I don't understand. Maybe its just me."
"Nov 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eternal is a good movie, in my opinion. Characters are interesting, they have chemistry together, a fantastic scene, and the actor and actress provide a wonderful performance. I think that in time, everyone will see its worth."
"Nov 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not great, not terrible, pretty forgetable, but has some intriguing moments and otherwise a solid basis. Certainly not the best of the Marvels and not really a good  contribution to the overall MCU - it opens way too many questions and issues. The final boss is pretty laughable, but alas, it passes the time and is somewhat consistent in its quality. There are a few annoying characters and plot points, but it's easy to disconnect this from the rest of the MCU, especially if you've already given up on getting a good overarching plot line again. So watch it just as a standalone movie and pretend it has no further connection to anything else I guess."
"Nov 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A film that is said to be neither good nor bad, Eternal itself has its own characteristics in writing characters and stories. The depiction of the world before the Avengers is presented in a unique way."
"Nov 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Underrated Masterpiece. Don't watch it as an MCU movie, but as a Movie."
"Nov 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't as bad as I've heard people say it is, but I feel it would have been much more successful as a TV show. It would have given it alot more time to develop the large main casts characters."
"Nov 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,A lot in store here. It wasn‚Äôt the best Marvel movie I‚Äôve seen but totally worth the watch and the characters were likable. Visuals were on par with Marvel and impressive! Stay tuned after the initial refits for a little nugget. 
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely stunning visually and such a change of pace for Marvel which was much needed and it was fantastic.
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,The star-studded cast could not save this slow sinking ship. The long running time and uninteresting characters made this the least pathos-driven movie in the studios' repertoire.
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most underrated movie from Marvel
Acting 7.5/10
Dialogue 7/10
Action 7/10
Story 8/10
Music 6/10"
"Nov 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too many unknown characters, too many unanswered questions, too soon.

After Covid MARVEL seemingly decided to put things on screen out of order and out of context. This film doesn't make sense where they released it - same with the Black Widow movie. The film is great, but it feels like the middle section of a three film arc, but you haven't seen the other two bits yet.... 

For me the celestials were insanely impressive, the capturing of SCALE was awesome by the director, and the stand out character ARC for me was Dane Whitman. Bumbling professor who is in a world he doesnt understand, and his involvement keeps increasing to the point of unravelling his heritage.... this should have been the story, with the eternals as the aside.  

The film is definitely worth a watch, but the sub-par cgi in the post credit scenes is jarring, and the point of the film is yet to be seen / mentioned in the mcu at all. As i say, wayyyy too early."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had to come on here and write a review because this is the only movie that I've seen in a theatre where the audience and myself busted out laughing AT the movie (not with it). Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad visuals. I think we were being punked."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it but I think there were too many new characters so not enough time to explore them. Also they focused on the least interesting, I would have loved more Phastos, Makkari, Thena and Gilgamesh and less Sersi and Ikaris"
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not an avenger movie, but the visuals are awesome and the plot as well"
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This is objectively bad. But I somehow subjectively like it. The music is good too. Better than Endgame for me.
"Nov 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Zhao's creative instincts are underutilized in a predictable MCU film
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought Eternals was pretty good. It was cool over all in my opinion.
"Nov 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a bit long for me but I get it that they want to show us all of the characters. It has a very good fight sequences and the vfx was good. This is also the first film that I've seen a speedster in a real speed, not in slow motion! (Shout out flash). All in all, it is a fresh-air to see it in the MCU

"Nov 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The characters in this movie are done so well, i connected with most of them and the visuals are stunning. the most cinematic MCU movie dare i say it"
"Nov 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For 11/2021: Marvel Studios presents their next big team of superheroes Directed by Chloe Zao she assembles a very rich, diversified cast in this long roster After Thanos wiped out half the universe and Tony Stark bringing everyone back due to his sacrifice it provided the necessary energy to create an event called the Emergence; basically this would wipe the slate clean on planet Earth for other worlds to exist 7,000 years ago beings called Eternals gifted with immortality and amazing powers arrived from the planet Olympia or did they?; they were instructed to not interfere with human history or conflicts by Celestials unless creatures called Deviants were involved The Eternals comprise of 5 fighters and 5 thinkers; Ikaris who can fly, shoot beams from his eyes, and have superhuman strength, Makkari who has super speed and is deaf, Thena the goddess of war who can create all kinds of weapons, Sersi who can manipulate matter, Druig who can control people's minds, Kingo who's a Bollywood star but more joking than anyone that can fire projectiles from his hands, Phastos who can control any type of technology, Ajak who can heal people, Gilgamesh who can deliver super powered punches, and Sprite who can create illusions Even though they've shaped our cultures and civilizations since the dawn of time it's a heavy burden for them all they couldn't lift a finger to help humanity, heck they even explain why they didn't help the Avengers Now with the Emergence on the rise these immortal warriors have to band together to protect what they now hold dear even going against their prime directive Kros, is one their many obstacles being in charge of the Deviants making them believe they can't protect humans next to Jemiah the Analyzer who created the Eternals and Arishem, their master It‚Äôs the 3rd longest MCU entry next to 'Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame' but still good for fans that have been keeping with this franchise since 2008; brings all the enjoyment you‚Äôd expect albeit minor flaws included It takes some getting used to the exposition But the action is impressive, love the big world building, this rich diverse cast, the costumes, and it opens more of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in multiple directions Love this musical score too Ajax is the almighty leader yet she can‚Äôt let anyone interfere with human history lest them hindering their natural evolution, Kingo is the funny comic relief with his Bollywood personality, Sprite is the free youthful spirit being that she‚Äôs stunted in her growth being an immortal teenager, Sersi is the heart of the group feeling she used to have a romance with Ikkaris, Thena is the fierce warrior sticking to her duties yet she‚Äôs feeling weak with her memories since she‚Äôs been around for eons, Druig wishes everyone should have a common ground, Gilgamesh is the calming one for Thena, and Phastos feels ashamed of his tinkering considering how humans have used machines to kill each other so he‚Äôs found human connection living a domestic life This entry is more dramatic than bombastic or cartoony which might not sit well with many; villains are kinda lame to be honest with Kro only being in here for 5 min and Arishem who‚Äôs kinda sitting in the background It stinks 2 characters in here are axed off quick being part of this main family A lot of the environments feel empty and boring since it‚Äôs a lot of deserts, oceans, grass fields, beaches and volcanoes Still, it does show how others involved with humanity's development would've shifted things allowing us to evolve, thrive, learn from our mistakes Human nature is what it is; sometimes it's unavoidable or not our place to change what has to unfold Without our flaws and mistakes we couldn‚Äôt stand out or learn to be better Chloe Zhao knows her characters and their interpersonal relationships, she has them dig deep into themselves about whether they should do more than what they were made for or not bother getting attached to a planet inhabited It‚Äôs definitely a heavy toll being immortal and having to watch over civilizations far slower than others as far as weapons and modern technology One of those rare superhero films to make the viewer think The casting here is also a true profession of representation in film The mid credits scene is crazy and the after credits scene....very ambiguous It‚Äôs a lot of mystery for the future to unfold that‚Äôs for sure 25 movies in and Marvel Studios is still showing their love and passion for an ever-expanding multitude of stories from the pages of the comics This one isn‚Äôt perfect and will be very divisive but you can tell they are trying to open more doors for further adventures and that‚Äôs fine by me as a comic book movie lover"
"Nov 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No me gusto la peli, esas fueron 2 horas y 7 minutos de mi vida que no voy a recuperar, mal√≠sima, no recomiendo esta pelicula"
"Nov 2, 2023",POSITIVE,More interesting than other Marvel movies. It felt more character driven and less explosion driven. I was bored of the usual marvel format in the 2010s. This was refreshing.
"Nov 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The opening scene annoyed me the most. It started with an interesting premise and then the way it was acted out was as if it was done by a child. Like what a little boy would think was super cool.

You'd think that moviemakers have had plenty of practice, and should be getting better. Overall, it was quite mediocre."
"Oct 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring... Boring... BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,too hyped up which made the movie dissapointing
"Oct 28, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most underrated MCU movies imo
"Oct 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The biggest piece of dawgshit
"Oct 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"HEY #DISNEY #MARVEL.

You did fine here. I like it. This was actually a refreshing approach. Having a designated profound and naval gazing team is actual nice between quirky goofballs or depression psychopaths. The more flavors you have, the better the icecream shop, I say.

That being said, here are my complaints.
1) Gilgamesh. Now, hurray for color blind casting. That is great. Good for you.........but you have a mesopotamian Hercules and you did not think to hire a middle eastern guy to play him? Yeah, I know the comic did not look like a mesopotamian hercules, but...........come on! I know wrestling is popular in the middle east. I AM PERSIAN AMERICAN. You could have found a big middle eastern dude willing to read a few lines before getting killed. Would have been fine. We got body builders for days. But you got a husky east asian dude instead.................... care to cast a mexican for Anubis next while you're at it? Maybe a swedish Ganesh?
2) The spit-wine scene was stupid. Whomever wrote that scene should be hit with a truck.
Here is a list of funny hobbies for an immortal to have.
A) Tortoise farming and breeding (Ends in rainbow tortoise, poodle tortoise, or high speed tortoise breeds).
B ) world's most complete collection of cheeses (Even the maggot cheese, the vein cheeses, and the last of the woolly mammoth cheese)
C) Digging a tunnel to the center of the earth and that is how the celestial is discovered. (Cameo from mole men is optional. Deviants living in subterranean lairs encouraged)
D ) Cave of treasure history waiting for massive ebay event.

Back to complaints.
3) The caveman death at the beginning was unintentionally hilarious. Shame on you for the accidental comedic timing of that.
4) The bollywood thing was a waste of a scene. That character does not even come back to help in the fight at the end. What the hell? Good Guy or Bad Guy, you dragged us through the who film with him and used him in the trailer. Of course people left disapointed. We did not even see him DANCE IN HIS DANCE SCENE. Hire some guys from India to do a scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7K4vGYL9zI
The exchange rate can't be that bad.

AND FINALLY.......... while it sells the immortal warrior thing to show them in different historical periods, we all saw Highlander. Either really commit to the period piece segments, or figure out a better way to examine immortal characters visually. EXAMPLES!
A ) Green Screen scenes of them throughout the MCU in the background. Forest Gump style. Phestus could be telling jokes about Ironman's antics with his engineering.
B ) Icarus standing gaurd for something and him covering in cobwebs like an old suit of armor in a forgotten museum.
C ) have one of them work at a cancer hospital helping Make a Wish kids. ""They have so much love in them. So much hope. They deserve so much more time"" and the humans think he is talking about kids, but really he is talking about humans at large. 


Just........I really hope this gets a sequal. I really think the actors and directors did a great job. The editing and choreography was lacking (Especially dancing, but half the fights felt mild as well). Its good. Eternal heroes sworn to duty questioning their free will within that duty. THAT IS INTERESTING! Spit wine, bad bollywood, and cavemen that don't know how to panic is NOT INTERESTING!

Hope you get another whack at them.......but don't go Thor the Dark World either. You can be naval gazing, grim, AND STILL have a nice color palette."
"Oct 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another Disney woke garbage bucket
"Oct 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,I tried to see this movie about 5 times and every single time I couldn't get past 25 minutes this shit is boring as hell. Even as a comic fan it sucked
"Oct 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel could have done so much better, I'm disappointed with some of the plot holes there was and unanswered questions related to the villainy of some characters. Was definitely not the worst movie"
"Oct 4, 2023",POSITIVE,No way the critics consensus for the first Thor movie is higher than this. No way.
"Sep 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was incredible. Only issue is that it felt like it was the 3rd film not the first expects us to know the characters. Other than that it was great if not perfect, just needed films before it because this should not of been the first eternals film"
"Sep 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A movie that tried too hard to be the next marvel ""event"". We're not given enough time to understand the characters and the villain is one that is thrown into the plot and not really given a unique role. *spoiler* his death is one of the most underwhelming villain deaths ever as he is killed within 2 seconds."
"Sep 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just the worst marvel movie ever. So many holes in this story. Just dont watch and pretend it doesn't exist in the storyline, it won't make a difference anyway."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is possibly the worst MCU movie I have ever seen. The characters are an interesting in dull and does not have any heart, nor any interesting, motivations or beliefs that we can care about. The plot is jumped from stopping aliens to saving the planet. It is just nonsensical. It‚Äôs not 2+ that makes sense together. It‚Äôs just a plot on top of a plot on top of a plot. The pacing in this movie is very boring. In infinity war pacing is real fast and real smooth because we have one objective and that objective has no time to waste or the objective is incomplete but in this movie we keep sitting down and talking about bullshit that does not your matter to the story, or doesn‚Äôt even give us a lot of information or our characters just keeps having flashbacks   and then the main objective then flashbacks then the  main objective is just wrong and off pasted the CGI is kind of good and the visuals are impressive but the story is the best thing that keeps a movie going but this story is very lack luster and dull the only character that I remember is Icarus because he‚Äôs more kind of interesting, but everybody else is just not it. Overall 1.5/10"
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie turned out absolutely fantastic! The actors did a phenomenal job and I just got so easily attacked and hooked into the whole thing. One of the best CGI movies, so beautiful on that part. Everything was just beautiful."
"Sep 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's an interesting test for the MCU to take but it doesn't quite hit its mark
"Sep 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really refreshing take for a company that badly needs to try new things. A proper scifi epic that we don't see so much of anymore. Jack Kirby's original ideas were considered too ambitious by many (leading to the cancellation of the original comic book run of Eternals in the first place) - and I think that's what's happening here as well. But still, I think that despite some flaws the interesting ideas shown in this movie really end up shining through and this film is more than worth watching if just for that."
"Sep 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I rewatched this and it's actually a decent film. Definitely better than Marvel's recent crap like Thor, Dr Strange and Ant-Man. The story is self-contained and doesn't rely heavily on retcons of past events. It has some great themes and moments like defying ones fate and redemption. When Icarus surrenders to his love for Cersi and joins the Uni-mind it evokes strong emotions and satisfaction. As a whole I feel like this can work in an independent setting from the MCU. Trying to tie this in with the MCU will open up too many questions and plot holes because alot of it's major themes undercut the MCU especially it's concept of the Universe etc and the existence of Celestials etc. Other than that the acting performances were solid, the action was solid and the CGI was good. It has its corny stuff like the whole Bollywood stuff etc but it was definitely way better than sitting through something like Thor: Love and Thunder. Overall it's worth the watch."
"Sep 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Without doubt worst movie of Marvel. No plot, Casting is all wrong, sub plot like Indian and wokeism  are by far the worst portrayal. 

If sacrificing intelligent life is essential for birth of a being then humans shd be last on the list, this movie is prime example of human ignorance."
"Sep 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Made me angry, douchecanoe ruined it for me. Why was he acting like that? Mad confused. Also alien could've been a tad more helpful on the beach, missed out on making some friends."
"Aug 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Toilet paper film roll, only good thing about this"
"Aug 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible and boring. Very irrelevant. Bad plot, too long, very generic characters. Easily it's a black sheep movie. So forgettable."
"Aug 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,WHAT DID I JUST WATCH THIS IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE ITS A COPY FROM A BUNCH OF OTHERS
"Aug 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Diversity"" over quality or anything anyone cares about, like story or even basic coherence. ""White man evil"" is basically the crux of it. Creative flop, to go along with being a colossal box office flop. Avoid."
"Aug 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bland, boring and uninteresting, Marvel's ""The Eternals"" is a missed opportunity and a mess."
"Aug 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst piece of media I ever saw I like the wind paramount did the marvel movies
"Aug 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I do not know why they did a movie about the Eternals the story was slow and at times boring, not one of Marvels best"
"Aug 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is good i don't know what people are complaining about.
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eternals is an excellent film, breathtaking photography, super well done special effects and an excellent cast, Marvel Studios you are ten in this regard "
"Aug 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Se fosse para descrever esse filme numa palavra eu diria BOM
"Aug 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst Marvel movies I've seen. The first half of the movie was painstakingly slow and there was a very unnecessary and awkward sex scene in the beginning. I didn't feel attached to the characters at all nor care about any of the plot. I like to believe that this movie doesn't exist in the mcu
"Aug 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"uMmMmmM ewwww. this movie just suckes. phase four just sucks. marvel made a screwed , nonsensical plot, and tryed to make up for it with big name actors. btw, Angelina Jolie made the movie at least 2 stars worse. ShE SuCkS BrEhEhE. only part of the movie i can respect was the homosexual character. marvel, we need more of those."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,_________Bad_________
"Aug 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Longest movie ever. Me and my friends love marvel and went to see it together. The cgi was so bad we all laughed the entire ending. Story seemed basic and WAAAY too many characters to care about. Barely remember their names at this point.
"Aug 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not enough screen time for the many characters introduced, the rest is solid"
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this movie was a diabolical attempt to get people to clap like seals

they tried so hard to apeal to as a wide of an audience as they could the butchered what would have been an ok storyline with massive plot hole and badly landed decisions.

one of the worst movies ive ever seen and was forcedto watch it so that ive watched all the marvel movies in order"
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had to watch it more than once to follow everything that happened and I wanted to. Deep story, lots of clever side plots and characters with intertwined back stories and motivations that draw you in. A great twist in the mcu. Was thanos really a villain or was he just trying to slow down the celestials as they destroyed all life? Really creative all around"
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible CGI. Terrible story. I feel like these were the people who kept pestering Marvel to be in a Marvel movie and they just threw something together for these actors.
"Aug 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've only seen it once, but I thought it was stunningly beautiful cinematography with a strong cast. The plot was serviceable but nothing impressive."
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great MCU Movie! Loved seeing new lore for the celestials! An insane post credit scene! Fantastic soundtrack! A must watch!
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way over hated. Choppy, but not the worst movie in the MCU."
"Aug 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Least favorite of all the Marvel movies.  I liked the diversity of the cast and some of them had great chemistry. But the movie was disjointed and some scenes were just unnecessary or bad.  Poor choice of a director.
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,LA MEJOR DE MARVEL DE LOS ULTIMOS A√ëOS
"Aug 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Chloe Zhou, who has the ignominious distinction of having a plutocrat tax-dodger for a dad and lives in Ojai, home of the ""rich n famous"" US TV/Film community directed, or misdirected this stubbed toe of a pointless CGI adventure fantasy. 

Based on a semi-classic Jack Kirby comic book about warring ancient mythologies and the link between human development and alien anthropologists, the film version here is bland and unconvincing. Scenes feel ""big"" but at the same time curiously flat and distant. The combination of classical mythology and pulp that charmed 70s era comic collectors is amiss. 

Given the production workflow nature of these films, I don't think Feige/Disney-Marvel inc. can actually make a film with a distinctive style or voice, but here they made the mistake of cribbing the work of a distinctive, if flawed, creative (Kirby) and making it into something far more processed, but lesser in value."
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I truly don't understand the low reviews this movie received. Chloe Zhao's vision was perfect and the cinematography is astonishing. Finally we could appreciate more artistic approach to a Marvel movie instead of the rest of the franchice's films that start to feel the same after all these years.
"Jul 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While there was potential here, this film didn't have enough time to flesh out each character to where we don't care about them in the third act. If this was a show, it could have been great."
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like that film, its new!"
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE,meilleur marvel de la phase 4 du grand art
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,An absolute snooze fest. I was so close to falling asleep. This movie was boring and you felt every minute of it. The only good part was the final fight scene. hense why it's 2 stars.
"Jul 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I know there are some people that dislike this film, but I thought it was ok, to be honest. I enjoyed it and had a good time for the most part. I thought it was unique for sure."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The post credit scene
"Jul 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was actually good but Sprite ruined it
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Glad to see a quality movie can still be made within the MCU
"Jul 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,When I first watched this film I found it long and boring. On second watch a year and a half later I actually enjoyed it. If you're looking for a good superhero movie look elsewhere but if you like marvel this isn't the worst film they've made
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this movie. The style of filming is awesome and thr serious tone of the story makes this movie great. Also love each character and their arcs
"Jul 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great cast in this one, but the film as a whole was just an enormous bore. Far too long and far too uninteresting"
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly think it was an incredible movie, funny and humorous with a great amount of action. Would definitely recommend family and friends to watch it, and sincerely hope they make a part two."
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie with beautiful pictures, amazing CGI and very good characters. The Actors are all amazing and the story is very interesting. The movie got too much I hate, because it is different. But I love this movie."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was definitely a movie that I watched that's about all
"Jul 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's not like the comic
"Jul 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad Movie. No cohesive Story whatsoever.
"Jul 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Es gran pel√≠cula marvel sabe superheroes me encanta la acci√≥n y mas el villano pero no es tan buena es un 7.7 de 10
"Jul 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's an AMAZING looking Movie with some bad writing and storylines but the action and visual affects are probably the best in the MCU.
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just watched this yesteday and both my wife and I liked and hope they make a part two.   Had avoided it because of bad reviews, needless to say I should know better than ever listening to what the idiot critics say"
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Marvel's movie, no the same repetitive formula and something different."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,An Eternal pile of garbage.  Wow did that stink.
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Adorei o filme, quero o 2!!!!"
"Jul 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Forced an laboured way past the point of fracture. The ravine sized cracks in the story and characters cannot be covered up up by pretty visuals and great direction. 

The film was bland and most of these extremely talented actors looked unconvinced and bored with their own characters."
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really love this movie. It really did the found family thing really good, because I really believe the relationship they have with each other. I do think it could've benefitted from a little more time, so it's a little more fleshed out. I think people don't like it as much because it's not as action-packed as other marvel but I think that just adds to it's charm."
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Potentially the most over-hated MCU project to date. Was it perfect? No. Was it the worst? Far from it. The visuals and cinematography are some of the MCUs best. And the unique direction was fresh. Sure, i'd love more screen time with certain characters, but it was all executed quite well."
"Jul 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oof, that was Rotten"
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,this power th√≠ family so bad
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was hard to connect with the characters throughout along with a tedious story. It did seem to pick up momentum in the final hour.
"Jul 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great, respectful and refreshing superhero movie to watch! I think my favorite take on it is the fact that the duality good guys / bad guys is so much less obvious than in most other Marvel movies. I will change very little of it, and I'll probably watch it again a second time, if not more times than that."
"Jul 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is really good, i like the characters and actors, but it's not that good."
"Jul 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I thought it was a very boring movie, ugly, fake, forced inclusion of Asian characters...truly the worst of the worst superhero movies.
I regret seeing this movie, they should give me my money and time back."
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Remember when, after Raiders of the Lost Ark, some genius at MGM decided to green-light Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold?  Only in this case, Disney released a pale knockoff of its OWN franchise!  It's as if Coke decided to start bottling RC Cola.  Possibly the most WTF decision by a movie studio in history."
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some of the effects are great but that's about it. I really wanted to like this movie because its Marvel and the big name actors. As a veteran, I especially hated that Angelina's character ended up as a big war/PTSD stereotype. Very predictable plot. The movie was also waaaay too long and boring there were several times we almost fell asleep and there was just so much unnecessary scenes/backstories."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst MCU films ever made. Slow and tedious with barely any character development. Cardboard cut-outs standing in for movie actors and a script that will send you into a coma. Don't waste your time.
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I will say Eternals is like every Marvel film, a hero, and a villain, but this time, a villain that has no motive. The plot isn't really attractive. They did the Bill Skarsg√•rd, Kro really dirty. The character was sort of interesting."
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I was scared because I've heard so many bad reviews and I LOVE marvel movies. I was preparing myself to be disappointed. Finally it's was good enough to be enjoyable. Story could be move developed maybe, but would totally go see the second in theater."
"Jun 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst MCU entries yet. A case of biting off more than you can chew and being left with an unsatisfactory result that leaves many questions unanswered.
Would of been better if this was turned into a series rather than a movie."
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite Marvel movies. The concept and execution hits everything I wanted.
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,A lot of people dont like eternals but I enjoyed it
"Jun 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring. Couldn't finish it
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bland and uninspiring, I found it hard to care for the characters. The main redeeming quality was the visuals."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Eternal is very great
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was an absolute WTF moment. What does this movie have anything to do with anything? It feels like it was made with source material from a completely different franchise with no real discernible connection with Marvel other than a smattering of references. The casting choices were questionable, as several of the characters seemed unlikable, monotone, or at worst unbelievable... and that's a low bar to hit for fiction."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I couldn't even finish it
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI action is thrilling and entertaining, the effects (naturally) astounding and general ideals interesting, but Eternals tries to make itself as complicated as possible, and in the progress makes itself near incoherent and the cast is wide and unable to pan time to all of them to make them interesting asides from one gimmick."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,What it this movie even? I was soo bored. I was waiting for all of the characters to just die. This is a disaster movie
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I think they need to make a second one to flesh out the characters - there wasn't enough personality and I think the second one will give it the depth it needs. That said great intro to the new universe and the ending made me ready to see the next one.
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The most underrated movie I've ever seen
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than most of phase 5 MCU movies. Can't wait for Eternals 2. Critics underrated this movie wrong, in my humble opinion."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The critics are insane - the movie was very good! Don't listen to them! They were also saying this is a ""very DC"" movie, to which I also highly disagree - this movie was definitely MCU, not DC. My primary concern was the number of characters, but fear not - we get just enough time to get to know each character, and each character surprisingly has a good character arc and development, with (in my opinion) the exception of one - Makkari, who should have received more time and character development. There were a couple very interesting and very good twists and turns. One minor complaint, there was a scene where suddenly, out of nowhere, a ton of exposition is just dumped on you with no preperation. It caught me waaayyy off guard. Thankfully, even if you don't catch everything from that one giant exposition dump, the rest of the movie keeps talking about it so you do catch on super quick. As with the other Phase 4 movies, it certainly leaves you excited for the future of the MCU!"
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,If this is what comes after endgame the mcu is over. It had a good run though.
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's actually a good movie. Not the best. But new refreshing faces are always welcome in the MCU, its heavily underrated since it have close to none connection yet to the old faces of the verse."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a great storyline but could have been conveyed better. It honestly wasn't that bad but still has some anticlimactic and anti suspense moments.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,i don't care what anyone says i thoroughly enjoyed eternals and how it was different than any other mcu movie to date. the soundtrack was very good as well and i always want to rewatch the movie.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Struggling to choose between the giant sci-fi epic it deserves to be and the tried-and-true traditional Marvel film, Chlo√© Zhao's ""Eternals"" fails terrifically to be a standout (or even somewhat passable) Marvel installment."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a decent film neither too bad now too good but okay. The characterisation of The Eternals is poor and movie felt little bit of stretched feeling except these the movie was okay and one time watchable.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme incr√≠vel, visual magn√≠fico e o elenco √© perfeito."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es preciosa, visualmente es una joya cinematogr√°fica. Los ojos agradecen lo que est√°n viendo durante toda la pel√≠cula. La historia es de or√≠genes y presenta a muchos personajes nuevos e interesantes, pero eso es algo que se toma su tiempo y a veces puede bajar un poco el ritmo. Pero es preferible que asienten unas bases para un futuro apote√≥sico que darte mucha acci√≥n con un mal guion."
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring film, flat acting, so slow...Not good!"
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the only movies I've ever fell asleep while watching
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie. No plot. Villain kills himself from white guilt
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Second worst film in the MCU. Introduces to the eternals who are immortal beings with various powers. There is a big plot twist which I thought was awful and best character is the villain. End credits scenes introduces to tons of new characters in the MCU.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was awful! The movie had to many ideas. It tried to introduce to many villains which lead to a confusing plot and a unsatisfying conclusion. By the end of the movie there was a total of 4 villains! The movie throughs deaths at you which you don't care about because we don't have enough time to learn and care about the people who died. The final battle was anticlimactic. The main character literally just puts her hands on the ground then the movie was over‚Ä¶ The acting was terrible. Especially for the actress of the main eternal who I don't even remember because her character had no personality. Overall this movie rushes its plot packs to many ideas and had no idea what it was doing. 1/5
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A good visually attractive movie . But , could have done more on the story & screenplay with this star studded cast"
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A pleasant surprise, I decided to watch it after rewatching all the older marvel movies and I wasn't disappointed"

"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not as bad as I was anticipating. But still pretty awful in places. The dialogue at times was cringe and felt amateur and devoid of depth. The plot seemed confused and convoluted and internally inconsistent. Selma Hayek was about as interesting to watch as a wet flan. Very bad casting choice. She just seemed like a washed up, 50-something actress who had forgotten how to act. I also couldn't help but sense some woke undertones to the story which undermines trust for me, when I feel like I'm being fed an agenda. And the casting of Eros also left me rolling my eyes, but I'm willing to give him a chance. 

That being said, there were a few surprising elements to the film I actually appreciated. Some of the theology the film explored was quite thought provoking. When viewing the fate of billions and trillions of lifeforms from the perspective of Gods, the trolley problem becomes a whole lot more interesting. To sacrifice the few for the greater good, in this regard, is a much more challenging proposition. I enjoyed seeing things from that angle. 

Also, the visual effects were no less than what you'd expect from a Marvel movie, which is generally fun to watch, and occasionally a little more. Though occasionally cringe at times too. 

The fact that I found myself wanting to see how it ends, I think is also a good sign. I don't have much hope that I'll ever want to watch it again, but it passed the time and wasn't quite as bad as I'd heard. 

One final positive was Gemma Chan as Sersi. I thought she was cool and likeable as the lead and gave a subtle and impressive performance. 

As a contrast, one final negative was Barry Keoghan as Druig. He was creepy and dislikable."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It seems like all the Marvel movies are getting a strange amount of negative reviews.    Maybe it's not as good as the others, but I love this movie and never thought I would get to see this characters on the big screen."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst of the MCU, don't waste your time"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything about this movie was bad, except some of the visuals.  I've watched it 3 or 4 times just for the scenery."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While feeling super disconnected from the MCU and having some pacing issues, the exploartion and introduction of the Eternals is a lot of fun! The first two acts play smoothly but the third act falls victim to the MCU stereotype of having a big CGI battle that feels very predictable. The villain is kinda weak but the first real introduction of The Celestials (in true form) was awesome. And like most Phase 4 movies the setup for the future has my attention more than the movie itself, but ultimately its a fun watch!"
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While it's not as bad as some say, this film still struggles with juggling too many new characters."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt, just skip it. Between the ridiculous overacting and mind-numbingly boring story you're left wondering where this fits into the Marvel universe besides them saying the words ""ironman"" once or twice."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually, beautiful and meditated movie. The director did and splendid work. Simply the closer approach to art than a Marvel movie has achieved."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"People who says that eternsls is a bad and boring movie, obvioulsy is a product of the cancel culture... The movie does a great job giving every character their moments to shine, beautiful filmed and there is great action scenes.. for me its a top 10 marvel movie for sure üëå"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How in the world was this written by the same man who wrote The Truman Show? The dialogue, plot and everything about this movie is juvenile. The cast is good, but the script they had to work with was painful. The scenes were pieced together roughly, the timeline made absolutely no sense and the pacing was all over the place.

I love the concept, don't get me wrong. Produced correctly, I could see In Time as a powerful television series. Unfortunately, a great idea does not make a great final product."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can easily say this was the worst movie I watched in the theatres. No plot, unlikeable characters, didn't feel like a marvel movie at all."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"3 stars:   a major disappointment. I thought this was one of the most ambitious plots for a Marvel movie. It just didn't live up to the ambition. Looking back, I think they just put too much on our plate. We had to follow the eternals through all known history to get to present day in order to make the point of the film. That was just entirely too long. That was plenty of star power, but they were dragged down so far into the plot that the acting became boring. I had to hit the snooze button at least twice. Probably a 2 star or 2.5 star film. But I have to admit that the Special Effects were pretty fantastic for a two-year-old movie. That was enough for a 3 stars to me."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, they shoved some unnecessary plot points in there for inclusion. But overall a good movie."
"May 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was an ok movie. Just hard for me to get into. The movie is just to hard to fathom as a real possibility. With their powers it's dumb they only can fight the machine things.
"May 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too many character with their own stories that make this film Incredible boring to keep up with it.
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great hands DOWN!
"May 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's hard to believe that this movie is in the same universe as Spider-Man. I'm not a marvel expert, I haven't read the comics but I enjoy the movies. I honestly I have no idea what's happening in this movie. It's hard to follow the story line and the movie seems out of place."
"May 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,It has great concept and potential which was not well executed but it's not unbearable. It would have been better if it was a tv series.
"May 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it and so did everybody I talked to....the special effects are great, the story was cool and the premise was different. It hooked us right from the beginning. The suprise twist at the end just worked. I wish they would make a sequel."
"May 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, lame, not exciting and not fun to watch. If you're looking for a movie to fall asleep to with you cute girl friend this movie is perfect !. Brown guy with the camera filming things was pretty funny tho best part of the movie 10/10 for that part"
"May 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tremenda Kgda -10/10 y zzzzz
"May 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overstuffed cast that isn't very memorable. I can't recall most of what happened, and I found it extremely boring. I do appreciate it being different than most MCU movies. It only wasn't executed correctly."
"May 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,https://youtu.be/b1vCgWhIyNc
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito subestimado, n√£o √© igual os outros da Marvel e por isso pessoal n√£o gostou tanto. Mas √© um √≥timo filme."
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a solid marvel movie. Not the best but I don't know why it gets so much hate.
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Each time I watch the film I enjoy it more yet it lacks. It could've been so much more!
It has some amazing shots though."
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,So long and boring. Had a hard time getting through it.
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watching this garbage of a movie you kind of hope they fail. The story has so many flaws. The cast are a diverse group of unlikable diversity hires written by talentless writers who are thrown in as if they had big effects on history. I still cannot fathom why beings that were created as some better beings are such trash and why anything would make such flawed beings including one that is mute... It is also insulting to all inventors that the fat black guy was inventing everything as if humans are idiots, while still acting like an idiot himself... Unlikable characters, bad story writing, and signs of a drop in visuals including the celestial that just disappears from the world by the next Marvel movie, a good example why this is more like terrible fan fiction then a real Marvel movie."
"May 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,it would be an awesome movie if they didnt feel forced to speak about Thanos and the other stuff that happened in the mcu
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Forgetable characters, forgettable story. Don't see the point in making this movie. Even Harry Styles' cameo didn't make it better ;)"
"May 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My friends, family and I rented out a theater to watch Eternals. We expected so much, but we were let down. So many points where the movie wants to peak then‚Ä¶ big let downs."
"May 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie got very negative reviews. So I have no expectations for this film even though Chloe Zhao was an Academy Award winning Director. But surprisingly I liked this film. Except the characterisation the whole movie was good and good attempt for Marvel Studios. Angelina Jolie was totally underutilized.
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This film deserves a 4 hour extended Zhao cut. People just hate on it because they refuse to comprehend it's true scale and it made them feel like the tiny little dumb specs of insignificant nothing that we are. I personally love being reminded of that. More Eternals plz.
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was B.S I was excited for it the trailer looked good the comics are good but this movie disappointed with a thin plot and non memorable characters
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing, bad acting and no coherent plot here, avoid it"
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,eternals more like midternals i blew up when I watched this
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,What an eternal movie !!
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This Movie is unique marvel movie
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's kinda watchable‚Ä¶
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not great, dull action and plot"
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Random and jumbled feeling when thrown into the MCU. Didn't enjoy the feel of it or like the characters.
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm honestly really disappointed in this movie it was not what I expected and it was just a horrible movie with bad script writing
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,The film's pacing is horrible
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Incredibly boring and didn't feel like it fit into the Marvel cinematic universe at all.
"May 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"good cast, convoluted mess of a movie and script, too many characters, no discernible plot."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow that was long, and even after all that time i still don't remeber a single character from this movie. Don't be suprised when you forget that this movie exists."
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,A really bland movie that takes too long to progress and fails to create character arcs for most of the characters. This movie would've been more interesting as a nine-episode Disney+ show.
"Apr 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst Marvel movie ever. Don't know why they got a Indy film director to do this movie. She didn't know what a superhero movie is.
"Apr 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,this is beyond atrocious....
"Apr 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As a marvel fan,it was nice to see something a little more dark than what phase 4 has been giving us but it still has it's flaws,it does get better when I rewatched it and the cgi looks a little off but if you are a fan of marvel or like an Angelina jolie fan the you should watch it"
"Apr 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an original movie, with good characters and a decent plot. It's not an awesome movie, but it's ok."
"Apr 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's alright! Too long though for my liking. I've never seen a movie with so many flashbacks. I didn't fall in love with the cast like I do most Marvel movies, I think they're all very different characters and some of the story didn't make sense. They built up this monster that was taking characters' abilities but then he didn't do anything at the end and got killed in his first fight. 

Overall, I think the movie is worth the watch. The problem with Marvel movies now is that everyone thinks if it's nowhere near Infinity War or End game level then it's automatically a 1 star. People are hard to please. Go watch it, it's not a bad movie at all."
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is one of the worst mcu movies no doubt but it is not terrible like for example the vfx and acting and costumes are beautiful the videography and all of that is amazing the movie suffers mainly from a bad main villain and a below average story I wouldn't watch it again but I think you should at least watch it once and if there is a sequel I wouldn't mind to watch it
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An absolute snoozefest of a movie that was difficult to sit through. Plot holes galore, the story is dull and boring, and it constantly begs the question of ""Why should I care what happens to these people?"" The characters hardly show any emotion, and they aren't enjoyable or memorable to watch in the slightest. In a movie with a large cast, it is crucial to establish personality traits to distinguish the characters from each other, and unfortunately none of the characters had any notable personality. I nearly fell asleep in the second half of the movie. Not recommended whatsoever."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie I have ever watched.
"Apr 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Poorly written and lacking continuity.  Forgettable characters and a disjointed story line. Totally Forgettable
"Apr 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh is the best way of describing this film. There was nothing offensive about it but their isn't much to like either. Their is cast bloat, it's too long for such a shallow story, no growth. And while I do always enjoy watching Angelina Jolie kick ass she's criminally under utilized here. Worst of all this movie kept schizophrenically switching between making you feel guilty of existing(i.e. being an irredeemable human) and humanity is special it must be saved. Be warned you will get whiplash."
"Apr 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Achei bacana os momentos de luta e os efeitos especiais.
Mas achei o filme esquec√≠vel, n√£o foi muito comentado, sendo apenas mais um filme a assistir.
Tem algumas cenas empolgantes mas tamb√©m possui algumas cenas bem paradas.
Em geral o filme √© legal, mas nada impactante."
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eternals"" has a visually stunning presentation and ambitious world-building, but unfortunately falls short in terms of storytelling and character development. The plot is convoluted and the pacing can feel slow at times, which can make it difficult to stay engaged throughout the film. While the cast is talented, the characters lack depth and their motivations are often unclear. Overall, ""Eternals"" may be worth a watch for its impressive visuals, but it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling and coherent narrative."
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It somehow wastes over two and a half hours not developing it's way too many characters with rather flat performances. The dumbest part of this movie has to be at its climax where Ikaris is about to lazer-eyes Sersi then suddenly remembers his love life with her that had pretty much no development in the entire movie and decides to kill himself by flying close to the sun. I'm not even kidding, that's exactly what happens. These characters would've fared so much better in a Tv series with more time to develop each one, unlike some projects that would've been better as a single movie(She-Hulk as a prime example)."
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eternals is generic, boring and out of place. While the characters are doing a great job at portraying their roles and the visuals are stunning, it doesn't excuse it's predictability.

Rating: 31%"
"Apr 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not absolutely horrible, but quite disappointing."
"Apr 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst marvel movies
"Apr 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is torture.
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite an overlong length and underdeveloped characters, Eternals is still a bit underrated."
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eternals is stunning in both cast and visuals, the main thing it lacks is stronger writing and more charisma on screen from certain key leads in its very charismatic cast."
"Apr 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,I watched it on the plane and I turned it off before the halfway point.
"Apr 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad haven't managed to watch all the way through
"Mar 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the chemistry between the main cast, and the plot and lore were very interesting! I think the ending was a little so-so, along with the pacing being a bit off sometimes. But otherwise, it was a really cool movie!"
"Mar 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Miserable. A missed opportunity.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think Eternals is a decent movie, it may not be the best compared to other marvel movies. However, the superhero's abilities and the story line I thought was good. Could it have been better? YES! I wish Salma Hayek wouldn't have died so fast, along with other eternal deaths, and I wish that it would have ended better. My main issue with the movie is how weak they are, they have lived for 7,000 years? And yet they still are learning about their power? Anyways, still love the movie and especially the concept, hope this movie comes out with a second! üíñ"
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely one of my favorite marvel movies. Good long movie that was deep with meaning and action! It was so involved and I never expected how it carried on. Can't wait for the sequel!!!
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I honestly think eternals is one of the best things marvel has put out. I love it!
"Mar 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Buena pel√≠cula, la vi sin expectativas de nada por la gran cantidad de criticas negativas que le√≠ pero al final no comparto eso. Para empezar, no me parece para nada la peor pel√≠cula de Marvel, eso en mi opini√≥n podr√≠a estar entre Thor un mundo oscuro o Iron Man 3. Eternals no me parece una mala pel√≠cula, es buena pero tiene algunos fallos. El mayor fallo que tiene es su duraci√≥n, tranquilamente podr√≠an haber cortado algunas partes, ya que a la vez esto desencadena a otros fallos en mi opini√≥n como el ritmo aburrido y sofocante. El villano es normalito, Kro tiene una buena motivaci√≥n pero al final termina siendo muy irrelevante debido a problemas m√°s grandes como los celestiales. En cuanto a lo bueno, est√°n los personajes principales, Los Eternals, en general est√°n bien, son bien aprovechados y ninguno se siente de relleno, cada uno se siente importante en la pel√≠cula, adem√°s de ser carism√°ticos y bien representados, adem√°s de contar con buenos actores que brindan muy buenas actuaciones como Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Gemma Chan, Barry Keoghan, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, etc. Me gusto como exploran esa parte de la humanidad desde una perspectiva de un dios, como el prop√≥sito de los humanos que se exploran en parte de la cinta que al menos en esta partes no se explayan mucho como lo hacen en el resto de la pel√≠cula. El humor tambi√©n me gusto, no hay mucho como en otras pel√≠culas del UCM pero lo poco que hay me gusto bastante. Los efectos especiales hay que decir que est√°n muy bien, salvo algunas peque√±as cosas que no me llegaron a convencer del todo, pero est√°n mas que aprobados. En conclusi√≥n, una buena pel√≠cula de Marvel, no me parece mala, creo que cuenta una historia interesante con personajes nuevos y carism√°ticos pero falla en algunas cosas como en su ritmo bastante lento y su duraci√≥n muy larga, aunque para mi eso no arruina la cinta. La recomiendo."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"una pel√≠cula locamente sobre odiada a mi parecer , es genial un tono √∫nico mas serio  y diferente en el ucm que nos da mitologia y mas amplia historia en el ucm personajes muy entra√±ables un plow twist que no me vi venir ,efectos maravillosos junto a una filmograf√≠a muy bella de mis pel√≠culas favoritas del ucm solo por detr√°s de joyas que simplemente no puede superar  que no supera"
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, not funny, and writing is terrible"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dumb, predictable, boring."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Could have been good. Just another rush job
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,bom para quem t√™m ins√¥nia.
"Mar 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent movie for superhero fans. 
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie I've every seen, and I've seen em all."
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,So very disappointing. It's a shame Hollywood is more focused on checking all the social boxes rather than making a good movie.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall this was a solid film that moved the overall MCU/MCMv along so that future shows (TV & Movies) have something more than just the new big bad. 
First and foremost, I was entertained. I enjoyed the new characters and the new ideas that were separate than the Infinity Saga. There was a lot going on and some may question decisions since they can't see how this film will effect the future storyline. Let's face it, if Thena was 100% she would've whipped everyone's derriere. Mark my words, the events of this film will be send ripples thru the MCU for many movies and series to come. The new characters will grow in the same capacity as our earthly heroes have since the OG Ironman film. 
I'm looking forward to the next installment."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eternals es algo completamente nuevo y diferente a lo que se vio en el MCU al presentar nuevos personajes que no se sab√≠a que siempre estuvieron ah√≠. A diferencia de las otras pel√≠culas de este universo, aqu√≠ tenemos un film que tiene m√°s argumento, pero puede ser tedioso para algunos que ya est√°n acostumbrados a las dem√°s pel√≠culas de Marvel. Puede llegar a aburrir ya que requiere de much√≠sima atenci√≥n. Los personajes a pesar de ser nuevos, tienen algo interesante y lo m√°s destacable de esta pel√≠cula es que se toma su trama muy en serio y tiene incluso una cosmolog√≠a por la parte de Los Celestiales y el origen de Los Eternos y Los Desviantes lo cual me pareci√≥ bastante fascinante y da cierta profundidad. Si tuviera que mencionar sobre la diversidad en los personajes, la verdad creo que est√° bien. Cada uno de Los Eternos es √∫nico a su modo y eso les da una cierta originalidad aunque hab√≠a m√°s que se tendr√≠a que haber explorado. Los Eternos no es la mejor pel√≠cula de Marvel, pero tampoco la peor y al final es un film decente y peculiar al ser algo fuera de lo que Marvel hac√≠a. La califico con un 8/10."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is a good movie hiding in here, but it is a terrible Marvel movie. The story being told out of order also removes any urgency that we are supposed to feel, and we don't care enough about all of the characters because they try to make ALL of the Eternals main characters. Focus on 2 or 3, not 10."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. It was a bit on the long side but had excellent cinematography, good story and for the most part decent acting"
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it!  I think fan expectations are tainting otherwise enjoyable films.  Plus, we finally get a director who wants REAL BACKGROUNDS, and we punish them with bad reviews... back to Quantumania with all you critics!"
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,They chose the wrong time to introduce the eternals it would of made more sense to see a post credit scene at end of infinity war with them deciding as a team to intervene against thanos an ask arishem for advice on what to do an then have arishem order them to stop thanos because if he wins no celestial will be born on earth which is what the celestials goal is all about so I doubt arishem would be cool with thanos ruining his game plan which has been in the works for thousands of years
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I am giving it 3 stars because for me it was pretty boring, nothing super interesting and they killed the characters that I actually liked and not enough of the other characters. saw it on opening weekends in theaters and haven't rewatched it since.  critics were way to harsh on this film for the wrong reasons."
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst marvel movie I've seen so far. First of all way too long, the acting is mostly boring and bad. The story is ok, but it goes way too far into details for characters that most people have never heard of or care about. IronMan showed us that there is a good way to do a movie for characters like that. Eternals has shown us there is definitely also a wrong way. I haven't seen how any of these people play into the rest of the MCU yet, and I can't imagine ever watching this movie again. There aren't many films I actively dislike, but here's one. 4.5/10"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie I'd watch it again. I will say it could have been better not much bet still better.
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"no logic, story like a piece of s h i t"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good I loved it and loved the scenes at the end. I can't wait to see The Black Knight, and Star Fox in the MCU."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,i really like this movie i love this movie my favoret movie
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,action and CGI is so cool and i like all the character
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,i like how eternals introduce and i cant wait to see them again in the mcu
"Feb 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is the worst mcu film and not that much character development.
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The ""professional critics"" of the rotten base their criticisms on humor, because it is not possible for this film to be inferior to Thor Love and Thunder, it has an absurdly superior narrative and graphic quality. It lacks action, but it gives us interesting, deep characters and a feeling that something great is coming. Unlike any Thor movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I just watched it and might I say I was very skeptical at first but I had an amazing ride and the ending was wild !
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMAZING WAY TO INTRODUCE CELESTIALS IN THE MCU AND THE BEST CGI IN WHOLE MCU! and overall great movie 4,5/5 PEAK!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent. A grand scheme in the multiverse. Loved it!
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This may be the worst big budget movie I have ever seen. It steals away a portion of your life you can never get back.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie would work on paper. You get a more serious movie with a hidden enemy that isn't revealed right off the bat. But odd cuts to what I consider unimportant scenes, poorly made exposition dumps, and underdeveloped characters with stationairy motivions drag the movie down. They don't explain important things, and characters just kind of do stuff."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I personally loved the movie! I thought the characters were great; also loved the storyline.
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very boring and underwhelming. Had a lot of potential, especially with Icarus, but dropped the ball hard"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,second least favorite so far behind capt marvel.   good visuals but story was just meh
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly a lot of people have given this movie flak, but it's way better than half recent movies marvel have brought out. 
Interesting story, great cast and just a real nice change of pace to the usual marvel movie formula, which I personally have been over after the first few movies from marvel."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good introduction to a whole new cast of characters.  I liken it to Guardians of the Galaxy, but with a different tone; whereas Guardians was a comedy, this was more of a historic piece (or more a re-imagined history).  Give it a chance, ignore the ""professional"" critics, decide for yourself."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plot was weak, characters were meh. Not a good movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so amazing. A breath of fresh air. I dont why these fake ""critics"" hated such an awesome movie. I watched this movie like 5 times now. Chloe Zhao created one of the best speeder scenes ever in movie history! We want more Eternals!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eternals. Simplemente hermosa, la fotograf√≠a y los efectos, de los personajes no tengo mucho que decir, y aunque va a su propio ritmo es genial, dejaron muchas preguntas sin responder pero aun as√≠ la arquitectura de esta pel√≠cula esta buena"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! Something new for Marvel. But I very much appreciated the movie and it's characters.
"Feb 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie üé• I hate it god
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Falt√≥ algo m√°s, no es mala"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This film in particular shows that an Oscar winner behind the camera can't make the film good either. One of the most boring stories with at least good ideas meets characters that are more one-dimensional than the floor in front of the Mona Lisa.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is so refreshing and interesting and I'm bummed I missed it in theaters. Beautiful, sweeping, and weird like a bunch of awkward gaslit alien androids would be. I want more legitimate tonal difference in my MCU!"
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Eternals"" (2021) is a superhero film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Chlo√© Zhao and starring a talented ensemble cast including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, and more. The film follows the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who have lived among humanity for thousands of years, as they come together to protect Earth from their enemies, the Deviants.

The film boasts stunning visuals, with its lush and fantastical world-building and stunningly realized special effects making it a feast for the eyes. The film also has an engaging and complex plot that weaves together several different story threads and characters in a satisfying way.

The direction by Chlo√© Zhao is top-notch, with a confident and clear vision that brings the film's fantastical elements to life. However, some viewers may find the film's pacing slow, with long stretches of character development and world-building that may prove a challenge for those seeking non-stop action.

Overall, ""Eternals"" (2021) is a visually stunning and emotionally engaging superhero film that will appeal to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the genre. While it may be a bit slow-paced for some viewers, it is a well-executed and beautifully realized film that is well worth checking out."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"so underrated, mcu at his best!!"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as Critics claimed but still nothing crazy,good acting and action...just very long and at times boring very forgettable film unfortunately"
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There were characters in this movie that I really liked individually! Especially Phastos (who knocked it out of the park with the humor, along with Kingo). So good acting for the most part, except for Angelina Jolie, who is not good at being sad and at crying. Plus, Richard Madden looks very similar to Sebastian Stan/Bucky, and they could've easily casted someone else to play his role.

The action sequences were pretty cool to look at too, some good grand fun! And the ending was a real shocker with the main villain, just wait and see!

The main issue with the film though is that it's so jumbled for someone who doesn't follow the comic books closely enough. I found myself getting confused and not fully comprehending the mythology, leaving me with many questions and making it so that I was loosely following the film, instead of being on the same page with it. Some of the character motivations and relationships didn't make much sense as well, and I feel like earlier MCU films are easier to follow since most are already familiar with the characters and their origin stories are simpler to understand. I didn't care for the deviants one bit either. Overall, not bad, but definitely not my favorite Marvel film or one I'd watch again. It was meh, and I expect greatness from most of not all Marvel films. Maybe I shouldn't anymore."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wish they explained more about the ‚ÄúEternals,‚Äù I wish they explained more about who they were, individually. I wish that there was more ‚Äústories‚Äù to them after they were separated."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,i for one enjoyed it more than many others
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Watch if you want‚Ä¶ I didn't care for it much.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the cinematography and the script.  Different from what is expected from Marvel, but considering the latest releases, maybe that's why I liked it so much comparatively."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a special movie.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a little slow paced and at the same time tried to do too much with so many new characters but it is a good watch and loved the graphics
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think this film was marketed incorrectly, instead of being marketed as an action epic, this should have been promoted as a family drama that is comprised of Superheroes."
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I went into this move optimistic but boy was I wrong, this movie was not worth wasting the time seeing literally the worst movie I've ever seen, would rate it a 0 if I could."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know why the critics gave this such a low grade. I loved it. The entire cast is outstanding. It's a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I can't wait until the 2nd one comes out.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is another great superhero movie. Better storyline and visual effects than Black Panther 2 and Thor 3.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Underated movie, give it a chance may suprise you"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very bland, very boring. There's a ton of characters and they barely flesh out any of them. Wouldn't recommend"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I left the theater when I ran out of popcorn. I was upset with myself for buying the largest size as I had to see almost half of this movie. I never did find out how it ended and I'm fine with that.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Gostei bastante do filme
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film's biggest problem is the main characters. In fact, I was expecting to see Angelina Jolie as Thena, fighting and facing the villains and I ended up getting a special participation from her. Disappointing. The protagonists are bland and were outclassed by the secondary characters even with little screen time. If the movie had focused on Thena taking on deviants, it might have been more compelling to watch."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Was waiting for this movie for some time and wasn't disappointed when I finally got to watch it.
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film was a mistake to make and a mistake to see. Even commies will OD on this wokestacy....Also, f the c*ensorship on this site"
"Feb 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,The best part of the movie was the speedster vs the ikarus.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice addition to the mcu. Very different from what i‚Äôm used to. Amazing visuals and great cast. Interesting plot. 
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"By far the worst super hero movie in the last 2 decades.  If this came out in the 90s I think we'd overlook a plot that tried to do way too much with so little.   As it is, it's not even worthy of being in the DC universe."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"By far worst marvel movie..spent to much time ""checking the boxes not entertaining."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although flawed, this is an entertaining watch with some good performances. The actor playing Druig is the least likeable character so I hope he is a future villain. Perfect creepy villain, shockjing hero. I don't think this is the worst Marvel film, certainly not after Ant Man 3. Enjoyable overall."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly really enjoyed this film, seeing it in theaters and then seeing the reviews I am still perplexed. Eternals was a solid action movie that leans towards the cosmic bigger entities in the Marvel Universe and really opened the doors to bigger and badder villains to show in the MCU on top of having a fantastic cast. Is it your typical super hero movie? No but they aren't truly super heroes or atleast not meant to be. The villains do fall a bit flat but I think that's the point when you see the whole story. Don't get the hate I'd say give it a watch."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Interesting characters, uninteresting plot"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Underrated but not great at the same time.
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Big script problems, stereotypical characters and confusion in the ending"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eternals se destaca mas que todo por sus efectos especiales pero se desvia mucho de la trama, cuenta con un elenco que se considera aceptable pero hasta la fecha se considera innecesaria y fuera de lugar"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,not as good as the others but a good movie
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While I admit that Eternals was visually stunning, the plot left a lot to be desired... especially for fans who are neurodivergent."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor cgi da marvel 
Foge da f√≥rmula original de uma forma maravilhosa 
Grande hist√≥ria, bons personagens 
Espero que tenha uma sequ√™ncia"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ame la pelicula, diferente a la formula de marvel, increibles personajes y excelente guion, ademas de unos paisajes hermosos"
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrendous movie. Nothing about this movie works. The characters are undeveloped, the plot is confusing and we don't know if the Eternals are heroes or villains. This movie fails in every level of the Marvel formula that has worked for over 10 years."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good movie overall, but not worth to watch at movie(g*y guy ruined it)"
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Acho engra√ßado que quando a Marvel faz filme gen√©ricos do estilo Marvel √© criticada, quando arrisca e faz algo diferente tamb√©m. A√≠ fica dificil.
EU gostei do filme. Est√° longe de ser dos meus favoritos, mas eu curti. O filme tem uma fotografia e um CGI muito lindo. Os personagens no total s√£o legais e eu gostei de ver eles juntos, mas achei que poderiam ter sido mais desenvolvidos. Eu achei que o filme demorou a passar, achei ele bem lentinho, mas curti. A hist√≥ria √© meio confusa, mais mesmo assim √© legal de acompanhar."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie, very aesthetic, one of my personal fav"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amei o filme, sensacional, alguns personagens s√£o meio chatos, mas n√£o interfere na experi√™ncia, o Ikaris √© SENSACIONAL, espero que ele retorne e um futuro filme."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie and watch it any month^^
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Taking place 5 years after the events of 'Avengers: Endgame' and during the events of 'Spider-Man: Far from Home' Marvel Studios presents their next big team of superheroes Directed by Chloe Zao she assembles a very rich, diversified cast in this long roster from Angelina Jolie to Salma Hayek to Brian Tyree Henry to Richard Madden to Kumail Nanjiani to Gemma Chan to Lia McHugh to Lauren Ridloff to Don Lee to Barry Keoghan After Thanos wiped out half the universe and Tony Stark bringing everyone back due to his sacrifice it provided the necessary energy to create an event called the Emergence; basically this would wipe the slate clean on planet Earth for other worlds to exist 7,000 years ago beings called Eternals gifted with immortality and amazing powers arrived from the planet Olympia or did they?; they were instructed to not interfere with human history or conflicts by Celestials unless creatures called Deviants were involved The Eternals comprise of 5 fighters and 5 thinkers; Ikaris who can fly, shoot beams from his eyes, and have superhuman strength, Makkari who has super speed and is deaf, Thena the goddess of war who can create all kinds of weapons, Sersi who can manipulate matter, Druig who can control people's minds, Kingo who's a Bollywood star but more joking than anyone that can fire projectiles from his hands, Phastos who can control any type of technology, Ajak who can heal people, Gilgamesh who can deliver super powered punches, and Sprite who can create illusions Even though they've shaped our cultures and civilizations since the dawn of time it's a heavy burden for them all they couldn't lift a finger to help humanity, heck they even explain why they didn't help the Avengers during the Infinity Saga Now with the Emergence on the rise these immortal warriors have to band together to protect what they now hold dear even going against their prime directive Kros, is one their many obstacles being in charge of the Deviants making them believe they can't protect humans next to Jemiah the Analyzer who created the Eternals and Arishem, their master The Deviants themselves are evolving as well almost matching all the Eternals‚Äô abilities This is also the 3rd longest MCU entry next to 'Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame' This is a long one but still good for any of the fans that have been keeping with this franchise since 2008; brings all the enjoyment you‚Äôd expect albeit minor flaws included It takes some getting used to the exposition But the action is impressive, love the big world building, this rich diverse cast, the costumes, and it opens more of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in multiple directions Love this musical score too Ajax is the almighty leader yet she can‚Äôt let anyone interfere with human history lest them hindering their natural evolution, Kingo is the funny comic relief with his Bollywood personality, Sprite is the free youthful spirit being that she‚Äôs stunted in her growth being an immortal teenager, Sersi is the heart of the group feeling she used to have a romance with Ikkaris, Thena is the fierce warrior sticking to her duties yet she‚Äôs feeling weak with her memories since she‚Äôs been around for eons, Druig wishes everyone should have a common ground, Gilgamesh is the calming one for Thena, and Phastos feels ashamed of his tinkering considering how humans have used machines to kill each other so he‚Äôs found human connection living a domestic life This entry is more dramatic than bombastic or cartoony which might not sit well with many; The villains are kinda lame to be honest with Kro only being in here for 5 min and Arishem who‚Äôs kinda sitting in the background a lot of the time It stinks 2 characters in here are axed off quick being part of this main dysfunctional family A lot of the environments feel empty and boring since it‚Äôs a lot of deserts, oceans, grass fields, beaches and volcanoes Still, it does show how others involved with humanity's development would've shifted things allowing us to evolve, thrive, learn from our mistakes Human nature is what it is; sometimes it's unavoidable or not our place to change what has to unfold Without our flaws and mistakes we couldn‚Äôt stand out or learn to be better Chloe Zhao knows her characters and their interpersonal relationships, she has them dig deep into themselves about whether they should do more than what they were made for or not bother getting attached to a planet inhabited by humans (or beings not like them) It‚Äôs definitely a heavy toll being immortal and having to watch over civilizations far slower than others as far as weapons and modern technology One of those rare superhero films to make the viewer think and reflect The casting here is also a true profession of representation in film as far as the queer community and the deaf I‚Äôm anxious to see how more films will play out The mid credits scene is crazy and the after credits scene....very ambiguous It‚Äôs a lot of mystery for the future to unfold that‚Äôs for sure 25 movies in and Marvel Studios is still showing their love and passion for an ever-expanding multitude of stories from the pages of the comics This one isn‚Äôt perfect and will be very divisive but you can tell they are trying to open more doors for further adventures and that‚Äôs fine by me being a comic book movie lover! "
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marvel's Eternals is a serviceable superhero movie, but it's weighed down by its star power and clunky story. The Eternals team consists of otherworldly beings sent to Earth to foster the growth of life and bid never to interfere with the wars of man. Their main purpose is to protect humanity from giant dinosaur-like creatures called deviants who feast on intelligent life. The premise is quite simple, and outside of a couple of twists it never gets more complicated than that, nor does it need to. Instead, the story gets bogged down by its too-numerous cast of characters. These Eternals are a race of immortal beings sent to Earth by an all-powerful Prime Celestial, so why do we as viewers care about who loves whom? It's one of the drivers of conflict throughout the film but between the Eternals not being human and the lack of focus given to any one of them due to time constraints, it might make a viewer roll their eyes. It's not just the overly emotional connections for which the film does little to earn, there's a palpable lack of wisdom for a group who have lived on Earth since the times of Sumerian culture. There exists a strange balancing act in this film between presenting the Eternals as alien and above the fray, but also as human and deeply flawed. Unfortunately those two themes never find a way to mix well together. If one can forgive the pedestrian story driven by lukewarm character building there are good things at play here. First, the acting is solid. The roster is incredible, though overstuffed, and everyone here is certainly capable of handling their role. But no one really stands out either, another unfortunate side effect of cramming too many big names into one film. The special effects and fight choreography are both stunning, with every fight scene cleanly spliced together and every epic bad guy looking real life sharp. The final fight scene alone is probably worth the movie's chunky runtime. But apart from those aspects this film is largely bland, just an A to B story that's built to appear grander than it really is."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,for me is a nice movie.
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For the most part it was okay, but the plot dragged on and I wish it had less characters."
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Eternals is the most boring and dull MCU movie of all time.
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An hour shorter and it might have been ok, but falls into the usual marvel trope of overlong never ending action sequences. Just a bit boring at the end of the day"
"Feb 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,It‚Äôs only saving grace is its occasional action sequences.
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Chlo√© Zhao's addition to the ever-expanding Marvel universe is a refreshing take on Marvel Studios' classic formula. ‚ÄòEternals' includes a star-studded cast that includes Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani. This latest edition to the MCU is an emotional tale about human connection that features brilliant world-building and an unexpected layer of maturity for a superhero film.

Zhao brings viewers a story that takes place across 7000 years, spanning over a lengthy 157-minute runtime. In fact, the long runtime makes ‚ÄòEternals' the second longest MCU film, coming in 2nd place to the 2019's ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame'. ‚ÄòEternals' features solid performances from its diverse main cast. The film features both Marvel's first deaf superhero (played by ‚ÄòThe Walking Dead's Lauren Ridloff), and the MCU's first openly gay superhero (portrayed by ‚ÄòSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' star Brian Tyree Henry). ‚ÄòEternals' tells the story of an immortal race of superpowered beings, known as Eternals, brought to earth by another race of superpowered beings called Celestials. Sent by the Celestials to rid Earth of creatures called Deviants, the Eternals reside among civilisations throughout our history, helping humanity progress and develop while protecting them from the Deviants. But when they learn the truth of their existence, the Eternals must try and stop the destruction of Earth that has been brought on by an apocalyptic event known as ‚ÄòThe Emergence', an explosive event that follows the birth of a Celestial.

Despite following Marvel's continuously recycled formula, ‚ÄòEternals' manages to inject something new and exciting into the MCU with Zhao's brilliance as a director carrying across into the detailed world-building and Ben Davis' naturalistic cinematography. Zhao also reunited with crew from her 2020 Best Picture winner, ‚ÄòNomadland' cinematographer Joshua James Richards, serving as a camera operator for the film. ‚ÄòEternals' isn't the first film to fall victim to Marvel's current stream of second-rate CGI, recent releases like ‚ÄòShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' and ‚ÄòBlack Widow' have also featured some questionable visual effects. Although, Zhao's unwillingness to use green screen and visual effects allows ‚ÄòEternals' to feature stunning natural locations that bring places like Mesopotamia, Babylon and the Amazon rainforest to the screen. The acclaimed director pays homage to her previous film ‚ÄòNomadland' by including scenes set in South Dakota, as seen in the 2020 drama. ‚ÄòIron Man' and ‚ÄòGame of Thrones' composer Ramin Djawadi returns to Marvel to provide ‚ÄòEternals' with a melodic, pleasant-sounding score.

Like every other Marvel project, the future of the vast universe is hinted at in a variety of ways. ‚ÄòEternals' paves the way for various upcoming projects including Mahershala Ali's upcoming film ‚ÄòBlade and a possible sequel while also introducing new characters like Dane Whitman/Black Knight (played by ‚ÄòGame of Throne's Kit Harington) and Thanos' brother Eros, also known as Starfox (played by none other than Harry Styles). ‚ÄòEternals' deals with more tender themes than some of the other films in the MCU, including human connection, what it means to be human and family. The film also brings an immense amount of diversity to the MCU, including characters of all ages, ethnicities, abilities, and sexualities to the screen. ‚ÄòEternals' marks itself as a turning point for the Marvel universe as the studio is finally acting on it's promise to include characters from all backgrounds and cultures. The film is one of the more mature features to come from Marvel Studios, the film delves into deeper themes than most of Marvel's previous features and the film also includes the MCU's first sex scene, albeit brief enough for the film to keep its 12A/PG-13 rating.

Featuring a star-studded cast and fresh visuals, Chlo√© Zhao's ‚ÄòEternals' is a new, exciting film that shows audiences that superhero films can be cinematic and introspective, while also delivering thrilling fight sequences and intense action. Building on the history of the MCU, and also the future, ‚ÄòEternals' is a tender story that allows viewers from all backgrounds to feel represented and included."
"Feb 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,‚ÄòEternals' is an art-house director's film. And it works‚Ä¶ until it doesn't. More: https://bit.ly/3K0Xc3m
"Feb 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie generated, a lot of hate, and I see why, the director definitely shouldn't not have been the director, and it should've been given to somebody that had more skills, rather than somebody who was trying to make a tree look pretty. Ultimately, I enjoyed the cast, and I enjoyed this movie, that's why I did not score it low. I have watched it multiple times, but it's one of those movies that you can fast-forward through parts of the film to get to the better parts of the film. And I never wanna watch a movie where I feel like I can fast forward to the next part. So this movie is definitely a decent watch, but it's not a great watch. The biggest let down is the end credit scenes go nowhere, it's been way too long, and none of these characters have appeared anywhere else there was no development, it felt like it was just thrown in there."
"Feb 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Feel very devoid of story, also they kill Salma Hayek's character in the first ten minutes. Lacks personality and I found it hard to care for any of the characters."
"Feb 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"poor casting , poor pacing , poor storyline , kinda dull. i expect more from Marvel to be honest. whoever gave this the green light needs a talking to."
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,That's a movie I would show to someone who's not into superhero films... it doesn't use any of the tropes from that genre and it's basically good sci-fi.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"one of my all time favorite marvel movies

loved the characters and plot
very overhated because people don't like new things"
"Feb 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eternals has some fascinating ideas and its ambition, visuals and action sequences are praiseworthy, however it is a drab and tedious movie that doesn't capitulate on its ambition and has uninteresting characters, a poorly executed plot and an overall lack of urgency ultimately making it a disappointing installment in the MCU."
"Feb 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too many characters and too much going on. My least favorite MCU movie.
"Feb 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is boring and has way too many characters shoved into it. I really hope they don't do a sequel, but I appreciate the attempt and the actors trying their best."
"Feb 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"We began watching the movie, got bored after every continuous, high steam pressure moment.  Everyone was constantly on the edge of extreme emotion. When I finally saw the big picture I no longer cared.  There was so much story condensed into the movie I lost interest in every one.   After the resolution, the movie took too long to finish then the post story was ridiculous."
"Feb 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely the worst MCU film. A lot of the TV shows feel like they're bloated and should just be a movie. This movie feels like it's trying to do too much and should've been a TV show. It's just so boring and nonsensical. The idea of a Celestial coming out of the ground, or hovering in space, not having any bearing on the MCU as a whole really shatters the illusion that these MCU films take place in the same universe."
"Feb 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The mangled character naming reeks of desperate trademark conflict avoidance with the Greek mythology.
The story is boring and inconsistent, the dialog is pack full of cheesy lines, but not the funny cheesy kind, the boring cheesy.
I had to watch it in 3 parts because I kept falling asleep.
Angelina looks like a baboon butt with those ridiculous oversized lips."
"Feb 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only representation in this movie was lots of diverse sucking
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Eternals is not a typical smash and grab MCU movie.  It is a well balanced story about a group of close friends that spans millions of years.  The story is as big as the creation of life in our universe, yet comes down to the choices we make for those we love.  Some characters are given more time than others to develop, but each has their own unique fascinating path of need and desire.  The pain and struggle of the Ikaris and Sprite characters alone pull at your heart as their inner turmoil is revealed throughout.  From the opening scene until the end the actors and story had my attention, of my favorite MCU movies I never tire of watching again.  A wonderful story I hope @ChloeZhao will follow up on :)"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A very rewatchable MCU movie
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a good stand alone film.
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie has suffered from the loneliness of a studio that failed to recognize the failings all too common with their DC counterparts:  Too many characters in a movie means no one has time to engage and connect with those characters.  The representation attempt could have been improved and i think this story would have been greatly improved by making this movie into at least two stories; one for us to see the character's histories as more than a flashback and the sequel to give us the story that felt so 'stuffed' into this package.
"Jan 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I like the actors just didn't enjoy movie felt like just another marvel movie to make money.
"Jan 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Holy guacamole that knock of cyclops is lit. Let's go this is the best super hero team yet. Loser you thought avengers were good we'll wait until you see eternals in all of their glory. When I was in the theater I was blessed eternally. The eternals made me feel safe especially one in particular most may know IT as the greatest superhero of all time but I just no IT as master Sprite. Anytime master sprite came on the screen all my fears left me like a hot air balloon into the clouds all my grief and sorrow took flight out of my body like a golden eagle in the sky. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!!!!!! It is too good when I say tooo good I mean tooooooooooooooooo goooooood. I can't get over how graceful Master sprite is it has captivated my mind ever since I left the theatre. I AM A NEW MAN. The MCU will never be the same and this movie is unparalleled by any other movie. Thank you.
"Jan 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is probably one of the worst Marvel productions the public has seen for quite some time. It's story does not get the details and the time it deserves and it fells a little bit superficial in the way that it leaves most of the main aspects of the comics' story out of the movie. Also the plot feels a little distant from the comics' story as in the comics it mainly focuses on the origins, roles and story of the celestials and in this movie the main focus is on the eternals. Overall it is not a bad movie but it had the potencial to be one of the most interesting stories in the entire MCU."
"Jan 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good special effects with uninteresting heroes and villans and medicore plot and acting. Average film and too long.
"Jan 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's good, I guess. The action is pretty good and the story will definitely excite some people, but it can drag on, and some of the people I really wanted to see more of died too soon."
"Jan 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was SO confusing to follow with it constantly hopping back and forwards to past and the present day! I, still to this day, can't find out what the movie's plot was doing!"
"Jan 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A mismatch of cast, characters and plots which did not gel well at all. Overblown with several plots points which started to say something interesting but never actually finished anything. The storyline seems to pander to inclusivity, which overall would be a positive step, however when this comes at the cost of character development it is hard to justify. The humour is misplaced and doesn't land well. Worst of all, at almost 3 hours long it was a slog to get through."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good storyline and exciting action. There were a lot of introductions in this MCU edition, which made it complex but similar to many of the other films. I like the diversity of the cast, and references to myths around the world. I never read the comics from old."
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,If the run time wasn't so much then I could have probably enjoyed the film more. Other than that everyone plays their role perfectly.
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was Ok. The Main issues are there are too many characters, its unfocused for half the runtime, there is next to no emotion, charm or jokes from any of the acting and really the film lacks a solid identity. There really isn't anything truly broken about it. Everything is passable fundamentally speaking besides the editing. The music is just ok as well. Honestly I'd say watch this only if your a hardcore super hero movie fan. Otherwise its not worth the long run time."
"Jan 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, contrived and directionless"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Underrated movie. Good characters. Great Cinematography. Funny, Cinematic."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great actions, great cinematography, great characters, and great humor. Villain was a little weak but still was super enjoyable. Grand in scale!"
"Jan 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Certainly a contender for 1 of the top 3 worst marvel films to date.
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eternals is breathtaking. Its visuals are beyond stunning, its score excellently reflects the ancient nature of the Eternals, as well as their power and suffering, and the characters are fresh, complex, and unique. The story is essentially the philosophical ""trolley problem"" on a galactic scale, which is a genius idea for an MCU movie. The plot is unpredictable, ever-changing, and every character's motivation is clear, providing for an excellent plot-twist antagonist. However, the deeper themes and complexity of the film seem to have gone over most people's heads.
It's interesting that Eternals is hated on while similar movies such as ""Dune"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" are praised. All 3 have similar strengths (breathtaking visuals and unique tone) and similar weaknesses (far too much time spent in exposition leading to a long runtime, too many characters to introduce). My theory is that MCU fans decided against this film before it even released, as evidenced by the ""review bombing"" that took place before release date. Yes, the film had a lot of characters to introduce, but a movie can't be simultaneously too packed and too slow, which are the two biggest criticisms Eternals received. Due to the contradicting criticisms, my thoughts are that in reality these fans are more action-oriented as opposed to strength of story. 
Eternals is a film that will grow in popularity over time. Due to its massive, complex nature, the re-watchability is much higher than most MCU films. If you love the film, spread the word. If you didn't love it, I urge you to give it another chance, as its complex story and broken family dynamic allows for an emotional power not common in the MCU."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely underrated. My two notes:
- Don't go in expecting a superhero movie. Go in looking for a movie in the MCU's Universe.
- The pacing is slow at times. Let it be. Not every moment needs adrenaline"
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, while a new direction to the Marvel universe is welcomed, I'm not sure how I feel about this one. There's plenty of fun to be had, but it requires a bit more work from the viewer than previous Marvel films. It's dialogue-heavy, and, at times, I felt confused by the story and vague new direction. Again, action scenes are fun but generally dark; otherwise, it's a stunning film visually. Eternals is a big change, and the question is, are fans ready? For me, this film certainly warrants a repeat viewing, which I hope will win me over more significantly."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't get the hate. I loved this one. Can't wait for the sequel!
"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie was just really bad. The story was rushed and the movie itself introduced many characters that will barely be in the MCU timeline. The movie had great characters but just bad story line. You might not have the same opinion but this is mine.
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eternals redefine os filmes de super her√≥i e os eleva,enquanto prepara o que ainda vir√° por a√≠"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie a little slow but then it picked up the pace a must see I don't see why it's getting all this hate it was amazing show.
"Dec 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,Its long but it has some good parts but the red hair girl was soooo bad
"Dec 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"UUUHHH... OK, it's not that bad. It's fine, probably the most mediocre MCU movie of all time. While it's not great, there are a lot of great stuff in it. The cinematography... Chefs kiss 3!! Kingo and his cameraman are hilarious and easily carry the movie. To the bad, i guess. The story is so lackluster, as there are no stakes in a end-of-the-world story, especially if it's in a cinematic universe with other movies releasing afterwards. None of the characters, except for Kingo, are so bland and uninteresting and it doesn't really make sense that the mute person does sign-language and points on her wrist, like a wristwatch, which doesn't exist in the caveman era when she does it. I went on a tangent there, oops! Fine action, fine character. Yeah Idk, it's just a really bland movie."
"Dec 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"another instantly forgettable marvel movie that looks like a minimum effort by all involved, quality, not quantity is what the audience wants"
"Dec 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,Nice photography but the movie himself is boring and you do not fill any empathy for the characters.
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"Uno dei film meglio realizzati della Marvel.
La fotografia √® straordinaria con scenari mozzafiato e con luci naturali che rendono il tutto pi√π realistico.
Trama complessa e ben sviluppata(Non su tutti i pg) e personaggi ben caratterizzati.
Attori perfetti per i ruoli e ben sviluppati sul grande schermo.
Combattimenti eccezionale ma che non invadono il film.
In sostanza, io non comprendo come una piattaforma del genere permetta ai bomber reviewing di affondare un film solo perch√® a priori l'idea non √® piaciuta."
"Dec 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the weakest Marvel movies... Tons of potential for MCU growth but fell flat. No mention of the heroes in other Marvel movies either yet... so it seemed extremely at random that they would release this movie. Easily could have connected things with Guardians of the Galaxy but they decided to introduce a blip preface to the Marvel vampire stuff...
"Dec 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was a refreshing change of pace for Marvel. I enjoy most of the MCU movies and this one is definitely in my top 5. 

I enjoyed the scope of the story, how it wove its way through the span of human history and threaded itself through the existing cannon of the MCU. 

The ensemble cast of characters was well handled and the story had some energizing depth to it. I like that it didn't follow the well practiced Marvel formula and gave us something really quite grey and subjective to explore.

I hope they have the confidence to explore these characters and the implications of the film further. I feel like this movie has added a lot to the tapestry of the MCU"
"Dec 16, 2022",POSITIVE,This is a great film and deserves a sequel just bravo.
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"O filme em minha opini√£o e um dos melhores da atual faze, claro ficando apenas uma posi√ß√£o atr√°s de Wakanda Forever! Tem personagens interessantes e uma nova equipe que pode ser explorada ainda mais nos futuros filmes."
"Dec 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,Absolutly the worst Marvel film in history
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a pretty fast moving thrill. I liked the history of the Eternals, the Earth, and the universe shown here. I hope there's a sequel and more of the Deviants who were given free will and an ability to evolve."
"Dec 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,Oof that was rotten. God bless!
"Dec 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Definition of an ""OK"" film. The bigger picture of what the premise was going for is quite unique from the other MCU films. Nonetheless the film can't execute the grand ideas properly as a consequence of the redundant amount of characters, underdeveloped relationships, and focus on the wrong character arcs. Visuals have to be the #1 stand out."
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Beautifully shot, with characters that are a lot more personable than their comic book counterparts. Not enough time to get to them all well, but I hope we see more of them."
"Dec 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Me encant√≥! Deseando ver m√°s de estos personajes. Disfrut√© con todo de esta pel√≠cula. Desde la fotograf√≠a, gui√≥n, actores,... ¬°TODO! He escuchado criticas a lo lenta que le pareci√≥ a muchas personas, puede ser cierto que lleva otro ritmo a lo que Marvel Studios nos tiene acostumbrados, yo agradezco que se tomen el tiempo y la delicadeza de otorgarle personalidad propia a cada proyecto. Eternals es una joya dentro de toda la filmograf√≠a de Marvel."
"Dec 8, 2022",POSITIVE,Here https://playabledownloads.com/1281418 you can download the movie in High Definition (HD) 2.87Gb
"Dec 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,So many plot holes I was getting whiplash looking between them. Had so much potential. Only potential is go in looking for a laugh. Gives
"Dec 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,The slowest Superhero film ever made. Eternals is convoluted and lacks the deep dive into character that is needed to pull off this kind of film. At least it is more interesting than Nomadland.
"Dec 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of Marvel's best underrated movies, Marvel decided to change itself for the better.  This is a beautiful film, which speaks to adults and not to children.  The movie shows Marvel from a different point of view, I've seen many Marvel movies but this movie made me think.  The main problem with the film is that Marvel was afraid to pull it, in my opinion the film was supposed to be three hours.  The characters in the film are simply fascinating, but it is difficult to contain them because of the length of the film and in general the film is supposed to be a series."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,Turning the marvel cinematic universe into a cringey joke
"Dec 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eternals is the most beautiful Marvel movie ever. It's just set apart from others. Every character, every move, and action is terrific. The plot line has a nice twist in the end. Every cast is accurately cast, for example, Angelina Jolie is perfect for playing Thena. And the design of the costumes and CGI powers are artistic and different from any other Marvel movie.
And the most important thing is this movie is very promising, it opened up a different genre and a bigger storyline and plan for upcoming movies"
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, absolutely terrible! worst movie ever! how dare you destroy Kirby's work like this! life will punish you guys"
"Nov 29, 2022",POSITIVE,I hope their story continues to show new adventures as well. The final action scenes are amazing.
"Nov 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not horrible, just not particularly good. Too many forgettable and unlikable people/characters, and all embroiled in a terribly generic plot."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Meu filme favorito do MCU ü¶Ñü§©üôÉ
"Nov 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,It didn't have the time it needed to do what it needed to do.
"Nov 25, 2022",NEUTRAL, Not the non-stop goofy good time you get from most Marvel films. I am flexible though. It has a good cast and fine rock song choices. Not close to the best Marvel film. Yet I can‚Äôt talk myself into being a hater. It‚Äôs a guilty pleasure.
"Nov 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Maybe the sequel or whatever movie they make next with these characters in it will make this one better, but it just felt like it dragged. It was scattered at times and hard to follow. Hopefully they expand on Eros in an upcoming film as well as the rest of the characters. I was hoping for more but all in all it was mediocre at best. "
"Nov 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,"While not your standard addition to the MCU, this film is better than it's given credit for. The production is amazing, the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the scope of the Celestials is captured perfectly, a few of the characters are genuinely likable and Ramin Djawadi once again provides a wonderful score."
"Nov 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,This was the worst movie marvel has ever put out and being a huge marvel fan this was unlike them and I hope this is not what we have to look forward too in the future sense Stan lee has passed.
"Nov 19, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the best comic movies created! I don't understand how the critics gave such a low score on this one while on other crap super hero movies and series like She Hulk and Thor Love and Thunder gave a much better one! I don't think you know what you are doing anymore! Hopefully the eternals will be combined in the future story of marvel.
"Nov 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the best MCU movies, well integrated in this world and interesting for his cosmic future!"
"Nov 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,Definitely my least favorite of the marvel movies. Just was not very good.
"Nov 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,this movie was fine but just so long and wasn't very entertaining at times.
"Nov 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This defiantly would have worked a lot better as a Disney+ series. It was a little boring in quite a few places and there were a few plot points that I thought could have done with refining, but it was alright."
"Nov 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,"una pelicula muy hermosa en sus visuales art√≠stica , pero muy aburrida en la trama.
la tuve que ver por pedazos. muy lenta."
"Nov 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,A necessary but bloated introduction for the large cast of eternals that suffers from a dragging run time and a lack of screen time for the more interesting characters.
"Nov 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The Eternals was interesting. I can see where Cretton was going...but it was not good at all. The visual effects were great, but the poor plot was gross. This definitely could have been a series instead, especially with all of the new characters introduced (Which is what likely confused fans). Now I see why no Eternals merchandise really sells."
"Nov 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Filme fraqu√≠ssimo, personagens EXTREMAMENTE superficiais e fracos, escolhas de roteiro ruins e a √∫nica coisa que salva s√£o algumas cenas de a√ß√£o"
"Nov 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This film isn't for everyone. However, for me, I appreciate the bold decisions made by the director."
"Nov 13, 2022",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel film ever.
"Nov 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Bem legal , divertido."
"Nov 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Felt like Captain America Civil War to me with the characters fighting amongst themselves, but the story is decent and the action is solid, and with a twist at the end, Marvel is in a new darker direction that should leave audiences wondering what's next for the MCU?"
"Nov 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,The movie is bland and uninteresting
"Nov 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,Chole zao didn't knew what kind of movie she wanted to make. The movie was struggling between Diving into the past which didn't have any gold in it(was not interesting) and also in the present it's hard to focus on one person which was gema chans character as with every 20 mins they were introducing characters again and again and was reintroducing the plot in different way in every 30 mins . The villain was ehhhhhhh and wasn't developed and the villain looked like lots of cable mixed in a drawer. The best character and acting  belong to Kit harrington in this movie
"Nov 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"At the same time the movie feels barren with not much happening on screen, it feels really rushed with too much new stuff to introduce. It'd be better as a Disney+ series, but still far better than the worse mcu movies like thor 2 for example"
"Nov 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A watershed, but for me it was an interesting film. Seeing a group of heroes come together again made me happy, little action, but enough and beautiful CGI."
"Nov 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Probably one of the slowest mcu movies.  Copious back stories and pacing make the movie feel really slow.  Looked beautiful though.  The most interesting character flew himself into the sun, making any sequel look even less inspiring."
"Nov 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"For 11/2021:
Marvel Studios presents their next big team of superheroes
Directed by Chloe Zao she assembles a very rich, diversified cast in this long roster
After Thanos wiped out half the universe and Tony Stark bringing everyone back due to his sacrifice it provided the necessary energy to create an event called the Emergence; basically this would wipe the slate clean on planet Earth for other worlds to exist 
7,000 years ago beings called Eternals gifted with immortality and amazing powers arrived from the planet Olympia or did they?; they were instructed to not interfere with human history or conflicts by Celestials unless creatures called Deviants were involved
The Eternals comprise of 5 fighters and 5 thinkers; Ikaris who can fly, shoot beams from his eyes, and have superhuman strength, Makkari who has super speed and is deaf, Thena the goddess of war who can create all kinds of weapons, Sersi who can manipulate matter, Druig who can control people's minds, Kingo who's a Bollywood star but more joking than anyone that can fire projectiles from his hands, Phastos who can control any type of technology, Ajak who can heal people, Gilgamesh who can deliver super powered punches, and Sprite who can create illusions
Even though they've shaped our cultures and civilizations since the dawn of time it's a heavy burden for them all they couldn't lift a finger to help humanity, heck they even explain why they didn't help the Avengers 
Now with the Emergence on the rise these immortal warriors have to band together to protect what they now hold dear even going against their prime directive
Kros, is one their many obstacles being in charge of the Deviants making them believe they can't protect humans next to Jemiah the Analyzer who created the Eternals and Arishem, their master 
It's the 3rd longest MCU entry next to 'Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame' but still good for fans that have been keeping with this franchise since 2008; brings all the enjoyment you'd expect albeit minor flaws included 
It takes some getting used to the exposition 
But the action is impressive, love the big world building, this rich diverse cast, the costumes, and it opens more of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in multiple directions 
Love this musical score too 
Ajax is the almighty leader yet she can't let anyone interfere with human history lest them hindering their natural evolution, Kingo is the funny comic relief with his Bollywood personality, Sprite is the free youthful spirit being that she's stunted in her growth being an immortal teenager, Sersi is the heart of the group feeling she used to have a romance with Ikkaris, Thena is the fierce warrior sticking to her duties yet she's feeling weak with her memories since she's been around for eons, Druig wishes everyone should have a common ground, Gilgamesh is the calming one for Thena, and Phastos feels ashamed of his tinkering considering how humans have used machines to kill each other so he's found human connection living a domestic life 
This entry is more dramatic than bombastic or cartoony which might not sit well with many; 
villains are kinda lame to be honest with Kro only being in here for 5 min and Arishem who's kinda sitting in the background
It stinks 2 characters in here are axed off quick being part of this main family 
A lot of the environments feel empty and boring since it's a lot of deserts, oceans, grass fields, beaches and volcanoes 
Still, it does show how others involved with humanity's development would've shifted things allowing us to evolve, thrive, learn from our mistakes 
Human nature is what it is; sometimes it's unavoidable or not our place to change what has to unfold 
Without our flaws and mistakes we couldn't stand out or learn to be better 
Chloe Zhao knows her characters and their interpersonal relationships, she has them dig deep into themselves about whether they should do more than what they were made for or not bother getting attached to a planet inhabited
It's definitely a heavy toll being immortal and having to watch over civilizations far slower than others as far as weapons and modern technology 
One of those rare superhero films to make the viewer think
The casting here is also a true profession of representation in film
The mid credits scene is crazy and the after credits scene....very ambiguous 
It's a lot of mystery for the future to unfold that's for sure 
25 movies in and Marvel Studios is still showing their love and passion for an ever-expanding multitude of stories from the pages of the comics 
This one isn't perfect and will be very divisive but you can tell they are trying to open more doors for further adventures and that's fine by me as a comic book movie lover"
"Nov 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,Better than expected.
"Nov 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I hate this movie, I'm just giving it 1 star because of the visual experience, if it wasn't for that, it will be a half star, i don't recommend"
"Nov 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Is bland worse than bad?  The movie has action and many good actors, but it's just all shoved in there without any style.  Watch the movie in 5 minute sections and you could confuse it for being good.  As it is, it's a confusing mess of bland and I haven't the energy to try again."
"Nov 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,Have seen it 2 times. I hate it. All of this is bad. Sry. I dont know why people can like this movie.
"Nov 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,This is not a film. This is not even a movie. This is a shitshow. I want both my money and time back.
"Nov 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"THIS MOVIE IS EXTREMELY UNDERRATED AND ""OVER HATED"" , I don't see any reasons to hate this film this much , Chole Zhao have directed this film so well it's beautiful and having the best CGI , Plot Twist , Sound effects better than any of the others phase 4 movies and shows

The direction is good 
Almost all actors gave their best
VFX and CGI is TOP NOTCH
Twist is good 
Story telling is good but a little complex when you will watch it for the first time because you have to pay attention at some scenes that are important

Movie feels a little bit lengthy , some part of the movie like Jumping back from present to future and then again'present felt not perfect



Overall , Eternals is a amazing , beautiful movie"
"Nov 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Absolute garbage, slow and a terrible story line, a lot of moping round looking into the distance, just terrible"
"Oct 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"No matter what the critics and the people say, Eternals is an absolutely beautiful film. It makes you feel things more then any other Marvel movie has,. The cinematography is PEAK and the visuals are absolutely EYE- CATCHING, and as the cherry on top, the suits of the characters are FABULOUS. The story falls short, but once you get over it, it is a soulful and awakening adventure."
"Oct 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"One of the most boring and pointless marvel movies ever made, and that's hard"
"Oct 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,The movie is just 3 hours straight boring flashbacks.
"Oct 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Worst movie ever marvel has been doing a terrible job on movies after endgame nothing feels like the mcu
"Oct 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The movie as a whole was pretty bad in terms of just plot.  But I felt the individual acting did a great job of holding it up (Karun, omg, more please!).  Galactus is hard to bring to the screen, so they did a good job on that part, but the entire thing felt unfinished.  I saw where they were going, but a lot of tropes were also used to get there.

In all honesty, what this movie felt like was the limitations of the medium.  It was too much crammed into one movie and Galactus may just be better left to the comic books."
"Oct 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eternals is the most ambitious film to date in the history of the MCU, and takes the franchise to another level with Gods, immortals and magic, we are not in the old MCU anymore. Unfortunately casual fans of the franchise will leave the film scratching their head with all of the  ""inside baseball"" content and lore that will probably go over the head of most people but hardcore fans will sure to get a kick out of where the franchise is headed."
"Oct 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I could manage my patience  with so many characters without any solid link to real MARVELS  until ""politically correctness"" and sexuality was grossly evident. I quit and at the middle of the movie. This is a rotten one..."
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Very good and deep film. MCU's Mythology and it is great diracted. Unfortunate that Marvel doesn't want to be loved for its content..
"Oct 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A decent movie but eternally boring at times. Eternals is movie that makes me happy for the convenience of streaming. Many of the exposition scenes in this movie are near unbearable. The stars on the screen do not share much chemistry which is surprising after spending nearly 5000 years together. This is a typical action movie Marvel movie. Nameless uninspired grey monsters attack Earth for the majority of the movie. I did enjoy some of the action scenes, though many of the character powers are very ""one note"", and quickly become predictable and boring. On a personal note I am kinda bummed Marvel is leaning heavily into magic now rather than a good mix of scifi. This makes it difficult to gauge just how powerful these beings are. I would say unless you're a die hard fan of the lore watch the action scenes and read a synapsis online. You would think a movie with a character near Ikarus would be a bit more willing to take risks, sadly this movie never makes it off the ground."
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Really bad , to many characters , to many different styles cause lost in argument, no way to catch up in that mess"
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Have potential, but why the hell they downgraded them so much? They barely can win vs some big lizards xD"
"Oct 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"What a waste of time. Confused, stupid, and cheap looking. This doesn't even feel like a Marvel movie."
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as some people say. But it's just meh.
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not the worst film MCU has put out but not the best either. I enjoyed it nonetheless, the conclusion was fun too. Obviously the CGI has it's moments here and MCU starting to slow down as they push their CGI to it's furthest limits."
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,I liked the story and how the characters were depicted each with their own features. The action scenes are breathtaking.
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Eternals is a good movie. The visual effects are amazing and very well done. I hope their story continues.
"Oct 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A story that didn't need to be told, in a way it shouldn't have been"
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"UN ESPECT√ÅCULO VISUAL, PARA ENTRETENERTE ES MUY BUENA PEL√çCULA, LO QUE NO ME QUEDA CLARO Y NO ENCAJA EN ESTO ES EN DONDE ESTUVIERON TODO ESTE TIEMPO DE MARVEL. 
PERO ES ENTRETENIDA DE PRINCIPIO A FIN, ESTAR√çA BIEN VER M√ÅS DE ESTOS H√âROES EN LO PR√ìXIMO DE MARVEL"
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,The best Marvel movie!
"Oct 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eternals was not well received when released, so I put off seeing it for quite some time.  It exceeded my expectations by quite a bit.
I can see the difficulty that critics had.  There are ten Eternals, so it takes a while to get to know each of them and what role they play in the movie.  But the characters are well differentiated and interesting, and Gemma Chan does a good job tying them altogether as our protagonist. 

The story itself is of course ridiculous, but so what?  The MCU keeps scaling up to encompass more and more of the comic book history.  We started with Iron Man and Captain America, scaled up with the Asgardians, scaled up again with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos, and Captain Marvel, and the step to the story line of the Eternals is one level even higher.  At some point one has to wonder how the various levels can possibly mesh together (this is where the multiverse provides many outs), but let's not forget the primary purpose is to tell enjoyable stories.  This particular story works well."
"Oct 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,Better than expected just don't go into the movie expecting action and you won't be disappointed good story telling however
"Oct 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It took 3 attempts to get through this movie. The inventor was an interesting choice for superpowers. The gunslinger though, not bagging on the actor, that was lazy writing."
"Oct 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Excellent superhero movie and much better than I thought. I don't understand the low rating at all, like at all, definitely different, but this movie is great."
"Oct 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,Another weak and absolutely boring Marvel movie. A complete waste of time ...
"Oct 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Too many characters, not enough time to develop them all and get me to have any emotional connection to them."
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"love it, good CG, good cast, amazing director"
"Oct 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"L movie, L writing, L characters"
"Oct 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,Why MUC Movies are sosososoooo üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
"Oct 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It was a decent movie, really it was, I just felt it could've done a better job with telling the whole story in such a way that it doesn't feel like multiple movies all in one, that's what I felt like it was but I'd watch it again"
"Oct 19, 2022",POSITIVE,The more powerful mcu movie
"Oct 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,siendo sincero la pelicula me dejo un poco confundido pero la pelicula conserva la esencia de marvel en cuanto a personajes y escenas de accion de hecho eso lo alabo por las coreografias bien hechas
"Oct 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"unwatchable
boring empty and repetitive dialogues
bad acting"
"Oct 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The cast, score, and comic book origin of the Eternals doesn't truly get to shine through in this film, however the characters and casting are it's saving grace."
"Oct 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,Mediocre & convoluted.
"Oct 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"After Endgame, Marvel has continued to get worse, and I can 100% say this is the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen."
"Oct 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I can't even believe that someone has approved this movie, and without a doubt the WORST, I repeat, the WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, 2H30, 1H40 OF THAT TIME IS MEETING, BAD MOOD AND STARTS WITHOUT YOU EVEN UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING"
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Given the mixed reviews, I was apprehensive about seeing this film but it turned out to be a rather impressive entry to the MCU - both visually and narratively. I appreciate it's not the typical MCU story but that's refreshing!"
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Refreshing and special.
Considering this movie doesn't lean heavily on past marvel movies I think it was well made with a nice plot twist."
"Oct 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,Worst mcu movie ever.
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film takes you into uncharted territory for Marvel movies.  There is a sense of a subplot taking place that might make you think too much.  As with other Marvel films it's beautiful and action-packed.  The diversity of the cast is amazing and as I noted with the previous Marvel movie, I want more of it."
"Oct 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,Normally I Love Marvel Super Hero movies. This one did not do it for me.
"Oct 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I tried really hard to love this movie, but being unfamiliar with the source material, I had trouble.  Possibly would have fared better as a series.  I wasn't very invested in Ikaris yet and the plot twist just wasn't as captivating as it could have been.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either."
"Oct 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,worst mcu movie ever
"Oct 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was absolutely amazing! I think it did a really good job of balancing a bunch of storylines and it was just the perfect amount of seriousness, action, and comedy that I loved from the beginning of the Marvel cinematic universe without it overdoing it too much on the comedy. Absolutely love the cast! But what more can you ask for when you have half of Game of Thrones +  Angelina Jolie and so many other amazing actors (that I can't name off the top of my head right now and am too lazy to google). Anyways, I think it's one of the better Marvel movies that have recently been released, so I recommend to go watch!"
"Oct 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This was just a very bad movie. Horribly structured and constructed. It took 2 hours just to sort of introduce all of the characters and ""get the band back together"" and then the story was just trying to be way too big and cosmic. Honestly, just a very bad movie."

"Oct 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Its above average, i think the characters are ok, i think the story also is ok, visuals are great, acting is decent, story is decent. The action was good and the ending was decent."
"Oct 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"An incredible love letter to the world and nature. Marvelous cinematography and visuals. The visual effects were great as well and the cast did an excellent job, especially Jolie, Chan, Madden and Ridloff."

"Oct 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why critics are against this movie. It was something new, something we are not used to, something incredible... The cast for the film with personalities like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Richard Madden do fantastic in their roles, endowing the characters they play with charisma and personality. The film has inclusive characters that do not feel forced, as is the case in most current proyects. It is not the typical superhero movie, moral and ethical issues are touched, who are the good guys and their own creation are questioned. The film does not hesitate for a second to put an end to any of the characters that could be of potential benefit to the franchise. This phase of Marvel I feel is darker, more adult, and daring more..."
"Oct 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the VFX of this movie, especially the weapons and powers, and the characters; but the writing could be improved."
"Oct 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eternals is not a perfect movie, but if it becomes an average movie, which falls due to being too slow, and the lack of development of people, but it also has its flashes of light, such as its good visual effects, the acting, the direction by Chloe Zao, and the inclusion is not forced."
"Oct 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,The movie was slow and boring. Had to stop it halfway through. The performances were boring but at least the environments were kinda interesting.
"Sep 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This wasn't good at all. I didn't hate it, it was just was all over the the place and lack writing cohesiveness. Not sure why the score is like this."

"Sep 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It is a different movie, but it still felt ad part of the mcu formula. Combining so many plot points and so many characters made it suffer, but it is still very enjoyable and a bit different."
"Sep 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable action and characters. Kind of on the weird side of superhero movies but I thoroughly enjoyed the concept.

The director did a great job of getting the story down, all the characters had a moment to shine, the effects were clean and refreshing! None of this new slap stick comedy Marvel feels it needs to ram into everything lately was used. Touching moments, I want to see more of this.."
"Sep 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,Too many characters with not enough time to connect and care about any of them.
"Sep 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I was a Marvel fan.  I loved all the Iron Man movies, the first Thor movies, Avengers (and etc), because they were movies with a well-constructed plot, well-thought-out stories, that made sense, they were movies that connected with each other and that WERE INTELLIGENT, but honestly, I hated the latest Marvel movies (Doctor Strange, Eternals and Thor).  Poorly written films, bad stories, confusing and meaningless plots, in addition to addressing current social issues just to get attention.  The stories of these latest Marvel movies feel like a mixture of vomiting and stroke.  The directors and screenwriters of the movie ""Thor Love and Tunder"" confused the ancient gods (and mythologies, ancient myths RICH in meaning and spirituality in general) with the FULLY celebrities and the Hollywood surface world, that is, showing the gods as real clowns, liars, ridiculous, selfish, petty, who use alcohol, have orgies, accept human sacrifices and who want to appear at all costs, with their inflated egos!!!  That's the perfect description for Hollywood, not spirituality!!  In addition, the latest Marvel movies - Eternals and Thor - want to convey to the public an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcruel God, as if the Supreme Deity was horrible, perverse, sadistic and evil.  In ""Eternals"", the said gods blow up the planets when they are too crowded to be born;  in ""Doctor Strange"" there are black magic rituals, where Doctor Strange conquers evil with evil;  in ""Thor"", the gods don't care about humans, they are futile and have personality disorders, in addition to other psychological problems!!!  It looks like these movies were made by SATANISTS!!!!  All very bad!!!!  I don't watch Marvel, or Disney, or even if they pay me anymore!!!  I don't give my attention and my money to see this dumb, unscrupulous and clearly EVIL bullshit!!!"
"Sep 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A little slow and meandering, but introspective and exostential and makes you ponder on the beauty and pain associated with humanity."
"Sep 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,Plot made little sense. Characters lacked depth. Editing and plot made little sense.

"Sep 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"In 5000 BC, ten superpowered Eternals‚ÄîAjak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena‚Äîare sent by the Celestial Arishem to Earth on their starship, the Domo, to exterminate the invasive Deviants. The last Deviants are apparently killed in 1521, when the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders. In the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman who works at the Natural History Museum. When the trio are attacked by the Deviant Kro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem. Sersi learns that the mission of the Eternals was actually to prepare Earth for the Emergence. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting the seeds of Celestials inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when the Deviants evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the reversal of the Blip,[N 2] Earth has reached the necessary population for the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, which will result in Earth's destruction. Hoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reconvene. At Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with his mind-control powers. However, Ikaris reveals that Ajak told him of the Emergence centuries before. When Ajak told him she wishes to stop the Emergence, he led her to the Deviants who killed her...

Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, ""An ambitious superhero epic that soars as often as it strains, Eternals takes the MCU in intriguing‚Äîand occasionally confounding‚Äînew directions."" Charlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard described the film as ""lavish"" and ""ambitious"", and praised the fight sequences as ""astounding, beautifully paced and crammed with detail"". Robert Abele of TheWrap commended the cinematography and felt ""an earnestness to the operatic stakes"". Oliver Jones of the Observer called it ""full of wonder and romance and fueled by an agenda and audacity all its own"". Owen Gleiberman was disappointed over Zhao's missing filmmaking style that shaped her films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020) to ""embrace the straight-up expository conventionality of Marvel filmmaking"", but felt that the film was a ""squarely fun and gratifying watch"". Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times thought ""it's got some pretty slow spots midfilm and it's desperately in need of a bit more wit ... what it does have is a palpable, artful mood; this is a movie full of superheroes who spend time thinking and feeling, and of special effects that aren't just zippy but often delicately elegant"". Linda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle described it as ""a mishmash of well-meaning, yet jarringly verbose and bafflingly incoherent nonsense which is only just about saved by some half decent performances""; Nicholas Barber of BBC Culture called Zhao's direction ""workmanlike""; and Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent said that it ""strives for the same expansive soulfulness"" as Nomadland ""but discovers there's room enough only for the occasional burst of it"". Brian Lowry of CNN thought ""the movie's structural flaws offset its stunning visuals and strong performances"". Kyle Smith of National Review was harsher, describing it as ""one of the dumbest, cheesiest, most trite, and least human"" of the MCU films. The mixed reception surprised some commentators, given the MCU's positive track record and the acclaim of Zhao's previous work. Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that ""much of the criticism of Kirby's work"", which was divisive for its subject matter and relationship to the wider Marvel Universe, ""has followed Zhao in her adaptation."" He compared the divisive response to that of Zack Snyder's DC Extended Universe films Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), writing that they and Eternals share ""a deconstructive approach to superheroes and force them to question their purpose in the world, through meditative and melancholy narrative beats, and a tragic yet hopeful ending."" This approach, he felt, subverted critics and audiences' expectations, which made them review the film more harshly. Zhao addressed some of the criticisms of the film, believing some of the divisiveness came from everyone ""having an existential crisis"" because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the film being an ""existential crisis, both for humanity and God"". She also felt the reactions to how the film incorporated her filmmaking sensibilities with Marvel's were ""a testament to how much we had merged with each other; how uncomfortable that might make people feel"".

Based on Jack Kirby¬¥s classic and slightly surreal comic, this film struggles with a mixed bag of characters and a partly stiff and wobbly performance from the main actors. The development of who the Eternals are, is more of less non existing and the running time is too long with several scenes that could¬¥ve been edited down as they just drag. I also think that the film uses too much of a humorous approach that doesn¬¥t work at all. My other criticism is as well that Marvel and Chlo√© Zhao haven¬¥t manage to adapt Jack Kirby¬¥s comic in a convincing way to the silver screen. The CGI is pretty nice though and there¬¥s still some entertainment value in this film. However, ""Eternals"" will get a sequel, but who honestly want to see that? 

Trivia: The film grossed $402 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its themes and visuals, but criticized its screenplay, pacing, runtime, and character development."
"Sep 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eternals was not as bad as I had feared. It is a ""C"" movie. Not great, but not terrible either. It's just completely meh.  Just like my thoughts and energy spent on this review."
"Sep 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"All of human history... And NOTHING happens? A BUNCH of characters and you don't really see any of them..... A 2 and a half hour, ""superhero"" movie and it did nothing... Not much else to say."
"Sep 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was great and it honestly deserves a rewatch because of how many details tying it to the mcu i had missed, definitely doing so soon!"
"Sep 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Nomadland was the only movie of 2020 that I couldn't watch. The fact that she won awards at every festival she attended and that she won an Oscar on top of it reinforced my interest in the film. However, the movie I watched when I had the opportunity was a kind of meditation that brought worse sleep than medicine, no matter how well-intentioned it was. There are very few movies that I get bored with watching. I was quite surprised to hear that the director who shot this boring masterpiece would be directing a Marvel movie. There shouldn't be anything as ironic as a superhero film by a director who takes Terrance Malick as an example. So I ended my review of the movie I wrote for the √ñteki Sinema with these sentences: ""I really wonder what kind of superhero movie the director, whose narration style led me to siesta, prepared. Again, if she envies Malick's cinema, she will either make the most boring superhero movie ever made or make a revolution in this field"". Did it revolutionize? I do not think so. But she is likely to be a pioneer. Of course, although she made a much more dynamic film than I thought, it is obvious that she signed a completely different approach compared to the remaining 25 films in the series. Eternals is an entirely different Marvel movie, both in terms of directing and scenario approach; It is one of the rare examples that succeeded in presenting the philosophical approach sought in the superhero world."
"Sep 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great origin entry MCU Marvel Cinematic Universe film with lots of great scenes, memorable characters, charming story and intriguingly great use of misremembered encounters in the human timeline. It's a fantastic film, as many Marvel films are. A few things that let it down are characters that were great on screen were cut out to early, a lot of dialogue that wasn't really clear nor relative to the plot (which could of been easily left out) and unnecessarily too long in some scenes. Regardless, it's still a great film to watch as is. An engaging film with various plot twists, locations and memorable characters and intriguing storytelling."

"Sep 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"1 hour too long. Typical of Marvel movies, has its funny moments."
"Sep 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amei! Diversidade, conflitos e v√°rios personagens novos que s√£o super carism√°ticos!!! Os √∫nicos pontos negativos s√£o a mudan√ßa da origem dos Eternos e os vil√µes n√£o serem bem vil√µes."
"Sep 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Vacant and trying too hard. There was no chemistry between the actors, so it never felt real. Clearly, we're supposed to leave the theater filled with an urgent sense of anticipation, but all I felt was relief that the two-and-a-half hour running time had finally come to an end.

ALSO: No one, and I mean no one is going to find some average fat guy believable as an ""Eternal""."
"Sep 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The year 2021 began with the Marvel Cinematic Universe falling upon an established character with Black Widow getting her movie and then trying something new in Shang-Chi. Both movies were phenomenal and now the MCU continues with another new addition to the film universe in the Eternals, a Marvel series of immortal alien demigods. I have heard some mention from fans of the Marvel comics, especially hinting at their relationship with the supervillain Thanos. I don't read many Marvel comics, but I have a general knowledge of their more famous characters with the Eternals being a complete mystery to me, but I came into this with an open mind, and I have to admit that I was not just disappointed but bored out of my mind.

The planet Earth has existed for thousands of years and in that time, it has been watched over by immortal demigods known as the Eternals. These beings watch over life on the planet but only as observers, choosing to help humanity but not advance them to their level. These dozen beings of great power, wisdom, and intelligence are amazing presences that appear to be well-meaning but over the years of existence, they have maintained power but with limitations. But they are not all-powerful and are guarded by even greater beings known as Celestials who have a special mission in mind for Earth as the Eternals protect the planet from only a specific threat. But the Eternals learn of what the Celestials have in mind, and it sends the rest of the Eternals at odds, especially against each other.

I heard someone describe this as an Ancient Aliens movie set for the Marvel Universe in a similar style to epics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but that was a good strong drama, this is a tedious bore. These are comic book movies, and they are supposed to be fun, but this movie was not. It was slow and boring and should never have been made. With performances that were weaker than the plot and special effects that were just as poor. Probably the worst time I spent in a theater."
"Sep 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It's incredibly obvious how much work went into this film. You can see the good cinematography, the good acting, and the interesting ideas it had to play with. But as I was watching it I kept wondering how none of this added up to a movie that was engaging at all..."
"Sep 10, 2022",NEGATIVE,worst marvel movie ever.
"Sep 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,I understand why it's not popular..... no STUPID Marvel Jokes. I enjoyed it
"Sep 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This is a bad MCU movie not the worst I personally think Thor, Ant Man & The Wasp, Thor The Dark World & Incredible Hulk are worse. This film is really over stuffed with too many things there are too many characters so the movie can't balance everyone out properly if they cut it down to just 5 Eternals rather than 10 it would have worked better since each member has a interesting story like Phasto's when he arrives at the Nagasaki bombing seeing how his influence indirectly causing Death & Mayhem, Athena seeing her past memories rather than having a illness that Celestials get & Druig taking a more pacifist role during human evolution after seeing a lot of war & genocide among the humans. If there is any MCU property that should have gotten a Disney + show it should have been this it could have easily been 2 seasons long & it would have fleshed out the group & the lore way better since a lot of things go unexplained or are ignored since it has too many things to explain to us with only a 2 hours & 37 minutes run time."
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, celestials we're cool, one of the better marvel movies"
"Sep 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie is the definition of the MCU trying something new, for me I found some parts very entertaining. But with too many characters and not enough time it fails to make me feel attached to any of the characters."
"Sep 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I felt myself falling asleep Marvel! 
Have you gotten cocky being at the top?
Don't forget what makes your movies great! Go back to that formula!"
"Sep 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,"If you're looking for a fun, entertaining, deep, or moving film --- this ain't it.  Eternals is a convoluted mess with some high points, some interesting plot points which never came to full fruition, and acting ability ranging from community theatre quality to bordering on a decent performance by some of the actors.  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't feel ""focused"" or cohesively logical in any way.  The pacing is all over the place, it's chock-full of the modern representation checkmarks, yet quite lacking in actual content.  

As far as the characters are concerned, none have any real personality besides stereotypes to speak of, unfortunately.  With so many characters I'm really wondering how it's possible that not one of them is actually developed enough to consider him/herself as likable.  Their motivations are illogical at best, and their morality choices even more so.  

Acting wise, we have absolutely wooden performances from long-term actors and over the top performances by some relative newcomers.  There's no consistency here.  

It's not all negative, however.  The visuals are quite impressive at times... it is Marvel after all...

It's quite a long movie, but that's mainly due to the editing.  There are many scenes which could be cut out and the movie cut a bit tighter to make it more interesting overall.  

That's pretty much all I can say about the movie.  It's watchable, but forgettable.  It's Marvel-esque, but nowhere near the potential it had.  It's entertaining in parts, but overall quite bland.  It features a lot  of modern film-making tropes, but is devoid of good storytelling.  It's one of those movies you can have playing in the background while you do other things without missing something important."
"Sep 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Filling in the remains gaps in MCU watching, seeing this at some remove from cinematic release does allow some for some perspective. While the plot and the screenplay are all over the place and some VFX lack physical weight, there are some nice visual moments and directorial touches. But as the significantly overlong running time bites, the negatives take hold - and the fact that there are too many new characters to really care about means it drags way too much. Not awful, but not that good either."
"Sep 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,Wasn't Marvels best but still enjoyable. Would watch again.
"Sep 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,"My least favorite Marvel movie yet. 
""Let's make a movie, not a show, about 10 completely new characters that almost nobody has ever heard about. Let's also kill off 4 of them, give only 1 or 2 of them any character development whatsoever. Oh, and let's also have the movie span thousands of years.""
Clearly a good idea. Poor writing. Acceptable acting. Decent CGI. Horrible story. Horrible pacing. Unlikeable characters. And the romance that wasn't even supposed to be in the movie was cuter and felt stronger than the literally plot point that was Sersi and Icarus.
Terrible Marvel movie, but not the worst Marvel project."
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,This movie was alright. The several main characters introduced in one movie was not the greatest idea as the audience couldn't find any personal connections to any of them. It was a bold idea by Marvel to create a film like this in the MCU but was not the greatest outcome. There was also very poor pacing throughout the film. One thing I liked was that it did not seem like a typical marvel superhero film which shows some growth within the company.
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,Quite good. Trying too to do a bit too much in one movie but still works pretty well
"Sep 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"boring movie and it destroys a lot of the MCU. Character decissions are idiotic. The eternals behave like dumb children, they are thousands of years old and should be wise and smart. Their powerlevels are weird, why is not everyone like icarus? The trailers made you think salma hayek and Angelina Jolie play important roles in this movie, which they dont."
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"""Eternals"" is an ambitious and visually stunning film that takes the Marvel Cinematic Universe to new heights. While Gemma Chan's lead role may not have been as commanding as I would have hoped, the rest of the cast shines, with standout performances from Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani. The film's visuals are simply breathtaking, with epic set pieces and stunning action sequences that showcase the incredible scope and scale of the story. While the film's pacing may have suffered a little from its ambitious storytelling, ""Eternals"" still manages to deliver a compelling and entertaining adventure that is sure to delight ."
"Sep 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I was pleasantly surprised, we had good performances from everyone."
"Sep 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,"For a movie that aims to be one of the greatest Marvel is really far from that... It's not like you will spend a bad time watching this movie but the main issue with it is the pace. Multiple times the film will get exciting but then spoil the tension by giving you a flashback or a long conversation, also the lack of bright light/colors contributes to make the movie looks duller than it is. The story (not the script) of Eternals is by far the best part, the characters have to face very complex situations in a cosmic-level but also in a deep human-level. The only issue here is that we have complex quandaries with not-that-complex characters. I won't say that the characters are clich√© or one-note but they lack the depth needed by the storyline. The actors playing the two main characters fail to give charism or chemistry to their eternal beings... it's especially visible when you have Angelina Jolie succeeding in all of that with Don Lee and with the (surprising) few amount of screen time and dialogue she has."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,Much better the second time around.
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,Beautiful cinematography and just a wonderful introduction to these new Marvel characters. Chole Zhao is amazing and excited to see more of her in the MCU.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,I watched it for its Visual Effects.
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,I am wondering of Eternals sequel that Thanos's brother help Eternals.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie but they failed on so many levels. The story was weak, the writing was horrendous and they played identity politics...the box office numbers don't lie"
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,Utter rubbish. Takes an embarrassingly silly approach to the (already absurd) superhero premise.
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This is very much a film of its type - a Marvel CGI fest. There are a lot of characters and a lot of story but it didn't really grab me. I'm not too keen on most of these films yet Chloe Zhao (the director) is one of my favourite directors, so that piqued my interest. Angelina Jolie and Gemma Chan certainly give credible performances but this film felt too long drawn out and a little cliched for my liking. I wouldn't recommend it as such, no."
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,It's good not unwatchable.
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"The critical reception for ""Eternals"" showed me many professionals working in this space today are too egotistical for their own good. This ""certified rotten"" is so thoroughly undeserved and it's likely all because it doesn't push the political agenda elitist critics want it to. Instead, ""Eternals"" tells a story that actually rejects the idea of narratives and is instead an exploration of truth. It's unimportant what conclusions it arrives at because, like the source material written by the legendary Jack Kirby, the journey is what matters. Director Chloe Zhao relies heavily on realistic set pieces to tell her epic 7000-year story, featuring truly breathtaking cinematography. Zhao picks up the important details from Kirby's inspired, but unfortunately short-lived series about a group of extraterrestrials tasked with protecting humanity, hiding in plain sight on Earth. Actress Gemma Chan delivers a performance full of empathy as the film's lead Sersi, one reminiscent of the divine feminine impulse. Richard Madden is surprising and electric as the complicated Eternal, Ikaris, while Angelina Jolie is touching as the broken and confused Thena. The rest of the cast is delightful, including the hilarious Kumail Nanjiani and the always lovely Salma Hayek."
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,Wasted a couple hours of my life. Humor was dry and the movie was a drag. Go watch it if you have insomnia
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Just awful, one of the main characters leaves for no reason before the big battle, monsters so bad. Whole thing really poor."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Despite its inclusive cast and its director, Eternals is still a bland, boring movie that fails in the most important thing: entertaining the audience."

"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"can a marvel movie get any worse, we have yet to see . . ."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie's greatest sins were that it seemed pointless, and it was boring."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It's not She-Hulk bad, but it is awful. The cool visuals and decent acting from most of the cast couldn't carry the bad writing and terribly planned marvel movie."
"Sep 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not for me, I am not a simp"
"Aug 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I found this movie to be longer than it needed to be. The lifestyle of the characters felt forced upon the viewer. I think this movie is a little bit on the ""woke""side. A big letdown for a Marvel movie."
"Aug 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie with amazing action scene design like I have never seen before, especially at the peak ending where the team tries to take down Ikaris, bravo to that. Chloe portraits the power of each member beautifully - especially Makkari. Just one thing that made me take out 1 star out is that Chloe made the Eternals robot puppets. She could have turned the story a lot better when Marvel tries to promote them as the god among men, where the audience had high expectations from that. Make them what you said they were and really it's what they should be."
"Aug 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Beautifully shot movie, wish it tied into the MCU more‚Ä¶we know sequel will"
"Aug 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Not saying this is the best story ever written but I genuinely had a good time watching it. Love the whole ambiance/universes
"Aug 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"hit the nail on the head with that ""perfectly"" bridled potential vibe."
"Aug 26, 2022",POSITIVE,It's a comic book movie mixed with a philosophy book. Very interesting!!!
"Aug 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I don't care what people are saying, go and watch this movie! It's a fresh and new tone for the mcu, and it's different from anything we've ever gotten before in the mcu. It's just really fun and enjoyable, while also showing some really great characters, and dealing with the end of the world. It's not the best, but it's defenently not a waste of time. Would recommend"
"Aug 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,CGI quality and acting are good points of this movie but the story is weak and so far we haven't seen the impacts that the movie leaves on the Marvel universe.

"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"You will feel betrayed by a studio that promises changes in its formula, but innovates to the extent that it self-destructs, eternal is the apex of the MCU's wear and tear."
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie pretty much has no reason to exist. Totally rotten.
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Wow, I've never disliked a Marvel film until this. I really wish I could like it. I was excited to see the Stark brothers from Game of Thrones in another work, but they did not manage to save it. Not by a long shot. $200 million down the drain. Chlo√© Zhao really messed this up. Don't even bother watching this. It was embarrassing."
"Aug 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Absolutely horrible!
"Aug 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie just didn't make me feel invested in the Eternals. The visuals were quite outstanding but weren't enough to win me over.
"Aug 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Worst MCU movie to date.
"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Although it is a film much underestimated by critics and by the general public who loves classic Marvel characters, I consider it a true directorial and narrative masterpiece. It has a tone that is very reminiscent of DC movies, which isn't a bad thing because it's okay to diversify the genre. The characters are well characterized although, being ten protagonists, some are more important than others. The sceneries are spectacular precisely because they are real and not in CGI. The plot is interesting because it talks about faith, belonging and family. The soundtrack is exceptional as well as the direction. Kro is a good villain even if a little wasted in the end. In conclusion, I loved Eternals because it is so poetic and full of important themes. My favorite Eternal, however, is Druig."
"Aug 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Neat, the worst superhero movie I've seen in the last decade or so. This was a snoozefest, predictable and boring the whole way through."
"Aug 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Worst MCU film, horribly boring and out of universe"
