"Dec 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Subtle, sometimes too much... However, brining a festive note to characters that others reject and make fun of is always welcome. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jan 20, 2021",POSITIVE,Gloria is magnetic and radiant... I left the theater feeling a little sad that a female lead like Garcia and a film like Gloria are both so rare.
"Mar 14, 2019",POSITIVE,There's less of an endgame than a scenario allowed to run its course. García is fantastic in the role with an attitude that refuses to stay quiet when something must be said.
"Mar 5, 2019",POSITIVE," Chilean director Sebastián Lelio’s Gloria (2013) is a lighthearted examination of a country in a state of flux, told beautifully through the tragic endeavours of its hopelessly romantic protagonist, that’s both charming and culturally enlightening. Gloria (Paulina Garcia) is an ageing divorcee living alone in her one bedroom apartment, who’s determined not to spend the rest of her days alone. She spends her evenings at a local singles club where she drinks cocktails and dances to disco music amongst a rabble of similarly lonely souls, each desperately attempting to rebel against their solitude and fight off the advance of old age. It’s here that Gloria meets Rudolfo (Sergio Hernandez), an ex-naval officer, seven years her senior, who whisks her of her feet. That evening, a night of awkward, fumbling lovemaking becomes the catalyst for a steady relationship. However, despite an encouraging start, it quickly becomes apparent that Rudolfo’s divorce is far more recent than Gloria’s, and the scars of his troubled marriage are still clear for all to see. Gloria sees potential for a lifelong relationship, yet Rudolfo’s inability to completely separate himself from his past slowly begins to raise question over his commitment to her and his capacity to adapt to a new life. The camera’s gaze never leaves our heroine’s presence, and the film is all the more enjoyable for it. With Gloria, Garcia has created a complex and incredibly affable character that oozes heartfelt emotion, be it her charming romantic optimism or how she copes with the stifling isolation of singledom. A refreshingly empowered woman of advancing years, this fragile yet confident woman seizes control of her life and embraces the liberation she’s presently enjoying, culminating in a film full of vivacity, warmth and charisma. Not dissimilar to the majority of Chilean film’s that have found themselves an appreciative audience overseas, Lelio’s offering does provide a non-to-subtle allegory for a country in transition, learning to except its freedom from dictatorship whilst constantly undergoing a political metamorphoses. Whilst nowhere near as powerful or alarming as Pablo Larraín’s Post Mortem (2010) or as pensive and contemplative as Nostalgia For The Light (2012), Lelio’s lighthearted approach is no less effective at illuminating Chile’s bleak and troubled history. A s smart, sensitive and bitterly funny romantic comedy, elegantly played out against the backdrop of a county whose political scars are still very much evident, Lelio’s endlessly impressive Gloria is on of the most enjoyable and heartwarming films of the year."
"Dec 3, 2017",POSITIVE,"The wonder is that Gloria becomes truly beautiful as the movie goes on. As in real life, as we get to know her, we fall in love with her, and the way she appears to us changes."
"Jun 8, 2016",POSITIVE,"What truly makes the film riveting is Paulina Garca's performance as the title character -- and she appears in nearly every shot. With a wide, truly contagious smile, Garca exudes a lived-in confidence and control with every movement."
"Sep 10, 2015",POSITIVE,One of the best Chilean films of the 21st century. [Full review in Spanish]
"Sep 9, 2015",POSITIVE," Malentender la soledad como un veneno está matando a Gloria (Paulina García). Lánguida, taciturna, esta mujer entrada en sus 50 es el éxito de un fracaso universal: la búsqueda de la felicidad en la presencia de los otros. Gloria es la costumbre de enajenar al yo en un mundo que considera la extroversión un valor esencial, y la introversión un pecado contra la comunidad. Como muchos entre nosotros, ella no está sola; se siente así. Gloria cree que la soledad se cura con los ansiolíticos que improvisa la desesperación: el baile de pareja, el sexo, el romance por encima del amor, el tabaco. Todas son soluciones emergentes, efímeras, necesidades creadas que bloquean la comunión esencial del humano, que es la reunión con el yo. La primera imagen de la protagonista de Sebastián Lelio expresa su angustia con una esencialidad fuerte: ella bebe sola en la barra de un animado club nocturno y se mueve despacio entre la gente de su edad, que baila con ánimo mientras ella los contempla con el rostro manchado de tristeza. Cuando comienza a platicar o a bailar con otros su expresión cambia, su corazón se alivia. El contraste viene inmediatamente, cuando Gloria irremediablemente abandona el escape de su vida y regresa hacia la normalidad. El retorno a la innegable soledad es doloroso para Gloria, quien se busca un respiro en sus pequeños vicios y las llamadas a sus hijos. “Soy tu mamá”, les deja dicho en el buzón de voz, como orden, más bien chantaje, para que le arrojen un salvavidas, un permiso para visitarlos. En Gloria (2013), Lelio utiliza un contexto de enajenación cultural para exigir un rescate de la introspección. Convertida en minoría, Gloria, que se siente vieja y apartada por la cultura de la omnipresencia, del celular que no deja hablar con el interlocutor presente ni con el remoto; de las nuevas concepciones de familia, y del cultivo del físico, no puede integrarse al mundo sin sentirse remota y decide terminar sus largos años como soltera divorciada con un hombre de su edad, Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), y escapar al fin hacia un sueño donde nunca más estará sola. Se le olvida que Rodolfo, como ella, es real. También divorciado, el novio de Gloria tiene un pasado. La incapacidad de ambos para aceptar el bagaje del otro se convierte en el derrumbe de la ilusión que logran crear con lecturas de poemas y apasionados encuentros eróticos. Rodolfo tiene dos hijas y una exesposa que no sólo dependen de él, sino que son dependientes. Gloria se muestra intolerante desde la primera llamada entrometida que corta un rato de amor, porque después de sentirse tan aislada ella hubiera esperado que su relación fuera perfecta. Rodolfo desaparece cuando Gloria lo ignora en una fiesta familiar y, peor, se sienta al lado de su exesposo para ver las fotos de sus hijos. Indignada por su reacción, Gloria no vuelve a contestarle el teléfono. Lelio encuentra en el egoísmo, en la furiosa obsesión por lo idóneo, el fracaso del amor porque para él, como para Erich Fromm, amar es conocer, respetar, cuidar, responsabilizarse. Gloria y Rodolfo se incomodan ante el otro cuando descubren el pasado de cada quien y se rehúsan a aceptarse, pero la soledad que cargan en sus almas y que les hace necesitar del otro los reúne sólo para terminar en la recurrencia. Esta visión tan limitada se percibe en los símbolos que Gloria ignora, como el independiente gato que restaura el orden, o que reconoce con horror, como el esqueleto bailarín que le recuerda su mortalidad, porque, según nos expresa Lelio, Gloria va de error en error, como consecuencia de su búsqueda del amor y la aceptación afuera y no adentro de sí. Pero Gloria concluye con esperanza, aunque requiere de una epifanía real entre las muchas distorsiones  de su protagonista el que finalmente se pierda en la masa que baila una famosa canción que lleva su nombre. Gloria se confunde entre los otros después de rechazar una invitación a bailar porque al fin ha dejado de necesitar a la comunidad tras una violenta catarsis y un encuentro en el abandono: el de sí. Lelio cumple su objetivo después de hacer luchar a su protagonista y la recompensa con la contradicción de su deseo por un gran escape: una gran captura. El estereotipo de la soledad se invierte cuando Gloria se aprehende y puede, al fin, bailar sola.

"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE," The first time the viewer sees Paulina García’s Gloria at the bar of a crowded nightclub for middle-aged singles, the sound of Frecuencia Mod’s upbeat ‘Duele, duele tu amor’ (‘Your Love Hurts’) rings out. With a glass of pisco sour in her hand and her arm positioned confidently on the bar, she casts her eye around the room and then swings purposefully across the dance floor to introduce herself to a potential new partner as Donna Summer’s ‘I Feel Love’ resonates across the room. The sonic commentary offered by the two opening numbers sets the scene for Sebastián Lelio’s perceptive and entertaining study of a feisty, free-spirited 58-year-old divorcee, putting aside the pain of past relationships in her search for passion, companionship and a partner who shares her zeal for dance. Gloria’s early scenes are framed against a series of torch-song numbers that both comment on the action and complement the snippets of exposition revealed by Gloria’s encounters and conversations. Divorced for over a decade, she lives in a small apartment where she suffers upstairs neighbours – it is never clear if it is a single disturbed neighbour or a warring couple – arguing noisily late into the night. She leaves buoyant messages for her grown-up daughter Ana (Fabiola Zamora) and son Pedro (Diego Fontecilla), reminding them to call her – the implication being that she hears from them less than she would like. Gloria is single and lonely but refuses to give up. She croons along in the car to Massiel’s ‘Eres’ (‘You Are’) as she drives to work. The lyrics – “You are the response I couldn’t find in my silence… You are my king” – point to the traditional relationship model she’s searching for. The plethora of songs and music that underscore the film’s action, from the melancholy of Bach’s Partita in D minor for solo violin to Paloma San Basilio’s ‘Libre’, position Gloria’s adventures within a litany of tales of emotional survival in the aftermath of romantic heartbreak. Gloria is surrounded by a number of less than perfect relationships. “Are you going to tell me what to do?” thunders one of her neighbours to the other, ominously. Her son Pedro responds in an acerbic tone to the absent mother of his small child when she rings home. Her ex-husband Gabriel (Alejandro Goic) evidently has a strained relationship with his daughter – he is the last to know that she is expecting her Swedish boyfriend’s baby. And yet the film seems to suggest that Gloria’s family dynamics are no more problematic than those experienced by other characters in the film. The recently divorced Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), the retired naval officer Gloria begins a relationship with, has two grown-up daughters who appear utterly dependent on him. When Gloria brings him along to meet her family at Pedro’s birthday dinner, Rodolfo sheepishly reveals that his daughters never graduated, have no employment and still live at home. Indeed, on many levels Gloria enjoys a good relationship with her children: she visits her son and helps with his sick baby; and when she drives Ana to Santiago airport to catch a plane to join her boyfriend in Sweden, Ana appears genuinely distraught at parting from her. The film’s pulse comes in many ways from García’s brave and beautiful central performance. She dominates the movie from the very beginning as the camera picks her out in the swarming disco. She is present in every frame and Lelio shapes the film to ensure that the viewer is given the sense of entering her world, sharing the front seat of her car as she drives to work and the intimacy of her lovemaking scenes with Rodolfo. Her large round glasses frame slanting, expressive eyes and heavy lids noticeably dressed up with eye shadow; her flicked-back hair has something of a 1970s feel. García exudes the humanity of Carmen Maura’s genial Pepa in Almodóvar’s Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988), with the sexual energy of Diane Keaton’s Theresa Dunn in Richard Brooks’s Looking for Mr Goodbar (1977). Her positive outlook and willingness to try anything – including bungee jumping and marijuana – generate Rodolfo’s pick-up line: “Are you always this happy?” Gloria and Rodolfo’s sexual encounters are marked by the sight of flabby flesh and the sounds of slobbering kisses and heavy breathing. Gloria is a film about ageing and the management of change: Rodolfo has had a gastric bypass to deal with obesity but can’t handle his sagging waistline. He constricts himself within a girdle – a potent metaphor for his own emotional imprisonment – which Gloria rips off with a glorious sense of purpose. Gloria herself is diagnosed with glaucoma and must take action to avoid going blind. The film’s strength is that it operates both as a compelling character study of an alluring, humane protagonist whose fragility and resourcefulness sit side by side, and as a wider contemplation of the state of the nation, without the latter dimension ever appearing forced or imposed. There are scenes of protests on the TV as Gloria chats on the telephone at home, testifying to the wider turmoil besetting Santiago; she is framed by crowds of protesters carrying placards as she leaves a city café; and at a dinner party she bemoans the cost of medical treatment while her friend describes Chile as a ghost nation. Like Gloria and Rodolfo, the country is managing transition, from the lasting infrastructures of a dying dictatorship to a more pliable democratic model. But whereas Gloria is determined to move forward and let her children live their own lives, Rodolfo is trapped by a past that he can’t (and perhaps doesn’t even want to) let go. The fact that his adult daughters rely on him financially and emotionally is perhaps a comment on a generation who grew up in the shadow of a dictatorship that would not let them make decisions for themselves. Rodolfo seems content to let this culture of dependency continue, to the detriment of his relationship with Gloria. Hernández imbues Rodolfo with childish attributes: pleading eyes, overblown declarations of devotion, a petulant inability to deal with not being the centre of attention. He takes Gloria paintballing on their first date. “Men like to play war,” he informs her in a telling indictment of the macho culture that spawned and cocooned the Pinochet regime. The disclosure of Rodolfo’s military past leads to an awkward silence at Pedro’s birthday dinner. “Who is this man?” asks Ana after his embarrassing silent departure. There is an admirable visual economy to Gloria. The central protagonist’s emotional state emerges not only through the music, which works, the director has said, “almost like a Greek chorus”, but also through image association: a dancing skeleton in a shopping arcade embodies both Gloria’s sense of mortality and her lissom energy; the use of Mahler’s Adagietto from his Fifth Symphony as she sits at the hairdressers with her hair sculpted in tight curls suggests a parallel with the ageing Aschenbach in Visconti’s Death in Venice (1971). At the end of the film, Gloria embarks on a spring clean, hoovering her car (and by association her life) of unnecessary clutter. She returns Rodolfo’s paintballing guns with a flourish: dressed in black dress, heels and a red sequined bolero jacket, she fires green paint across both Rodolfo and his house while his overweight daughters rush like giant toddlers to his aid – a playful reference to Women on the Verge. In the final sequence she styles her hair in the mirror, cigarette in mouth, creating a new look for herself. Singing along to Umberto Tozzi’s ‘Gloria’ at a wedding party, she refuses an invitation to dance and subsequently takes to the floor at her own rhythm. Her style is all her own: passionate, fearless, determined and, like Lelio’s film, eloquently uplifting."
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE,"The film is a showcase for Garca's rich and varied performance. When it comes to finding meaning in Gloria's story, though, Lelio leaves that up to us."
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE,"We don't make movies in America like Gloria, so we have to import them. I wish we'd import more -- and make a few, as well."
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE," When we first meet Gloria, the middle-aged woman at the centre of Chilean director Sebastian Lelio's deceptively light drama, she's at a singles' night at a Santiago bar, where she likes to dance to old disco hits. Despite her humorously oversized, Tootsie-style glasses and hair-helmet, she exudes a sensual vibrancy. You can see it in the way she raises her arms on the dance floor, or wields her cigarette like an old-fashioned movie star. After flirting with an old acquaintance and getting a little drunk, Gloria (Paulina Garcia) goes home alone to her apartment, where she can hear her mentally ill stoner neighbour screaming to himself in the upstairs apartment. His creepy, hairless cat has, in an apparently familiar invasion, found its way into Gloria's apartment. Gloria has been divorced for 12 years and works in an undefined office job where, during the day, she phones her grown children to offer advice or assistance. Her violinist son, Pedro (Diego Fontecilla), is a single parent with a baby. Her daughter Ana (Fabiola Zamora) is a yoga instructor who's having a fling with a world-travelling Swedish skier. One night at the bar, Gloria meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a shy, sad-eyed man of around 60, who shows a keen interest in her. They drink, dance, and end up going to bed, where even his support corset is no impediment to a good time. Later, he takes her on a date to the theme park he owns, where they practise shooting paintball guns. At first, Rodolfo seems too sensitive and sweet to be true, writing her mushy love poetry and complimenting her incessantly. At one point he confides that his marriage ended a year ago, after he dropped a lot of weight with gastric bypass surgery. He still carries a lot of family baggage, with a demanding former wife and two dependent adult daughters, who call on him incessantly. What's worse, he says it would be less complicated to not tell them about his new relationship. Things come to a head when Gloria's son Pedro has a birthday dinner. It's also the occasion for a reunion with her now remarried former husband. Gloria decides to bring along Rodolfo. Everyone is civil, though there are tensions between Ana and her father, Gabriel (Alejandro Goic). At one point, Gloria realizes that Rodolfo, who has been hovering peevishly in the background, has left without telling her, claiming he has been called away on yet another family emergency. The film's second half follows Gloria's contrary impulses to either extract herself from Rodolfo's clinging, petulant ways or give him another chance. The latter call ends up in a disastrous getaway weekend at a casino resort. Much of the film is a portrait of a woman facing a middle-life crisis (the link to John Cassavetes's 1980 film Gloria does not seem coincidental), and Garcia won a best-actress award at the Berlin International Film Festival last year for her wonderfully specific performance. At the same time, Lelio includes unobtrusive symbolic touches – a macabre skeleton puppet, a resplendent white peacock – along with political and generational context. Chile's younger generation is represented both in Gloria's children, with their uncertain domestic arrangements, and in the agitated student protesters we see on the streets. Gloria's elderly housekeeper, a patient, delicately reproachful, maternal figure, is the generation of her parents. At a dinner party, we see Gloria's peers, the ones raised under General Pinochet's dictatorship. A left-leaning academic complains that money is the new ruling value, and Rodolfo mutters about the lack of leadership. He admits, defensively, that he was once an officer in the navy, which he attempts to distinguish from the ""military."" Suddenly, his paintball guns don't seem so innocent. Whether you appreciate Gloria as a portrait of a vital woman, muddling through life's middle chapters, or as an allegory of Chilean resilience, the message is the same: Let's face the music and dance."

The first and last time we see Gloria (Paulina Garcia), the 58-year-old Chilean divorcee who gives writer-director Sebastián Lelio’s touching midlife crisis drama its name, she’s lost in the shuffle of the dance floor — at once buried by the world and free to roam it. Anchored by Garcia’s nuanced performance, the movie explores this fragile state of being with extraordinary astuteness. It’s an open-ended question whether Gloria ever finds the happiness she seeks while dodging the current of middle-aged isolation, but her constant search is a valiant and deeply involving one. 	From the initial set piece that shows Gloria going about her bar-hopping single life, Lelio slowly assembles the details that define her solitary routine, drawing out her apparent ambivalence over it. In her cramped apartment, she spends more time shooing an intrusive cat that creeps into her room and trying to drown out a noisy neighbor upstairs than entertaining company. On the occasion that she does venture out, she maintains a healthy relationship with her two grown children and ex-husband. While this cycle of behavior shows contentment on the surface, Garcia’s character — typically hidden behind a pair of oversized glasses and heavy makeup — displays a lack of investment in her surroundings that suggests she wants something more. 	That void is filled with the arrival of Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), another aging parent recently divorced and eager for a rebound, with whom she shares a passionate one-night-stand that gradually develops into a greater bond. Though his motives and backstory are suspicious, the seemingly tender-hearted Rodolfo’s passionate exchanges with Lelio quickly accumulate emotional weight.
	There’s a marvelous sense of defiance to the way Lelio stages their early scenes together, conveying an atmosphere drenched in romance that rejuvenates the couple and strips away the barriers of age. In her newfound companionship, Gloria’s personality erupts with energy that Lelio explores intimately by showing the couple in the nude while in the throes of their sexual reawakening. The connection is so vividly realized that it’s especially tough to watch when the perfect scenario starts to unravel. 	Facing another set of relationship problems, Gloria’s hidden frustrations and burgeoning fear for her own mortality erupt in a series of unpredictable outbursts. Garcia’s droopy face, riddled with far more nuance than anything Gloria says, defines the movie’s fascinating trajectory. Rodolfo aptly summarizes her personality as “so physical, so real,” exactly the pair of traits that make her such a fascinating subject. 	Lelio has always applied a fair degree of subtlety to his filmmaking, which has carried the unevenness of his two earlier features starting with “La Sagrada Familia,” but the tendency finally blossoms here. Gloria rarely attempts to verbalize her emotions, but Lelio finds ways to do it for her with perceptive visual flourishes, as she frequently stares down symbolic reflections of her mindset — most memorably, when she comes across a dancing skeleton puppet at a supermall, but that’s just one of several interludes in “Gloria” where music and imagery speak volumes. 	By conveying Gloria’s alienation so effectively, the movie taps into a greater generational anxiety that imbues the character with metaphorical value. At a dinner table conversation, one of her relatives explains that the generation of young adults reared on social networking have experienced “a revolution that’s probably more spiritual” than the ones preceding it. The emerging communal energy of the digital age stands in stark contrast to Gloria’s lack of firm footing — as well as the desperation and self-delusion that results from it. 	While “Gloria” may pity its title character, she gets plenty of opportunities to fight back, none better realized than when Umberto Tozzi’s “Gloria” comes through the speakers at a bar and immediately refreshes her. As she jives to the tune as though the star of her own musical, the lyrics complimenting her movement (“You’re heading for a breakdown/so be careful not to show it”), a cheesy pop song transforms into her personal anthem. By that point, she has earned the attention.  HOW WILL IT PLAY? One of the best-received competition films at the Berlin International Film Festival, the movie should find a home with a midsize distributor able to play up its themes to older arthouse audiences. Produced by the same team that worked on the Oscar-nominated “No,” the new movie will help solidify Chile’s rising popularity in world cinema.

"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE,"This is not a film about narrative sweep, but about the slow, steady business of reclaiming one's soul."
"Jan 5, 2015",NEUTRAL," A 50-ish divorced woman (Paulina García) precariously navigates the pitfalls of life alone: dealing with landlord and neighbors, keeping in touch with her adult children without hovering—and, most precarious of all, adjusting to a new lover (Sergio Hernández) too recently divorced and still tied to ex-wife and family. Written by Gonzalo Maza and director Sebastián Lelio, the plot of this Chilean-Spanish co-production isn't particularly thick, but it's savory. The spice is provided largely by García's performance: She's not only the center of the movie, she's literally never off camera, and she holds our attention effortlessly. It's a winning, immensely sympathetic performance without fireworks, but with a steady fire. The rest of the cast—especially the mopey Hernández—complements her nicely. "
"Jan 5, 2015",NEGATIVE,"The script certainly couldn't give more of itself to its leading lady, and Chilean TV star Garcia accepts with a wondrous star turn that makes plain Gloria's inner vitality, but doesn't stint on the petty insecurities holding her back in other respects."
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE,"As a character study, Gloria is a rare pleasure. There's no quiet heroism in just living day to day, but there's definitely something admirable in bringing such a fully formed woman to the screen, naked and free to dance all she wants."
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE," Chilean actor Paulina García deservedly won a Best Actress award at this year's Berlin Festival for her exuberant, warm-hearted performance as Gloria, a divorcee in late middle age who still has an extraordinary lust for life. Her vigour is matched by that of the director Sebastián Lelio, who makes what could have been just another ponderous family drama about a mid-life crisis very high spirited and enjoyable indeed."
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE, Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram.
"Jan 5, 2015",POSITIVE,"Heartbreaking, unvarnished and thoughtful, Gloria is the story of a woman looking for the best that life can bring her. You'll be rooting for her to find it."
"Jan 4, 2015",POSITIVE," Gloria could have been a typical singles bar confection – a bittersweet drama about a woman searching for an anchor. Instead, Chilean director Sebastian Lelio’s Santiago-set film sensitively draws a portrait of a character who is her own person, whether on the sidelines or at the centre of things. For Gloria herself, however she is seen, she is always in the driving seat. Girl power maybe, but a self-determination lacking crass shouting and attention-seeking. The lightly humorous Gloria centres on Paulina García’s Gloria. She’s on screen throughout. Her presence is accompanied by music – her life is carried by music. In her car, she sings along with the radio airing Chilean hits of the Eighties. After opening the film with an unfamiliar local song playing in a club, the film moves to Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love”. Music and Gloria's life are symbiotic (pictured right, Paulina García as Gloria with Sergio Hernández as Rodolfo). García is amazing. Her portrayal of this aware yet sensitively positioned woman is nuanced, utterly convincing and bears not a jot of self-pity. She is Gloria. Her daughter doesn’t answer phone calls, so Gloria attends the yoga class she leads and in the process meets her Swedish boyfriend for the first time. Pregnancy follows, as does the daughter's decision to move to Sweden. The connection between them is clear, and Gloria only breaks down at the airport after her daughter is out of sight and out of reach. It’s the only time Gloria loses control. When Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández) strolls into her life, she goes along with him, trying out paintball and sex with him. His mlitary background is a charged characterisation given Chile’s history. He woos with stereotypical declarations and readings from sappy literature. But despite also being divorced, he lacks Gloria’s assurance. His two daughters constantly call and are reliant on him. His ex-wife is still in the picture. Taken by Gloria to meet her family at her son’s birthday dinner, he’s petulant about not being the centre of attention and vanishes without a word (pictured left, Paulina García's Gloria learns how to laugh). Rodolfo has, though, tried to reinvent himself. Just before his divorce he had a weight-loss operation and shows Gloria a picture of his former, bulky self. His past is always close and he now wears a corset which she triumphantly tears off. After his vanishing act, she gives him another try but he sneaks off again. Her housekeeper rescues her from the hotel. On returning home, Gloria allows the cat which has been sneaking into her apartment to stay, finds an appropriate use for the paintball guns in the trunk of her car, and finally encounters Rodolfo’s daughters. With a new hairdo, she returns to checking out Santiago’s nightlife. This fantastic film has attracted attention at festivals and its general release in the UK is cause for celebration. See it and root for Paulina García’s fabulous Gloria."
"Nov 16, 2014",POSITIVE,"Insofar as Garca's is clearly one of the best performances to reveal itself in U.S. theaters in the last couple of years, that's enough to make Gloria essential viewing."
"Sep 27, 2014",POSITIVE,"Obviously, this is a one-woman show, and an extraordinary part for an actress, and Paulina Garca fulfills it 100%."
"Sep 10, 2014",POSITIVE,"A triumph of quiet beauty and subtle storytelling that, if you like that sort of thing, will haunt you for days."
"Sep 7, 2014",POSITIVE,Sebastian Lelio delivers a tour-de-force that embraces the notion that we never stop seeking love and companionship.
"Jul 5, 2014",POSITIVE,"You will probably warm to this odd and unglamorous character. You'll come to appreciate her expressions, her wit, her imagination, and her courage."
"Apr 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"It's a warm, earnest and lively movie, anchored by a superb lead performance."
"Apr 8, 2014",POSITIVE," There have been more than a few movies about older people trying to avoid the lethargic funk of their retirement years,but none of them approach the subject in quite the way that Gloria does. The movie revels in activity and vitality, promising that of course it’s possible for one to keep having fun no matter what age they are. At the same time, it’s under no illusions about the trepidation that comes with the twilight years. In one scene, the title character joyfully rides a zip line. The next, she watches a dancing skeleton puppet with melancholy in her eyes. Gloria, played by Paulina Garcia, is a 58-year-old divorcée. She spends her days trying to keep as busy as possible with sporty diversions and singles meets, and her nights listening to the rantings of her troubled upstairs neighbor. Her routine is shaken up when she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a fellow divorcée with a similar lust for life. The two prove a good pair, and for a while it seems that Gloria might have found a second chance at a meaningful relationship. But she gradually finds Rodolfo unwilling to commit, and that drives a wedge between them. Garcia’s performance is quietly remarkable. She wears every emotion in the way her face crinkles, and in the way her eyes flicker in constant contemplation. The movie is less driven by plot by it is by constant introspection about the various foibles of the twilight years. Gloria is frustrated by the fact that she’s a younger soul in an old body, and how others play off of this quality. The movie follows through on its goal to depict Gloria and her romantic / pleasure-seeking escapades as frankly as possible. It’s unafraid of 60-year-old bodies. One sex scene between Gloria and Rodolfo is more intimate and convincing than a good deal of standard hot and heavy movie fare, and that honesty extends to the rest of their interactions, which start out sweet and get increasingly painful as it becomes clear the pair isn’t made to last. That objective perspective means that the interpretation of the film can be quite subjective (beyond the fact that reactions to movies are always subjective, of course). I’ve read vastly different, often diametrically opposed ideas about Gloria. Is she cloaking a refusal to accept her age in her insistence that it’s just a number? Is she wholly sympathetic in her attempts to get Rodolfo to come closer to her, or is she overly aggressive? It’s hard for me to come down on one side or another, and I can see the logic in every reading of the movie. Dance sequences bookend Gloria. At the beginning, Gloria orders drinks in the background while others boogie in the foreground. At the end, she is front and center, dancing to Umberto Tozzi’s Gloria (a tad obvious, I’ll admit, but still infectiously joyous). If there’s a change in Gloria’s character in the interim between these two scenes, it’s that she’s simply had the “live life to the fullest” credo reinforced for her. She suffers a lot of heartache, but does that mean she should just stop trying? Hell no.

"Apr 3, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Brilliantly brought to life by actress Paulina Garca, Gloria is not afraid to put herself out there at a Santiago dance club for over-50s, where she drinks, boogies and is on the lookout for Mr. Right."
"Mar 25, 2014",POSITIVE," Chilean director Sebastián Lelio(“Christmas”/”Smog”/”El año del tigre “) co-writes with Gonzalo Maza this observant indie romantic comedy. It’s about a middle-class 58-year-old divorced resident of Santiago, Gloria (Paulina García), with two grown children living on their own, who puts on a smile for the outside world even though hurting inside, as she goes regularly to senior citizen single discos hoping to meet a man. One night she meets the polite owner of an amusement park, someone her own age, Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), and hops into bed with him hoping to make a relationship. Things sour when he won’t introduce her to his two grown daughters and still looks after his ex-wife of a year. Gloria invites Rodolfo to her son Pedro’s (Diego Fontecilla) birthday party, where he meets her engaged to a world-traveller Swedish ski bum yoga instructor daughter Ana (Fabiola Zamora) and her ex-husband (Alejandro Goic), not seen by her for the last ten years, and his pregnant second wife (Liliana García). Without telling anyone the spineless Rodolfo rudely walks out of the family reunion, leaving Gloria miffed. When Rodolfo repeatedly calls, asking for another chance, she relents and they go to a nearby seaside resort for a weekend together. When Rodolfo receives a call from his daughter that his ex-wife is hurt, going through a pane of glass, he without a word abandons Gloria and stiffs her for the bill. In the conclusion, Gloria regains her nerve, as she’s again at the disco and sings the Umberto Tozzi’s 1979 hit Gloria (sung by Laura Branagan, who dubs Gloria’s voice). I think Lelio meant us to admire the aging vulnerable woman, who faces such social hurts, glaucoma and also has to cope with her inconsiderate noisy upstairs neighbor keeping her awake every night. That in the end she shows spunk and determines she can have fun in her golden years despite all the drawbacks makes her into an empowered heroine. Garcia’s appealing performance makes us root for her, as she invites no self-pity in this slight but unpretentious pic about lonely senior citizens still looking for romance."
"Mar 24, 2014",POSITIVE,"The movie insists on the value of the everyday. Gloria's heroism is her dignity, her intelligence, her perseverance."
"Mar 19, 2014",POSITIVE," Sebastián Lelio is another of those foreign — in this case Chilean — filmmakers whose work (for whatever reason) has failed to come to Asheville. That changes with his fourth theatrical feature, Gloria, which opened on Friday at the Fine Arts. The film, which Lelio co-wrote with his Christmas (2009) co-author Gonzalo Maza, is not the sort of thing one sees every day. Oh, I don’t mean that it’s awash in cinematic creativity. In fact, I can recall nothing remarkable about the way Gloria is made — except that it’s well-made and intelligent. But this is a film that operates on story and character more than anything. In that regard, the film is far from what we usually see. Gloria is about a woman approaching 60 and her attempts at finding herself as well as some romantic validation. Gloria (Chilean TV actress Paulina Garcia) has been divorced for years. She lives alone in a comfortable apartment with an often loud, mentally disturbed man on the floor above her. She’s also frequently invaded by the man’s hairless sphynx cat, which she’s slightly repulsed by. She works at a boring office. Her children are grown and have little need for her. (Gloria’s efforts at soothing a grandchild suggest that mothering may never have been her strong suit.) Her ex-husband has long since remarried. In other words, Gloria is at a loose end, and her only visible admirer is a cat she doesn’t much like. Gloria is not, however, a victim. She has in some respects crafted her own world — that of an observer behind a pair of terminally unstylish glasses, cutting loose only in the privacy of her own car, where she sings along with pop songs on the radio. The crux of the film concerns Gloria’s attempts to become a participant rather than an observer. This takes the form of her meeting a retired naval officer, Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández, No), at a dance club. He is much more recently divorced than she is, and his two daughters and ex-wife are constantly in need of him. Rodolfo keeps Gloria separate from his own life, while constantly intruding on hers. Yet they seem compatible, willing to share some pretty intimate secrets and are more than willing to share other kinds of intimacy. Even when he screws up spectacularly, Gloria ultimately relents and gives the relationship another chance. This is pretty much what the film is. It’s all Gloria’s story. There isn’t a scene — possibly not even a shot — that she isn’t in. We never see what anyone else is doing. We make no discoveries she can’t make. We do, however, have glimpses of things she may not be aware of — like the way she slowly accepts the presence of the hairless cat and the meaning behind her actions in the film’s final scene. All of this is presented in a very frank manner. The film doesn’t shy away from depicting the sex between Gloria and Rodolfo. In fact, it doesn’t shy away from anything, which is what makes it refreshingly adult. But let’s be honest: Gloria is utterly dependent on the performance of Paulina Garcia, and she more than delivers. She not only lays her body bare but also her soul.

"Mar 7, 2014",POSITIVE," In the Chilean movie Gloria, actress Paulina Garcia wears over-sized glasses that may have the unfortunate effect of reminding American audiences of Dustin Hoffman’s look in the gender-bending comedy Tootsie. Safe to say that director Sebastian Leilo has something else in mind. The glasses, I think, have thematic significance. Despite the size of her glasses,  Gloria — a 50-something woman who has been divorced for more than a decade — doesn’t always see clearly, and we’re not talking about her ability to read an eye chart. It’s a bit cliched to say, but Gloria spends too much time looking for love in all the wrong places. She bar-hops and goes to discos. When she’s not immersing herself in Santiago’s nightlife, she’s at home in an apartment where she’s tormented by a noisy neighbor who seems to be having a non-stop argument with himself. To make matters worse, the neighbor’s hairless cat keeps wandering into Gloria’s place. Gloria isn’t completely alone. She has grown children — a son and a daughter — but like most grown children, they’re busy with their own lives. The question of Gloria’s vision (perhaps judgment might be a better word) comes into sharp focus when she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a retired Navy man who seems to want more than an evening’s sexual release.  Rodolfo is also divorced, but he feels the tug of need from his two grown daughters and from an ex-wife who apparently won’t let go. And perhaps Rodolfo doesn’t want his daughters or his former spouse to let go. For all his complaining, he’s obviously nourished by their dependancy. Leilo should be commended for creating a portrait of an older single woman, and you can have fun speculating about how Hollywood might have treated the same subject — presuming it even bothered with characters who carry lots of personal baggage with them as they age. A scene in which Gloria invites Rodolfo to her son’s birthday party (her former husband and his young wife also attend) shows that Rudolfo can’t deal with outsider status. For their relationship to succeed, Gloria and Rodolfo must accept the fact that not all of their history can be shared. I’ve seen the movie described as joyful, but that’s not a word I’d use in connection with a film about a woman’s attempts to battle loneliness. Garcia creates a vibrant chaacter whose persistence and liveliness keep the movie’s wheels spinning, but Gloria has moments of despair that play against its comic thrust.  By the end of the film, we get the feeling that Gloria will persist — even if if she has to go it alone. Still, there’s a lingering question about whether she’ll ever find the companionship for which she yearns. Dance, in this case to a Spanish version of the disco song that may have given the movie’s title character her name, becomes the operative metaphor for Gloria’s ability to survive. Metaphorically, it’s important to keep dancing. The question for Gloria — and for everyone else, I suppose — is how to keep dancing, even after the music stops. "
"Mar 6, 2014",POSITIVE,"A raw and rich look at loneliness, love and aging."
"Mar 5, 2014",POSITIVE," Paulina Garcia's Gloria is a character you usually see on the periphery of movies. She's a 50-something divorced mother of two trying to keep a foothold in the lives of her adult son and daughter, but instead of seeing her from their youthful perspective, we see them from hers. Sebastian Lelio's fine film doesn't show the children hearing - and ignoring - mum's call, it watches her leave a message, afterwards pondering the hurt of casual silence from your own offspring. This Chilean drama is a reminder that no one is a simple outline. Gloria is gainfully employed and lives comfortably alone, but she pursues, sometimes painfully, companionship and sexual satisfaction. At the Santiago seniors' disco she frequents, where beauty and age are judged quickly and cruelly to the menacing throb of I Feel Love, hope and desperation are barely divided. When the ageing Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez) tells Gloria that ""I'm constantly thinking about you"", she's both excited and wary. The film, which unfolds via a naturalistic hand-held aesthetic, doesn't limit Gloria, and she's never merely the wise, forgiving mother, or any other cinematic cliche. The movie is particularly alert to the way grown children cast a shadow over their parents' lives. Rodolfo, separated for a year, is still the first port of call for ""the girls"", despite his daughters being aged 27 and 31, and his relationship with Gloria has to define itself outside the vast shadows cast by their previous marriages. Chilean cinema has distinguished itself internationally over the past few years, with Pablo Larrain's Tony Manero and No, which explore the South American's nation's volatile political history, and the Roman Polanski-like dislocation of Sebastian Silva's Magic Magic. Lelio adds to the country's profile, evoking an emotionally rich portrait of his titular character. Equal credit belongs to Paulina Garcia, who uses the awkward glasses that divide Gloria's face to sometimes obscure her feelings, while at other moments the depth and intensity of the character's reactions are almost overwhelming. The openness extends to the sex scenes, which are both passionate and scrupulously honest. Lelio allows the mood to build through Gloria's travails with Rodolfo, particularly at a long and increasingly fractious birthday dinner. For each person who sees Gloria as someone else's mother or co-worker, she's quietly determined to be the centre of her own imperfect world."
"Mar 2, 2014",POSITIVE," Gloria doesn’t contain a lot of story but it makes up for it with an abundance of character. I’m sure Chilean director Sebastián Lelio deserves his fair share of credit but the reason you’ll remember this film is because of the performance of star Paulina García. She won the best actress prize at the 2013 Berlin Festival and it’s easy to see why. So let me do my best to describe Gloria. She’s fifty-something years of age and she’s been divorced for a decade. Her two children have moved out of home and she tries to catch up with them semi-regularly. She lives alone but she still likes to be social. In the film’s opening scene, we see her on the dance floor of a nightclub and trying to catch the attention of a particular guy. The style of the film is somewhat fragmented. We zip between locations and get a glimpse of Gloria is each of those settings. It is then up to you to take in all of these observations and form your own conclusions about her. Is she happy? Is she lonely? Is she vulnerable? Is she just like you and me? There’s one part of her life that is given more attention – her relationship with an ex-naval officer named Rodolfo (Hernández) who she also meets in a nightclub. The two are keen to spend time together… but there’s a catch. Rodolfo can’t seem to distance himself from his clingy ex-wife and his two unemployed daughters. It leaves Gloria unsure about their future and whether it’s a relationship she wants to fully invest in. Having done the rounds at the Sydney and Melbourne Film Festivals last year, it’s nice to see Gloria getting a wider release here in Australia. I sense that some might be frustrated with the film’s lack of narrative momentum but it’s still an engaging character study that taps into feelings that are very difficult to put into words."
"Feb 28, 2014",POSITIVE,"Subtle, quiet, delicate and unpretentious, Gloria is among the most satisfying films I have seen in years."
"Feb 28, 2014",POSITIVE," Gloria (Pauline Garcia) is a 58-year-old woman living alone in Santiago, Chile. Her divorce 12 years ago was not the end of the world, and her life is crowded – if not with passion, then with duty. She has a daughter who teaches yoga and a son with a baby and an ex-wife. Gloria works in a busy office. She sings along with the radio in the car, because she knows all the words to the romantic hits. At weekends she togs up and goes to a dance club for seniors. There she meets the handsome Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), who is divorced, soulful, ardent. They begin a passionate affair, which we see in some detail. The sex is frankly if not frighteningly depicted. So far the film offers nothing you would mistake for drama. There is a sense of developing mystery, but it's muted. The camera keeps close to Gloria, following her day and night, but she reveals little, except by her uninhibited singing. She's attractive, obviously brave in going to a seniors meat market by herself each week, and just as obviously lonely. That loneliness is made physical by a small but clever plot detail. A hairless cat from the apartment upstairs keeps sneaking into her apartment. She can barely look at it, let alone pick it up. The cat is like an accusation: you need something to love, even something as unattractive as me. Gloria is promoted as a comedy, and some parts are amusing, but it's not really funny; the loneliness is too real. Nobody makes movies about lonely women for that reason, but the Chilean director Sebastian Lelio, who's 39, boldly goes where less confident directors fear to tread. For him it's a film about his mother's generation, and that makes it an act of tenderness. At the same time it's also a work of imagination rather than self knowledge. I can imagine many women of about 60 recognising parts of themselves in Gloria, especially in her troubles with men of a certain age, but I can also imagine some finding this character study just a tiny bit patronising. He has not lived this life, yet he feels confident about viewing it with a touch of pity? Garcia's performance is wonderful, and was recognised at the Berlin Film Festival last year with a Silver Bear for best actress. The movie begins slowly and a little coldly, but it warms up. There is less pity than compassion. The more we watch her, the more beautiful her character becomes."
"Feb 28, 2014",POSITIVE,"What could in less capable hands so easily have been mishandled, lapsing either into patronising comedy or sappy sentimentality, is accorded generous and sympathetic treatment here."
"Feb 28, 2014",POSITIVE," Chilean director Sebastian Lelio's Gloria is a warm, intimate, sharply funny depiction of a life in progress. It's the portrait of a middle-aged woman, wonderfully portrayed by Paulina Garcia, drawn with generosity and care and an utter lack of sentimentality. In its quiet way, it attempts a tricky balancing act: Gloria is made up for the most part of ordinary, everyday moments. Yet there's something troubling and unsettling beneath the surface, a sense of things at stake. This has to do with Gloria's choices, expectations and limitations, as well as her strengths – most of all, her tenacity and her openness to experience. She lives alone, she works, she likes to go dancing. She has been divorced for a long time. Her relationships with her adult children are detached but amicable. When she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a slightly older man who is clearly smitten with her, things seem to be taking a turn for the better. The course of their relationship tests Gloria, in ways that can be hilarious and painful. Garcia's performance is beautifully judged: she gives the character depths and certainties and a disarming resourcefulness. She doesn't feel that her life is over, that her options are all exhausted – and that's where the quiet exhilaration of the film comes from."
"Feb 28, 2014",POSITIVE,"If the film itself doesn't win viewers over with its refreshingly rounded story, Garcia's offering of a vulnerable and tenacious heroine will; make no mistake, audiences will be singing Gloria's name."
"Feb 27, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Look, how often do we see films about people of this age finding love and particularly finding sex and so this is quite original from that point of view?"
"Feb 27, 2014",NEUTRAL,"This is what getting old is all about. GLORIA is nicely acted, nicely shot, it's just a teeny bit dull."
"Feb 27, 2014",POSITIVE," Audiences are programmed to expect escapism in movies about romantic relationships, whether they be foregone happily-ever-after comedies or doomed-to-death tragedies. But Sebastián Lelio's Gloria—Chile's official Oscar submission—insists upon unsettling realities without either stomping on its hero's indomitability or tacking on a deus ex machina.Socially active in Santiago, Gloria (Paulina García) is 58, years divorced, and unashamed of enjoying single life to the best of her ability. Part of what makes García so beguiling in the role are her naturally sad eyes, which seem to droop even when she's beaming. To look into García's face is to see the movie, a loving character study, in miniature at any moment: Gloria refuses to be your stereotype or a writer's stock character. She's complicated, like you: she has dark nights of the soul despite a willful optimism that, this time, she's gonna make it after all.""This time"" means Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a somewhat older ex-Navy man she picks up on an evening out. The pair embark on a relationship as excitedly sexual as it is romantic: if Gloria was ever a shrinking violet, she's long past those days. Rodolfo's puppyish recitations of Claudio Bertoni poems bode well for a relationship that seems to be a great fit; they could be one of those smiling couples in a magazine ad targeted at people of a certain age.But time doesn't freeze, and relationships get real: as the two unpack their baggage for each other, they discover the ways they'll have to work at hanging on to each other. Both have adult children and exes that complicate their lives. For all his purred devotion (promises, promises...), Rodolfo remains unhealthily at the beck and call of his ex-wife, at least from Gloria's point of view. Every time he pulls a poorly timed disappearing act on Gloria, it's a dagger in her heart.What gives Gloria the rhythm of life is its stringent heroic point of view: we wake up with Gloria, follow her to her unfulfilling job, hang out with her and her family, go out on dates with her, and observe her in quiet introspection and party time (the latter, as in life, being sometimes distressing to behold). Lelio and co-scripter Gonzalo Maza also thoughtfully depict contemporary Chile. They don't bend the reality of life in Santiago to suit their story; they simply remember how politics and urban influences subtly line our paths, whether they be student protests in the street or Rodolfo's worrying past as a seeming Pinochet loyalist.The film's doggedly realistic subtleties do put a weight of dullness on the scene-to-scene movement of the film: I'd be lying if I said it were always scintillating. On the other hand, whenever the story reaches for catharsis, it stumbles into cliche, including in a love-it-or-hate ending that, for my taste, is a little too on-the-nose. All the same, García rises above any failings to make Gloria a 110-minute anthem for the women Hollywood forgot."
"Feb 26, 2014",NEUTRAL," 
Gloria (Paulina Garcia) is a Santiagoan who has been divorced for 10 years. Out dancing one night, she finds the courtly Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), an ex-Naval officer who now runs a paintball emporium. Director Sebastian Lelio insists that it's a meeting of bodies as well as minds. Age has seasoned Gloria. She's getting glaucoma and she has to keep her glasses on when they tryst.
 
The problem with the relationship is the couple's families; Gloria's ex married a younger woman, but this elder man sitting around at a family reunion is a little too strange. And Rodolfo's ex-wife and grown daughters pester him relentlessly.

"Feb 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"The humour comes mostly from painful places, our recognition of painful truths and/or just the authenticity of responses by the characters, sometimes delivered as nothing more than a glance or a thin smile."
"Feb 21, 2014",POSITIVE,A knock-out performance from Paulina Garca as Gloria anchors this insightful portrait of a life-loving woman searching for fulfilment
"Feb 20, 2014",POSITIVE,"Seeing Gloria makes you realize it's possible to portray middle-aged romance, and sex, without resorting to goofy caricature."

"Feb 17, 2014",POSITIVE,"Sebastin Lelio's melodrama about a woman's determined search for love and meaning is hilarious and disquieting, sometimes within the same moment."
"Feb 15, 2014",NEUTRAL," Chile’s submission for this year’s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar (although it didn’t end up with a nomination), Gloria is a sometimes fascinating, sometimes obtuse character study about a middle-aged woman struggling to find satisfaction in her personal life. Long divorced, mostly neglected by her adult children, working in a generic office job, Gloria (Paulina Garcia) may seem to have an empty, lonely life, but she also clearly has resilience and optimism, getting dressed up and going out dancing with other singles of a certain age, and eventually starting a relationship with fellow divorcé Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez). That relationship begins as exciting and invigorating for both Gloria and Rodolfo, but the baggage that comes with years of living (exes, children, various obligations) eventually takes its toll, and neither of them exactly handles it well. Director and co-writer Sebastian Lelio plays things so coy at times that it’s hard to understand the characters’ motivations, and while Garcia’s performance makes Gloria likeable and engaging, she’s still largely an enigma. The movie sometimes plays like a portrait of crushing loneliness, but it’s equally possible to see it as an ode to positivity, to moving forward despite overwhelming negative odds. Either way, Lelio provides plenty of touching moments, and he depicts sex among older people with an admirable frankness, neither turning away from nor sensationalizing Gloria and Rodolfo’s bedroom activities. Whether she’s a lonely misfit desperate for any kind of companionship, or a vibrant and independent woman who takes relationships on her own terms, Gloria is a complex person, and Lelio never treats her with anything other than respect. Understanding her, however, proves to be a little more difficult. “Across the Tracks: A Las Vegas Westside Story” was screened at both the Sundance Film Festival and locally at the Plaza, and the film serves ..."

Ciavarella as he emerges from the courthouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to face a scrum of reporters and camera operators after his February 2011 conviction on twelve of thirty-nine counts of racketeering, bribery and extortion. According to federal prosecutors, he had used his power as the juvenile court judge of neighboring Luzerne County to funnel thousands of children into for-profit prisons in exchange for kickbacks from the operators. As Ciavarella stands in grim silence beside his lawyer, who is making the obligatory futile effort to portray disgrace as exoneration, a slim blond woman named Sandy Fonzo, the mother of one of the wronged children, sweeps around the right flank of the press corps and comes bearing down on Ciavarella, cursing him for having destroyed her son’s life. Had you read about the case in the newspapers, you might have seen that incident frozen as a front-page photograph: the gray, bespectacled, plump-cheeked Ciavarella in the foreground, gazing down at the microphones he won’t use, with Fonzo raging behind his shoulder. 




If Kids for Cash were a standard exposé, as it appears to be at first, you might spend an hour and a half with it and never get much deeper than that image of anguished wrath at the back of wrongful authority. But Kids for Cash does not let you off so easily, to turn the page and skim the next outrage. In effect, it takes you inside the front-page photo.
You meet Sandy Fonzo, listen to her stories, watch her home movies and go with her to visit the grave of her son, Ed Kenzakoski. Remarkably, you also visit with Mark Ciavarella in his house, see him with his family, and hear him account for his actions with a mixture of sorrow, bafflement and mounting distress. The picture grows more dense with the testimonies of four survivors of Ciavarella’s courtroom—young adults now, but barely teenagers when they were hauled into a perfunctory, lawyerless trial—who spent years in Pennsylvania juvenile prisons for offenses such as getting into a schoolyard fight, shouting curses at a bus stop and mocking a teacher on MySpace. As these details accumulate, May gradually makes the case that the front-page photo is incomplete. Although Ciavarella was guilty of financial improprieties—and admitted as much—he might have been telling the truth when he insisted that he had not railroaded kids for cash.
He just railroaded kids, and thought it was the right thing to do. According to some of May’s witnesses—the reporter for the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader who covered the story, and the former head of the Luzerne County public defender’s office—Ciavarella had come onto the bench vowing to maintain a zero-tolerance policy for youthful misbehavior and had kept his promise, starting well before the profit-making prisons were built. In the climate of fear that took hold after the Columbine massacre, and in a culture that promoted individual responsibility as the sole cure for all social ills, Ciavarella had won praise and popularity for jailing virtually every child brought before his bench. Never mind that children by nature cannot consistently live up to adult standards of responsibility, as Marsha Levick and Robert Schwartz of Philadelphia’s Juvenile Law Center argue. The public was clamoring for stringency, the schools were happy to dump their troublemakers, and officials across the country were sending more and more children to prison, as if life behind bars would make kids wiser, more amiable and better prepared to do the work of the world—a notion worthy of the man in Swift’s A Tale of a Tub who is shocked to discover that flogging does little to improve a woman’s appearance. Ciavarella himself held firmly to the punitive faith, believing he was helping the kids. This is a man who proudly recalls, when speaking to May’s camera, that his father once turned him away from the path of delinquency by knocking him unconscious.

Kids for Cash is the first film directed by May, who until now has done admirable work as a producer for the likes of Errol Morris and Steve James. Despite the clarity of exposition that he brings to the job, and his caginess in building up and then undermining the received image of Ciavarella, the result is not an especially artful documentary; but it may be something equally valuable. It’s an honest investigation—unprejudiced toward its subjects, thorough in its research, comprehensive in its intellectual framework—and it’s a tragedy.
* * *
You come to a moment in Gloria, an unaffectedly sad and charming tale by the Chilean director Sebastián Lelio, when the title character asks for a public reading of the love letter her grown daughter recently received. The message arrived by e-mail, and so, after an initial demurral, the daughter gets out her smartphone. When she brings it close to read, her face literally lights up with the words.
Modest, natural and yet keyed up just a little beyond the everyday, this passing effect illuminates something lovely in the young woman but is even better for the reflected light it casts on Gloria, who glows with happiness for her daughter but has no desire to live through her. At 50, more or less, Gloria still wants a sex life of her own, preferably with somebody sympathetic who likes to go out on the town, and she will not let divorce, a few wrinkles or a blandly respectable job hold her back.
Played by Paulina García with the grace of a woman who makes light of her own wounds and is oblivious to her own courage, Gloria wraps herself most evenings in a layer or two of something tasteful but sparkly, transforms her lips into a masterpiece of hard-edged monochrome painting, and sallies unaccompanied into one or another of the discos for the post-40 set, which apparently are a common resource in Santiago. If no one asks her to dance, she will venture onto the floor by herself. With her squarishly handsome features, helmet of brown hair and enormous eyeglasses, she looks a bit like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, which I do not mean as an insult. There is more humor than desperation in Gloria’s outgoing manner, more prideful display than anxious disguise in the way she likes to play dress-up. When she takes up with a comfortably rumpled older man (Sergio Hernández) whom she’s met in a disco—someone who has so many newly discovered feelings that he stammers in getting them out—you want to believe that Gloria has at last met someone who is her equal in benevolence and candor. I don’t think I’m giving anything away when I say that if he were, there wouldn’t be much of a movie.
Lelio in fact has plenty to work with in Gloria, in theme as well as plot. He simply prefers for you to encounter the bigger matters in small, everyday moments, as Gloria herself does, hearing about present-day social discontent through the complaints of friends exchanged over a meal, for example, or feeling a momentary chill from the Pinochet era when her new lover explains fuzzily that he was never in the military, just the navy. You are in the world of the short story rather than the novel: a place where the telling details are as close to hand as a jar of cold cream or the world’s ugliest stray cat, and the wisdom that encourages Gloria to keep living comes to her lips readily, in the words of the pop songs she loves to sing along with.
A feel-good movie that you don’t have to feel bad for liking, Gloria suggests that those songs might address the biggest matter of all: what you should do when you’ve lost your youth, your illusions, your proximity to your children, some of your late hopes and even a cat you hadn’t wanted in the first place. The answer—you should dance—wouldn’t sound very persuasive stated baldly; but articulated in the flesh and blood of the radiantly middle-aged Paulina García, it becomes a truth beyond argument.

What if you could get a sick society to submit to an X-ray? What would the picture look like? For starters, its field of vision would probably be limited, showing what was going on only within one small group, much as a standard X-ray investigates one part of a body. Although the disease would obviously not be confined to the group being investigated—the members of a family, say, or a set of people drawn together by work—you would assume the trouble could be seen in that cluster, perhaps in an acute form. Also, because there would be a lot of space separating the individuals in the group, who naturally would keep moving around, the picture might take a long time to expose—perhaps as much as two hours. Maybe you would watch the image slowly coalesce over that time, from the surface down, as the beam steadily penetrated through layer upon layer.
This impossible technology is the closest analogy I can imagine to the movies of the Romanian New Wave. Implicitly diagnostic in their purpose, cumulatively devastating in their impact, the films in this small but crucial subset of contemporary Romanian cinema practice something like the clear-sighted, unhurried concentration of Robert Bresson, but without the French master’s faith in a redemptive grace beyond the hard facts. To the Romanian filmmakers, the human drama is not existential but circumstantial—a misère that we make for ourselves, sans Dieu—which nevertheless has taken on the solidity of a permanent condition. Religious belief in these movies is at best a solace for the poor and simple; social change, a hope for the citizens of other countries. Proceeding as if their main duty were to see into the situation patiently, without blinking, the Romanian filmmakers offer the audience only two alternatives to despair: empathy and grim laughter.
When I say “Romanian filmmakers,” I am of course referring to a few interconnected people—that’s how it is with New Waves—of whom one of the most important is the screenwriter Razvan Radulescu. He contributed to the screenplays for Cristi Puiu’s The Death of Mr. Lazarescu and Radu Muntean’s Tuesday, After Christmas and served as a script consultant for Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Andrei Ujica’s The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu. That’s almost a clean sweep. About the only significant director with whom Radulescu has not worked is Corneliu Porumboiu, who could have used his help, as far as I’m concerned, for his most recent picture, When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism.
Radulescu’s latest collaboration was with the director Calin Peter Netzer on the entirely characteristic drama Child’s Pose, which won the top award at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival. Now going into theatrical release in the United States, beginning in New York at Film Forum, Child’s Pose is a continually deepening drama about corruption, class divisions and generational conflict in Romania, as exposed by the aftermath of a traffic fatality.
The ubiquitous Luminita Gheorghiu, indispensable woman of Romanian cinema, plays Cornelia, an affluent and well-connected theater designer and architect whose bitter, throaty speeches and continual self-medication (booze and tobacco) make her instantly disagreeable to the audience. When you see the lavishness of her birthday party, you wonder when Cornelia and her upper-class clique amassed their money and status: before or after Ceausescu? When you watch her order a housemaid to spy on her thirtysomething son Barbu, offering the bribe of a pair of used shoes (200 euros, and worn only once), you can understand why Barbu refused to attend her birthday party, and what he might have meant when he said that her entire generation ought to disappear.
Then Cornelia gets word that Barbu has been arrested in the impoverished outskirts of Bucharest, having run over a boy who was dashing across the highway. Driving out to the police station in the middle of the night, she calls in the help of the proper fixers, faces down one of the dead boy’s enraged relatives, tells the unhappy cops how they’re going to do their job and sets about altering Barbu’s written statement, all in one extraordinary prolonged scene. And now that you’ve finally met Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache), a shambling, overgrown boy who musters his energy only when he attacks his mother, you start to feel slightly less hostile toward Cornelia.
Netzer directs this episode, and the increasingly wrenching events that follow, in a more fluid style than other New Wave directors would use. He even cuts within scenes, which does nothing to dilute the power of Child’s Pose or diminish the stunning effectiveness of the actors (who behave with so little self-regard that Bresson might have forgiven them for being professionals). There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave. But the empathy is there, for Cornelia and for Barbu as well, in a film that gets all the way down to the rotten bones.
 If Kids for Cash were a standard exposé, as it appears to be at first, you might spend an hour and a half with it and never get much deeper than that image of anguished wrath at the back of wrongful authority. But Kids for Cash does not let you off so easily, to turn the page and skim the next outrage. In effect, it takes you inside the front-page photo.
You meet Sandy Fonzo, listen to her stories, watch her home movies and go with her to visit the grave of her son, Ed Kenzakoski. Remarkably, you also visit with Mark Ciavarella in his house, see him with his family, and hear him account for his actions with a mixture of sorrow, bafflement and mounting distress. The picture grows more dense with the testimonies of four survivors of Ciavarella’s courtroom—young adults now, but barely teenagers when they were hauled into a perfunctory, lawyerless trial—who spent years in Pennsylvania juvenile prisons for offenses such as getting into a schoolyard fight, shouting curses at a bus stop and mocking a teacher on MySpace. As these details accumulate, May gradually makes the case that the front-page photo is incomplete. Although Ciavarella was guilty of financial improprieties—and admitted as much—he might have been telling the truth when he insisted that he had not railroaded kids for cash.
He just railroaded kids, and thought it was the right thing to do. According to some of May’s witnesses—the reporter for the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader who covered the story, and the former head of the Luzerne County public defender’s office—Ciavarella had come onto the bench vowing to maintain a zero-tolerance policy for youthful misbehavior and had kept his promise, starting well before the profit-making prisons were built. In the climate of fear that took hold after the Columbine massacre, and in a culture that promoted individual responsibility as the sole cure for all social ills, Ciavarella had won praise and popularity for jailing virtually every child brought before his bench. Never mind that children by nature cannot consistently live up to adult standards of responsibility, as Marsha Levick and Robert Schwartz of Philadelphia’s Juvenile Law Center argue. The public was clamoring for stringency, the schools were happy to dump their troublemakers, and officials across the country were sending more and more children to prison, as if life behind bars would make kids wiser, more amiable and better prepared to do the work of the world—a notion worthy of the man in Swift’s A Tale of a Tub who is shocked to discover that flogging does little to improve a woman’s appearance. Ciavarella himself held firmly to the punitive faith, believing he was helping the kids. This is a man who proudly recalls, when speaking to May’s camera, that his father once turned him away from the path of delinquency by knocking him unconscious.

Kids for Cash is the first film directed by May, who until now has done admirable work as a producer for the likes of Errol Morris and Steve James. Despite the clarity of exposition that he brings to the job, and his caginess in building up and then undermining the received image of Ciavarella, the result is not an especially artful documentary; but it may be something equally valuable. It’s an honest investigation—unprejudiced toward its subjects, thorough in its research, comprehensive in its intellectual framework—and it’s a tragedy.
* * *
You come to a moment in Gloria, an unaffectedly sad and charming tale by the Chilean director Sebastián Lelio, when the title character asks for a public reading of the love letter her grown daughter recently received. The message arrived by e-mail, and so, after an initial demurral, the daughter gets out her smartphone. When she brings it close to read, her face literally lights up with the words.
Modest, natural and yet keyed up just a little beyond the everyday, this passing effect illuminates something lovely in the young woman but is even better for the reflected light it casts on Gloria, who glows with happiness for her daughter but has no desire to live through her. At 50, more or less, Gloria still wants a sex life of her own, preferably with somebody sympathetic who likes to go out on the town, and she will not let divorce, a few wrinkles or a blandly respectable job hold her back.
Played by Paulina García with the grace of a woman who makes light of her own wounds and is oblivious to her own courage, Gloria wraps herself most evenings in a layer or two of something tasteful but sparkly, transforms her lips into a masterpiece of hard-edged monochrome painting, and sallies unaccompanied into one or another of the discos for the post-40 set, which apparently are a common resource in Santiago. If no one asks her to dance, she will venture onto the floor by herself. With her squarishly handsome features, helmet of brown hair and enormous eyeglasses, she looks a bit like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, which I do not mean as an insult. There is more humor than desperation in Gloria’s outgoing manner, more prideful display than anxious disguise in the way she likes to play dress-up. When she takes up with a comfortably rumpled older man (Sergio Hernández) whom she’s met in a disco—someone who has so many newly discovered feelings that he stammers in getting them out—you want to believe that Gloria has at last met someone who is her equal in benevolence and candor. I don’t think I’m giving anything away when I say that if he were, there wouldn’t be much of a movie.
Lelio in fact has plenty to work with in Gloria, in theme as well as plot. He simply prefers for you to encounter the bigger matters in small, everyday moments, as Gloria herself does, hearing about present-day social discontent through the complaints of friends exchanged over a meal, for example, or feeling a momentary chill from the Pinochet era when her new lover explains fuzzily that he was never in the military, just the navy. You are in the world of the short story rather than the novel: a place where the telling details are as close to hand as a jar of cold cream or the world’s ugliest stray cat, and the wisdom that encourages Gloria to keep living comes to her lips readily, in the words of the pop songs she loves to sing along with.
A feel-good movie that you don’t have to feel bad for liking, Gloria suggests that those songs might address the biggest matter of all: what you should do when you’ve lost your youth, your illusions, your proximity to your children, some of your late hopes and even a cat you hadn’t wanted in the first place. The answer—you should dance—wouldn’t sound very persuasive stated baldly; but articulated in the flesh and blood of the radiantly middle-aged Paulina García, it becomes a truth beyond argument.

A feel-good movie that you don’t have to feel bad for liking, Gloria suggests that those songs might address the biggest matter of all: what you should do when you’ve lost your youth, your illusions, your proximity to your children, some of your late hopes and even a cat you hadn’t wanted in the first place. The answer—you should dance—wouldn’t sound very persuasive stated baldly; but articulated in the flesh and blood of the radiantly middle-aged Paulina García, it becomes a truth beyond argument.

What if you could get a sick society to submit to an X-ray? What would the picture look like? For starters, its field of vision would probably be limited, showing what was going on only within one small group, much as a standard X-ray investigates one part of a body. Although the disease would obviously not be confined to the group being investigated—the members of a family, say, or a set of people drawn together by work—you would assume the trouble could be seen in that cluster, perhaps in an acute form. Also, because there would be a lot of space separating the individuals in the group, who naturally would keep moving around, the picture might take a long time to expose—perhaps as much as two hours. Maybe you would watch the image slowly coalesce over that time, from the surface down, as the beam steadily penetrated through layer upon layer.
This impossible technology is the closest analogy I can imagine to the movies of the Romanian New Wave. Implicitly diagnostic in their purpose, cumulatively devastating in their impact, the films in this small but crucial subset of contemporary Romanian cinema practice something like the clear-sighted, unhurried concentration of Robert Bresson, but without the French master’s faith in a redemptive grace beyond the hard facts. To the Romanian filmmakers, the human drama is not existential but circumstantial—a misère that we make for ourselves, sans Dieu—which nevertheless has taken on the solidity of a permanent condition. Religious belief in these movies is at best a solace for the poor and simple; social change, a hope for the citizens of other countries. Proceeding as if their main duty were to see into the situation patiently, without blinking, the Romanian filmmakers offer the audience only two alternatives to despair: empathy and grim laughter.
When I say “Romanian filmmakers,” I am of course referring to a few interconnected people—that’s how it is with New Waves—of whom one of the most important is the screenwriter Razvan Radulescu. He contributed to the screenplays for Cristi Puiu’s The Death of Mr. Lazarescu and Radu Muntean’s Tuesday, After Christmas and served as a script consultant for Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Andrei Ujica’s The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu. That’s almost a clean sweep. About the only significant director with whom Radulescu has not worked is Corneliu Porumboiu, who could have used his help, as far as I’m concerned, for his most recent picture, When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism.
Radulescu’s latest collaboration was with the director Calin Peter Netzer on the entirely characteristic drama Child’s Pose, which won the top award at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival. Now going into theatrical release in the United States, beginning in New York at Film Forum, Child’s Pose is a continually deepening drama about corruption, class divisions and generational conflict in Romania, as exposed by the aftermath of a traffic fatality.
The ubiquitous Luminita Gheorghiu, indispensable woman of Romanian cinema, plays Cornelia, an affluent and well-connected theater designer and architect whose bitter, throaty speeches and continual self-medication (booze and tobacco) make her instantly disagreeable to the audience. When you see the lavishness of her birthday party, you wonder when Cornelia and her upper-class clique amassed their money and status: before or after Ceausescu? When you watch her order a housemaid to spy on her thirtysomething son Barbu, offering the bribe of a pair of used shoes (200 euros, and worn only once), you can understand why Barbu refused to attend her birthday party, and what he might have meant when he said that her entire generation ought to disappear.
Then Cornelia gets word that Barbu has been arrested in the impoverished outskirts of Bucharest, having run over a boy who was dashing across the highway. Driving out to the police station in the middle of the night, she calls in the help of the proper fixers, faces down one of the dead boy’s enraged relatives, tells the unhappy cops how they’re going to do their job and sets about altering Barbu’s written statement, all in one extraordinary prolonged scene. And now that you’ve finally met Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache), a shambling, overgrown boy who musters his energy only when he attacks his mother, you start to feel slightly less hostile toward Cornelia.
Netzer directs this episode, and the increasingly wrenching events that follow, in a more fluid style than other New Wave directors would use. He even cuts within scenes, which does nothing to dilute the power of Child’s Pose or diminish the stunning effectiveness of the actors (who behave with so little self-regard that Bresson might have forgiven them for being professionals). There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave. But the empathy is there, for Cornelia and for Barbu as well, in a film that gets all the way down to the rotten bones.
 Kids for Cash is the first film directed by May, who until now has done admirable work as a producer for the likes of Errol Morris and Steve James. Despite the clarity of exposition that he brings to the job, and his caginess in building up and then undermining the received image of Ciavarella, the result is not an especially artful documentary; but it may be something equally valuable. It’s an honest investigation—unprejudiced toward its subjects, thorough in its research, comprehensive in its intellectual framework—and it’s a tragedy.

You come to a moment in Gloria, an unaffectedly sad and charming tale by the Chilean director Sebastián Lelio, when the title character asks for a public reading of the love letter her grown daughter recently received. The message arrived by e-mail, and so, after an initial demurral, the daughter gets out her smartphone. When she brings it close to read, her face literally lights up with the words.
Modest, natural and yet keyed up just a little beyond the everyday, this passing effect illuminates something lovely in the young woman but is even better for the reflected light it casts on Gloria, who glows with happiness for her daughter but has no desire to live through her. At 50, more or less, Gloria still wants a sex life of her own, preferably with somebody sympathetic who likes to go out on the town, and she will not let divorce, a few wrinkles or a blandly respectable job hold her back.
Played by Paulina García with the grace of a woman who makes light of her own wounds and is oblivious to her own courage, Gloria wraps herself most evenings in a layer or two of something tasteful but sparkly, transforms her lips into a masterpiece of hard-edged monochrome painting, and sallies unaccompanied into one or another of the discos for the post-40 set, which apparently are a common resource in Santiago. If no one asks her to dance, she will venture onto the floor by herself. With her squarishly handsome features, helmet of brown hair and enormous eyeglasses, she looks a bit like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, which I do not mean as an insult. There is more humor than desperation in Gloria’s outgoing manner, more prideful display than anxious disguise in the way she likes to play dress-up. When she takes up with a comfortably rumpled older man (Sergio Hernández) whom she’s met in a disco—someone who has so many newly discovered feelings that he stammers in getting them out—you want to believe that Gloria has at last met someone who is her equal in benevolence and candor. I don’t think I’m giving anything away when I say that if he were, there wouldn’t be much of a movie.
Lelio in fact has plenty to work with in Gloria, in theme as well as plot. He simply prefers for you to encounter the bigger matters in small, everyday moments, as Gloria herself does, hearing about present-day social discontent through the complaints of friends exchanged over a meal, for example, or feeling a momentary chill from the Pinochet era when her new lover explains fuzzily that he was never in the military, just the navy.

About the only significant director with whom Radulescu has not worked is Corneliu Porumboiu, who could have used his help, as far as I’m concerned, for his most recent picture, When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism.
Radulescu’s latest collaboration was with the director Calin Peter Netzer on the entirely characteristic drama Child’s Pose, which won the top award at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival. Now going into theatrical release in the United States, beginning in New York at Film Forum, Child’s Pose is a continually deepening drama about corruption, class divisions and generational conflict in Romania, as exposed by the aftermath of a traffic fatality.
The ubiquitous Luminita Gheorghiu, indispensable woman of Romanian cinema, plays Cornelia, an affluent and well-connected theater designer and architect whose bitter, throaty speeches and continual self-medication (booze and tobacco) make her instantly disagreeable to the audience. When you see the lavishness of her birthday party, you wonder when Cornelia and her upper-class clique amassed their money and status: before or after Ceausescu? When you watch her order a housemaid to spy on her thirtysomething son Barbu, offering the bribe of a pair of used shoes (200 euros, and worn only once), you can understand why Barbu refused to attend her birthday party, and what he might have meant when he said that her entire generation ought to disappear.
Then Cornelia gets word that Barbu has been arrested in the impoverished outskirts of Bucharest, having run over a boy who was dashing across the highway. Driving out to the police station in the middle of the night, she calls in the help of the proper fixers, faces down one of the dead boy’s enraged relatives, tells the unhappy cops how they’re going to do their job and sets about altering Barbu’s written statement, all in one extraordinary prolonged scene. And now that you’ve finally met Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache), a shambling, overgrown boy who musters his energy only when he attacks his mother, you start to feel slightly less hostile toward Cornelia.
Netzer directs this episode, and the increasingly wrenching events that follow, in a more fluid style than other New Wave directors would use. He even cuts within scenes, which does nothing to dilute the power of Child’s Pose or diminish the stunning effectiveness of the actors (who behave with so little self-regard that Bresson might have forgiven them for being professionals). There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave. But the empathy is there, for Cornelia and for Barbu as well, in a film that gets all the way down to the rotten bones.
 Played by Paulina García with the grace of a woman who makes light of her own wounds and is oblivious to her own courage, Gloria wraps herself most evenings in a layer or two of something tasteful but sparkly, transforms her lips into a masterpiece of hard-edged monochrome painting, and sallies unaccompanied into one or another of the discos for the post-40 set, which apparently are a common resource in Santiago. If no one asks her to dance, she will venture onto the floor by herself. With her squarishly handsome features, helmet of brown hair and enormous eyeglasses, she looks a bit like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, which I do not mean as an insult. There is more humor than desperation in Gloria’s outgoing manner, more prideful display than anxious disguise in the way she likes to play dress-up. When she takes up with a comfortably rumpled older man (Sergio Hernández) whom she’s met in a disco—someone who has so many newly discovered feelings that he stammers in getting them out—you want to believe that Gloria has at last met someone who is her equal in benevolence and candor. I don’t think I’m giving anything away when I say that if he were, there wouldn’t be much of a movie.
Lelio in fact has plenty to work with in Gloria, in theme as well as plot. He simply prefers for you to encounter the bigger matters in small, everyday moments, as Gloria herself does, hearing about present-day social discontent through the complaints of friends exchanged over a meal, for example, or feeling a momentary chill from the Pinochet era when her new lover explains fuzzily that he was never in the military, just the navy. You are in the world of the short story rather than the novel: a place where the telling details are as close to hand as a jar of cold cream or the world’s ugliest stray cat, and the wisdom that encourages Gloria to keep living comes to her lips readily, in the words of the pop songs she loves to sing along with.
A feel-good movie that you don’t have to feel bad for liking, Gloria suggests that those songs might address the biggest matter of all: what you should do when you’ve lost your youth, your illusions, your proximity to your children, some of your late hopes and even a cat you hadn’t wanted in the first place. The answer—you should dance—wouldn’t sound very persuasive stated baldly; but articulated in the flesh and blood of the radiantly middle-aged Paulina García, it becomes a truth beyond argument.

What if you could get a sick society to submit to an X-ray? What would the picture look like? For starters, its field of vision would probably be limited, showing what was going on only within one small group, much as a standard X-ray investigates one part of a body. Although the disease would obviously not be confined to the group being investigated—the members of a family, say, or a set of people drawn together by work—you would assume the trouble could be seen in that cluster, perhaps in an acute form. Also, because there would be a lot of space separating the individuals in the group, who naturally would keep moving around, the picture might take a long time to expose—perhaps as much as two hours. Maybe you would watch the image slowly coalesce over that time, from the surface down, as the beam steadily penetrated through layer upon layer.
This impossible technology is the closest analogy I can imagine to the movies of the Romanian New Wave. Implicitly diagnostic in their purpose, cumulatively devastating in their impact, the films in this small but crucial subset of contemporary Romanian cinema practice something like the clear-sighted, unhurried concentration of Robert Bresson, but without the French master’s faith in a redemptive grace beyond the hard facts. To the Romanian filmmakers, the human drama is not existential but circumstantial—a misère that we make for ourselves, sans Dieu—which nevertheless has taken on the solidity of a permanent condition. Religious belief in these movies is at best a solace for the poor and simple; social change, a hope for the citizens of other countries. Proceeding as if their main duty were to see into the situation patiently, without blinking, the Romanian filmmakers offer the audience only two alternatives to despair: empathy and grim laughter.
When I say “Romanian filmmakers,” I am of course referring to a few interconnected people—that’s how it is with New Waves—of whom one of the most important is the screenwriter Razvan Radulescu. He contributed to the screenplays for Cristi Puiu’s The Death of Mr. Lazarescu and Radu Muntean’s Tuesday, After Christmas and served as a script consultant for Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Andrei Ujica’s The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu. That’s almost a clean sweep. About the only significant director with whom Radulescu has not worked is Corneliu Porumboiu, who could have used his help, as far as I’m concerned, for his most recent picture, When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism.
Radulescu’s latest collaboration was with the director Calin Peter Netzer on the entirely characteristic drama Child’s Pose, which won the top award at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival. Now going into theatrical release in the United States, beginning in New York at Film Forum, Child’s Pose is a continually deepening drama about corruption, class divisions and generational conflict in Romania, as exposed by the aftermath of a traffic fatality.
The ubiquitous Luminita Gheorghiu, indispensable woman of Romanian cinema, plays Cornelia, an affluent and well-connected theater designer and architect whose bitter, throaty speeches and continual self-medication (booze and tobacco) make her instantly disagreeable to the audience. When you see the lavishness of her birthday party, you wonder when Cornelia and her upper-class clique amassed their money and status: before or after Ceausescu? When you watch her order a housemaid to spy on her thirtysomething son Barbu, offering the bribe of a pair of used shoes (200 euros, and worn only once), you can understand why Barbu refused to attend her birthday party, and what he might have meant when he said that her entire generation ought to disappear.
Then Cornelia gets word that Barbu has been arrested in the impoverished outskirts of Bucharest, having run over a boy who was dashing across the highway. Driving out to the police station in the middle of the night, she calls in the help of the proper fixers, faces down one of the dead boy’s enraged relatives, tells the unhappy cops how they’re going to do their job and sets about altering Barbu’s written statement, all in one extraordinary prolonged scene.

Netzer directs this episode, and the increasingly wrenching events that follow, in a more fluid style than other New Wave directors would use. He even cuts within scenes, which does nothing to dilute the power of Child’s Pose or diminish the stunning effectiveness of the actors (who behave with so little self-regard that Bresson might have forgiven them for being professionals). There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave.

 This impossible technology is the closest analogy I can imagine to the movies of the Romanian New Wave. Implicitly diagnostic in their purpose, cumulatively devastating in their impact, the films in this small but crucial subset of contemporary Romanian cinema practice something like the clear-sighted, unhurried concentration of Robert Bresson, but without the French master’s faith in a redemptive grace beyond the hard facts. To the Romanian filmmakers, the human drama is not existential but circumstantial—a misère that we make for ourselves, sans Dieu—which nevertheless has taken on the solidity of a permanent condition. Religious belief in these movies is at best a solace for the poor and simple; social change, a hope for the citizens of other countries. Proceeding as if their main duty were to see into the situation patiently, without blinking, the Romanian filmmakers offer the audience only two alternatives to despair: empathy and grim laughter.
When I say “Romanian filmmakers,” I am of course referring to a few interconnected people—that’s how it is with New Waves—of whom one of the most important is the screenwriter Razvan Radulescu. He contributed to the screenplays for Cristi Puiu’s The Death of Mr. Lazarescu and Radu Muntean’s Tuesday, After Christmas and served as a script consultant for Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Andrei Ujica’s The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu. That’s almost a clean sweep. About the only significant director with whom Radulescu has not worked is Corneliu Porumboiu, who could have used his help, as far as I’m concerned, for his most recent picture, When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism.
Radulescu’s latest collaboration was with the director Calin Peter Netzer on the entirely characteristic drama Child’s Pose, which won the top award at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival. Now going into theatrical release in the United States, beginning in New York at Film Forum, Child’s Pose is a continually deepening drama about corruption, class divisions and generational conflict in Romania, as exposed by the aftermath of a traffic fatality.
The ubiquitous Luminita Gheorghiu, indispensable woman of Romanian cinema, plays Cornelia, an affluent and well-connected theater designer and architect whose bitter, throaty speeches and continual self-medication (booze and tobacco) make her instantly disagreeable to the audience. When you see the lavishness of her birthday party, you wonder when Cornelia and her upper-class clique amassed their money and status: before or after Ceausescu? When you watch her order a housemaid to spy on her thirtysomething son Barbu, offering the bribe of a pair of used shoes (200 euros, and worn only once), you can understand why Barbu refused to attend her birthday party, and what he might have meant when he said that her entire generation ought to disappear.
Then Cornelia gets word that Barbu has been arrested in the impoverished outskirts of Bucharest, having run over a boy who was dashing across the highway. Driving out to the police station in the middle of the night, she calls in the help of the proper fixers, faces down one of the dead boy’s enraged relatives, tells the unhappy cops how they’re going to do their job and sets about altering Barbu’s written statement, all in one extraordinary prolonged scene. And now that you’ve finally met Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache), a shambling, overgrown boy who musters his energy only when he attacks his mother, you start to feel slightly less hostile toward Cornelia.
Netzer directs this episode, and the increasingly wrenching events that follow, in a more fluid style than other New Wave directors would use. He even cuts within scenes, which does nothing to dilute the power of Child’s Pose or diminish the stunning effectiveness of the actors (who behave with so little self-regard that Bresson might have forgiven them for being professionals). There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave. But the empathy is there, for Cornelia and for Barbu as well, in a film that gets all the way down to the rotten bones.

"Feb 13, 2014",POSITIVE," Not quite a comedy and not quite a drama Gloria looks at middle age from a refreshingly even-handed perspective, not a wacky or tragic one. And it features an award-winning performance by Chile’s Paulina García. Not quite a comedy and not quite a drama Gloria looks at middle age from a refreshingly even-handed perspective, not a wacky or tragic one. And it features an award-winning performance by Chile’s Paulina García. Not quite a comedy and not quite a drama, this Chilean film looks at middle age from a refreshingly even-handed perspective, not a wacky or tragic one. Hollywood has trouble with the middle, preferring extremes. So the eventual American version of this story of a frisky fifty-something divorcee will inevitably feature someone like Sandra Bullock (comedy) or Meryl Streep (drama), with all the attendant narrative clichés such casting implies. But we don’t live in an ideal state, and neither does García’s Gloria, a Santiago office worker who is first glimpsed on a nightclub’s dance floor as she negotiates the weekend mating ritual she knows all too well. Gloria is attractive and sensual, but not in that phony way of a gorgeous actress pretending to be matronly. She wears oversized glasses that she might have owned since the 1980s, back when she was still married and raising young children. Now she’s a decade divorced, and her offspring Pedro (Diego Fontecilla) and Ana (Fabiola Zamora) are grown and leading busy and complicated lives. She rarely sees them, for no particular reason, but keeps in touch by phone. Gloria is lonely, but not desperately so. She’s interested in sex, but she’s not looking for pity. She’s worried about losing control, but she’s also aware that she needs to move outside of her comfort zone. Random chaos keeps intruding, like the pesky neighbour’s cat that won’t leave her alone, or the family birthday party that includes an awkward encounter with her ex. Then she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a former naval officer who is recently divorced, a little older than her and very serious about matters of love — maybe too serious. Yet the attraction between Gloria and Rodolfo is mutual and immediate, soon leading to the bedroom and to thoughts of settling down together. Rodolfo has two needy daughters, aged 27 and 31, whom he dotes on past the point of mere coddling. They’re constantly ringing his cellphone, interrupting his dates with Gloria. It’s an annoyance, but of greater concern is Rodolfo’s apparent inability to make a clean break with is ex-wife. Director Sebastián Lelio is looking for realistic human behaviour, not conventional movie moments, and co-writer Gonzalo Maza is of like mind. A scene where Gloria tries out bungee jumping, for example, is brief and not turned into a zany happening. It’s an approach García takes and runs with. Her Gloria almost never leaves the screen but she deserves every minute of our attention. She doesn’t require a laugh track or a downbeat musical cue to make us laugh or tug at our hearts. When we finally hear the disco hit “Gloria,” what should be an eye-rolling soundtrack cue becomes a shared triumph. The movie, and García’s stellar performance, earn our love.

"Feb 13, 2014",POSITIVE,"A casual atmosphere that sneaks up on the viewer, and the reward for such patience is the opportunity to spy a seasoned character realized onscreen with refreshing honesty."
"Feb 10, 2014",POSITIVE," It's been said that American films are about what
happens, while foreign films are about who it happens to. It's a gross oversimplification, of course,
but one brought to mind by the Chilean movie ""Gloria."" The title character
is of a sort rarely glimpsed in Hollywood movies: Gloria (Paulina García) is a
divorced office worker in, probably, her fifties.  She lives alone, except for the neighbor's
hairless cat, which wanders into her apartment every so often. Her grown kids make only rare appearances in
her life. But director and
co-writer Sebastián Lelio isn't serving up a portrait of middle-aged misery
here: Gloria can take care of herself, thank you very much. She hits the clubs with regularity, dancing,
drinking, and staving off loneliness with occasional one-night stands. When she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a
retired naval officer who now manages an amusement park, the possibility of a
deeper relationship emerges. It's clear, though,
that Gloria doesn't need some Mr. Right (or Mr. Goodbar) to make her life
complete, and that self-sufficiency shines through in García's glowing,
confident performance, which includes sex scenes of a matter-of-fact
explicitness. Lelio's direction is just
as confident, shadowing Gloria as she moves through her life, singing along to
disco hits from the 1980s in her car, taking a mildly disastrous weekend trip,
or observing a street puppet performance featuring a symbolic skeleton. Basically, ""Gloria""
is an opportunity for García, an accomplished theater director and television
actress, to shine, and she takes full advantage. There might be times where you wish for a
little more narrative momentum, but basking in the glow of this grounded but
vibrant woman never really gets old. The lowdown: A
free-spirited divorced office worker in her fifties hits the nightclubs of
Santiago, eventually meeting a retired naval officer who presents an
opportunity for a deeper sort of relationship.
Paulina García's magnificent performance carries this meandering but
effective character study of a woman who doesn't conform to expectations. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"Feb 7, 2014",POSITIVE,Paulina Garca gives a powerhouse performance in a completely naturalistic setting.
"Feb 7, 2014",NEUTRAL," So rarely are middle-aged women the subjects of movies that it seems ungrateful not to genuflect when one of these exceptions comes along. Although this Chilean filmâs narrative ambitions are modest, Gloria is a likable movie thatâs anchored by an outstanding performance by Paulina GarcÃ­a â whose work here was recognized with the Best Actress award at last yearâs Berlin Film Festival. Appearing in nearly every frame of the film, GarcÃ­a imbues the eponymous character with an unquenchable thirst for life â which seems alternately audacious and foolhardy. We are never privy to Gloriaâs deepest inner thoughts, so she remains something of mystery. We can admire her resilience and unwillingness to get bent out of shape over a romantic affair gone bad. Itâs also refreshing to see two middle-aged bodies engage in sex. But like the disco sounds that accompany the end of Gloria, this film seems a bit superficial.

"Feb 6, 2014",POSITIVE,"By the end, we dance with her, living in the moment as she does, not looking ahead to life's next turn."
"Feb 6, 2014",POSITIVE,"This is a driven, indelible character -- like the women Gena Rowlands played for John Cassavetes -- and you fear her going over the edge not least because you suspect you'd follow her."
"Feb 6, 2014",POSITIVE,"Most films past the mid-life point either don't acknowledge romance and sexuality, or make it the central point of the story; the frank, comfortable, yet warmly erotic way Gloria deals with it is a breath of fresh air."
"Feb 6, 2014",POSITIVE," Just under a year ago, the Chilean feature Gloria became what you’d have to call the feel-good hit of an otherwise glum Berlinale competition. Any film that ends with its heroine on the dance floor, getting down to what’s effectively her own disco theme song, is bound to come across as feel-good one way or another—although as upbeat endings go, Gloria’s is deliciously slow-burn and more than tinged with ambivalence. Writer-director Sebastián Lelio, whose fourth feature this is, has a confident way of parceling out exuberance and melancholy in a setting of mundane everyday realism. But this is also one of those films that you can’t imagine without its magnetic and superbly nuanced central performance, and it’s no disrespect to Lelio to say that Gloria is as much Paulina García’s film as it is his (at Berlin, she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress). García plays Gloria, a woman in her late 50s, divorced for some 10 years. She still lives alone but regularly attends singles events, putting on her glittery glad rags and keeping an eye out for attractive older men, who seem fairly receptive. She thinks she’s landed a winner when she exchanges glances—and then yet more glances—with the dapper Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), with whom she quickly winds up in bed. Gloria seems confident about Rodolfo as a prospect—a confidence the viewer might not share, since he seems a little hesitant, a little stiff, and a little too easily embarrassed. Besides, there’s that torso-flattering corset he wears, though it doesn’t seem to bother Gloria, who twice in the film yanks it off with gusto: if romance can withstand the sound of ripping Velcro, it must have something going for it. The relationship starts as fun—Rodolfo is a former Navy man, now the owner of an adventure park where adults can swing on bungee-style ropes (which Gloria has a ball with) and take part in paintball games. But both lovers carry considerable baggage. Gloria has two adult children with their own domestic complications (her yoga-instructor daughter is about to leave for Sweden to join the father of the child she’s expecting). And Rodolfo has two adult daughters and an ex-wife, as of one year, that he hasn’t yet really left behind, and they are forever troubling him with distress calls (the insistent ringing of his cell phone is one of the film’s leitmotifs). Still, the couple’s sex, evoked in brief, tightly shot scenes, seems pretty hot. Gloria is one of those very rare films that not only show two people, both some way over 50, getting naked together, but also don’t suggest that it’s a big deal in any way. But the closer the couple get, the more we sense that there’s going to be friction. The sticky moment comes when Gloria’s son hosts a family get-together, at which her ex-husband is present and old times are talked about fondly. There’s someone left out, and the fact that we can barely see that person in the scene—Rodolfo’s awkwardly frowning features hover in the background—brings home the painful exclusion this shy, earnest man feels, which is why he quietly gets up and sneaks out, barely noticed. Having said it’s Garcia’s film, I should also add that it’s substantially Hernández’s too. This patrician-looking but soft-faced actor previously worked with Lelio in his The Year of the Tiger (11), and you may recognize him as the lead in Raúl Ruiz’s swan song Night Across the Street and as a military officer in Pablo Larraín’s No. Rodolfo’s nervous delicacy, and the weary self-pity that always seems about to surface, tell you that he’s nowhere near as well-adjusted to the single life (or to life, period) as Gloria. You can possibly imagine them as a couple who have been together for years, but it’s harder to imagine them making it work now—and that’s partly the drama’s appeal, the discrepancy between the relationship we see, and the hopes (and self-deceptions) that Gloria seems to invest in her lover. Editing the film together with Soledad Salfate, Lelio builds the narrative on discreet temporal jumps and occasional gaps, around which he and co-writer Gonzalo Maza build insights into the daily stresses of Gloria’s life: the impersonal office where she works, a problem neighbor noisily cracking up, casual visitations from said neighbor’s sphinx-like hairless cat. That animal prompts Gloria’s cleaner to tell a magnificent non sequitur of a story about Noah’s Ark, a digression which seems to have wandered into the film as mysteriously and casually as the cat enters her apartment. As a heroine, Gloria is magnetic because she’s so unremarkable—a middle-aged woman who holds down a job, cements her family together, keeps her own psyche on an even keel, and goes about seeking love and sex with a mixture of confidence and nervousness that everyone can surely identify with. A telling detail, suggesting that she hasn’t quite shaken off the past, is a pair of huge windshield-like glasses that make her look a little more matronly than she needs to, from more or less the same era as the film’s disco numbers. García has a neat way of signaling Gloria’s old-school femininity—the little flicks of her hair as she steps onto a dance floor, her half-coy, half-saucy inspection of Rodolfo. And García takes the role’s physicality in her stride—including the nudity, sexual and non-sexual, not to mention the half-nudity, waist down, in the scene where Gloria gives Rodolfo a no-nonsense shove into an armchair and takes what she’s after. One of the producers here is Larraín, whose own films—notably Tony Manero, Post Mortem, and No—have picked over the horrors of the Pinochet years. While it’s not a political film in the same way, Gloria clearly emerges from contemporary Chilean reality. We glimpse TV coverage of street protests, one of which is seen in the background while Gloria sits alone in a café, and it’s presumably part of Chile’s wave of student protests against a stagnant education system, a youth movement identified with its charismatic figurehead Camila Vallejo. Gloria herself is identified with a faintly bohemian middle-class liberal background: at one get-together, her friends do an impromptu performance of Antonio Carlos Jobim’s “Waters of March,” while at that awkward family dinner, someone alludes to social disillusion and a “spiritual revolution” taking place in Chile. Rodolfo’s main awkward contribution to that conversation is the complaint “There are no leaders now”; it’s never made explicit, but this comment, together with his Navy background and his identification with guns (even if only the paintball variety) suggest that he was one of the many right-wing Chileans who, as Larraín’s docudrama No pointed out, were perfectly content to see Pinochet in power. Incidentally, there’s no obvious connection with the Cassavetes film of the same name—though you wouldn’t want to get on this Gloria’s bad side any more than that of the Gena Rowlands character. Nor is the closing theme song, alluded to above, either the Them number or the Patti Smith variant; it’s the original Italian “Gloria” from 1979 by Umberto Tozzi. You may be more familiar with the Laura Branigan cover."
"Feb 6, 2014",POSITIVE,The best compliment the Chilean drama deserves is that it captures how it feels to be its title character.
"Feb 5, 2014",POSITIVE,"Audiences intuitively search for someone to root for in a film, and Garca's Gloria, who's in practically every frame of the movie, fits that bill perfectly."
"Feb 4, 2014",POSITIVE,"Lelio's non-restrictively comedic scenario, scripted by him and Gonzalo Maza, makes a great space for Garca's wholesale refusal of self-pity."
"Feb 2, 2014",POSITIVE,"She has the ego and the thick, bobbed hair and big glasses reminiscent of Tootsie. But the vivacious middle-aged woman at the heart of Chile's Oscar submission, 'Gloria,' leaves no doubt she's all female."
"Jan 31, 2014",NEUTRAL," “Gloria” explores better than any movie I’ve seen how, when middle-aged divorcees become a couple, they are still affected by their relationship with their ex-spouses and children. For her homework preparing to star in the Chilean film, Gloria, Paulina García (winner of Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival) was asked by filmmaker Sebastián Lelio to read Cassavetes on Cassavetes. The character she plays in this winning drama is certainly in line with many Gena Rowlands portraits in the cinema of director John Cassavetes: raw, unsentimental, and changing scene to scene, human identity akin to improvisatory jazz. In his New York Times review, A.O. Scott said it well of Gloria: “Her life is a familiar jumble of pleasures and frustrations, her personality a weave of moods, foibles, and admirable traits.” Protean as Cindy Sherman, García’s Gloria reads different scene to scene, from, on a good day, perky and sexy to, at a down moment, drawn, tired, slouching toward old age. From Jill Clayburgh in An Unmarried Woman to Rowlands in Woman Under the Influence to Giulietta Massina in Nights of Cabiria to (an intentional homage from Lelio) bespectacled Dustin Hoffman in drag in Tootsie.  By day, Gloria, in her mid-50s and divorced, works in a Santiago office, seemingly to pay the bills. She never talks about her employment, good or bad. When she’s on the phone, she’s wanting to converse with her adult son and daughter. Both seem fond of their mother, but her son has his own child to worry about. Her daughter is consumed by her new exotic lover, a tall Swede skiing his way around the world. So Gloria is a bit lonely. But she doesn’t fret. Her love is music. She sings along with sentimental pop tunes on her car, knowing all the kitschy words. In the evenings, she wanders into a local singles club, meant for 50s and older. The sensual bassa nova is in the air, and Gloria dances confidently by herself, arms swinging high, in the middle of the room. Occasionally, a man will come over. If she likes his style, the way he holds her, she’ll go home with him. And be OK the next day.  Filmmaker Lelio is 39, but he’s smart and dead right about middle age. Gloria has as much right to a hearty sex life as someone far younger. She can have just as much fun in bed. Like a college coed, she’s allowed to have casual affairs, if that’s her want. And like her daughter, she can fall foolishly for someone who just doesn’t seem right. That’s Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), the recently divorced owner of a theme park (an odd profession), who dances gamely, makes love skillfully, and, a bit after their one-nighter, actually calls Gloria for a date. And soon he is reading to her mushy poetry (much like the lyrics of her favorite mainstream songs), and, surely too soon, declaring his deep love. When young people get seriously involved, they bring into their relationship not only themselves but their relationship with their parents. Gloria explores better than any movie I’ve seen how, when middle-aged divorcees become a couple, they are still affected by their relationship with their ex-spouses and children. At his most intimate moments with Gloria, Rodolfo will be summoned by his always-on cell phone to deal with his guilt-tripping daughters. He’s a slave to their whims.  And Gloria brings Rodolfo to a party where the guests are her son and daughter and her former husband and his new wife.  Gloria is cozy with her family and ex-family and virtually forgets that suffering, ignored Rodolfo is in the room. Finally, he runs off from the party without telling Gloria. He does this several times, abandoning her. Gloria and Rodolfo probably shouldn’t be together. After the sex, they are so different. Filmmaker Lelio watches their relationship dispassionately, as they stumble about, break up, come together again for another absurd try. Without me saying how she gets there, Gloria circles back to where she began, dancing, dancing. And the song being played is Gloria. Not the splendid Van Morrison version, immortalized by Patti Smith. The other platinum-certified one, also great pop poetry, done by Laura Branigan in 1982: “Gloria, you’re always on the run now…I think you’ve got to slow down/ before you start to blow it/ I think you’re headed for a breakdown.” Check out Laura performing it, in tight leather, under a disco ball.

"Jan 31, 2014",POSITIVE,"Director Sebastian Lelio paints&#65279; a subtle picture of a self-assured, independent woman who is sometimes sad but is more often happy, ready to take on life's adventures."
"Jan 31, 2014",POSITIVE," Gloria is smart, funny, and stylish. She’s got lots of interesting friends and an active social life on the Santiago singles scene. She’s fifty-eight years old, and romance and sex are what is on her mind. Can you handle that truth? Chilean TV actress Paulina García is a revelation in this festival favorite (and Chile’s official submission for the Foreign Language Oscar) as a woman who lives life on her own terms and doesn’t let herself get pushed around… especially not by her new beau, Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), who can’t seem to decide whether he’s actually divorced or not. It shouldn’t be that a woman like Gloria and a bittersweet dramedy about her life are so exceptional onscreen, but while we don’t even think twice about a 50something dude as a romantic lead, we barely get the chance to consider their female peers in the same cinematic realm. So by mere dint of his chosen subject, writer (with Gonzalo Maza) and director Sebastián Lelio has given us something fresh and unexpected. (For pure movie-movie fun, it also features another of the great film cats of the moment.) And yet there’s no hint whatsoever of gender politics in this delightful film: this is simply a glorious — heh — character portrait of a vibrant person whom it’s a joy to spend time with. Definitely looking forward to this. I sometimes feel that the really effective message films are the ones that don’t scream out their message, they’re the ones that just say “yeah, I’m a person too, I also have a story to tell”."
"Jan 31, 2014",POSITIVE,"The movie lets you make up your own mind about this vivacious woman, who is doing her best not to surrender to her inner loneliness."
"Jan 31, 2014",POSITIVE,"Gloria, spare and keenly observed, plays like a short story - there is no sweeping narrative arc, no momentous triumph or calamity."
"Jan 30, 2014",NEGATIVE," This sensuous, comedy-tinged drama about a Chilean divorcee in her 50s trying to find her own happiness after raising two accomplished children, brings audiences on a quietly urgent ride straight into the consciousness of a questing woman. Americans of the heroine’s age should relate to it immediately – it’s reminiscent of movies and fiction like Paul Mazursky’s hit “An Unmarried Woman” and Grace Paley’s short-story collections, “The Little Disturbances of Man” or “Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.” (All three would be apt names for this picture.) Actually, the collaboration between the director, Sebastian Lelio, and his star, Paulina Garcia, is intimate and lyrical enough to seduce adults of all ages. As Lelio sketches the zigzag contours of the heroine’s existence, Garcia holds the screen like a south-of-the-border Diane Keaton, complete with Keaton’s power to embody contradictory impulses while carving out a strong, suggestive personality. Gloria holds down a white-collar job, goes to bars and dance clubs, babysits for the child of her violinist son, and gives her daughter’s yoga class a spin. She visits with educated friends who lament their ambivalence toward their country. They’re past the age when they think they can change Chilean life; the best they can do is put faith in their children. Gloria, who yearns for amour as she sings alone in her car, risks everyday stability for a chance to change her own life. (Later on, she plots her own coup with a paintball gun, and it proves to be a masterstroke of romantic revenge.) Without bitterness, she recognizes that others take her for granted. She needs someone who thinks she’s everything. She appears to find that person in a retired naval officer named Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), who now runs an amusement park that features bungee jumping. Is she in love with love or with this surprisingly needy, slippery, girdled fellow who can’t resist the demands of his ex-wife and grown daughters? It’s telling that Rodolfo’s place is called “Vertigo Park.” Lelio, who co-wrote the script with Gonzalo Maza, has a wonderful sense of how lives can be like cities: Tolerate a smashed window and you’re opening yourself up to decay. Gloria can’t believe she’s paying top dollar for an apartment with an upstairs neighbor who keeps her awake at night and lets his cat invade her space. (She maintains her equilibrium by, among other things, protesting to the building supervisor.) The Santiago of this movie includes student street marches, spot-free malls and storybook settings for a wedding. Its atmosphere seeps in and out of Gloria’s daily life as she aims for happiness despite repeated setbacks. (She lets herself go – disastrously – only when she visits the resort of Vina del Mar.) You wonder why Gloria doesn’t open up to her friends about her romantic turmoil. Occasionally, a symbol – a dancing skeleton puppet, a white peacock – obtrudes on the rich, naturalistic textures. But the movie’s virtues far outweigh its flaws. Lelio’s use of bossa nova, romantic pop and Laura Brannigan’s 1982 smash “Gloria” imbue the soundtrack with a sonic ripple that merges with the film’s muted glow. By the end, in more ways than one, Gloria dances to her own song. Hitchcock once said that other directors made slices of life; he made pieces of cake. Lelio’s feat is that he’s made a slice of life that’s a piece of cake, too."
"Jan 30, 2014",POSITIVE," Whether you're 16 or 65, new relationships stir up the same sparks of excitement and the same lapses in judgment. That's the gist of ""Gloria,"" a delightful Chilean drama about middle-age love between characters who have maturity on their side but still prove we're all amateurs when it comes to relationships. Paulina Garcia practically pops off the screen as Gloria, a woman whose bubbly buoyancy can’t quite mask her loneliness. Her two adult children don’t always call her back, but she stays busy with work and yoga. Most nights, she heads to the local disco, where she usually ends up swaying solo on the dance floor, her sex appeal nearly obscured by oversize plastic glasses. It’s there she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a recent divorcé who picks her up with the brightly disarming line “Are you always this happy?” Despite a fumbling first conversation, the buttoned-up businessman and Gloria quickly settle into a serious relationship that includes dinner parties with friends and paintball target practice, passionate sex and poetry readings for two. At first, things are easy. But while Gloria fully embraces new experiences and people, Rodolfo is cagey. He won’t even tell his two daughters he has a girlfriend. And before you know it, spiderweb cracks emerge in a foundation that seemed effortlessly solid. With the exception of Nancy Meyers's movies (""It's Complicated,"" ""Something's Gotta Give""), love stories about 50- and 60-year-olds are a rarity onscreen, and nudity with middle-age actors is practically unheard of. We're so used to seeing young, lithe bodies stripping down in movies that a glimpse of naked humans who look like actual people can be a little jarring. But there's a point to writer-director Sebastián Lelio's naturalism: Gloria and Rodolfo experience the same awkwardness and electric charge as any new couple, regardless of how many times they've been around the block. The film’s great revelation is Garcia, who’s best known in her native Chile for theater acting and directing. She’s a master at conveying nuances of emotion. When Rodolfo takes a call on his cellphone in the middle of their first date, her firmly plastered smile imparts both an extreme effort to seem happy and a simmering annoyance. Gloria is a complex person, and the movie takes its time revealing her. Even a tiny scene of routine, where Gloria slathers on a thick veneer of night cream before bed, rounds out her character: She’s a woman who cares about her looks even while she hides behind huge glasses. There are a few missteps, including a discordant moment of jealousy. But for the most part, “Gloria” is a day brightener of a character study about finding someone new and making the same old mistakes. R.

"Jan 30, 2014",POSITIVE,"""Gloria,"" a charmer from Chile, is a character portrait of a woman the movies rarely notice: Divorced, hovering around 60, not especially interested in self-pity."
"Jan 30, 2014",POSITIVE,"The message, if one needs to look for one, is that the course of romance is no smoother at 50 than it is at 15, when heedlessness is an advantage to plunging into love."
"Jan 30, 2014",POSITIVE," In Hollywood-style storytelling, we expect the protagonist to evolve through adversity. A weakling becomes a hero, a Grinch grows a heart. But in indie and overseas cinema, such sentiments are foreign. So when we meet a middle-age Chilean barfly named Gloria (Paulina Garcia), we shouldn’t assume that the ugly duckling will emerge as a beautiful swan. “Gloria” is a character study, one that’s pitiful in the compassionate sense of the word. Gloria is a 40-something divorcee with two grown children who are starting families of their own. Behind unflattering eyeglasses, she is still reasonably attractive and fit, so after a few drinks at the Santiago nightclub she haunts, she often ends up dancing with lonely men. One of those gentlemen is Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a retired naval officer who operates a paintball emporium. In lieu of a long courtship, he and Gloria tumble into bed almost immediately, But the frankness of the senior sexuality is not the most disturbing thing about this film. Gloria’s alcohol-fueled desperation and Rodolfo’s evasiveness about his children and ex-wife are a combustible combination, and after a pair of mini break-ups, we’re not sure who’s to blame. Director Sebastian Lelio may be providing us a clue by placing Miss Lonelyhearts in the midst of social unrest that she barely notices. In the streets and on the television in the apartment where she numbs herself with marijuana, student protests are roiling. The notion that Gloria is an emblem of a rusting and heartless system is tantalizing, but it’s not explored, nor is it necessary for appreciating the film. Garcia’s performance, which won the best actress award at last year’s Berlin International Film Festival, is a marvel of self-effacing artistry. This is a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and in the film’s most painfully frank scene, she literally sinks into the sand. When Gloria picks herself up, the duet between hope and irony echoes long after the credits roll. The family of the late actor are getting behind a film project that looks to capture the essence of the Wisconsin native. Here's what we know. "

"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. “Gloria,” the Chilean Oscar entry for best foreign film, is about a woman in her late 50s who lives on her own and wants more out of life than loneliness. Divorced for more than 12 years, Gloria Cumplido (Paulina García) has two grown children and a grandson she dotes on. But she’s not ready to be put out to pasture just yet. Her favorite activity is hitting the Santiago singles scene and dancing the night away. That’s how she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Herndández), who is somewhat older, distinguished looking, and also divorced with adult children. The difference is that Rodolfo’s ex-wife and children are continually pulling him into complications. He may seem staunch, but, as Gloria discovers during their ensuing courtship, he’s a weakling in matters of the heart. The film’s central attraction is García’s performance, which could easily have lapsed into coy theatricality. (Her acting won the Silver Bear at the Berlin festival.) The fact that so many of her effects are understated must be due, in part, to the tactful ministrations of the co-writer-director Sebastián Lelio. He frames Gloria as a flesh-and-blood woman and not a caricature. We are watching a star performance, not a star turn. It’s easy to see how Hollywood would have mucked up this same material. Let’s hope no one is trying to remake “Gloria” in La-La Land. Not much chance of that happening anyway, since for decades Hollywood has been averse to featuring women over 50 in starring roles. The nice thing about “Gloria” is that, despite its rather contrived scenario, it is unabashedly about an older woman who is comfortable with her sexuality. She still wants to be in the game, even if she can’t quite comprehend what the rules are anymore. She has a fuller life than appearances would suggest, perhaps because she is always ready to be swept away by something. She takes yoga classes and laughter-therapy sessions. These come in handy when she has to deal with her yowling, jilted upstairs neighbor, whose amorous miseries keep her awake at all hours. She even inherits (sort of) the guy’s Sphynx cat, a feline refugee from love’s battleground. Lelio allows us to discover right along with Gloria just what a lunkhead Rodolfo is. The fact that he runs an extreme-sports park – a place where cowardly types pretend to be daredevils – should have been her first big tip-off that something was amiss with this guy. In his own life, he is anything but extreme – except in his kowtowing to his ex. Gloria gives him ample, perhaps too ample, opportunity to reform himself. She does this not only because her own welfare is at stake but also because, despite everything, she genuinely cares about him. She has an emotional generosity, an essential amplitude of spirit. We know that, whatever happens with Rodolfo, she will be all right. “Gloria” is a starting-over story that never quite picks up a head of steam. Lelio paces the action as a series of sketches, and the hit-or-miss quality of the material makes for a bumpy ride. Rodolfo’s woes (which, for a time, become Gloria’s) become increasingly repetitive. Were it not for García’s performance, Gloria might have turned into a bedraggled bore. Fortunately, there’s always something to look at whenever she is on screen, which is most of the time. She becomes something she never intended to be – a heroine. Grade: B (Rated R for sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use, and language.) Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people.

"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE," You don’t have to be middle-aged (although it helps) to recognize that love affairs get more interesting later in life — say, 58, the age of the woman at the center of the happy-horrible seesaw that is Gloria. I don’t mean interesting to viewers whose idea of romance is young people with beautiful bodies boning — it’s likely they’ll avert their eyes when, pre-coitus, an old man unhooks his girdle and his belly falls out. I mean interesting because there are so many more variables. Physical degeneration, obviously. But also children who are grown and whose absence leaves a void — or who refuse to leave the nest and are a different kind of pain. Or ex-spouses who might or might not have found mates and have fluctuating levels of resentment, which results in emotional geometry that borders on the Higher Math. Another variable implicit in Gloria: The status — the desirability quotient — of post-menopausal women, chiefly determined by aging men who behave as if they’re irresistible to firmer-fleshed younger females. Gloria doesn’t lie about a woman’s dwindling options. It’s rife with disappointment and humiliation. But bleakness does not preclude buoyancy. It still manages to leave you with the urge to dance. This Chilean drama (directed by Sebastian Lelio) is a lovely surprise. Paulina Garcia plays Gloria, who’s first seen sitting alone at a bar as others boogie — a middle-class woman who’s obviously available, moderately attractive (she wears big, round red glasses), but overshadowed by younger or more chiseled beauties. She’s ten years divorced and still uncoupled. Her son is emotionally distant, her daughter (a yoga instructor whose class her mother takes) about to embark on a relationship with a peripatetic Swede. Her world is unstable. Santiago is in the throes of a transition from a military dictatorship to democracy, and few in her circle know what’s what. In the apartment above her, an unseen man rants into the night, his grasp of reality increasingly tenuous. His cat has wandered in — a skeletal, hairless beast. But there’s something indefatigable about her. When Gloria drives, she sings along to pop songs full of hope. What makes Garcia’s performance so wonderful is how she portrays indefiniteness. She is open without being fatuous — always game, always slightly wary. Watch her face when her daughter asks, of a new suitor, “Who is this guy, mom?” Damned if she knows. He has descended on her out of the blue — an older, retired navy man named Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez). His ardor is hard to resist. But there are worrying signs. There’s something pleading in his demeanor. His hinges seem a little loose. And he’s besieged by calls from his ex-wife and overly dependent daughters. Lelio’s style is understated, but with Garcia front and center (is there a shot she isn’t in?), the images vibrate. Above I called her “moderately attractive” — the male gaze at its most judgmental. That’s how I saw her at first, but as the film goes along, she becomes more and more radiant — as people do in life when you know them better. You don’t want to look away for fear of missing something in her face — even in an excruciating sequence when she’s drunk and easy prey. Gloria builds to the song of that name. It was written by Umberto Tozzi and a disco hit for Laura Brannigan, but in English its meaning was changed. It wasn’t meant to be about a woman nobody wants. Here, in Spanish, it’s positively throbbing with possibilities. Imagine another song, “Is that all there is my friend? / Then let’s keep dancing,” in the key of ecstasy instead of defeat. In an uncertain world, you can be sure of this."
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE," It has been 12 years since her divorce and Gloria (Paulina Garcia) spends her weekends at the various dating clubs in Santiago. But, she has never found a man to love and be loved by. That is, until she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a shy man who is far more recently divorced than “Gloria.” In Santiago, Chile, a divorcee approaching her sixties continues to embrace the possibilities still to come. She goes to dance clubs for fun, but there is always the chance of a romantic adventure to raise the stakes. When she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández, ""No""), it looks like her life is about to get brighter but even rocky roads ahead cannot dampen the spirit of ""Gloria."" Cowriter (with Gonzalo Maza)/director Sebastián Lelio's film, Chile’s official entry Foreign Language entry for the Academy Awards, was considered a surprising exclusion from the eventual five nominees, but even though the Academy is well known for disregarding some of the more worthy foreign films, I for one was not surprised. ""Gloria"" does boast a very good performance from Berlin Silver Bear winner for Best Actress Paulina García, but the filmmakers, who clearly wish to present her as an irrepressible life force, have also made her behavior too contrary to fully root for her. Flaws are a necessary component of any complex character, but here Gloria is guilty of the same sort of inconsideration that we are supposed to condemn Rodolfo for while being rude about it to boot. Youthful spirit is also confused with juvenile irresponsibility in the way Gloria reacts to Rodolfo's weakness. Alcohol is a factor in both episodes. Before this we must admire this woman who ventures into clubs alone, happy just to dance. She's the type of woman who sings along to the radio in her car with gusto and Garcia demands our attention, her vibrancy powered by the sheer will to overcome loneliness. When Gloria does connect, she's all in, making love with passion, flinging herself off a bridge on a bungee cord, engaging in paintball battles. Lelio's maddening climax puts a damper on things, but he ends his film on an upbeat note, Gloria alone again at a wedding, dancing to a Spanish language version of her namesake hit. García fuels this shapeless, misguided character study with more character than it deserves - she's a real firecracker. The past few years have been kind, film-wise, to the 40+ year old demographic with stories skewing away from youthful audience. “Gloria” is just that kind of films as it follows its title character in her search to find happiness and companionship. Paulina Garcia envelops her character as she does the date bar circuit looking for Mr. Right. She finds him, maybe, in Rodolfo, but he has his own set of baggage – his ex-wife and children who he remains close to. This baggage affects the relationship between Gloria and Rodolfo as, first, tells her he cannot get Gloria out of his head. Then, without explanation during a birthday dinner for her son, he walks out and disappears from Gloria’s life – then comes back to her only to leave her once again. The film shows the fleeting elusiveness of love for our middle-aged heroine. Paulina Garcia gives a smart feistiness to her Gloria as she continues life after divorce. It is a good character study of life after 40. The story, by director Sebastian Lelio and Gonzalo Maza, is not quite up to the star’s study of Gloria. Sergio Hernandez, as Rodolfo, lacks dimension of character and his coming and going in Gloria’s life rings false, especially when considering her megawatt presence. The reason to see “Gloria” is to appreciate the fine performance by Paulina Garcia."
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE," There is that feeling you get inside when a movie suddenly starts to push your every button, creating an emotional connection that goes beyond pure reason and mere emotion. It elevates your mood to such a point that you wish you could hug the screen out of sheer joy and recognition. That is what ""Gloria"" did to me. The Chilean-Spanish production that somehow did not make the cut as a best foreign-language Oscar candidate is a bit of a throwback to the '70s, the liberated era that gave us ""An Unmarried Woman"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and ""The Goodbye Girl"". It was a time when female characters over 30 or even 40 were allowed to not only have great sex, but also were given the chance to re-examine the choices they made at this stage—especially with men—and transform into the person they were always meant to be. ""Gloria"" covers similar territory, but with a difference. Jill Clayburgh's divorcee in ""An Unmarried Woman"" could afford one-on-one therapy, had a gaggle of gal pals to turn to for support and toiled in an upscale Soho art gallery. As for Gloria, brought to, yes, glorious life by actress Paulina Garcia, she's a formerly wed, 50-ish office worker in Santiago who laughs easily, wails along to the sappy love songs on her car radio and craves new adventures whether bungee-jumping, smoking pot or spur-of-the-moment getaways. The trouble is, most people—including her adult son and daughter—are either too busy or don't bother to notice that there is a vibrant human being standing before them who aches for intimate contact and a chance to shower someone with affection. In the opening scene, director and co-writer Sebastian Lelio sets a kind of a trap, allowing the moviegoer an opportunity to perhaps jump to unfair assumptions about Garcia's character. There she is, hanging out alone at a gathering for middle-aged singles looking to connect. With her oversized Tootsie-style glasses, crooked smile and prim '80s bob, she cuts a rather melancholy figure as she sips her drink and sways alone to the erotic rhythms of Donna Summers' ""I Feel Love"". Suddenly, Gloria spies a man she vaguely knows and engages in awkward small talk, eventually flirting and dancing a little too enthusiastically with him. But it is all for naught. She goes home alone, where the only warm body that wants to share her bed is a hairless cat who belongs to her crazy upstairs neighbor.  As it turns out, however, Gloria is not a victim to be pitied but a fighter. She returns to the club, where this time she spies an slightly older, rumpled gent intently gazing at her. He's Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a recently divorced former naval officer, and it turns out he finds her fascinating—just as we begin to feel the same way about her, too. They quickly connect romantically, leading to the first of several honestly depicted, completely unglamorous sexual encounters between two people of a certain age that Hollywood rarely attempts, even in such films as ""It's Complicated"" and ""Hope Springs"". There is flab, there is sag, there is an elastic girdle-like belt Rodolfo wears as a result of weight-loss surgery. But there is also heat.  Alas, there is baggage as well. As Rodolfo's all-too-frequently ringing cell phone reveals, he might be single but his needy daughters and ex-wife still rely on him. Though his interest in our heroine feels sincere, he is not the type of man who will rush off and leave his family in the lurch. That might a fine quality, but not what Gloria needs or desires at the moment. She wants fantasy, passion, excitement. And she deserves it. Frustration soon leads to recklessness on Gloria's part, but Lelio—who trusts the viewer to fill in many of the blanks for themselves—does not judge his characters but allows us to draw our own conclusions. It helps he has someone as wonderfully expressive and real as Garcia, who can go from appearing old and haggard to luminous and adorable seamlessly, at the center of this tale.  There is not a false note in her performance, especially in the final scene at a wedding when the song that I kept hearing in my head while watching the film finally filled the soundtrack—""Gloria"", not the Laura Branigan version from ""Flashdance"" but the original sung in Italian by Umberto Tozzi. It is up to us to decide whether the sight of Garcia once again alone—by choice this time—is a moment of triumph or resignation. Me, I was cheering inside.

Now unchained from the grind of daily journalism, she is ready to view the world of movies with fresh eyes."

"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE," It’s a rare phenomenon for a director to remake their own movie, but this year, there are already two instances of filmmakers retrofitting their foreign-language darlings for American audiences. Hans Petter Moland turned his Scandinavian thriller “In Order of Disappearance” into the Liam Neeson revenge flick “Cold Pursuit.” And now, Chilean director Sebastián Lelio remakes his amusing 2013 portrait of feminine middle-age, “Gloria,” into a vehicle for Julianne Moore, “Gloria Bell.” The title isn’t the only thing familiar about the film, which is essentially a shot-for-shot remake of the original, a carbon copy down to the line readings, tone and story beats. Both “Gloria” and “Gloria Bell” are slice-of-life depictions that seem simple on the surface but are remarkable for their singular focus on the experiences of a woman in her late 50s, a character type all too often forgotten or cast aside. But there’s something else about the character of Gloria that makes her different. She lives her life unabashedly, with her heart open, her dancing shoes on. It’s a frankly radical notion, not just for women, but for anyone. Gloria is a divorced mother of two grown children (Michael Cera and Caren Pistorius). She’s also a grandmother and an insurance adjuster. But what makes her so interesting and appealing is that her zest for life won’t be dampened by circumstance. She’s unafraid to hit disco bars alone, attends therapeutic cuddle-puddle giggling sessions and shouts the praises of a friend from the top of a parking structure. She leads with her heart, which makes her seem so alive, so in the moment. But when she encounters an interesting new man on the dance floor, Arnold (John Turturro), a layer of her charming bravado is peeled back — perhaps she would like to love again. In remakes of this nature, one has to search for the moments of dissonance, the elements that make it uniquely Chilean, or uniquely American (or Angeleno, to be exact). The small talk here centers on climate change, 401(k)s and having “work done,” both signifying the place and time, as well as the existential issues with which the film grapples so subtly. Moore is softer and more vulnerable than the brassy and bold Paulina García, who won best actress at the Berlin Film Festival for her performance in this role. But Moore is more relatable, a bit goofy, sometimes unsteady. Her sweet chemistry with Turturro as the fumbling Arnold is genuinely affectionate and sexy in a film that acknowledges the realism of sex and romance beyond your 20s. One does wonder about the purpose of the remake, when it hews so closely to the original, telling the same story. It almost seems that Moore discovered the film and character and decided she had to play Gloria, the way stage actors take on classic roles. Moore’s take brings a new dimension not only to the story but also to her career. Lelio’s approach to writing and directing is to pluck out moments from Gloria’s life with which to weave a tapestry of who she is at this moment, which unfolds before the audience in distinct patterns — Gloria’s signature oversize glasses, her habit of singing along to the radio in the car, her loving but strained relationship with her kids. Highlights and lowlights make up the rest of the image, moments of freedom and abandon anchored by dark nights of the soul. But always, Gloria is behind the wheel of her own destiny, and that is truly refreshing and inspiring."
"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE," “Are you always this happy?” Rodolfo asks Gloria, shortly after catching her eye. They are at a nightclub where middle-aged residents of Santiago, Chile, dance and flirt, and where Gloria, in her 50s and long divorced, occasionally goes to attract the attention of a silver-haired Romeo. Rodolfo, who has a kind, crumpled face and a winningly uncertain manner, makes Gloria laugh with this pickup line. No, she says, sometimes in the mornings she is sad, and in the afternoons, too. The great accomplishment of “Gloria,” the Chilean writer-director Sebastián Lelio’s astute, unpretentious and thrillingly humane new film, is that it acknowledges both sides of its heroine’s temperament without judgment or sentimentality. In a North American movie — a fizzy Hollywood comedy of empowerment or a glum indie kitchen-sink melodrama — a woman like Gloria would most likely invite either pity or condescending encouragement. But Gloria, played with dignity and gusto by Paulina García, is too complicated for such treatment. Her life is a familiar jumble of pleasures and frustrations, her personality a weave of moods, foibles and admirable traits. She sometimes drinks too much, smokes more than she should and hovers needily around her two grown children. She endures a dull office job and the late-night ranting of a mentally unstable neighbor, whose hairless cat finds its way into Gloria’s apartment. The more we learn about Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), the more we might question her taste in men — a judgment confirmed during a family dinner with her ex-husband — but there is no doubting her curiosity or her confidence. She is immune to self-pity and not averse to emotional risk, as her relationship with Rodolfo demonstrates. He is recently divorced but still attached to his ex-wife and their two daughters, who have a habit of calling his cellphone at inconveniently intimate moments. But Gloria likes his company, likes having sex with him and is susceptible to his floridly sincere declarations of love. For all her practical good sense, she has a romantic side, most evident in her habit of singing along with pop songs on the radio. Viewed from one angle, “Gloria” is a cautionary love story, a tale of weary resilience in the face of disappointment and loss. But Mr. Lelio enriches it with a combination of narrative expansiveness and filmmaking discipline. No aspect of Gloria’s experience is off limits for him, and some of the film’s most memorable moments are those a more plot-focused director might have omitted, like the party scene in which she listens to unidentified friends performing Antônio Carlos Jobim’s “Waters of March,” one of the loveliest songs ever written.

"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE," The Chilean matron at the heart of the wonderfully unsettling comedy Gloria looks like any ordinary woman confronting the familiar dilemmas of late middle age. For other reasons, though, you may feel as though you've met her before. The film's director, Sebastian Lelio, is up to all kinds of mischief, the least of which is Gloria's abundant hairdo and outsized spectacles, which give her a slight but unmistakable resemblance to Dustin Hoffman in Sydney Pollack's beloved 1982 comedy, Tootsie. The movie puts her through hell, but make no mistake: Gloria is a celebration. Like Tootsie's Dorothy Michaels, Gloria is cheerful, gifted with goodwill and common sense, and supportive to a fault. True, there's a little telltale sadness about her eyes. Like many women of her age, Gloria has reached a stage in her life when the losses are incremental and the future seems lonely and scary. Her children have their own lives; work is just for making a living; after 10 years as a divorcee she still lives alone, visited only by a mad neighbor's homely cat. Gloria is close to her family, but she's clinging to the edge of a world of which she was once the center. For a while we see her only in confined spaces: Even at the dance club where she goes to have fun and hunt for love, she seems hemmed in. Until, that is, she locks eyes with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a handsome, age-appropriate man with whom she feels such immediate rapport that they end up in bed that night. Their naked lovemaking is candidly shot and as avid as it is awkward. Rodolfo has the soft features, doe eyes and attentive manner of a sensitive soul. Look again: No, he's not a serial killer, but he's all kinds of trouble. Here Lelio begins to have some fun feeding audience expectations, then confounding them. The revelation that Rodolfo is a retired marine may raise Chilean hackles — the 1973 military coup that plunged the country into dictatorship was set in motion by naval officers — but the director veers away from the political-commentary path, unless you attach significance to the fact that Rodolfo's current combat of choice, and his living, is paintball. On an early date at Rodolfo's amusement park, the congenitally game Gloria finds herself trussed, bundled up and swung like a pendulum high above the ground. In another kind of movie, this might function as a cheap foreshadowing metaphor for helplessness; here, it also signals Gloria's openness to a wild ride. That she will get — which gives actress Paulina Garcia a golden role in which to explore a multitude of moods. Gloria is told entirely from its leading lady's point of view, and her mobile features, shot from every possible angle, register pain, amusement, exasperation and a kind of befuddled ecstasy. This is a woman who might smoke her first joint, exhort a weak lover to ""grow a pair,"" and finally seek a unique form of retributive justice with, shall we say, the tools at hand. Rodolfo, you see, will turn out to be only a slightly exaggerated version of the emotionally draining screw-up many survivors of the dating circuit will recognize with a wince. Yet both he and Gloria are both bewildered casualties of a radically modernized Chile in which the demand for individual rights has displaced a more traditional emphasis on obligations."

Produced by rising Chilean force-to-be-reckoned-with Pablo Larraín (“Post Mortem,” “No“), Sebastián Lelio‘s fourth feature, “Gloria,” proved to be one of the most pleasant surprises at last year’s Berlin Film Festival. While films focusing on female protagonists have not been in short supply during this and previous Berlinales, many of them featuring strong central performances and a realist style, Santiago-set “Gloria” is marked by two key differences that set it apart from, and above, many surface-similar films.  
	Firstly, the rigor of the approach—lead actress Paulina Garcia is not only in every scene, she’s in every single shot. And having a divorced mother of grown children, in her late 50s, be the subject of such an obsessive approach is nothing short of transgressive in how it makes central the kind of character who is so often invisible, or at best relegated to background importance. Secondly, and perhaps most surprisingly, Gloria is smart and kind and fundamentally a happy person, and it’s hard to remember the last time we saw a drama about one of those. It sounds like faint praise, but it really isn’t: Gloria is as real and true and interesting a character as we’ve ever seen, but she is neither stupid nor desperate nor haunted by a terrible past nor battling some dreadful addiction or affliction. Gloria is a normal, ordinary woman, and like most normal ordinary women, she has moments when she’s completely extraordinary and weird. As she goes through the tribulations of a love affair, suffers the departure of her daughter and fends off the advances of a neighbor’s hairless cat, things go right and things go wrong, but Gloria responds in her own unique yet utterly relatable way. By the end, her humor and resilience, and her unwillingness to take herself too seriously, means our initial liking for her blossoms into a kind of love.  
58 and sporting thick glasses, a la Dustin Hoffmann in “Tootsie,” Gloria lives alone, having divorced the father of her two grown children more than ten years prior. She works in an office during the week, stays in touch and on good terms with her son and daughter, and goes dancing by herself regularly, though she doesn’t always return alone. She is perhaps a little lonely, but it’s nothing she can’t handle, and it’s clear from the outset she does not regard herself as some sort of tragic heroine. Actually, she trusts herself most of the time, blames herself when she does something blameworthy, and then forgives herself and moves on. She doesn’t cast herself as a victim, even when she may actually be one—she has agency. We can’t stress enough how refreshing and unusual it is to have a complex, rounded character shown on screen who doesn’t hold some deep reserve of self-hatred or worthlessness—it’s little short of revelatory.  
And it’s a sensibility that extends to the whole film: just as Gloria doesn’t need some glaring fatal flaw or some manic pixie stylings to keep our interest, the film rarely resorts to melodrama or exaggeration to keep us engaged in the story. Gloria meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a paintball park owner and recent gastric bypass recipient (that comes across less screwball in the film, honest), at the dancehall and starts a relationship with him, but his tendency to walk to the heel of his dependent daughters frustrates her. Her pregnant daughter decides to leave the country, her son celebrates a birthday, she reconciles with Rodolfo for a holiday to Vina del Mar that goes awry… we’re aware this doesn’t sound like the stuff of great drama. However, these encounters and interactions play out with such truth and feeling that the narrative feels rich with incident and full of compassionate wisdom. And Lelio doesn’t shy away from physical details either—there are several instances of full-frontal nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes that are not just “adult” but grown-up in how non-judgmentally they are presented.

"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE," Movies about middle-aged women are so rare that it’s tempting to praise them on that basis alone. Thankfully, the Chilean drama Gloria, which won Paulina García the Best Actress prize at last year’s Berlin International Film Festival, doesn’t require much critical mitigation. Neither mocking nor quite celebrating its title character, who’s at once adorable and exasperating, the film asserts—even in the face of grim box-office realities—that menopause isn’t the end of sex or love. At the same time, though, it’s utterly realistic about the challenges of looking for love in an age group consisting almost entirely of people who’ve failed, in one form or another, at creating a viable long-term partnership. First seen practicing both her dance moves and her awkward seduction technique in a crowded disco, Gloria (García) puts a great deal of effort into her appearance without really understanding what’s attractive, resulting in a look that seems dowdier than she must have intended. Determined not to be some sad cat lady—though a neighbor’s cat apparently has other ideas—she eventually locates a kindred spirit in Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a courtly gentleman her own age who dotes on her… most of the time. Problem is, he still has strong ties to his troubled ex-wife, continually interrupting dates and vacations with Gloria to take phone calls from her, or from his adult children on her behalf. Whether his behavior indicates conscientiousness or rudeness is in the eye of the beholder; Gloria’s eyes, however, framed behind her giant, unflattering glasses, increasingly narrow. It’s to both García’s and Sebastián Lelio’s credit that festival audiences have been sharply divided on whether Gloria is admirable or pitiable, and on whether her perception of Rodolfo’s solicitude toward a former spouse is accurate or delusional. Either way, Gloria is a beautifully judged portrait of loneliness and resilience, equally effective whether seen as “you go girl” triumphalism or the willful obliviousness of someone for whom the truth would be too painful to endure. (A climactic sequence set to a Spanish version of  “Gloria”—as made famous in the U.S. by Laura Branigan—fits either interpretation.) García commits fully to this willful, indomitable, thoroughly odd woman, making her distinctive and memorable enough to earn the movie’s use of her name as its title. Who knows—maybe the film’s modest achievement would seem less impressive if more fiftysomething women were at the center of movies on a regular basis. Fact is, they aren’t."
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,"The leads give subtle, poignant performances that stick with you."
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE," Paulina Garcia has the face of a real-life woman in late middle age, one with facial muscles that move all the way up to the hairline and skin that is starting to slacken. Her body (which you get to know well) is quite a bit better than average, but it bears the obvious marks of a long-ago pregnancy. Of course none of this is exotic in real life, but in movies it’s pretty rare, and Chilean director Sebastián Lelio stalks his heroine around Santiago with the enthusiasm of a man who’s discovered a new wildlife species in remote Madagascar. The long-divorced Gloria (Garcia) hangs in singles bars catering to her age group (theme song: “I Feel Love”) until one day she meets what seems to be a catch: a divorced, slightly older man (Sergio Hernández), with a healthy sex drive and a strong attraction to her. The emphasis, alas, turns out to be on “seems.” Gloria must decide whether her dissatisfactions — inattentive adult kids, mopey ex-husband, suspicious new boyfriend — are going to keep her off the dance floor. It is all tied to the disconnected feelings of post-Pinochet Chileans, in a way that a foreigner can’t miss, but may be unable to fully comprehend. Fortunately, Garcia — singing along with pop songs or indulging in a flashy act of revenge — is always worth paying attention to."
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE," BERLIN – Hardly the most richly served of moviegoing demographics, smart middle-aged women will give a warm embrace to Gloria, making it a seemingly surefire contender for significant art house acceptance. But it’s hard to imagine anyone with a heart and a brain not responding to the quiet delights and stunning intimacy of Chilean director Sebastian Lelio’s account of the personal evolution of a 58-year-old divorcee, played with scrupulous honesty and intelligence by the wonderful Paulina Garcia. A large part of the cumulative joy of this movie is considering all the ways in which the story might have been mishandled. Midlife sexual desire, second-chance romance, the hunger for companionship, the challenging path toward self-reliance — these are all potential minefields ready to set off explosions of mawkish cliché. But Gloria is a work of maturity, depth and emotional insight. There’s not a single false note here to push the uplifting empowerment or resilience angles, or the conclusion that having a man is not a requirement in order to feel complete. Yet those nonstrident feminist themes emerge organically, without the need to be articulated. The title character is first glimpsed at a Santiago dance club populated by similarly middle-class mid-lifers. She gets pleasantly tipsy and flirty with an old acquaintance, yet fails to seal the deal. Gloria shuffles home alone not only to endure the screaming rants of the bipolar stoner living upstairs, audible through the ceiling, but also to find his whiny hairless cat in her apartment. In one of many touches of sly humor, this ugly animal appears to have decided that Gloria’s best option is to become a lonely cat lady. Still attractive and well put-together, but in a way that suggests a lack of vanity or the standard terror of aging, Gloria holds down a decent job and invariably is the one to make the effort to see her grown children. Her son Pedro (Diego Fontecilla) is a single father of a kid whose mother is out of the picture, while her daughter Ana (Fabiola Zamora) teaches a yoga class and has a budding relationship with a Swedish ski enthusiast. Divorced more than a decade ago, Gloria is much too level-headed to sit around moping in self-pity, but clearly something is missing. That threatens to change when she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a soft-spoken gent with a puppy-dog air, whose marriage ended more recently. The owner of a small funpark offering paint-gun battles and bungee jumps, he is in the process of restarting his life after gastric bypass surgery and dramatic weight loss. There’s a pleasing economy of means throughout the film, but particularly in Lelio’s way of chronicling their fast-blooming romance. This is complemented by the candor with which cinematographer Benjamin Echazarreta covers the sex scenes, observing their aging bodies with neither judgment nor embarrassment. Gloria is reinvigorated by the relationship yet is not the type to get all girly and airborne, even as Rodolfo reads her love poems in bed. She’s aware that he comes with baggage, and even the vintage ringtone of his cell phone is a hint of his ties to the past. The two needy grown daughters he supports financially are a noose around his neck but also evidence of his own dependence; he drops everything to run whenever they call. He also declines to “complicate” things by telling them about Gloria. But Rodolfo’s weakness becomes impossible to ignore when, feeling shut out of family reminiscences during Pablo’s birthday dinner, he reacts by slipping away silently, humiliating Gloria. Much of the movie’s second half is given over to Gloria resolving to cut her losses and shut the door on the sweet but spineless man who keeps begging for a second chance. When she relents, and agrees to a resort weekend, the look of helplessness on his face even as he tries to ignore a freshly arisen crisis back home is both touching and pathetic. A lot of women put through the deflating situations Gloria experiences would crumble. But in Lelio and Gonzalo Maza’s perceptive script, the character retains dignity and behavioral credibility even through the messy episodes that signpost her quiet catharsis. Onscreen for the duration in a story seen entirely from Gloria’s perspective, Garcia is remarkable, not least for the rigorous unshowiness and integrity of her self-possessed performance. She sets the tone for a gently humorous melodrama that’s refreshingly grownup, which is a rare thing. The realness of the central character extends to her relationships with friends and family, particularly in the subtle signs of friction softened by love with Ana. And while Gloria’s ex (Alejandro Goic) obviously had his shortcomings as a husband and father, this is not a movie that condescends to its protagonist or to its female audience by making sweeping generalizations that men are weak and women are the emotionally heroic ones. Chilean social context is sketched in with just a few brief verbal or visual nods to government disillusionment, popular unrest, corruption and the escalating cost of living. But the personal world depicted here is a universal one. In addition to Echazarreta’s close camerawork and the fluid editing of Lelio and Soledad Salfate, this gorgeous character study is aided immeasurably by well-considered music choices. Watching Gloria sing along to sentimental Latin pop while driving is an especially lovely touch in a movie notable for its absence of silly sentimentality. And her generation is neatly defined by songs that bookend the film, with Donna Summer’s disco classic “I Feel Love” near the start, and at the end — what else? — Umberto Tozzi’s ecstatic late-‘70s Italian evergreen, “Gloria.” As a concluding note, it’s perfection."
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"A divorced woman in her late 50s recaptures her life in Sebastian Lelio's pitch-perfect, terrifically written Gloria."
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE," A delightfully astute and compassionate delve into the life of a 58 year-old divorcee looking for company, romance and perhaps even love, director Sebastián Lelio’s engaging, amusing and oddly uplifting Gloria is a film that will strike a chord with audiences of a certain age. It is driven by a quite wonderful performance from Paulina Garcia, who should snag best actress awards at every festival the film plays at. Paulina Garcia is quite wonderful in the role – she is in every scene, and does a remarkable job in portraying the fractured and fraying life of a middle-aged woman who is simply seeking affection. The fourth feature from Lelio (whose other films include La Sagrada Familia and Navidad), Gloria is a simple and straightforward piece of cinema, and while never resorting to any overly clever camera tricks or visual flourishes it succeeds if delivering a gentle drama with a real sense of affection for its lead character. It could fit into the current trend for mature-audience cinema, while also likely to feature on the festival circuit. Gloria (Garcia) favours singles parties rather than staying in her small Santiago flat all alone (apart from an annoying hairless cat that often sneaks in), and at one dance she meets ex-naval officer Rudolfo (Sergio Hernandez), seven years her senior and newly divorced, and keen to forge out a new life for himself.  She sees the possibly of a loving and possibly permanent relationship, but despite Rudolfo’s enthusiasm the spectre of his ex-wife and two grown-up daughters interrupts their romance. Favouring large glasses and old songs (she sings in the car by herself), Gloria is a woman caught in a cycle of booze and fractured family relationships. She adores her grown-up son and daughter, and though things are still vaguely tense between them they seem like a vision of family perfection compared to Rudolfo’s family situation – his wife and adult daughters all live together, don’t work and rely on his for money, advice and affection at any time day and night. She and Rudolfo start a sexual relationship, but any chance of happiness and development seems to be hampered by constant calls by his family. Things come to a head when they drive off for a brief break by the coast, only for him to flee when calls start coming. Gloria resorts to copious amounts of booze, flirting drunkenly with a random man she meets at the hotel casino an ends up waking dishevelled and hungover on the beach. The film touches on the current political situation in Chile, but at its core this is essentially just one woman’s story.  Paulina Garcia is quite wonderful in the role – she is in every scene, and does a remarkable job in portraying the fractured and fraying life of a middle-aged woman who is simply seeking affection. There are moments of real humour – when she starts dabbling with marijuana or when she takes wonderfully wicked revenge on Rudolfo (that may have some audience members cheering) – and pathos as her sense of inner-strength finally wins through. The final coda of her singing along and dancing (to, naturally, Laura Branigan’s 1982 pop anthem Gloria) at a wedding reception ends the film delightfully – and appropriately – on a real high.

"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"I overheard someone call it a ""midlife crisis drama."" The comment was clueless for lots of reasons, most notably because there's no crisis in Gloria at all, which is what makes it so marvelous."
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE," Chris Pine has startlingly bright blue eyes, thick, dark eyebrows, and a way of seeming to look for something special even when he’s just staring into space—a gift of intentness that works well for him in “Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,” where he plays the latest incarnation of the intellectually dazzling C.I.A.-analyst hero of many books by Tom Clancy. Early in the movie, a thug tries to kill Ryan in a Moscow hotel, and Pine also gives a successful impression of a man frightened to death—eyes darting wildly, mouth open wider than most acting coaches would advise. He’s an enjoyably talented actor in these early scenes. Like “Batman Begins,” “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” and “Man of Steel,” the new movie begins as a myth of conception, or, as it’s more commonly known, the reboot of a half-dead franchise. We see Ryan as a marine in Afghanistan, in 2003: his helicopter goes down, his lower spine is mashed, and he has to learn to walk again. He gets help from a medical student (Keira Knightley), who is holding out for a date until he can overcome the excruciating pain and run like a track star, a demand that is supposed to be charming in a feisty sort of way. The movie then skips ahead to his recruitment into the C.I.A., by the super-agent William Harper (Kevin Costner, trying to look mysterious and dangerous by not doing much). Most of the rest is set in the “new” Moscow, which, despite many cutting-edge skyscrapers and a glass-and-metal office of icy brilliance, is pretty much like the perfidious old Moscow that Clancy prized in Cold War days. A sinister Russian oligarch, Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh), has been buying up U.S. Treasury bonds through dummy corporations. He orders a terrorist attack on American soil, after which he intends to sell the bonds, crashing the dollar and the economy as a whole. Explaining the plan to Harper, Ryan allows that an American economic collapse might cause Russia’s economy to crash, too, but he quickly adds that the Russians have oil reserves, and will survive. He fails to point out that the Americans have a barrel or two in reserve themselves. Thus ends the exposition of economic warfare. Tom Clancy was an insurance salesman in Maryland when, in the early nineteen-eighties, he wrote a book, “The Hunt for Red October,” that Ronald Reagan, with a handsome public mention, turned into a best-seller. Clancy’s career took off like, well, like one of his rockets. Too nearsighted to serve in the armed forces, Clancy, who kept a tank on his front lawn, was a military fantasist whose end-is-nigh concoctions spawned a franchise empire of video games, Clancy books by other hands, and, of course, movies. He died last October, and I don’t know if he had an opinion of this movie’s scenario (not based on any of his novels), but I wonder if he would have approved. The movie, which was directed by Branagh and written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp, features some rifles and revolvers but few of the bases, missiles, advanced artillery, and ecstatically enumerated ordnances and ranges that Clancy loved so well. The Jack Ryan films have never been a proper franchise. James Bond, no matter who plays him, and no matter what the actor’s age, always seems about forty; it’s existentially impossible for him to be much older, just as it’s existentially impossible for Nancy Drew to be any older than a teen-ager. Jason Bourne does age—his story, as recorded in the three movies starring Matt Damon, was consecutive and heart-wrenching. Bond and Bourne, one playful, one serious, are both genuine franchise heroes. Ryan is just a property. He has no fixed identity, and his age fluctuates according to which actor is currently bankable. He was played by a devilishly handsome but puppyish Alec Baldwin in “Red October,” and by a fiftyish, scowling Harrison Ford in “Patriot Games” and “Clear and Present Danger.” In the latter, Ryan disrupts a covert war run by the White House against drug cartels in Colombia. The best of the series, the movie is morally ambiguous and complicated in a way the others don’t come close to. Ben Affleck, cleft and eager, took over for “The Sum of All Fears,” which begins with Israel losing a nuclear bomb, and not bothering to recover it, allowing it to fall into the hands of neo-Nazi terrorists. How can you identify with a hero who jumps around in age and gets stuck in stupid plots? The series had hit bottom. Branagh doesn’t go for the fragmented, glimpses-of-action style perfected by the director Paul Greengrass and the cinematographer Oliver Wood in “The Bourne Supremacy” and “The Bourne Ultimatum.” The images produced here by Branagh and his cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukos, are stable, glossy, gleaming—a crisp black-on-black look that delivers paranoia in the chic style of a coolly disdainful fashion show. In Branagh’s favorite trope, C.I.A. people pass one another secret materials in the Moscow streets like Olympic runners handing off batons. Branagh, who started out in movies directing Shakespeare, has turned into a speed freak. He and his editor, Martin Walsh, have increased the tempo of the international thriller without spinning into incoherence. “Shadow Recruit” is fun in a minor, winter-season way. If the producers stick with Chris Pine as he ages, they may end up with something worth caring about. In the Chilean film “Gloria” (opening  January 24th), directed by Sebastián Lelio, and written by Lelio and Gonzalo Maza, Gloria (Paulina García), a good-looking and adventurous woman in middle age, regularly visits singles bars in Santiago. Placid and fifties-European in ambience, these establishments cater to substantial-looking people who dance tamely to retro pop and look for a bed partner. The atmosphere is congenial and relatively quiet, and conversation is easy. At one bar, Gloria, who is the divorced mother of two grown children, meets a somewhat older man, Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández). Is he right for her? Moviegoers instinctively crave sexual egalitarianism in romance—Hollywood has always understood this—and at first it may seem that Gloria needs someone younger. Rodolfo has a fine, modulated voice and melancholy eyes—he is given to nobly romantic sentiments and the recitation of terrible love poetry—but he appears tired. He stumbles a bit: he says that he, too, is divorced, and the father of two adult daughters who remain dependent on him (his mobile phone keeps ringing with urgent requests). But, smitten with Gloria, he presses ahead, and she goes to bed with him. Lelio shoots explicit sex scenes between these two matter-of-factly, demonstrating a striking good sense that, among other things, makes the jokey nervousness about middle-aged sex in a pair of recent Meryl Streep movies—“It’s Complicated” and “Hope Springs”—seem even more embarrassing in retrospect. It’s a little hard to understand how we are supposed to take Rodolfo, though. Is Sergio Hernández miscast? Perhaps not. Judging from this movie, you’d think that Chile is a country without irony or even much humor. The culture clearly isn’t as media-obsessed as ours is—for instance, people sing together at home for entertainment—and conversations are blunt, rather than knowing. Rodolfo’s earnestness fits right in with this tone, and Gloria wants to believe in him. On the surface, she’s an ordinary, rather lonely middle-class woman. She has an office job that she doesn’t much care about; her son, a musician and a single parent, is remote; her daughter, whom she adores, takes off for Sweden to live with her boyfriend. Yet there are mysteries in Gloria’s character, and the movie chronicles a strange, upsetting month or two in which everything in her life threatens to unravel. Paulina García, who won the best-actress award at last year’s Berlin film festival for the role, has a magical smile and a mobile face and body—at times, Gloria seems a young woman—and she reacts so idiosyncratically to events that she keeps us fascinated, even when the script turns inarticulate and patchy.

"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE," Set in Santiago, Chile, this is a saga about the romantic travails of attractive, flirtatious, 58 year-old Gloria (Paulina Garcia), who becomes involved with 60’ish Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), the very recently divorced owner of an arcade amusement park. But, torn between family obligations and personal fulfillment, he is obviously conflicted and clearly not ready for the kind of mature bond for which she so passionately yearns. Opening in a crowded ‘singles’ nightclub, bespectacled Gloria confidently is sitting at the bar, happily sipping champagne, puffing on a cigarette and surveying the scene unfolding around her until she catches the eye of a man she used to know and moves onto the dance floor. But the next morning and the morning after, she awakens alone.  So it’s back to the nightclub, where Gloria meets Rodolfo Fernandez, who is immediately attracted to her. Explaining that “men love to play war games,” Rodolfo happily introduces Gloria to Vertigo Park, yet alludes to the neediness of his ex-wife and two grown daughters who call him incessantly and with whom he obviously has a co-dependent relationship.  In turn, Gloria invites Rodolfo to a family birthday party, where she thoughtlessly ignores him, preferring to engage in nostalgia with her ex-husband and his new wife.  Then when Rodolfo plans a romantic getaway to the beach resort of Vina del Mar, that excursion turns out to be equally disastrous. Written by Gonzlo Maza and director Sebastian Lelio, it’s dominated by the sensual complexity of the indomitable titular character, magnificently played by Paulina Garcia, who won the coveted Silver Bear Actress Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Music is a pivotal element throughout the film. As she drives to her office job, Gloria sings along with ballads on the radio – and the concluding image of her trilling along with Umberto Tozzi’s original version of “Gloria” is emotionally uplifting."
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE," In her youth, Gloria hit the discos and danced the Chilean nights away, grooving to the Andrea True Connection and Umberto Tozzi’s song that used her name.
“Gloria”, a song later remade in America by Laura Brannigan, is an ear bug. Try to get it out of your head after seeing “Gloria,” the movie about this divorcee who finds herself reliving her past in the over-50 dating scene of modern day Chile.
Gloria, played by Paulina Garcia with a sort of fierce victimhood, still listens to the songs of her youth, still picks up men — now, it’s at senior dances, where music of her era is played. She’s pushing 60 and still doing the occasional Walk of Shame.
She has lost some of her looks, but not her vivaciousness. Sebastian Lelio’s film is about starting over, about how 60 is the new 40 and about how a woman of a certain age keeps her optimism and her sense of self worth when society (and cinema) has traditionally put such women out to pasture.
“Are you always this happy?” Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández) wants to know on meeting her. Maybe he has number. Or maybe that’s just an “alias” she’s been living under.
As Rodolfo, successful, 60something and plainly smitten, pursues her and in between the work days and beauty regimen, the wining and dining and youthful paintball battles, we start to understand the weight of sadness behind this sunny exterior.
Some of that you can lay at the feet of Rodolfo. He is an enthusiastic lover, but so guarded about their relationship that Gloria turns suspicious. That gives the film a melodramatic edge.
She has other priorities – a daughter about to move overseas with her Swedish beau, a weepy ex-husband. And Rodolfo is a reminder of everything about her past — drunken bar pickups, the excitement of a new sexual partner, casual pot use, the awkwardness of “relationship” conversations — and the unbridged maturity gap between men and women.
“Gloria” has a palpable loneliness about it, and Garcia makes us feel that and fear the emptiness that is staring Gloria in the face. Not a lot happens in this closely-observed character study, but few recent movies have dared to show this stage of life, the creeping solitude that memories of your disco past cannot fend off."
"Jan 18, 2014",POSITIVE," It has been 12 years since her divorce and Gloria (Paulina Garcia) spends her weekends at the various dating clubs in Santiago. But, she has never found a man to love and be loved by. That is, until she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), a shy man who is far more recently divorced than “Gloria.” In Santiago, Chile, a divorcee approaching her sixties continues to embrace the possibilities still to come. She goes to dance clubs for fun, but there is always the chance of a romantic adventure to raise the stakes. When she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández, ""No""), it looks like her life is about to get brighter but even rocky roads ahead cannot dampen the spirit of ""Gloria."" Cowriter (with Gonzalo Maza)/director Sebastián Lelio's film, Chile’s official entry Foreign Language entry for the Academy Awards, was considered a surprising exclusion from the eventual five nominees, but even though the Academy is well known for disregarding some of the more worthy foreign films, I for one was not surprised. ""Gloria"" does boast a very good performance from Berlin Silver Bear winner for Best Actress Paulina García, but the filmmakers, who clearly wish to present her as an irrepressible life force, have also made her behavior too contrary to fully root for her. Flaws are a necessary component of any complex character, but here Gloria is guilty of the same sort of inconsideration that we are supposed to condemn Rodolfo for while being rude about it to boot. Youthful spirit is also confused with juvenile irresponsibility in the way Gloria reacts to Rodolfo's weakness. Alcohol is a factor in both episodes. Before this we must admire this woman who ventures into clubs alone, happy just to dance. She's the type of woman who sings along to the radio in her car with gusto and Garcia demands our attention, her vibrancy powered by the sheer will to overcome loneliness. When Gloria does connect, she's all in, making love with passion, flinging herself off a bridge on a bungee cord, engaging in paintball battles. Lelio's maddening climax puts a damper on things, but he ends his film on an upbeat note, Gloria alone again at a wedding, dancing to a Spanish language version of her namesake hit. García fuels this shapeless, misguided character study with more character than it deserves - she's a real firecracker. The past few years have been kind, film-wise, to the 40+ year old demographic with stories skewing away from youthful audience. “Gloria” is just that kind of films as it follows its title character in her search to find happiness and companionship. Paulina Garcia envelops her character as she does the date bar circuit looking for Mr. Right. She finds him, maybe, in Rodolfo, but he has his own set of baggage – his ex-wife and children who he remains close to. This baggage affects the relationship between Gloria and Rodolfo as, first, tells her he cannot get Gloria out of his head. Then, without explanation during a birthday dinner for her son, he walks out and disappears from Gloria’s life – then comes back to her only to leave her once again. The film shows the fleeting elusiveness of love for our middle-aged heroine. Paulina Garcia gives a smart feistiness to her Gloria as she continues life after divorce. It is a good character study of life after 40. The story, by director Sebastian Lelio and Gonzalo Maza, is not quite up to the star’s study of Gloria. Sergio Hernandez, as Rodolfo, lacks dimension of character and his coming and going in Gloria’s life rings false, especially when considering her megawatt presence. The reason to see “Gloria” is to appreciate the fine performance by Paulina Garcia."
"Jan 14, 2014",POSITIVE," What distinguishes Sebastián Lelio’s funny-sad character study isn’t just its ubiquitous subject, a middle-aged divorcee looking for love and sex. It’s that we watch Gloria not simply getting her groove back (though we do see that), but also feeling numbed and downcast much of the time, often with the help of a drink. The Chilean director’s fourth feature isn’t some simplistic tale of uplift but one that honestly depicts someone who is taking emotional risks, having fun, and taking her lumps too. Gloria, played by a tireless Paulina Garcia, lives alone in Santiago and likes to go out dancing; she wears dated granny glasses but her adventures would probably give her own daughter a run for her money. When she gets together with a timid-seeming retiree named Rodrigo, she enjoys herself but can’t help pushing him around a little; a complicated family dinner suggests that the need for approval isn’t something that goes away with age. (An underdeveloped detail, hard to ignore in a Chilean film, is that Rodrigo was a military officer, presumably during the Pinochet era.) Lelio, again co-writing with Gonzalo Mazo, centers the film on Garcia from start to finish, right down to scenes of her stumbling about her apartment or blinking in the pitiless light of day after an all-nighter. Garcia is up to the challenge (though, truth be told, those specs seem an unnecessarily obscuring touch), and brings a welcome, defiant sense of brio to a complex role."
"Jan 11, 2014",POSITIVE,Celebrate the empowerment of Chilean middle-aged women!
"Dec 19, 2013",POSITIVE," Sebastián Lelio’s funny, touching, splendidly acted character study Gloria shows up Hollywood’s inability to create realistic, compelling roles for middle-aged women. While Gloria, a free-spirited 58-year-old divorcee finding romance in Santiago, might turn up there in a watered-down rom-com as a shrilly doting, comically lusty harpy-type, Leilo affords her dignity and respect, warts and all. She’s terrifically played by Pauline García, whose performance — easily a candidate for the year’s best — exudes a raw, nuanced, effervescent honesty as Gloria navigates the emotionally murky terrain of midlife malaise. Her kids are fully grown and independent, and she frequents singles nights at bars, content to booze and dance on her own, but her voracious appetite for seeking pleasure and adventure can’t quite overcome the ever-pervading sense of loneliness and the onset of cruel age-centric physical ailments like glaucoma. Enter Rudolfo (Sergio Hernández), a charming retiree who seemingly offers her another stab at love, but ultimately serves to further unravel her complicated persona. Leilo’s outstanding direction and thoughtfully written screenplay, matched with Garcia’s committed performance, make Gloria one deceptively effortless, subtly endearing treat. Its refreshingly frank attitude towards sex manages to conjure passion from Old People Banging without sniggering, and better still, it never balloons into melodrama nor makes any excuses for Gloria’s behaviour, however off-the-rails she might get. She remains the bright, throbbing heart of the story throughout, earning the inclusion of Umberto Tozzi’s cheesy disco namesake at the end. It’s not just a quick patch of uplift to send audiences out on a high note — she deserves it."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE," Gloria is such a lovely, simple story that it’s amazing (or depressing) that we don’t see more of its kind. An up-close look at a middle-aged divorcée figuring out her life as a solitary woman amidst an extended family and a possible new romance, this drama (Chile’s official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar) goes a long way on the strength of its lead performance by Paulina García. She’s such a rich, layered creation that it’s a bit of a letdown that the movie around her isn’t always comparably engaging. García plays the title character, who’s single in her 50s but refusing to become one of those people who recedes from view now that she’s no longer “young.” When the movie opens, we see Gloria at a nightclub, happily dancing and enjoying herself. Soon, she meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), who’s a little older but shares her zest for living. (Other things they have in common: They’re both divorced with adult children.) Gloria and Rodolfo have been around long enough to know that love doesn’t always work out, but they’re willing to give this potential relationship a try. In the last few years, we’ve seen middle-aged romances like Last Chance Harvey, but Gloria feels different because of its honesty about the difficulties that await adults who find new love. When we’re young, we’re hardly tied down to anything, and so a romance can give dimension and meaning to a life. But for Gloria and Rodolfo, they’ve already established their lives, and so any new person coming into their orbits must learn to adapt to what’s already there. And as Gloria discovers, falling for Rodolfo also means having to accept his strange relationship with his ex and his children, who are always calling him on his cellphone needing this, that or the other. Although she doesn’t meet these people, they’re an invisible drag on her and Rodolfo’s burgeoning love affair—not just because of the time they take up in his life but also because their consistent virtual presence suggests a man who doesn’t have good boundaries. Director and co-writer Sebastián Lelio avoids any sort of cutesy condescension in his depiction of Gloria. The movie spends precisely zero minutes trying to hip up or validate Gloria’s lifestyle. Her office day job doesn’t seem particularly scintillating, but her journeys to nightclubs aren’t meant to reveal the “real” Gloria—merely her attempts to remain open to new experiences. Similarly, García makes Gloria’s age, which would most assuredly be the most important part of her character if this were an American movie, only part of her makeup. Confident but also searching, Gloria is looking for love, but she has control issues, which come up when her ex-husband’s new wife offers her pot. Though most would describe Gloria as being her own woman, her deepening feelings for Rodolfo highlight that she still desires companionship, still wants someone to share her world with her. That’s why his unpredictable behavior is all the more galling. It’s best not to reveal anything, but unlike Gloria—who has reached middle-aged with her wits still very much about her—Rodolfo can’t be trusted, his pronouncements of passionate love for Gloria sometimes contradicted by his actions. But Lelio can’t quite bring himself to be too hard on this man. On the whole, Gloria drifts along on its patient, sympathetic treatment of all its characters, never more so than when Gloria brings Rodolfo along to a family meal, giving us a glimpse of the splendid people with whom she’s surrounded herself. (Even her ex-husband is a pretty great guy.) But the film’s sweetness can too often settle into blandness on the storytelling side. As deeply felt as Gloria is, Gloria ultimately doesn’t have much of a framework to support García’s deeply sympathetic performance. (Though to be fair, the decidedly modest narrative may actually be the point.) A woman like Gloria is seasoned enough to recognize that sweeping, Hollywood happy endings don’t happen in the real world. All she can ask for is a little peace and a little comfort to get her through the day. The movie provides that, which is victory enough for her."
"Nov 8, 2013",POSITIVE," Filling the gap is a stunning performance from Paulina Garcia, this year’s best actress winner in Berlin and now the spearhead for this Chilean submission for the best foreign language film category at the 2014 Oscars. At 52, Garcia is something of a halfway house between Meryl Streep, 64, and Ashley Judd, 45 – blended with odd touches of Corrie’s bespectacled Deirdre and Dustin Hoffman circa Tootsie. I’d never heard of Garcia until this year, but whether she’s smoking, having sex, eating, drinking, dancing, paintballing or bunjee jumping, you can't take your eyes off her magnetic performance. And so the more the two leads strive for happiness together, they more they are in danger of being weighed down by their previous baggage. A glori-ous warts-and-all reminder that in order to strive to be successful, happy or simply in love you have to put your foot down and hold your steering wheel tight during life’s inevitable storms."
"Nov 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Gloria's journey is free from artificial flashpoints or climaxes.
"Nov 6, 2013",POSITIVE," Since Hollywood refuses to make clever, engaging films about strong 50-something women, leave it to Chile to give us a movie to celebrate. This delightful comedy-drama has a loose plot that lets Paulina Garcia's terrific title character spring wonderfully to life. And she's never a victim: Gloria is a woman who does things on her own terms. The film opens by showing us how full her life is. She may be divorced, but Gloria enjoys her busy days, going from her office job to yoga classes, laughter therapy and helping her adult children (Fontecilla and Zamora) with their issues. And in her spare time, she heads to the local disco to meet men. It's there that she encounters Rodolfo (Hernandez), a man her age who runs an extreme sports park. As their relationship develops, Gloria begins to worry that he has no interest in her children, and even worse he constantly leaves her in the lurch so he can help his own adult daughters. So she has to make a decision. The nice thing about Gloria is that she knows she's fine on her own; she doesn't need Rodolfo, but she likes him and is willing to put up with his baggage (including his velcro corset). Watching her deal with him gives us a striking portrait of her independent resilience. Even though she's had a rocky romantic life, she's still hopeful about love and maintains a youthful silly streak. Garcia plays all of this with a blast of personality that wins us over completely. The film's tone matches Gloria's mischievous outlook on life, playfully stirring in some hilarious details while keeping everything earthy and natural. Awkward moments are both amusing and realistic, and every moment tells us more about this remarkable woman who can stand up for herself when she needs to, but never forgets to have fun along the way. A scene in which she puts a brave face on her true feelings is darkly moving, while her casual denial of all knowledge about a lost stash of pot makes us smile. We definitely need more movie heroes like Gloria."
"Nov 4, 2013",POSITIVE," Enough Said warned against befriending your new boyfriend's ex-wife. The Great Beauty showed what the sex, Botox and penthouse rave scene was like for wealthy Roman pensioners. And now Gloria chips in with full-frontal insight into post-divorce dating in Chile. All three films have felt fresh and exciting – this won Paulina García the best actress award at Berlin, and it's gloriously strange and slippery, impossible to pin down – at once funny, uplifting, moving and deeply disquieting. What it's not is parochial: Lelio speaks to the ties that strangle in all relationships. Gloria's new lover is smothered by pathetic daughters, our heroine hobbled by an over-functional family life and, perhaps, a thirst for irrationality that's stronger than her hankering after companionship. Both director and star keep it mysterious; this leaves as strange and complicated a taste as Claire Denis's Beau Travail."
"Nov 1, 2013",POSITIVE," Contemporary cinema is depressingly uninterested in the romantic lives of older single women. If such people aren’t running aggressive branches of the CIA, then they must look elsewhere for attention. Sebastián Lelio's terrific Chilean drama goes some way towards redressing that imbalance. Shot in widescreen, featuring luscious camerawork by Benjamín Echazarreta, Gloria doesn't look much like a piece of dirty realism. But it isn’t any sort of melodrama either. Odd, seemingly random story elements combine to make a very attractive, consistently diverting cinematic mosaic. There’s no vulgar flash on display. But the picture feels utterly original. Paulina García plays a divorced woman – mother to two mildly neglectful adult children – who has decided to launch herself onto the dating scene. At a singles club she meets a slightly older man named Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández) and they begin a twisty romantic relationship. At home, she is distracted by a noisy, mentally disturbed neighbour and his wandering Sphynx cat. Work offers few opportunities for excitement. It soon turns out that Rodolfo is no good. He’s not cruel. He’s not violent. He’s just pathetically unable to live life as it should be lived. Henpecked by his own kids, he sulks and pouts when sufficient attention fails to come his way. Hernández makes something quietly monstrous of this nincompoop, but the film belongs to its brilliant lead. Ms Garcia won a Silver Bear for best actress at the Berlin Film Festival and it is hard to imagine the jury deliberated for long. One thinks, perhaps, of the various determined women who dominate Mike Leigh films. But Gloria is a more complex human being than those broad creations. Though endlessly charismatic, properly funny and disciplined in her home life, she is (like us all) capable of making bad decisions when under emotional stress. Garcia encapsulates all those aspects in the creation of a
	character that only a heel could fail to root for. A very impressive, very grown-up drama."
"Nov 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"A gentle, plaintive character study elevated by a glowing central performance."
"Nov 1, 2013",POSITIVE," It's gloriously difficult to place the protagonist of Sebastian Lelio's drama. Chilean grand-mother Gloria (Paulina Garcia, who won the Silver Bear at Berlin for this performance) is averagely attractive but has dodgy taste in glasses (think Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie). Financially secure, she's been divorced for years and, now that her two children are grown up, and no longer seem to need her, is thrilled by the attentions of fluttery businessman, Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez). She brings him along to her son's birthday party, to which her ex-husband and his wife, have also been invited. Rodolfo thanks everyone for letting him become part of the family. Mid-way through the evening, he disappears. The film, in that it hones in on an ageing singleton who loves to dance, spasmodically, and euphorically, to disco music, recalls art-house hits such as Julia and Beau Travaille. Yet those films used violence to up the ante. (There's a gun in Gloria, but the only thing it shoots is paint). Back in the 50s, this would have been described as a “woman's picture”. Yet films in that genre tend to have endings that are either romantic or tragic. (The climax, here, is neither). It's only when the naked heroine stretches out on her bed - beside the world's most repulsive-looking cat - that it hits you. Lelio's film isn't like other films... Gloria is the portrait Lucian Freud forgot to paint and probably won't be in cinemas for long. See it in the flesh, before it disappears."
"Nov 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Equal parts warm and wise, Gloria is an invigorating story of female agency that will have you rooting for its leading lady from start to finish."
"Nov 1, 2013",POSITIVE," Chilean actress Paulina García won the 2013 Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival. The prize is well earned. Her performance in  Gloria as the title character gives weight and meaning to a romance that could otherwise have seemed insubstantial. Divorced, but not through with love, Gloria (García) is introduced to the audience  at a bar, listening to early ’80s pop music, hoping for the chance to dance. Over the next few scenes, the film shows us her loneliness: she calls her children from work, she attends a yoga class with her daughter, she chats with an old caretaker and deals with the stray hairless cat that occasionally wanders in to her apartment. Directed by Sebastián Lelio, and written by Lelio and Gonzalo Maza,  Gloria has a lot of these illustrative scenes. They show the characters’ mood and emotions, without necessarily driving a an event-based plot.  Gloria meets Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a soft and gentle man, fifteen years her senior. Their romance is played like any other romance you’d see in the movies, no matter that the subjects are facing grandchildren and glaucoma. There are stolen glances, shy smiles, and plenty of dancing. As they get more serious, the romantic scenes keep pace. Rodolfo isn’t exactly a hunk, but Gloria’s hormones still work. Gloria gets hot, and García can still sell it. Gloria is episodic; disjointed scenes are spliced together. Usually that’s a style I don’t like, because it often means the movie is trying to do too much, and story continuity often suffers. But here the emotional arc  is the story. It doesn’t matter that there are jumps in time and space, because there is emotional continuity in Gloria and Rodolfo’s relationship. Gloria is surprised to learn that Rodolfo operates an adventure playground, with zip lines, cable swings, and paintball battlefields. He also has adult children — daughters in their late 20s and early 30s who still live at home. Maybe that’s understandable with the global economy in recession. What’s odd is that he doesn’t want Gloria to meet his daughters; he’s not ready for it yet. Is it a mere quirk? Or is it the beginning of a crack in the budding relationship? One of the film’s best scenes is a dinner party with Gloria’s children, their significant others, her ex-husband, and Rodolfo. Her family is lively, grounded, and well adjusted. Lelio gives a minute of screen time to the family singing an amateur version of Jobim’s  Waters of March that is beautiful in its imperfection. Rodolfo is delighted, but a little overwhelmed. He clearly comes from a more reserved, conservative family background than this. Some wine is consumed and Gloria and her ex spar in a way that makes Rodolfo even more uncomfortable, and he leaves without saying goodbye. It’s understandable, but it makes Gloria angry. García’s performance is very good, and it only gets better as the film progresses. Maybe the screenplay has one too many contrivances — the romance is on-again, off-again — but when the conflict grows, that’s  when García’s performance really shines. Not in an over-the-top explosive way, but simply in our estimation of her character. Gloria might be a hard sell for film festivals and audiences, since fifty-year-old lovers don’t exactly sound like a formula for success. But García’s award-winning performance and the well-sculpted screenplay work together to make a surprisingly compelling love story."
"Oct 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"A warm-hearted, emotionally engaging Chilean comedy-drama-slash-character study with a sharply observed script and a terrific central performance from Paulina Garcia."
"Oct 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Glorious.
"Oct 31, 2013",POSITIVE,This burnished gem from Chile is a rich and poetic character study of a woman on the look out for love.
"Oct 31, 2013",POSITIVE," Pablo Larraín's No and Patricio Guzmán's Nostalgia for the Light were movies that offered fascinating glimpses of modern Chile, struggling with its past. Now this film by Sebastián Lelio gives us another perspective: it is Chile's foreign-language Oscar entry. Gloria is a free-spirited divorcee, played with terrific exuberance by Paulina García; she is vivacious and attractive, though with a rather 80s hairstyle and big glasses that make her look weirdly like Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. She hangs out at singles bars in Santiago, looking for love and sex, and finds herself falling for a silver-fox type called Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), also divorced, who satisfies Gloria in the bedroom, and takes her bungee-jumping and paintballing in the amusement centre he owns, symbolically called Vertigo Park. Yet the relationship is in danger due to their baggage and family ties, particularly to grownup children. Lelio shrewdly suggests that love the second time around might not simply be the same old autumnal and bittersweet business. Perhaps the love experienced by Gloria and Rodolfo is the real thing, better and more authentic than anything before – it's just that they didn't meet each other until now. But whatever the truth, the past will get in the way. Gloria and Rodolfo feel a guilty attachment to this past. They can't quite abandon it; perhaps all of Chile's Pinochet generation feels like this in other ways. Gloria is a sad, painful romantic story."
"Oct 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"There's a bigness of reach and vision throughout this movie, even when distilling itself, more than once, to a single shot of a single woman in the lonely clamour of a singles bar."
"Oct 31, 2013",POSITIVE," When we think back to great moments in this year’s screen performances, there will need to be an entire sub-category for the looks, moues, gestures, exhilarating laughs, and worn-down line readings of Chilean actress Paulina García. As the title character of Gloria, a deliciously mordant study of middle-aged romantic travails, García appears in literally every frame between her film’s opening and closing credits. It was the admirably pure formal aim of director Sebastian Lelio to place her in his movie’s forcefield and not let go. It might sound gimmicky, but Lelio is so busy absorbing you completely in his heroine’s life, it’s a strategy that could easily pass unnoticed. Gloria is 58, divorced, and back on the scene. She begins the movie taking tentative steps onto the dancefloor at a Santiago club, where she’s very desirable to men of a certain age – men such as Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), an erstwhile family man, portly and somewhat older, who eyes her longingly from his table. They start to date, but it’s complicated – Rodolfo’s always fielding calls from his ex-wife and grown daughters, who may have neglected him entirely during a recent operation, but are indefatigable nags when they want something. The bleat of his mobile phone, which Gloria kindly accepts at first, takes its toll on their new-found intimacy like a shrill death knell. Lelio expertly handles the seesawing emotional tone of his story, which pivots between hope and heartbreak before alighting on its true subject – self-worth – and giving García a third act any actress would kill for. A night out drinking, gambling and being slobbered on in a resort casino ends with a crisp cut to Gloria lying on the beach with only one shoe – we fill in the blanks. This is a woman quite capable of humiliating herself, but also of springing back with a vengeance. The danger here might be forcing a comeback too neatly on the audience, but the film’s assertive good faith is earned in the frankest ways imaginable, with unfliching nudity and not the slightest bit of sugar-coating. The movie’s a toast to its subject, a boogie in her honour, and takes her side through thick and thin. It’s hard to resist. And why would you want to?"

Gloria (Paulina García) is a fifty- or sixtysomething divorcee sampling the Santiago singles scene for older folks. Since she’s happy with her work and gets on well with her grown-up kids, she’s mostly content with one-night-stands. Then she meets Rodolfo, a gentle, quietly spoken businessman who clearly adores her, but who comes with baggage of his own.Sebastián Lelio’s fine film boasts subtly nuanced, plausible performances, none more so than García as the strong-willed, fun-loving but sometimes lonely protagonist. Though it’s most successful as a character study, the movie also works as an unusually honest variation on the traditional cinematic love story (it rings especially true on the difficulties of starting over after years of settled family life). It’s also strong, in passing, as a portrait of a certain comfortably-off segment of Chilean society, still somewhat unsure as to how to cope with its recent history. There are just a couple of moments that don’t altogether convince: the predictable closing scene, especially, feels a little too neat and manipulative.

"Oct 28, 2013",POSITIVE,The mesmerising Garca and sensitive direction by Lelio light up this delicate yet spiky drama. Terrific stuff from both Chileans.
"Oct 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Sticking tightly to its heroine's everyday routines and rituals, this deft blend of humour and pathos fully earns its defiantly upbeat dance-floor denouement."
"Oct 16, 2013",POSITIVE," Cinematic  portrayals of the trials and tribulations of a more mature love saga usually go hand in hand with an obvious comedic sentiment that forgives any flaws or misdemeanours in the actions of the older protagonist. In 1989’s Shirley Valentine, say, the middle-aged heroine played by Pauline Collins was mocked for having a mid-life crisis, complete with one last fling in the sun. Things improved for the older actor with the more recent The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011) exploring the relationship dramas of a bunch of retired Brits, but it was still cloaked in humour. The striking difference with Chilean writer-director Sebastian Lelio’s engaging and often dark Gloria is how the lead role of the same name could be played by any aged woman. Also, how events unfold very matter of fact in navigating the rocky relationship scene – the comedy is subjective and subliminal, if at all. With the suggested ‘punishing’ of the sexually active female in film theory, protagonist Gloria is rung through the mill, both psychically and mentally, often without pity, regardless of her later years. Set in Santiago, divorced 58-year-old Gloria (Paulina García), an attractive, free-spirited older woman and mother and grandmother, visits the middle-aged singles scene regularly in the hope of finding a man she can have a relationship with. While out one night she meets and clicks with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a former naval officer and extreme sports park owner who seems to be the answer. However, secrets and lies and family commitments mar the fledgling romance and the commitment Gloria so craves. It’s perhaps another prime example of how more advanced-thinking foreign-language films are compared to their Hollywood counterparts in depicting older women as sexually active and desirable, as well as prone to the same mistakes as younger females. As a figurehead, Gloria is probably more ‘in tune’ with the present-day mature generation than a lot of screen characters. Hence, it’s a dynamic watch. Lelio has given us a multi-layered and totally genuine character in Gloria, so much so, we continually empathise with her throughout, however irresponsible her behaviour might be to some. She is a dichotomy of curious good and bad attributes making for a highly engaging character driving the film. Events have a real-time lapse to them too, so we can paused almost and savour her every expression at any one moment, then be surprised by her more erratic responses in what seems like self-destructive behaviour at times. Chilean TV actress García plays Gloria with a knowing stance, exuding effortless confidence, independence and approachability while tapping into Gloria’s vulnerable, sensitive and somewhat complex nature. She keeps us guessing at her next move, often thrilling us. This is beautifully summed up in Gloria’s revenge scene that again emphasises the contradictions to her nature as she tries to establish domestic bliss in what is essentially solitary existence post motherhood. Indeed, the sense of remoteness is another strong factor in us bonding with Gloria, and Lelio expertly addresses this and opens it up to any age’s understanding in these modern times. The ending celebrates the character while simultaneously feels a little deflating and a touch contrived. It’s arguable just how such a film should conclude, considering nothing can be resolved in the timescale, except to suggest Gloria is a survivour. Lelio also challenges men of a particular age; it’s almost two-dimensional and derogatory in depiction, suggesting a weaker gender at play. That said the writer-director, never allowing caricatures to take hold, treats the status quo with intelligence and irony in the proceedings. In this respect, Gloria is a thought-provoking and immensely satisfying piece of filmmaking to catch."
"Oct 8, 2013",POSITIVE," Gloria (Paulina Garcia) is a 58-year-old divorcee who has been on her own for 13 years in a small apartment where the walls are so thin she can hear the screaming of a drug user upstairs who sounds like he's having a bad trip. Gloria works in an office and tries to keep in touch with her grown children: a son Pedro (Diego Fontecilla) who is raising a small infant on his own and a daughter Ana (Fabiola Zamora) who teaches a yoga class. Whereas other women Gloria's age are spending much of their free time looking after their grandchildren, she has not had to do this. Instead on weekends, you can find her at a Santiago dance club with plenty of men her age. Gloria makes eye contact with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), and they really connect on the dance floor. It's as if they have been waiting for each other for a long time. He is very much taken with her enthusiasm and joy even though these qualities might be missed by others thanks to her very large glasses. Rodolfo has only been divorced for a year and is still immersed in looking after and financially supporting his two grown daughters and ex-wife. He seems to have plenty of money as the owner of a small fun park where customers can do bungee jumps and battle each other with paint-guns. In a moment of openness with Gloria, he shares the transformation of his life after gastric bypass surgery and a large weight loss. Although Rodolfo can bring Gloria to tears by reading her love poetry and they both enjoy their lively sex together, he shows impatience and the need to be in control of their relationship when she takes him to meet her family at her son's birthday party. When Gloria has too much to drink and really gets caught up in looking at old family pictures with her ex-husband (Alejandro Goic), Rodolfo walks out on her. She is devastated and humiliated. After frequent apologies for his selfishness at the birthday party, these two middle-agers get together again for a weekend at a fancy resort. The test comes when one of his daughters calls and reports that her mother has been badly injured by walking through a plate glass window. Gloria wants him to let go of his attachment to the past and to be truly present in his loving relationship with her. Gloria is a superb film about the important role of emotional intelligence in mature intimate relationships. Sebastian Lelio directs this Chilean drama and has co-written the screenplay with Gonzalo Maza. It portrays the desperate loneliness of Gloria, the co-dependence of Rodolfo, and the need for both of them to change their ways in order to deepen their relationship. Paulina Garcia puts in a rich and robust performance as Gloria. We salute this poignant and heart affecting film for its fresh and keen insights into the vulnerabilities of middle-age love which is never what we expect or imagine it to be. There are many different kinds of lonely people. Not all of them live in social isolation. Gloria is an energetic and enthusiastic single woman who loves drinking and dancing the night away at clubs and bars.
Sometimes she is lucky and connects with a stranger; othertimes, she returns alone to her empty apartment. A stray cat reinforces her inner feelings of sadness. Gloria has learned that playfulness and humor combined make a good antidote to loneliness. That is why she's willing to take a quick look at laugh therapy. She also derives pleasure from her yoga class and singing pop love songs in the car. Her positive attitude works like a charm with Rodolfo, a newly divorced man. Their intimate relationship begins to bloom and she is enchanted having him read poetry to her in bed. The roadblock which stands in the way of their new life together in love is his ties to his ex-wife and daughter. And so Gloria is forced to begin again. She returns to the dance floor and lets the music lift her spirits and carry her away. Dancing is her leap of faith — a truly heroic act after such disappointment."
"Oct 7, 2013",POSITIVE," Sebastián Lelio’s Gloria initially seems like any other study of a midlife crisis, one of those easily marketable art-house films that appeals to the older middlebrow set. And this Chilean-Spanish drama will likely be sold as such, given its accessibility and how thoughtfully it portrays common experiences of middle-aged life, like getting over a divorce, allowing one’s grown-up children to live their own lives, and searching for new love. But Gloria has more to offer than simply bankable appeal. The 58-year-old titular protagonist (Paulina García) is a complicated female character, and the film does much to normalize her sexual appetite in a way that never feels self-righteous or explicitly political. With its compelling and original approach to its romance narrative, coupled with García’s nuanced and intuitive performance, the film delicately balances an entire octave of emotions. The story opens with Gloria at a nightclub, and immediately we get the sense that life, at least for middle-to-upper-class Chileans, definitely doesn’t end at 50. Love and lust is in the air, and Gloria is there to get her fair share, patiently and occasionally impatiently awaiting someone worthwhile to show up. There’s never the sense that she’s here to be swept off her feet or looking for a one-night-stand—either, or something in between, would work just fine. Many scenes here depict a woman with an atypical grace, who can easily enjoy the experience of nightclubs simply by being present, a divorcee who still sings love ballads while listening to the radio in her car. Gloria is unabashed and comfortable with her sensuality, veering on hedonistic, though these tendencies don’t prevent her from becoming more serious with the right person. The film should be noted for its narrative expediency, because it quickly introduces a seeming Mr. Right in Rodolfo (Sergio Hernández), a bumbling introvert more recently divorced than Gloria, and it shows. While he quickly falls head over heels in love with Gloria, reading her poetry and randomly kissing her in moments of passion, he’s still chained to an emotionally needy family, two daughters and an ex-wife who call on him incessantly. Rodolfo is always quick to answer the phone when they call, a repeated phenomenon that wears down Gloria, who doesn’t want her fun interrupted (fittingly, he owns an arcade park and their first few dates take place there, serving as vicarious throwbacks to youthful gratification). When he quietly and inexplicably leaves her family’s party, Gloria feels embarrassed and scorned, and though her anger is justified, Lelio and Gonzalo Maza’s screenplay underscores her stubbornness and unwillingness to understand his conflicted position. Such scenes, like a later one that depicts Gloria and Rodrigo’s doomed getaway makeup trip, in which an abandoned Gloria ends up getting too drunk, having sex with a stranger on a beach, and waking up without her wallet, reveal her vulnerability. Her faults are deemed if not as lovable as her strengths, then clearly as human. This includes her capacity for practical humor, depicted in one wickedly funny scene in which she uses paintball guns to exact revenge. Gloria leaves analysis of the protagonist up to the viewer, who may decide she’s self-respecting or arrogant, maybe both. Gloria herself occasionally indulges in fleeting moments of reflection, notably in a final scene in which she comes across a white peacock. The strange and serene creature looks as surprised to see its own self-image as Gloria."
"Sep 5, 2013",POSITIVE," Directed by Asghar Farhadi, The Past follows Bérénice Bejo's Marie as she attempts to juggle her current lover (Tahar Rahim's Samir) and her visiting ex-husband (Ali Mosaffa's Ahmad) over the course of a few especially eventful days. As was the case with Farhadi's previous film, 2011's A Separation, The Past progresses at a deliberate (and palpably methodical) pace that heightens its atmosphere of authenticity - with the movie's slice-of-life feel perpetuated by an opening half hour that's almost entirely devoid of context (ie the viewer is forced to  piece things together mostly through inference and snippets of dialogue). The uniformly strong performances - Bejo is, in particular, quite good here - go a long way towards keeping things interesting even through the film's more overtly uneventful stretches, and there's little doubt that The Past grows more and more engrossing as it progresses into its revelation-heavy midsection. It's just as clear, however, that the movie begins to demonstrably run out of steam once it passes a certain point, as Farhadi, to an increasingly exasperating degree, stresses the hopelessly uninvolving circumstances surrounding a periphery figure's life-threatening medical condition - with the filmmaker's procedural-like sensibilities ultimately transforming The Past into an especially dull episode of Law and Order or CSI. The inclusion of several incongruously over-the-top instances of melodrama certainly doesn't help matters, and it does, as a result, become virtually impossible to work up any interest in or sympathy for the various characters - which ultimately cements The Past's place as a sporadically intriguing, undeniably well acted, yet terminally misguided piece of work.  Ralph Steadman is perhaps best known as the artist responsible for illustrating many of Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo news stories, and For No Good Reason is  a career-spanning documentary that covers Steadman's early days  through to his collaborations with Thompson, William S. Burroughs, and Terry Gilliam (among others). There's little doubt that For No Good Reason stands as a solid primer to Steadman's body of work, and yet it's just as clear that the movie never quite becomes as engrossing or even interesting as one might've expected - as filmmaker Charlie Paul has employed a haphazard structure that grows increasingly frustrating as time progresses (ie the movie seems to contain an almost equal amount of fascinating and pointless stretches). Paul's decision to pepper the proceedings with animated stretches, which surely sounded good on paper, proves relatively disastrous, with the distracting and superficial nature of such moments standing in sharp contrast to the effectiveness of comparatively simple sequences (eg Steadman creates an abstract painting from scratch). It does, as a result, become increasingly difficult to care about any of this, and by the time the movie arrives at Steadman's political activism, the viewer has all but entirely checked out - which is a shame, really, given the massive potential of the subject matter. An extremely low-key character study, Gloria follows a fiftysomething divorcée (Paulina García's Gloria Cumplido) as she attempts to shake up her run-of-the-mill existence by embarking on a relationship with a recently-separated man named Rodolfo
(Sergio Hernández). Filmmaker Sebastián Lelio has infused Gloria with an exceedingly subdued feel that proves an appropriate match for his and Gonzalo Maza's uneventful screenplay, with the movie's watchable atmosphere perpetuated primarily by García's riveting  turn as the title protagonist - as the actress steps into the shoes of her mousy character to a degree and completeness that is, from start to finish, utterly engrossing. The deliberateness of the pace is, however, occasionally a problem; García's stellar performance remains a highlight, yet the actress is essentially asked to carry the proceedings and, despite the effectiveness of her work here, Gloria does suffer from a few less-than-captivating stretches (eg there's a long sequence wherein Gloria attends a dinner party). The film's second half, in which a series of personal difficulties start to take their toll on Gloria, undoubtedly fares somewhat better than the first, while  the upbeat, feel-good finale  goes a long way towards  ensuring that Gloria concludes on a high note - yet it's ultimately clear that the movie is never entirely able to rise up to the level of García's consistently striking central performance (ie this is essentially nothing more than a sporadically engaging actor's showcase). Written and directed by  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Don Jon follows affable New Jersey bartender Jon Martello (Gordon-Levitt) as he's forced to put aside his womanizing ways after falling for a beautiful local named Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett
Johansson). Gordon-Levitt, making his filmmaking debut here, has infused the early part of Don Jon with a propulsive and thoroughly watchable feel that's heightened by the writer/director's  charismatic turn as the central character, with the dynamic visuals and strong supporting cast, which includes Glenne Headly, Brie Larson, and Tony Danza (!), perpetuating the movie's impressively engrossing atmosphere. It's only as the narrative settles into its rather conventional midsection that one's interest begins to wane, as Gordon-Levitt  suffuses this stretch of the proceedings with a series of  traditional romcom elements (ie there's a consistent  emphasis on the questionable pairing of Gordon Levitt and Johansson's respective characters). The movie's final half hour, which is devoted primarily to Don's efforts at battling an addiction to online porn and his unlikely friendship with Julianne Moore's Esther, feels just as shaky and underdeveloped, with, especially, the Moore subplot, despite a typically fine performance from the actress, not faring nearly as well as one might've hoped (ie the trajectory of Don and Esther's relationship, from everything we know about the former, simply doesn't ring true). It's clear, too, that Don Jon suffers from a second half that just isn't as tightly-plotted as the opening half hour (ie it's kind of aimless), which ultimately cements the film's place as a sporadically electrifying yet altogether uneven directorial debut for Gordon-Levitt. A typically slow-moving drama from  François Ozon, Young & Beautiful follows rebellious teenager Isabelle (Marine Vacth) as she loses her virginity one summer and, a few months later, begins working as a call girl in Paris. It's an unabashedly salacious premise that's employed to consistently subdued effect by Ozon, with the movie's deliberately-paced opening half hour, which is devoted primarily to Isabelle's leisurely summertime exploits, demanding a fair amount of patience from the viewer. The surprisingly engaging atmosphere, then, is due mostly to Ozon's strong direction and a seriously impressive central performance from Vacth; there is, however, little doubt that Young & Beautiful improves considerably once the action shifts to Paris, as the viewer is, to an increasingly prominent degree, drawn into Isabelle's fascinating (yet almost inexplicable) double life. (Ozon doesn't, interestingly enough, reveal the character's reasons for prostituting herself until well past the halfway mark.) It's not until the narrative takes a dramatic turn at around the one-hour point that Young & Beautiful begins to slowly-but-surely wear out its welcome, as the decidedly meandering nature of the movie's final stretch ensures that the viewer has checked out long before the end credits roll - with the only real respite arriving in the form of Charlotte Rampling's late-in-the-game appearance as the wife of one of Isabelle's former clients (ie the actress provides the film with a jolt of much-needed electricity). The end result is a watchable yet uneven effort from Ozon, with the movie ultimately fitting right into the filmmaker's almost uniformly passable yet underwhelming body of work. Directed by Ralph Fiennes, The Invisible Woman details the secretive (yet scandalous) relationship between Charles Dickens (Fiennes) and a 17-year-old actress named Nelly Ternan (Felicity Jones). It's clear immediately that Fiennes isn't looking to reinvent the wheel here, as The Invisible Woman, for the most part, unfolds exactly as one might've surmised based on the  premise - with the movie's less-than-engrossing atmosphere compounded by an unconscionably deliberate pace and a narrative that's almost comically underdeveloped. (Fiennes' dynamic performance remains one of the only overtly positive attributes within the otherwise interminable proceedings.) The viewer is, for the most part, forced to wait in vain for something of consequence to occur, and yet Fiennes, working from Abi Morgan's screenplay, shows little interest in offering up any elements of interest and instead emphasizes the characters' plotless musings and exploits - with the astonishing lack of passion or chemistry between the two protagonists compounding the movie's relentlessly stodgy vibe. It's worth noting, too, that The Invisible Woman only grows more and more uninvolving as it progresses, and there's little doubt that the  endless final stretch just isn't able to pack the tearjerking punch that Fiennes has clearly intended - which ultimately confirms the movie's place as a hopeless waste of time that has little to offer even the most ardent of Dickens fans."
