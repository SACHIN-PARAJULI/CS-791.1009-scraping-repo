"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE," It’s pretty much confirmed with “King of the Monsters” that the producers are going for a monster universe fitted for the more general audience. Director Michael Dougherty is back in this sequel to 2014’s bold “Godzilla” that pretty much establishes the kaiju movie universe for this era. Established as “Titans” the movie monsters from the classic Godzilla movie series all make appearances in some form or another, and boy are they terrifying. While the original monsters were all pretty scary, the way that director Dougherty visualizes them is just downright mind blowing. The monsters are all specters and reapers of the apocalypse, all unmatched in their power that are back to basically reclaim the planet for themselves. Five years after the end of “Godzilla,” the crypto-zoological agency Monarch and its scientists face off against even more giant monsters like Godzilla, including the mysterious Mothra, and the powerful three-headed behemoth known as Ghidorah. After a great loss five years earlier in the first attacks, Dr Emma Russell has dedicated her life to attempting to understand the nature of the monster who killed her son. On the other side of the world, her husband Mark is also working to understand the monsters, while also working to fix his fractured relationship with his teenage daughter Madison. Emma and Madison are suddenly taken hostage by a group of eco-terrorists headed by Jonah Alan, as Mark must locate his family and retrieve the Orca, a scientific gadget created by Emma which could help stop the impending monster Armageddon. Dougherty and co. spend a lot of time establishing the entire motivation behind the monsters, as well as exploring interesting methods for integrating all of these monsters for one big throwdown. Shockingly the monster that is depicted as one of the most destructive is Rodan. I never thought Rodan would be so imposing on screen, but the moment it awakens and begins unleashing a whirlwind of terror across the country, it’s pretty incredible. The way the movie envisions all of these monsters, makes them absolutely relentless forces of nature that basically serve their purpose. Mothra in particular is depicted as a beneficial being meant to keep the Titans in line, while Godzilla is something of a savior that is neither a friend nor a foe to mankind. For the most part I enjoyed the world building as Legendary studios props up so much meta-mythology around the monsters involving organizations researching the Titans, and prophecies about the end of the world, as well as the ultimate battles of the gargantuan beasts. Dougherty really should be commended for great direction and staging of some wonderful action sequences. He has a clear love for the Kaiju gallery Toho conceived, even if the movie suffers in other respects. “Godzilla King of the Monsters” tends to go on way too long in the tooth and spends too much time with human characters that aren’t really as engaging as I hoped they’d be. Even with Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, and Millie Bobby Brown leading the pack, the massive group of humans working to battle the giant monsters never garnered any of my interest, nor did their sub-plots about a family death, and divorce, et al. It’s by no means the fault of the aforementioned cast members (and the other impressive supporting players like Bradley Whitford, Ken Watanabe, Charles Dance, and Zhang Ziyi respectively) as they trot out impressive performances in anything they’re in. I just wish we’d been given more appealing protagonists with better motivations. Nevertheless, “King of the Monsters” is a blast that works on its own, and as a chapter in a larger movie universe (Titanverse?) that pays off quite well."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE," The MonsterVerse has turned into one of the more consistently enjoyable franchises in all of movies, as Godzilla, King Kong and all of the fellow monsters rampage against each other for global supremacy.  Well, y’know, there are also lots of human subplots, but we’re never really there for the people on the ground. No, we’re there to see a clash of the titans for the ages, and the four films we’ve gotten so far have all been decently fun at worst and stunning spectacles at best.  Ahead of this week’s latest installment Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, let’s rank the movies in the MonsterVerse and see how these movies stack up against each other in the grand scheme of the kaiju universe.  A riff on 1970s Vietnam films, Kong: Skull Island gave the Monsterverse’s proper introduction to King Kong and sent its human subjects on a terror ride through the jungles of a mysterious island with lots of monsters to battle. The monster action was actually pretty thrilling, but the film doesn’t do some of its main characters a lot of favors with the script. However, John C. Reilly nearly steals the whole movie as a stranded World War II soldier who helps the main cast navigate the terrain.  Godzilla and Kong finally got a chance to battle each other in 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, a psychedelic brouhaha for the ages across cosmic landscapes and unsuspecting cities. Sure, the human elements can detract from the mayhem, but the kaiju battles are so inspired and genuinely eye-popping that it’s hard to complain. This one might be the most pure fun of all four.  While the film just could not live up to that absolutely sensational first trailer, it’s still a very compelling monster film with some of the better human characters in the series. Godzilla taking on so many notable villains from the Toho history of the character was so cool in a modern landscape, and finally getting Mothra in the series to help the big lizard out was an added treat. The scope and melodramatics of this one meshed really well with the unfiltered desire to let these beasts go at it.  Gareth Edwards is one of the best filmmakers of his generation to understand scale, and his Godzilla film is one of the better monster films of the last decade. It feels like something bigger than you, one that pits pitiful humans against dueling forces of nature beyond comprehension. Bryan Cranston delivers the best human performance in any of these films by a mile, and Edwards’ big battle scenes feel ripped out of an apocalyptic nightmare. It’s a stunner in every sense of the word. "
"Mar 23, 2024",NEUTRAL," It’s too bad that Godzilla: King of the Monsters features far sludgier CGI than the two previous MonsterVerse installments—2014’s Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island—because the muddy imagery fails to capture the grandeur of the movie’s ambitious lineup of classic creatures: Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. Bathed in murky blues and bleary rain, none of them register with the awesomeness they deserve, to say nothing of the title “hero,” this time defending his turf against the new titans. The human story—involving a tug of war between two divorced scientists (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) over their teen daughter (Millie Bobby Brown)—is uninvolving to say the least, though I did appreciate how the various expeditions they’re on treat Godzilla and company like specimens: analyzing acoustics, measuring vitals, tracking locations. There are moments when Godzilla: King of the Monsters resembles a fantasy version of a National Geographic documentary—except those tend to deliver far more stunning visuals without any special effects whatsoever."
"Jul 24, 2023",NEGATIVE," Synopsis: The new story follows the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species - thought to be mere myths - rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity's very existence hanging in the balance. King of the Monsters is the sequel to 2014’s Godzilla, and the third movie in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, which also includes Kong: Skull Island. In 2021, Godzilla vs. Kong is scheduled to be released. As some of you might know, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2019. Not because I expected it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story with fully-developed characters who I would immensely care about. I was incredibly excited because it’s freaking Godzilla and from the few images that I had seen, it looked absolutely stunning. I didn’t need an Oscar-worthy screenplay or amazing performances. I just wanted a decent and logical (this last word is important) narrative with reasonable characters, and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other. So, my expectations were neither complex nor as high as some other people might have. Unfortunately, I left the theater extremely disappointed. I can’t deny the impeccable VFX and the infinite amount of wallpaper-worthy images spread across the entire film. Some scenes are filled with jaw-dropping cinematography, astonishingly gorgeous monsters, and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat. However, when the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are so far away from even remotely working, there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster. I wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding Game Of Thrones, and I will stand by it. I’m always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills, but if I have to choose between a technically seamless movie, and a film with a fantastic story and fully-developed characters, I have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice. Ultimately, that’s the huge problem here. The screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes I’ve seen in the last few years. Characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly. Generally, a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist, a comic-relief guy, a duo of bantering personalities, or a military general who always wants to attack something, even though everyone knows it’s not the most intelligent decision. King of the Monsters has all of these types and more! More?! Seriously, Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary, useless, stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights, turning them into minutes of complete boredom. I yawned during a Godzilla blockbuster. Yawned. How sad is that?! I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards 2014’s Godzilla. At the time, the most common complaint was that there wasn’t enough Godzilla in it. Most of the characters were well-written, despite that some could have been more fleshed out. King of the Monsters is (kind of) the other way around: there are dozens of monsters and bone-crushing, titanic fights, but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters. In the first installment, even though I also wanted more Godzilla, when he actually shows up, I was so freaking excited! Since I had to wait for the third act to watch the Titans fight, the build-up that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy. This sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written. There are a lot of fight sequences, and I wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes. The dilemma is that those periods need to exist, making the whole thing look like a double-edged sword that the director is trying to avoid. On one hand, you can’t have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively, otherwise, these will lose impact over time and become monotonous, so you need to spend time with the horribly-written human characters. On the other hand, you can’t have dumb characters with unclear motivations on-screen for long periods, otherwise, the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed, so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again, hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes. King of the Monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other. No one wants to have back-to-back fights because they’ll lose the impactful energy, but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to exposition-heavy PowerPoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name. I can’t even remember the main characters’ names, and I watched the movie yesterday! I can’t blame the cast, everyone gives good performances. Millie Bobby Brown (Madison Russell) continues her path to become one of Hollywood’s biggest stars (in less than 10 years, she’ll have an Oscar in her hands, I guarantee you that). Kyle Chandler (Mark Russell) does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script, and Ken Watanabe (Dr. Ishiro Serizawa) is the only one who delivered a solid performance AND had a suitable character (fruit of the previous film). Vera Farmiga (Dr. Emma Russell) is connected to the worst character of the movie (atrociously irrational decisions made by Emma), and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I’m going to have to deduct some points for the score, sound, and script issues..."
"Aug 21, 2022",POSITIVE," In 2014 director Gareth Edwards brought Godzilla back to the big screen. His monster reboot was the 30th film in the near 70-year-old Godzilla franchise and the first film in Warner Brothers’ interconnected MonsterVerse. I loved the movie and its slow-burning, old-school, creature-feature vibe. Relatively new director Michael Dougherty (“Krampus”) takes the reins of the sequel “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” and delivers a movie quite different from its predecessor. The slow-burn is gone and the large-scaled Kaiju action is front and center. And where the Edwards’ film could also be sold as a stand-alone movie, this one feels very much a part of something bigger and broader. I wouldn’t call this a spoiler but the last film ended with Godzilla sinking back into the ocean after leveling San Francisco in a fight with an earth-threatening monster. Jump ahead five years. Paleobiologists Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) lost their young son during the destruction of San Francisco. They have since divorced under the stress of loss leaving their 12-year-old daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) caught in the middle. While Mark has been off the radar Emma has been working with the super-secret shadow organization called Monarch. They’ve been monitoring not just the movements of Godzilla but the locations of numerous other monsters (called Titans) scattered across the globe in various forms of hibernation. Even more, Emma has constructed a device called ORCA that emits a sonar pulse which can either calm or rile the Titans. This catches the attention of a devious eco-terrorist group, Mark is drawn into the chaos, and a lot of big monsters rise up. The human dynamic is interesting in a variety of ways. The Russell family drama is easily the most intimate, but it’s the broader human story that’s most compelling. As Dougherty himself describes it to Entertainment Weekly, “The world is reacting to Godzilla in the same way we would react to any other terrifying incident, in that we are overreacting.” We see mankind responding to the monsters impulsively – out of fear and uncertainty. And the question becomes how far can humanity’s intelligence and ingenuity take them in the face of such mighty threats? All of this is explored through a fine ensemble – Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford, David Strathairn, Zhang Ziyi, among others. They all fall in nicely with a script that hearkens back (in a measured way) to the classic Toho Studio films. We get countless reaction shots, stunned utterances, and quick quips. Some may not like what they’re going for, but I got a kick out of it. And I appreciate how the film steers clear of drawn out exposition and loads of scientific mumbo-jumbo. A handful of characters do get pushed to the side but that’s okay because they do exactly what they need to do – service the story and keep it moving towards what we really are there to see – the monsters! And the Titans really are the showcases. In addition to Godzilla we get classic Toho creations Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. The creature designs are stunning and their epic-scaled clashes are breathtaking spectacles. The special effects, Lawrence Sher’s crafty cinematography, and top-notch sound design makes for some truly satisfying and immersive Kaiju mayhem. I can already hear the pushback from those wanting more human drama in a movie about massive earth-moving monsters. I actually like the way they unpack the human story amid a breathless array of action. And I appreciate how they add layers of intriguing mythology without drowning us in babble. And I can also hear those wanting more of Godzilla on the screen. There are indeed huge segments where we don’t see him. But I was fine with it because his presence never leaves our mind. While things were playing out in front of me, I kept thinking “but Godzilla”. So it makes sense to me that many have dismissed “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” the way they have. But at the same time it saddens me. Michael Dougherty has delivered a Godzilla movie that is unquestionably action-heavy, probably too much for those with no affection for the classic creature-features. But while the film is tipping its hat to its roots, it’s also subtly holding a mirror to modern society. I feel many have missed that element which is unfortunate. But when that human detail is combined with some of the best big monster action ever put on screen, all I can say is ‘Long Live the King’. It’s a ton of fun. Unfortunately it didn’t get the best reception (which I obviously disagree with), but hopefully it’ll do good enough to keep the series going.  Can’t wait to read your take on it. I’m with you, the mediocre reception has really surprised me. It was a great time at the theater and exactly what I like about big summer movies. I also love how it doesn’t shy away from its roots. I was really surprised that this movie was given such a rough ride really . For me it was amazing epic monster bash . The human element was there enough to connect all the dots and the fight scenes were off the wall good. The kid in me that relished seeing all theses iconic giants brought to life and although there was much going on, I never thought it lost its narrative nor the human element .  Plus I liked the fact that didn’t over use Godzilla  it made his appearance more epic .After re-watching the first one before seeing this one , I also have come to enjoy that one even more .I always liked it but have rethought a few of my concerns with it after recent viewings .  I was a a bit disappointed in hows this one has been received . Perhaps it was too long after last one but since they are knee deep in Godzilla vs Kong , we are assured of at least one more . Solid 9 out of 10 from me and one hearty roar for the king of monsters . YES! You absolutely nail it. I’m really wondering what people’s expectations were for this. I found there to be more story depth and satisfying mythology building than I ever expected. And then the monster action. The film packs some truly epic sequences that my son and I absolutely loved. I can’t wait to see it again. Hate to be a naysayer, but I could not stand this movie. For me, the problem was a huge technical one, I couldn’t see it. It was all too dark and creatures were far too obscured. I just couldn’t make heads or tails of what was on the screen. You say the creature designs are stunning, but I simply couldn’t tell. This made it way too frustrating for me to enjoy. My full review should be up tomorrow, but that’s the gist of it. Oh bummer. Hate to hear that. If that were the case for me I would certainly feel the same way. For me it was often breathtaking. Thankfully the screen I saw it on was great which definitely provided a better visual experience. I might check it out on TV though I missed the last film version though I really want to see the rest of the entire Japanese series. The first movie really got this particular version off on the right foot. It was too slow for some but I thought the slow-boil was just right for that film. This movie is probably too action-packed for some. Me, I loved the big action and it felt in line with the story this one was telling. Hope to see it again before it leaves theaters. Love your positive take on a movie that’s just gotten SLAMMED. Ugh. Mind you I still haven’t seen it but you’ve reconfirmed that this will be a great time for me. I am literally baffled by the bad press. I don’t know, maybe ‘dismissive’ is a better word. I found it to be an absolute blast, full of old-school (and nostalgic) monster action. I think it dodges so many of the potholes that can often make a movie like this a real drag. For me it almost felt yanked out of a time capsule but with a stunning new coat of visual effects paint. I was lukewarm on 2014’s Godzilla, but everyone I’ve talked to about King of the Monsters say this one straight up rocked! Admittedly, there are few movies I’m excited for post-Endgame (LOVED Endgame, but it’s a lot of movie and a lot of hype to come down from). This one, however, seems right up my alley. I really enjoyed Godzilla (2014) but King of the Monsters is a much different movie. The monster action is simply fantastic and I would definitely recommend seeing it on the big screen. It was even more fun watching it with my son. Hope you get a chance to check it out. Haha…I know same here. I saw it in theaters on its opening night with the D-Box seating (the seat moves and vibrates), which was awesome, especially with the movie’s action scenes. Yeah, pity.  I enjoyed the higher stakes, action & premise – and the discovery of Atlantis!  (Even if they had to destroy it to save the world.)"
"Mar 2, 2022",NEGATIVE," Sometimes when watching an action-packed finale in a Hollywood spectacle, the oversaturation of CGI causes your eyes to glass over and your mind to numb into a sleepy state. Somehow, the filmmakers have spent hundreds of millions on special effects, animating impossible creatures, superhero battles, alien invasions, and untold destruction, but none of it has the necessary emotion and energy to counteract our visual exhaustion or keep our attention. Certain blockbusters have this quality, where the third act descends into digital white noise, and the viewer cannot help but lose interest entirely. Competent Hollywood filmmakers know how to use CGI to enhance the material and impress their audience, whereas others resolve to throw endless computerized stimuli at the screen in the final battle and hope for the best. For that reason, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is exceptional; it’s an entire movie that functions as a relentless CGI assault on the viewer’s eyeballs, sustaining a heightened level of fireworks that would usually be reserved for the denouement. It carries on like this for the more-than-two-hour duration, and although initially diverting, it gradually wears the viewer down into a trancelike state of disinterest. Call it digital blindness, in the same way that snow blindness results from severe overexposure.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters is director Michael Dougherty’s bigger, louder, and more tiresome sequel to the 2014 reboot Godzilla, a movie that served its purpose blandly enough to earn some admiration for its technical competence and impressive cast (even though Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston played characters who died too soon). However, after a recent rewatch, my already lukewarm feelings about Godzilla have cooled. Not that it matters; most of the characters from the first movie have not returned for the follow-up—save for Sally Hawkins, in a thankless and throwaway appearance, and Ken Watanabe, who is forced to deliver fortune cookie jokes. The sequel also boasts a roster of recognizable names and faces, not that any of them have anything interesting to do. Each actor has been typecast in a familiar way, making it easy on screenwriters Dougherty and Zach Shields, who concentrate less on the human fodder than the enormous zoological specimens on display.  The action starts when, in the destruction caused by Godzilla in 2014, parents Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler lose a child, leaving their marriage in shambles and their teenage daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) in the middle. Five years later, Farmiga’s character, Dr. Emma Russell, works with Monarch, the secret agency that monitors humongous animals like Godzilla, known as Titans. Secretly, Dr. Russell also works with an eco-terrorist, played by the ever-villainous Charles Dance, and they plan to awaken the hibernating Titans to wipe out most of humanity and bring about ecological balance. It’s a standard “the Earth is dying, and humanity is the disease” argument popular among Hollywood villains these days (see Kingsman: The Secret Service, Inferno, or Avengers: Infinity War). Meantime, Monarch and the U.S. military try to stop Russell’s plan: Hawkins, Watanabe, Zhang Ziyi, and Bradley Whitford are the scientists; David Strathairn and O’Shea Jackson Jr. represent the soldiers; Chandler is the concerned Titan-whisperer who just wants his daughter back; and Thomas Middleditch provides the comic relief.  Dougherty approaches digital blindness in the opener with Mothra (a ten-story moth that spits sticky webbing), and he continues punishing us with CGI for the duration. Every major sequence—from the first appearance of Godzilla to the Antarctic emergence of the movie’s main baddie, Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon from space—takes place in some manner of visually muddy, inclement weather conditions. Battles between the Titans, such as the first clash between Godzilla and Ghidorah amid an oppressive snowstorm, are a struggle to watch because they’re so murky and obscured. These colossal monsters tangle underwater, in a hurricane, in a burning city, in the rain, or atop an exploded volcano. Along with the shaky camerawork, it’s almost as though the filmmakers don’t want us to make out what’s happening. Moreover, in each location, the image looks as though it’s been run through color filters (mostly blue, gray, or orange), giving everything a digital flatness and hued sameness that is monotonous to behold for any length of time. And while the global plot leaps around several locations the world over, somehow, as the grand finale unfolds, it does so underwhelmingly on the ruins of Fenway Park. Godzilla: King of the Monsters also desperately wants to establish an expansive franchise, wherein 2014’s Godzilla takes place in the same cinematic universe as 2017’s Kong: Skull Island—all to create enthusiasm for the upcoming sequel Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020. Conspicuous references to “Kong” and “Skull Island” are meant to titillate fans and build anticipation for the inevitable meeting between the giant iguana-god and the gargantuan ape. But since Godzilla fights several Titans throughout this large-scale sequel, the notion of Godzilla coming to blows with just King Kong seems rather underwhelming. In any case, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has done an effective job of making larger-than-life creatures completely inert, and any popcorn-munching fun that might’ve come from such a show has been reduced to a dismissive shrug. The viewer watches in a perpetual state of numbness, consuming but not processing, oblivious to any attempt at story or theme because the movie’s primary concern is delivering a sensory explosion—but we experience only the drowsy effects of digital blindness."
"Sep 29, 2021",NEGATIVE,"Strong action, weak dialogue unfortunately."
"Mar 6, 2021",NEGATIVE," Directed by Michael Dougherty, Godzilla: King of the Monsters follows an assortment of one-dimensional characters, including Millie Bobby Brown’s Madison, Kyle Chandler’s Mark, and Vera Farmiga’s Emma, as they race to prevent a series of building-sized monsters from destroying the planet. Filmmaker Dougherty, working from a script written with Zach Shields, delivers a predominantly tedious disaster that strikes all the wrong notes right from the get-go, as the movie boasts (or suffers from) an exceedingly, distractingly slick sensibility that’s reflected in its myriad of less-than-substantive elements – with this especially true of the picture’s uniformly underwhelming and incoherent action sequences. (Such moments, rendered entirely with computers, are about as convincing and compelling as a third-rate video game cutscene.) And although the movie is fleetingly tolerable when focused on the exploits of its impressively eclectic human cast, which includes David Strathairn, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, and Charles Dance, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is increasingly dominated by dimly-lit set-pieces that, perhaps inevitably, pave the way for an interminable second half that’s capped off with an astonishingly tedious final battle – with the end result a very expensive-looking flop that seems unlikely to please even the most indiscriminate of viewers."
"Feb 18, 2021",NEGATIVE,"  Godzilla is one of those movie creatures who will never truly die. First dreamed up in Japan in 1954 at the height of the Atomic Age, the nuclear-powered monster has unleashed destruction in more than 30 Japanese productions and three American productions, including the new Godzilla: King of the Monsters.  Taking place five years after the events in 2014’s Godzilla, the basic gist of the film is that a group named Monarch is tasked with studying and keeping at bay the group of 17 monsters that have been found around the globe. A rival group believes the monsters should be released, letting “nature” take its course however it may. I’ll give you one guess as to which group wins that battle.  As a result, monsters like the three-headed dragon King Ghidorah, giant moth Mothra, and pterodactyl-esque Rodan proceed to wreak havoc as only giant monsters can. It’s up to the movie’s plucky group of humans to bring an end to the havoc, and this time they’ll need the help of Godzilla in order to do so.  No one goes into a Godzilla movie expecting high art, but it’s still stunning how incoherent the movie truly is. The plot, such as it is, devolves into a rambling mess almost from minute one. That leaves the epic clashes between the monsters to carry the day, but even those are just a mish-mash of special effects where it’s next to impossible to tell what’s going on until the battle is over.  One of the only things keeping the film afloat is the general watchability of its laundry list of movie stars. The cast, which has five Oscar nominations among them, includes Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson, Jr., Anthony Ramos, and David Straithairn. All of them deserve better than the material they’re performing, but each of them also elevates it in one way or another.  Points do go to the filmmakers, led by writer/director Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields, for keeping the visible human death toll to a minimum. Action films too often wantonly destroy cities with seemingly no regard for the thousands of deaths that destruction would cause. In this film, two of the biggest scenes take place in Antarctica and in the middle of the ocean, taking humans mostly out of the equation.  Fun could also be had in watching the film by playing a “spot the reference” game. Only four monsters are truly showcased, but Godzilla superfans will no doubt relish either the appearances or allusions to other monsters from the franchise’s history. There are also a handful of references to Skull Island, which harkens back to 2017’s Kong: Skull Island and also hints at what’s to come in the already-forthcoming sequel, 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong.  It’s difficult to know what could make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a truly enjoyable film, but a start would be to focus on what everyone wants to see — the monsters — and leave the tricky plot mechanics for pretty much any other movie. 1.

"Jan 31, 2021",NEUTRAL," 
	From the get go “Rocketman,” the new Elton John jukebox biopic starring Taron Egerton, is more revealing and blunter than last year’s wildly popular but hagiographic Queen movie “Bohemian Rhapsody.” 
	Using flashbacks John, in full stage regalia, tells the story during an AA meeting. The movie and his tale begin with a revelation. “My name is Elton Hercules John and I’m an alcoholic, and a cocaine addict, and a sex addict and a bulimic and a shopaholic who has a problem with weed and anger management.” 
	Jumbled up in the mix are his terrible parents (Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh) — when he tells mom he’s gay she replies, “We will never be loved properly.”— his songwriting partner and muse Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), plus mounds of cocaine and hit songs used to punctuate the autobiographical action. Unlike “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” prudish attitude regarding Freddie Mercury’s homosexuality, “Rocketman” is out and proud, detailing John’s intimate relationship with partner and manager John Reid (Richard Madden). 
	Part “Moulin Rouge” by way of Ken Russell‘s “Tommy,” “Rocketman’s” startling opening number, “The Bitch is Back,” establishes that this is no warmed over “Bohemian Rhapsody” clone. It is a musical, not simply a musical biopic. Characters burst into song and Elton John songs are woven into the score. 
	Of course, music is a large part of the story. In the tradition of musical theatre “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” isn’t simply performed as one of John’s biggest hits, it’s moves the story forward as a duet between John and his ex-wife-to-be Renate Blauel (Celinde Schoenmaker). 
	To illustrate the transcendent nature of John’s star-making U.S. debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles director Dexter Fletcher gets metaphysical. As he plays “Crocodile Rock” both John and the audience levitate as if the music is taking them to a higher place. It’s trippy but wordlessly conveys the excitement of those early gigs. Add to that dancing Teddy Boys and flamboyant stage costumes and “Rocketman” feels Broadway bound. 
	The surreal storytelling effortlessly captures the heady, “Who wants to go to a party at Mama Cass‘s house?“ days of Elton John‘s early rise to stardom. Later, when John becomes a walking, singing rock n’ roll cliché director Dexter Fletcher amps up the style to portray the lifestyle the musician himself describes as “madness.” As such the biographical details are jumbled but “Rocketman” is more about capturing the moment not the exact details. 
	It is glittering eye candy but there is much humanity on display. In one remarkable scene Taron Egerton as John prepares for a live show with copious amounts of cocaine and wine. Staring into the mirror he tries to find his game face. From dead-eyed to sparkly in the flash we see the two sides of a man who once said, “I wish I was someone else.” 
	Egerton is a dead ringer for John, even if doesn’t sound like the voice from the classic recordings. In a performance that portrays the humanity and the outrageousness of someone who says, “I do not live my life in black-and-white,” Egerton grabs the singer’s essence. 
	Dick James, who advises John to “buy something flashy, put on a great show and don’t kill yourself with drugs,” add to the flavor of the piece but it is Egerton’s show. He can sing and dance but also mines the character to find an emotional resonance missing from many biopics. 
	“Rocketman” is sometimes a little too on the nose in its song selections. As Taupin, who will eventually call the singer his brother, and John bond the soundtrack plays “Border Song’s,” “He's my brother let us live in peace,” refrain. It’s a tad obvious for a movie that pushes buttons in terms of style, portrayal of sexuality and the flexibility of the biographical timelines. 
	By the film’s coda, however, it’s clear this is a tale of self-reckoning. There is much talk of reinvention, of “killing the person you were born to become the person you were born to be,” and as John becomes the person he is meant to be this very specific story’s “I’m Still Standing” message of resilience becomes universal. 
	If Blue Öyster Cult were to write the hit song “Godzilla” today they’d have to change the lyrics. In 1977 they sang, “Oh, no, there goes Tokyo.” Today the prehistoric sea monster has expanded his worldview beyond Asia and is now concerned with the entire planet. 
	The action in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” begins when paleo-biologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by terrorists. What would these bad people want with this Emma and Madison? Turns out Emma belongs to the crypto-zoological agency Monarch, a scientific watchdog group who study the Titans, creatures long believed to be myths. 
	Along with her ex-husband Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) Emma invented ""the Orca,” a device that allows communication with these mysterious beasts. More importantly, for the bad guys at least, it can also ""control them using their bioacoustics on a sonar level."" 
	As reluctant hero Mark teams with Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins) to save Emma and Madison from the kidnappers the Titans, Mothra, Rodan, the three-headed King Ghidorah and others, rise, threatening to destroy the earth. It’s the ultimate clash of the Titans as Godzilla (who now appears to have a beer belly) stomps in to level the playing field. Cue the Blue Öyster Cult: “Go, go, Godzilla (yeah).” 
	“Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is a remarkable achievement. It’s one of the most incomprehensible movies in the “Godzilla” franchise and that is really saying something. This story of restoring harmony to the world by releasing these angry monsters is pure codswallop and remember, this is the series that once devoted an entire movie to the king of the monsters teaching his dim-witted son how to how to control his atomic breath. 
	I’ll start with the script, and I only call it that because it contains words and was presumably written by people and not some kind of Kaiju-Auto-Cliché generating device. Ripe with pop psychology (“Moments of crisis can become moments of faith.” #Deep), horrible dialogue (“We’ve opened Pandora’s Box and there is no closing it!” #howmanytimeshaveweheardthat?) and several big emotional moments you won’t care about because the characters are walking, talking b-movie stereotypes, the movie is as clumsy as the script is dumb. 
	But you don’t go to a Godzilla movie for the human content; you go to see Titans battling it out and on that score “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” delivers. Unlike the 2014 Gareth Edwards reboot the new film wastes no time in introducing the radioactive monsters. We then sit through a bunch of pseudo-scientific pontification until the main event, the cage match between G-zil and his three-headed foe. In those moments the film improves, mostly because these characters don’t spout endless exposition about saving the world. They simply fight. It’s WrestleMania with fire-breathers and when they’re wreaking havoc it’s a good, fist-pumping time. 
	“Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is in 3D—Death, Destruction and Decibels—and has a certain kind of cheesy appeal. Watching the cast of good international actors try and play it straight as they muddle through the nonsense leading up to the climax is fun for a short time but next time I hope we get more actual monsters and less monstrous scripting. 
	He was once the single most successful American fashion designer ever, a man who counted Andy Warhol and Liza Minelli among his best friends. Studio 54 was his playground and he made Pill Box hats a sensation after designing one for Jackie Kennedy. He was Halston, a pioneer, nearly forgotten today. 
	From his early days as head milliner at Bergdorf Goodman to his stunning late 1960s success to his domination of the 1970s, he defined what was fashionable for the in-crowd. 
	“He took away the cage,” says former “Halstonette” Pat Cleveland. “He made things as though you didn’t really need the structure as much as you needed the woman.” 
	He designed luxurious pieces from single pieces of material, usually silk or chiffon, doing away with the extras like bows and zippers, creating form fitting clothes that, as Minelli says, “danced with you.” His clothes were for a modern time when women’s lives had changed and they were very popular. “You were free inside your clothes,” says model Karen Bjornson. 
	In 1973 he created a sensation presenting a runway show at the Palace of Versailles, which made him one of the first American designers to rock the world of Parisian couture. Minelli says the staid audience were wowed by the show. “They went bananas. All that energy and that joy and that wonder and that curiosity. That is America.” Years later he made similar inroads in China, breaking through in a way none of his contemporaries were able to emulate. 
	The ambitious designer’s company was growing as quickly as his acclaim. Money came in the form of business deals with Norton Simon holding company that also owned cosmetics giant Max Factor and a disastrous deal the down market JCPenney. One reporter labels the deal, ""from class to mass,"" and it marks the decline of Halston’s empire. 
	French filmmaker Frederic Tcheng is a specialist in the genre of fashion docs. He previously directed “Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel” and co-produced and co-edited the feature “Valentino: The Last Emperor.” It’s a world he understands and the kind of story he is expert in telling. For the most part his instincts don’t let him down here. He doles out the details, carefully weaving together the personal and professional story of a man whose career was destroyed by excess—he spent $2000 to $3000 a week on cocaine — and compromise. 
	Tcheng ‘s choice to use a framing device, an unnamed narrator played by fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, posing as an employee in the Halston archives feels like an unnecessary addition given the natural, dramatic rise and fall of the story. 
	“Halston” is part biography of a creative genius, part cautionary tale for artists who throw their hats in the ring with big corporations and lose everything, including the right to use their own name."
"Jan 29, 2021",NEGATIVE," In 2014, “Godzilla” left us with a San Francisco in smoldering ruins and the very injured title character returning to his mysterious home in the depths of the ocean, having saved the world from near-guaranteed destruction by a pair of radiation-hungry MUTOs.  Five years later, Godzilla has his work cut out for him again, this time against a monster of mythical proportions King Ghidorah, a three-headed water dragon reminiscent of the Lernaean Hydra as well as the other flock of high-rise-size creatures that nightmares are certainly made of. Right away, you know ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is a film that is not making a push for Oscar gold, but is focused purely on packing in the entertainment punches. Perhaps this is what boxing fans find so appealing about their sport. Or even those who follow the abhorrent game of tennis, for that matter. They come for the spectacle, for the head-to-head combat of two (or more) adversaries and to watch how the bodies hit the floor. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins return as doctors at Monarch, the crypto-zoological agency – whatever that means – in charge of tracking Godzilla and keeping the other secret monsters of the world in hibernation. This time around, the Russell family is at the center of the film. Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma (Vera Farmiga) are the resident experts in the technology that can communicate with the beasts, and their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) astutely keeps tabs on what her parents are doing. When a rogue eco-warrior hijacks Emma’s technology and releases the monsters to set the world back to its natural order, the Monarch ninjas must race across the world and around the clock to tame the titans. But what they quickly learn is that their only hope rests on their fire breathing king, Godzilla. If the terminology and technicality sound vague, that’s because they are. The science, if real, is above the average viewer’s pay grade, but it also doesn’t always add up, even to us layman folk. However, we forgive the science of convenience to get  from A to B in the most thrilling way imaginable. The movie runs through action sequences like my fourteen-month-old plays with her toy figurines; our human protagonists are thrown onto submarines and military jets, traversing the world multiple times, which in the brief timeline of the film, doesn’t seem physically possible. In fact, you know it’s all a bit much when, mid-action sequence, you find yourself thinking about when they sleep or use the loo or do any of the logistical things people need to do in a day. And listen, it’s ridiculous. “Godzilla: King of Monsters” attempts to pack in so much bang, you forget why the fighting started in the first place. It’s an action film on steroids, and, like with most great terrible blockbusters, you may be guilty of laughing at a corny throwaway line or absurd scenario at least a few times before the credits roll. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, this “Godzilla” installation is fast, fun, and pretty much exactly what we want from a sequel five years in the making. The story veers in outlands so far removed from reality, they could only come to life in a high budget, sci-fi summer blockbuster that, at the very least, won’t be called boring."

"Dec 16, 2020",POSITIVE,The story is a little bit of hollow it's a little bit orced... but - big but!- Godzilla makes up for it. The return of Godzilla and all of these friends is pretty amazing and pretty epic.
"Dec 7, 2020",NEGATIVE," Director: Michael Dougherty Actors: Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Ziyi Zhang, Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson Jr. ive years have passed since the devastation caused by Godzilla’s climactic battle in San Francisco. While many have attempted to move on, mourning mother Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has committed herself to her work on the Orca, a bio-acoustic sound wave system that may hold the key to controlling Godzilla and other “titans.” When the doctor is kidnapped by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his band of eco-terrorists, Emma’s daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) is dragged into the madman’s dangerous scheme to release more behemoths being held by secretive monster-hunting organization Monarch – led by Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). Despite his hatred for Godzilla, Madison’s father Mark (Kyle Chandler) agrees to assist Monarch in their quest to locate and aid the gargantuan reptile against their mutual enemies – including a newly freed three-headed abomination hell-bent on dominating the world. “We must keep our faith in Godzilla!” The world’s most famous lizard monster has been, conveniently, taking a five-year hiatus so that the events of this sequel can directly line up with the span of time between films. Humanity hasn’t learned much during the break, once again building containment fields that immediately fail to hold their prisoners, and devices of control that are unable to exhibit much command over their targets. It’s certainly not an original idea to have humans quarrel over meaningless authorities, yet that seems to be the major premise here; indeed, the first half-hour of “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” rehashes themes from every monster movie of the last 20 years. Further delaying the inevitable clash between Godzilla and longtime nemesis Ghidorah is a collection of hackneyed personas. Every generic character blueprint appears, sometimes in multiples: a nerdy scientist (Middleditch); a wise-cracking technician (Whitford); the precocious, headstrong child (Brown); the guilt-ridden father running away from his family (Chandler); the grief-stricken mother consumed by her work (Farmiga); the grimacing, stone-faced villain (Dance); and a wealth of military personnel (some barking serious orders, others providing cynical utterances), researchers, and politicians. And the dialogue is bland to match, from commonplace conversations to laboratory lingo to military mumbo-jumbo. Far too many supporting players populate the picture, with not a one feeling fresh or necessary. Fortunately, Monster Zero promises some excitement, though it’s the kind that probably won’t live up to expectations. Special effects have come a long way since the man-in-a-suit gimmicks of the originals or Harryhausen’s stop-motion derivations, so Ghidorah’s appearance is fairly amusing; the space creature’s movements are mesmerizing, particularly as its three heads writhe in a natural, oscillating cadence. But despite the sizable budget, there are still copious amounts of obfuscation pummeling the screen; rapid cuts and camera angles, storms and environmental debris, and flickering lights paired with nighttime shots all keep the kaiju combatants blurred and entangled. Specific choreography is impossible to sort out. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is an epitomic example of bombastic spectacle unable to overtake terrible storytelling. Accidental hilarity finds its way into the film through candid lines from an emotionless antagonist; ludicrous transportation conundrums as the main characters zip back and forth across the globe; and the nonsensically-ignored physics of nuclear explosions and blast radii, oversized stealth jets flying through violent tempests while miraculously pulling off complex rescues, and submarines diving and surfacing from extreme depths with the ease of a toy in a bathtub. But the visuals are the least of the problems; the narrative is more focused on motivational speeches, awestruck expressions and commentary, phonily emotional sacrifices, artificial predicaments designed to inspire last-minute heroism, and laughable stare-downs between man and titan. The filmmakers opted to follow the techniques of the Transformers series rather than “Pacific Rim,” resulting in massive amounts of destruction and collateral damage with very little substance. The monster battles are intermittently enjoyable, but the humans and their trivial woes continually interrupt them to ruin the momentum. For a film promoting the fine balance between mankind and nature, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” can’t seem to balance the petty people, the colossal kaiju, or the reasons for all of them to exist in the same storyline.

"Nov 20, 2020",NEUTRAL," The crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.  A surprisingly dull affair as far too much time is spent on a truly ridiculous plot involving the freeing of Godzilla’s rivals and far too little on epic monster throwdowns.  Once those occur, even they prove disappointing as so much of the action is done in overcast, murky settings with the camera too close to the action and the editing too frantic to follow it.  The monsters look great, but little else does in this tepid sequel."
"Nov 10, 2020",POSITIVE," Ever since the dawn of time, prosperous minds have dove headfirst into this indelible question, cutting through the dichotomy of our civilization and its past for the right answer. What happens when human beings try to reshape the world by using the dangerous creatures to clear the table? Who has the true power then? In Mike Dougherty's Godzilla: King of the Monsters, this theme is explored just enough to set up the wild and over-the-top action sequences featuring Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, and other endangered, yet still highly dangerous, species. It's the crypto-zoological agency, Monarch, and various other black ops security mercenaries along with it, that have given these otherworldly monsters a rebirth on Earth that kicks off the deadliest of times. Picking up after the events of Gareth Edwards' 2014 film, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is living in mourning peace with her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things), estranged from her father, Mark (Kyle Chandler, so effective here). Emma is testing a new technology that can alert, harness, and tame creatures from different worlds, but what happens when such tech gets into the wrong hands, such as a mercenary like Jonah Alan (Charles Dance, aka Tywin Lannister on Game of Thrones)? Chaos can break out, alliances are tested, and families are destroyed. Enter Ken Watanabe's wise yet Dr. Serizawa and Sally Hawkins' Dr. Vivenne Graham, two holdovers from Edwards' film that carry over the story here. Along with computer wizards like Rick Stanton (a hilarious and much-needed Bradley Whitford) and Sam Doleman (Thomas Middleditch), Mark tries not only to reconnect with his family, yet save them at the same time. By the by, the monsters come and go, with the humans not sure who they can trust. So, you get the drill, right? Humans running scared, yet with purpose, while monsters, both good and bad, attack and roar. Dougherty's film scratches the surface of the methodology of these creatures while providing the audience with what they really came for: crazy action and monster fights. You didn't come to this movie for a geology session without coffee and donuts; you bought a ticket for Godzilla to take on the three-headed dragon thing over the city of Boston (Sorry, Fenway Park fans). It is the consistently rousing action that makes King of the Monsters a worthy spring escape. The 2014 film was bogged down by a terrible Aaron Johnson performance and way too much deliberations and talky nonsense. Every monster film needs a little substance, but don't forget to keep the pace and tension up. You don't need to be a Godzilla nerd to roll with the punches here, as Watanabe's doctor and Chandler's expert will keep you informed about what's going on, but your eyes will be served plenty of candy. Try and tell me there isn't a rush inside you when Godzilla and Ghidorah make a mad dash for each other, crashing through skyscrapers and streets for a battle. I judge an action thriller's quality based on how many times I lean up out of my seat to get tuned into the picture, and let's just say there were several occasions here. It's not heavy nor is it too light, but screenwriters Dougherty and Zach Shields layer the plot with enough thrills and scares to keep audiences busy and alert. You won't be bored, and quite frankly, you'll be tired in the end. The cast gives the film much-needed weight. When they were casting the film, the filmmakers knew quality was more important than quantity. Chandler gives Mark instant conviction. The man's been putting out solid work since he took over Coach Taylor's desk on Friday Night Lights. Farmiga gives Emma the soulful duality that's required. Hawkins and Dance are solid. Whitford is the highlight here, injecting humor into any scene he can, even if it's playfully saying, ""zilla,"" after someone says, ""God."" Brown doesn't get much to do here except look scared, concerned, and ready to run. The trailer really placed a focus on her character, so seeing her being given not much to do was somewhat disappointing. If you've watched the Netflix Original series, you'll know she can handle a lot. Watanabe doesn't work enough in America these days, but he's popped up in two films recently, this and Detective Pikachu, and given each of them some much-needed soul. He plays a doctor who is more connected to Godzilla's origin tale than he is civilization's future. It's as if the rent on his forgiveness for our world ran out and he wants to explore a lease on another planet. Serizawa has skin on each side of the game here, and a scene late in the film between his doctor and Zilla is one of the better ones I have seen all year. It's quiet, patient, and emotional, setting up the big finale. The action can get overbearing at times, especially with the title character making several appearances right at the exact moment that he is required. Most of the time, Godzilla looks like a drunk war soldier who showed up the VFW a few minutes late, barking and shouting about what's right. His battles with Ghidorah felt more like a 12 round boxing match, accelerating yet exhausting at the same time. Then again, I liked the Rocky-esque touch given to Godzilla's story here, showing us a creature who may not be as monstrous as the humans trying to dictate his pace. Like the understated brilliance of the King Kong stories, he's out of his own time and element, looking for safe passage yet running into harm's way at every turn. There's intrigue there that Dougherty doesn't miss. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a fun spring kick to the senses, delivering on the action and boosting a cast that knows how to hit the proper dramatic notes, therefore giving the tale extra weight and space. I won't write this down on my year-end best of the year list, but I will advise you to see it. It fulfills the promise of the trailer and eradicates the dullness of the 2014 film. Who is the real monster: creatures or humans? That may never truly be answered, but this action-heavy film gives the theory some credence amidst the war."
"Sep 9, 2020",POSITIVE," Godzilla: King of the Monsters, if we're being honest, completely sucks but it sucks in that special kind of way that makes a guy feel kind of special. It's the kind of suck that you instantly forget about except for that weird tingling in your nether regions that serves as a reminder of the sucking.  There's no question that Godzilla: King of the Monsters should have been and could have been a much better film. There are moments when director Michael Dougherty, following up on Gareth Edwards' serious and silly 2014 film, taps into the soul of the Godzilla films and in these moments Godzilla: King of the Monsters flirts with being an upper tier Godzilla film. Unfortunately, these moments are often short-lived and surrounded by abysmal editing choices, excessive and unnecessary exposition, and wonkily awkward dialogue that serves little purpose other than constantly reminding us how completely unnecessary the humans are in this overly populated cast of one and two-note caricatures.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters isn't a necessary film. It's not even a good film, really. However, Toho devotees are likely to embrace it for the most part and those seeking escapist cinematic fare could definitely go more wrong than sticking with this nearly brainless, plodding, disorganized but still rather fun and cheekily endearing endeavor.  The Godzilla franchise is cinema's longest running and franchise, though certainly there are others that could claim to have a wider reach. The franchise has encompassed 30+ feature films, television, breakfast cereals, and a host of other pop culture outlets on its way to having attained its current iconic status globally. Most people have managed to see at least ""a"" Godzilla film, while others, including friend and film journalism peer Evan Dossey, have plopped themselves down in front of a big screen and watched, quite literally, every Godzilla film ever made.  In case you're wondering, Evan's a fan of this film. While recognizing its flaws, he embraces the culture of Godzilla and feels like Godzilla: King of the Monsters embraces that culture and brings it to life.  The third film in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse brand behind 2014's Godzilla and 2017's Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a difficult film to describe precisely because the film is less about narrative and far more about CGI Kaiju kick-ass sequences and goofily fun action sequences. Somewhat reflective of Toho's Heisei era flicks, think Godzilla vs. Destroyah, this is a film that defies its overly complicated plot with overly simplified action sequences.  The military also has their eyes on the tool, of course, and a certain refrence to 1954's Gojira should bring more than a few smiles to faces for true Godzilla devotees.  If you've managed to follow that last couple of paragraphs, then you're also an obvious devotee of my writing because I'm even sitting here reading it back to myself thinking ""That doesn't make sense."" Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn't make a lick of sense, but it has a lot of fun along the way. Dougherty, who directed the films Krampus and Trick r' Treat, has crafted a visually appealing film with enough affection for its cinematic roots that it's hard not to imagine that folks are absolutely going to love it. While one could easily argue the visuals are often dark and muddy, there's a consistency within those visuals to the Toho films that is admirable and it's hard not to get a goofy ass grin on your face when such monsters as Mothra, King Ghidorah, Kumonga, and a few other surprises pop up along the way.  The humans? They're mostly irrelevant here with Millie Bobby Brown being one of the most appealing, while Sally Hawkins, now an Academy Award winner, being completely and utterly wasted.  Bear McCreary's original score is loud, booming and domineering, though at times McCreary serves up delightful hints of Akira Ifukube's Godzilla scores from the 1950's and 60's and suddenly all feels right within the Godzilla universe. One can't help but wish he'd stuck even consistently within that musical realm.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters isn't a good film. It simply isn't. However, it's also not the disaster many will proclaim it to be and it's fair to say that it earns its way within the Godzilla franchise. It's close enough in tone and aura to not be considered a guilty pleasure, because one need not feel one iota of guilt for enjoying a brainless exercise in monster mashing and kaiju bashing. "

"Jul 28, 2020",POSITIVE," In a way, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the film that shows us that Warner Bros., the makers of 2014’s Godzilla and 2017’s Kong: Skull Island, are fully committed to creating a full-on, monster-based cinematic universe that is leading up to Godzilla vs. Kong, set to be released in March 2020. We’re starting to see characters return (entirely from Godzilla, since Skull Island was set in the late 1970s), and learn more about Monarch, the organization that was revealed at the end of Skull Island as being a decades-old group committed to finding and observing a small army of giant monsters called Titans. The monsters exist hidden around the world and seem to be emerging in the present day for reasons that become all too clear. From director Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘r Treat, Krampus), Godzilla: King of the Monsters picks up five years after Godzilla. The world now knows and accepts that these monsters exist and that Godzilla, as infrequently as he may make his presence known, is a friend to the human population, at least for now. As the film opens, we meet Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (a big-screen debut for “Stranger Things” star Millie Bobby Brown). The doctor has developed a machine that can simulate the soundwaves that the Titans use to communicate with each other, in the hopes that she can tame the savage beasts if any turn out to be hostile toward humans.  But just when she is in the midst of testing her machine on a newly emerging Mothra, a group of terrorists (led by Charles Dance, formerly of “Game of Thrones”) grab up the doctor and Madison in the hopes of using the machine to spark a global cleansing at the hands (wings, claws, teeth, fire-breath, etc.) of the Titans. Believing that the destruction of the environment has triggered the Titans' coming out of hiding, the group plots to level most of the pollution-causing cities and machines on the planet. It becomes clear that the monster king that wants to lead the charge against human civilization is King Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon that somehow has the ability to regrow a head if one gets cut off. And because this film is intent on matching the exact kaiju lineup from 1964’s Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, we also get the flying bird-lizard Rodan.  Say what you want about the movie’s plot or human characters, but this creature foursome is extraordinary in their design and epic special effect execution. The scale and awesome power of these monsters is on full display here. And their destructive force is in no way underplayed. Entire cities are laid to waste, and the entire final act of the film sees the absolute flattening of Boston to a magnitude I’ve almost never seen done in a sci-fi adventure like this. There may be a few too many moments when a key human character is about to bite it and Godzilla swoops in to save the day, but it’s a Godzilla movie. What the hell else were you expecting?  I should add that I've chuckled heartily at reviews that complain that the human characters in the movie are underdeveloped. Have those people never seen a Godzilla film before? That being said, it’s clear that the screenwriters want some of the characters to stand out and deliver some emotional resonance. To the recent films’ credit, the studio has been bringing in a squadron of exceedingly talented actors from all over the world to populate these recent works.  Kyle Chandler plays Dr. Russell’s ex-husband; the couple broke up when their other child was killed in the monster attack in the previous Godzilla film. Ken Watanabe returns as another doctor who specializes in Godzilla’s behavior (also returning from the last film, in a smaller capacity, are Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn); Ziyi Zhang is on hand playing twin doctors in different locations; Thomas Middleditch (“Silicon Valley""), Aisha Hinds (“911”), Bradley Whitford (Get Out), and O’Shea Jackson Jr. (Long Shot) also appear as part of the modern-day monster squad known as Monarch. And indeed some of them get moments to shine—and even sacrifice themselves if needed—during the course of the movie. But none of the human characters in Godzilla: King of the Monsters hold a candle to how involved I was in the fate and character arcs of the Titans. The only bummer is that Kong doesn’t even merit a cameo here, even though he and Skull Island are repeatedly name-dropped. There’s even a nifty post-credits scene...and still no Kong. But there is a beautiful, intricate score by Bear McCreary that finds ways to brilliantly incorporate elements of previous Japanese Godzilla scores. Director Dougherty does two things really well here: he keeps things moving and he keeps them dark and stormy, as if to imply that even the weather shifts and the atmosphere rages when Titans shake the earth as they fight. Godzilla: King of the Monsters features a handful of truly rumbling, explosive monster fight sequences, including one near the end where it seems all of the earth’s Titans (minus Kong, naturally) take part in the monster war to end all monster wars. Normally, I’m not one to make excuses or be an apologist when elements of a movie fall short, but I’ve also seen most of the 30-plus Godzilla movies ever made; I get how these work, and the normal rules don’t apply no matter how much you’d like them to. These movies are about monsters being misjudged, structures being flattened under the feet of creatures, and humans being about as disposable or noticeable as blades of grass. King of the Monsters is a solid, powerhouse kaiju story that even manages to find the time to make us like a couple of the human characters as well. That’s a win in my monster book.

"Jul 27, 2020",NEUTRAL," Five years after Godzilla becomes known to the world, an eco-dystopian plot is set into action that involves releasing more of these “titans” in order to reverse humanity’s mistakes. Shock almighty(!), it doesn’t work. Instead, titans wreck havoc, led by the three-headed monster Gidorah. Only one other titan can stand up to the apocalypse’s resident bully, and that’s Big G himself. Although Gidorah is not the only one he has to watch out for.  It speaks volumes that each of the four primary monsters are named in the end credits – played not by their motion capture artists, but by ‘themselves.’ Dougherty is letting his kaiju fanboy euphoria overtake him with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and it works a treat. There are subtle nods and callbacks to the detailed history of the beasts, and a character arc that so deliberately mirrors the bleak finale of the 1954 original (the American re-release of which gives KOTM its name). Such care is taken for each major monster to have its own distinct personality, sounds and look. This is especially true with Gidorah; the fallen angel who is an easy villain to detest, the embodiment of an insidious, repulsive evil. All of these are evolutions of Toho Studios’ original creations, and a stunning demonstration of what modern motion capture can do. Taking in the magnificence, terror and spectacle of these monsters reminds you of why we have movies like this. Most importantly however, the battles are as vicious and intense as you like. Weirdly for a film with a 500-foot three-headed dragon, some of the final moments feel over the top. Mostly though, the kaijus are finally seen as the best version of themselves. The most heart-pounding set piece is a chase involving the giant pteranodon Rodan near the Mexican coast, but the ultimate showdown is between Godzilla and Gidorah. With these two mighty foes at the centre, KOTM has plenty of moments where it rivals Avengers: Endgame for biggest visual spectacle of the year. Dougherty holds nothing back, raining fire without mercy, and for this he deserves massive credit. Unfortunately, KOTM can’t really move the MonsterVerse forward like it wants to, since it falls into some all too common pitfalls. As with Godzilla (2014), the humans serve little purpose other than occupying screen time that should be taken up by the monsters. They at least seem less robotic than Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s moody military maverick, but the family dynamic of the Russells is uninspiring. Very much going through the motions as far as the troubled family thread goes, they still emerge as the highlight amongst a spirited cast with little to do. Sally Hawkins especially, after her incredible performance in The Shape of Water (2017), feels wasted here. The cast aren’t helped by an occasionally appalling script, which takes so long to kick into action. Besides a strange plot based around a device that can summon titans (left out of the trailers for a reason, you suppose) and some nonsensical motivations, the dialogue is shoddy. It does nothing beyond moving the plot along, and suffers from some horribly corny moments. One line in particular is criminally awful – you’ll know it when you hear it. Admittedly however, you don’t watch KOTM for engrossing character work. You watch it to see kaijus kick the shit out of each other, and at least it gets that right. Don’t let naysayers put you off – Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a lot of fun and a bombastic salute to the franchise’s history. Although, you might want to consider losing a brain cell or six if you want to come away heralding it as a masterpiece. Director Michael Dougherty turns Godzilla up to eleven, but ultimately this beast is all killer and no filler."
"Jul 8, 2020",NEGATIVE,"It's a never-ending assault on our visual, auditory, and common senses."
"Jul 7, 2020",POSITIVE,"Everything my soul needed: kaijus mercilessly destroying each other, destruction, an epic music score, cheesy lines, and beautiful cinematography. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jun 28, 2020",POSITIVE," The post-credits scene. It’s been around for a long time, much longer than the classic Ferris Bueller plea for the audience to finally leave (In fact, Animal did something similar at the end of The Muppet Movie seven years earlier). Mostly because of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they’ve become even more popular, as of late. In my opinion, the number one, best of these is from a Marvel film: Spider-Man: Homecoming. Being that it was released worldwide on the same day, I consider it to be the greatest practical joke ever played upon movie theater audiences. The second best, to me, was at the end of Kong: Skull Island. Even though I knew the film was a litmus test to see if what had been started in Godzilla could continue as a franchise, it was still an amazing surprise to this longtime kaiju film fan. The promise set forth with that post-credits scene has now finally been realized with Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It's been five years since the battles between Godzilla and the MUTOs wreaked all kinds of destruction and showed the world that monsters exist. The organization Monarch has been locating and, subsequently, keeping an eye on these creatures, known collectively as Titans. One of their lead researchers is Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who has developed a machine, called the Orca, that mimics the frequencies Titans use to communicate. After the first successful test, she and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), are kidnapped by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) and his team of ecoterrorists. Monarch recruits Emma's ex-husband, animal behaviorist Mark (Kyle Chandler), to help track down his family and the Orca. In the process, they discover that Godzilla has been straying from his usual migration patterns, heading directly into the path of Jonah and his plan to loose all of the known Titans upon the world. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (henceforth to be known as GKOTM) is a very worthy successor to the previous films, amping up the monster action and even giving us a framing plot that's just as good as Kong and better than the one in Godzilla. It's also the big budget version of these creatures we've been waiting for since the summer of 1998. The human element is well thought out, with characters whose fates you get genuinely concerned about, who cause you to inch toward the edge of your seat when they're in peril. These aren't cookie cutter, central casting characters, wandering around like supporting players in a slasher film, just waiting to get stomped or chomped. Instead, these roles were filled with actors of a quality caliber. Returning for a second round with the Big Guy are Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn. Joining the fight with them are Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and, in a somewhat familiar-feeling dual role, Zhang Ziyi. Also, keep an ear out for a cameo actor to be called a familiar name. Of course, what you truly want from any Godzilla film, old or new, is monsters. The character designs the GKOTM effects team came up with are amazing. They have taken the classic kaiju a lot of us have grown up loving and given them the upgrade that goes above and beyond a fan's wildest dreams. I genuinely think the creators of the original Japanese creature suits would, and should, be proud of the design work in this film. Not only does GKOTM give us great monsters, it expands the mythologies of these beasts. The focus is primarily on the big four from the Toho films: Godzilla, Mothra (my personal favorite), Rodan and King Ghidorah. Yet, we’re also given a glimpse into what totals, according to the film’s scientists, seventeen different species. Sure, this is a blatant set-up for future films, and it would ring more as such if this wasn’t already the third entry in the franchise, as well as a fourth having finished principal photography. With several winks to longtime fans, GKOTM delivers the kaiju mayhem and serious storytelling that should satisfy all audiences. And, yes, there’s another nice post-credits scene.

"Jan 17, 2020",NEGATIVE," What if I were to say that a summer blockbuster was boring? Worse yet, what if I were to say that a summer blockbuster starring Vera Farmiga, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and more were boring? What if I were to say that said summer blockbuster wasted its cast, its simple premise, and its handful of provocative themes? And what if I were to tell you that a random PA accidentally spilled their bottle of Mountain Dew Voltage all over the camera, staining 75 percent of the film an opaque shade of blue? I can’t corroborate that last statement, but I can—as much as it pains me to do so—verify the rest. In what appears to be a response to Godzilla’s reception five years ago, Godzilla: King of the Monsters triples down what audiences were clamoring for. That’s more mayhem, more laser breath, and yes, more monsters. However, all of that comes with a caveat. More lens flares, more Michael Bay-hem, more awkward cuts, and less cohesion in both fight scenes and pacing make for a ride that goes on for way too long and still ends before it begins. Don’t peg me as some plot-driven square, though: the main issue with King of the Monsters isn’t necessarily its plot. It’s just how apparent it is; just how left of center it exists without enough care to either blossom or completely get out of the way. That plot concerns a so-called “cryptozoological agency”, Monarch, as they fight against a trio of god-sized monsters. That includes dragon-type destructor Rodan, Mothra the giant moth, and, for all the franchise fans out there, the three-headed King Ghidorah. Again, there aren’t many plot devices here. The entire plot is a device in and of itself, and while that would be fun in more secure hands, it instead seats the audience with a handful of dreadfully dull characters. The closest to a conduit exists in the form of Dr. Emma Russell (Farmiga) and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), both of whom have their own turbulent relationship with the family patriarch, Mark (Kyle Chandler). Alongside them are science experts Ishiro Serizawa (Watanabe) and Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) who, in their infinite wisdom, let in the little fact that Ghidorah is Godzilla’s arch nemesis. They naturally decide to pit Godzilla against the new team of threats. Things get scaly. Things blow up. Things get really dark, really dusty, and then really bright again thanks to a cacophonous light show of visual effects. Rinse, repeat, the end. But despite this schematically sound setup, King of the Monsters tries its hand at a semblance of commentary. Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields build the film around environmentalist ideologies that don’t go much of anywhere. Its idiosyncrasies point to more genre-bending potentials, but the film instead uses this base as filler. Add in the fact that the film exists to bathe in destruction, and it ends up at the south end of an already-extraneous moral compass. This isn’t to say that the entire film is preoccupied with some sort of message, however. That would only be the first 80 minutes or so, which come out to a very long first two-thirds. The arc is almost entirely dependent on tone as well, and while the film starts much more akin to Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, it veers farther into cartoon territory without telegraphing its shifts or recontextualizing its earlier scenes. Its closest efforts in doing so are personified with Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford), a joke dispenser who feels stuck in an entirely different film. Instead, the unifying motif is its platinum color palette courtesy of Lawrence Sher, the cinematographer behind movies such as War Dogs and the Hangover trilogy. It’s all blue all the time here save for the wide shots of the fiery abattoir that comes to be, and, if he and Dougherty are feeling generous, there might be some red in there as well. It’s economically shot but not fun to look at, often lacking a sense of scale or grandeur. Each monster, each crash, and each blow are so isolated that the film doesn’t feel light on its feet but void of weight instead. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?"
"Jan 10, 2020",POSITIVE,I'll say this is probably going to be one of the best event movies of the year. It succeeds in the scale of what this movie should be and what fans hoped it would be.
"Jan 10, 2020",NEUTRAL,"Legendary Pictures seems to have heard the outcry of audiences everywhere and have seen fit to produce Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a film that knows no sense of the word 'restraint.'"
"Jan 9, 2020",POSITIVE," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC It’s been five years since Godzilla reboot decimated the multiplexes. That film was an artier take on the monster film, directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Rogue One), that seemed to focus more on the human story than the giant lizard namesake that has spawned 30+ films. Since then there has been a refocus of the series, thanks of course to Marvel, to franchise up these monster films. This re-think was introduced in the follow up Kong: Skull Island, which setup not only one of cinema’s most beloved monsters, but also a mythology that hinted at Legendary, who produced these films, would be bringing Toho’s entire rogues gallery of monsters to this new cinematic universe. This was very exciting news to long-suffering Godzilla fans who have waited patiently to see these monsters unleashed onto a new generation. Cribbing a page or two from Avengers: Infinity War, Godzilla: KOTM takes place five years after the events of the first film. The once shadowy Monarch organization has come to prominence as humanity’s monster liaison with the revelation that 17 of these apex predators known as Titans are hibernating around the planet. Or they were, until they were awakened by a sonar device called “the Orca” wielded by a group of eco-terrorists lead by Colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Dance AKA Tywin Lannister from GOT) who want to rebalance the world by allowing the Titans to cleanse it. The film begins with Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), the Monarch scientist who developed the Orca — which can control the Titans through bioacoustics — getting kidnapped along with her daughter Madison(Millie Bobby Brown). Its then up to her estranged husband and former Monarch scientist Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) to navigate Kaiju battles around the world while bringing his fractured family back together. Blessedly, the first Titan the terrorists bring back is Godzilla’s infamous nemesis King Ghidorah, the three headed dragon also known as Monster Zero. Godzilla: KOTM wisely ditches the arthouse pretense of the first reboot and delivers a rock’em sock’em old school Kaiju beat’em up. Unlike his predecessor, director Michael Dougherty (Krampus, Trick ‘r Treat) isn’t stingy with the goods either. Just minutes into the film, Godzilla is on screen in all his glory doing just what he does best, laying waste to anything that gets in his way. We soon learn that mankind once worshipped the Titans as gods, and some are benevolent (Godzilla, Mothra) and some are in league with lucifer himself (King Ghidorah). The film culminates in the brutal and breathtaking spectacle of team Godzilla taking on team Ghidorah. Sure it’s campy and a bit goofy but it’s the right direction for these films and the right audience to target since Godzilla belongs to the monster kids, both young and old. There were moments watching Godzilla: KOTM when I was once again a bedazzled 10 year-old kid watching Godzilla fight King Ghidorah for the very first time, cheering on the good guys, hoping Godzilla triumphs again. It says a lot that a film can still inspire that kind of awestruck reaction from a 40 something film geek who sometimes thinks he has seen it all, but this movie managed to do just that, time after time. Loud, over the top and utterly unrelenting, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the WrestleMania of kaiju films and makes no apologies for it."

"Dec 6, 2019",POSITIVE," I’m not a Godzilla person. Or at least I wasn’t until 2014, when I was a year into dating a certified Godzilla person and Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla was released, and I was shocked to discover that I was weirdly into giant monsters beating the shit out of each other. I even told my grandpa, who I thought was a Godzilla person, that this new one was pretty good. He looked at me sideways and said, quite calmly, “Aly, I think you’ve lost your mind.” Well, maybe I did, because I married that Godzilla person, watched from the sidelines as he dove in headfirst into 65 years of Godzilla movies and wrote an opus about them, had a baby with him, and watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters with said Godzilla person and Son of Godzilla person, not once, but twice — twice! — since receiving a review copy of the DVD/Blu-ray. (The baby tried to eat my face after the first viewing — parenting win!) This is all a long-winded way of saying I never would have predicted that I would be in the apparent minority of people who loved Godzilla: King of the Monsters. This was the blockbuster that critics chose to lambast upon its release in May. Because, like the 2014 film, the humans are one-dimensional? Because, unlike the 2014 film, there are too many monster fights? Those are criticisms I don’t agree with or understand because they’re exactly what make King of the Monsters a good Godzilla movie. Maybe even a great one. If unironically loving Alien: Covenant (and, to a lesser extent, Prometheus) has taught me anything, it’s that sometimes you have to let go of caring about the human characters and root for the monsters (and / or robots) instead. The central family of Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown and their emotional journeys are fairly milquetoast. Their names are Emma, Mark, and Madison, for crying out loud, and the parents separated after their son Andrew was killed during the events of Godzilla … but who cares? While some of them play a more active role in the story, literally waking monsters, they’re really nothing but human witnesses of a world that must change in order to undo the damage humans have done to it. This story is too big for humans to be either the protagonists or antagonists. Some fall one way or another, of course, but it’s the monsters — the Titans — who are the real heroes and villains. Some, like Godzilla and Mothra, want to save the world; others, like Ghidorah and Rodan, want to destroy it. None of them really care about the tiny humans who either try to help in the tiniest of ways, fuck up in some majorly royal ones or wisely flee at the sight of real, tangible Gods.  You see that photo at the top? That’s it. That’s the movie. Godzilla has always worked best as an allegory for the consequences of human destruction, whether it’s nuclear testing or climate change. Do you think those consequences give a shit about whatever story we’ve been telling ourselves for generations to make ourselves feel better about how small we are?  The best example of this blending is the discussion of motion-capture performance. Both Godzilla and Ghidorah were performed by motion-capture artists (each one of Ghidorah’s heads was played by a different actor!), and Dougherty calls this the natural evolution from the man in the rubber suit in the original Toho films. He’s not wrong, and this is a pretty decent way to recontextualize a method of acting that has been underappreciated at least since the days of Gollum. Most tellingly, though, Dougherty smiles throughout every single one of his talking heads. Most directors undoubtedly love what they do, but it rarely shows in special features; even Taika Waititi sounds bored out of his mind during the Thor: Ragnarok commentary. So it’s pretty wonderful to see one who is so genuinely enthusiastic about his film and the franchise in which he’s playing. It’s worth watching all the special features for Dougherty’s contributions alone. Another aspect of King of the Monsters that I adore is its reverence and incorporation of world mythologies into Godzilla lore. I could probably go on about that forever, but the DVD has me covered: a dorky 15-minute featurette called “Monsters Are Real” interviews various professors and cryptozoologists about this very topic. It’s not necessarily the best special feature — I would say those would be the “Evolution of the Titans” and “Monarch in Action” collections — but it’s worth a view if only because it leans so hard into the campier aspects of Godzilla, for better or for worse. And that’s ultimately the deciding factor on whether or not King of the Monsters is for you. The “science” isn’t any stupider than what you’d find in Star Wars or the like. The humans are just humans. The monster fights are, and I don’t say this lightly, the fucking tits. This movie is beautiful on Blu-ray, and the special features are actually special. So overall I’d recommend adding this to your collection, should you find yourself a Godzilla person and not a total stick-in-the-mud."
"Nov 22, 2019",NEUTRAL,The monster fights alone are worth seeing on a huge screen. Just don't go looking for a realistic plot or science.
"Nov 22, 2019",POSITIVE,"As the puny humans flail, Godzilla, the Cary Grant of giant monsters, emerges with his dignity intact."
"Nov 7, 2019",NEGATIVE," With Trick ‘r’ Treat director Michael Doughtery taking over from Gareth Edwards, Godzilla: King of the Monsters follows the efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against several god-sized monsters, including Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his nemesis – the three-headed King Ghidorah. Although he has only directed three films, Edwards has established himself as a filmmaker that is confident with big-budget features. Following his departure from the production in 2016, it allows Doughtery to step in to make his first big-budget film. With so much pressure to deliver on the success on the 2014 film, the sequel needed to up the scale on Edwards’ mammoth feature. With that in mind, the sequel features more of Toho’s classic monsters such as Mothra, Rodan and the three-headed King Ghidorah. Setting the stage for the most epic battle in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, it promises high-paced action. However, it falls spectacularly short. Ranging from Kyle Chandler‘s embittered father and Bradley Whitmore’s unfunny crypto-monographer to Godzilla returnees Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins, the extensive list of characters don’t do much other than bicker about Monarch’s poorly maintained secrecy or argue about whether to help or kill the monsters. It is evident that each character has their own opinion about the Titans but the predictable narrative restricts them to being one-dimensional. When certain characters try and offer a serious spin on their motives (Vera Farmiga’s Emma Russell being a notable example), they just come across as laughable. In addition, the film isn’t helped by Doughtery and Shields’ poor script. Containing a mash-up of overdramatic lines and needlessly long (and ludicrous) explanations, the dialogue strays into cliché territory. Needless to say, the already limited character development is abandoned as soon as the Titans take to the sky.  Considering that they are the real stars of Godzilla: God of the Monsters, not even they can help enhance the quality of the film. Imposing on-screen and chaotically animated, audiences don’t have the time to revel in the majesty of the Titans amid the melee of sky battles going on.  Although Godzilla and Mothra do look quite astounding, the overall lacklustre quality down-scales the thrill factor of this supposedly high-paced action feature. Due to these poorly developed elements, Godzilla: God of the Monsters fails to deliver on the promise of an epic monster film. Long gone is the thrill of seeing two formidable opponents face-off on screen – thanks to the machinations of its human characters, it ends up being another boring blockbuster that is not as good as the original. "
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL," It’s a royal rumble of titanic monsters, as the iconic Japanese sea creature Godzilla confronts a slew of giant prehistoric foes and some very confused humans. There’s a degree of spectacle but it’s a misshapen movie, writes critic Craig Mathieson. Several times in this monster mash-up, the film will cut to a medium close-up of Godzilla, fixing on the oversized sea creature as he takes a break from his latest rumble with another of mythic Titans that have returned to life to topple skyscrapers and crush civilisation. The digital creature has a steady, blank gaze – obviously he’s seen a few things – but there’s no real inner-life to him, outside the destruction he causes or sometimes counters. That’s a problem for Michael Dougherty’s scaly blockbuster, because it keeps trying to assign motivation, values, and even beliefs to the radiation-ripped beast. He’s a blank slate nothing permanent can be written on. With 2014’s Hollywood reboot Godzilla, Gareth Edwards skilfully exploited that unknowable distance. The scale was human – the characters ran and dodged in the debris and dusty surrounds of Godzilla and his eventual adversaries – and when the monsters were revealed, after an admirable period of menacing restraint, their otherworldly scale rendered humanity and its toys insignificant. The sequel has many more monsters, and many more battles. Like an old 16-bit fighting game, Dougherty shoots Godzilla and his latest opponent in city-wide profile; you half expect them touch claws before they come out punching. Having ‘saved’ – i.e. devastated – San Francisco from a pair of Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms five years prior, Godzilla is a source of hope and a transformative figure in the new films. As more Titans are revealed they’re set free by eco-terrorists led by a former British soldier, Alan Jonah (Charles Dance, himself a giant of scenery chewing), who believe that the Titans will save a dying planet by reducing the plague of humanity and sparking regrowth through their radiation-fuelled bodies. That is a step short of worshipping these monsters, whose selections such as King Ghidorah will delight long-time Godzilla fans, and there’s a wild mix of paganism and nihilistic abdication lurking here that the movie, not unsurprisingly, doesn’t want to get into. Instead the framework is a divided family, with Jonah kidnapping one scientist who’s been helping the international agency Monarch study the dormant Titans, Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), along with her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). That necessitates Madison’s father, Emma’s ex-husband and former Monarch scientist Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), returning to the fold, growing increasingly more angry (Chandler has such an expressive jaw) as the extent of the Titans becomes destructively clear. Everyone, including the characters played by Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins in the first film, race around the globe from one clash to the next, complete with a MacGuffin-like box that’s super crucial (and thus easily stolen by an angry teenager). Yet it’s all strangely ineffectual – there’s no physicality to the fighting and no wonder to the creatures’ rise. Dougherty signals as much by repeatedly cutting away to scrambling humans or deeply ineffectual jet fighters that are mere mosquitoes. The film even has two comic relief archetypes: Bradley Whitford as the freaked-out white scientist and O’Shea Jackson Jr as the phlegmatic black soldier. Both actors are better than those roles require, but then everyone – and everything – in this film is reduced to their basic tenets; that look of furious focus Millie Bobby Brown trademarked in Stranger Things is showcased here. “You need to see this,” one bit player after another urges the main characters, but the reveals in Godzilla II: King of the Monsters never really linger, let alone inspire. A blank slate is nothing until it’s filled in."

"Sep 27, 2019",POSITIVE," Godzilla may be king of the monsters but this sequel to the 2014 American reboot of the legendary Japanese franchise is king of the monster movies. That does not mean the best. When I say ‘king’ I mean more in the context of a king-sized meal or bed. Despite having the blandest lead characters in mainstream blockbuster history, the 2014 Godzilla delivered the goods of a kaiju movie – that is brutal giant monster and giant monster action. While the titular character was used sparingly, when he did appear there was a real sense of weight. The camera shot Godzilla from below. You felt the sublime awe of those cowering under him and could witness the buildings around him buckle. From director Michael Dougherty (who helmed underrated creature flick Krampus), Godzilla: King of the Monsters improves on some of the issues fans had with its predecessor. There’s a more gripping human story and more Godzilla (as well as Ghidorah, Mothra and Rodan) for your buck. Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga star as Dr Mark and Emma Russell. One of their two kids (the other being Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown) died during the events of 2014’s Godzilla. The two are now split up. Mark has become an alcoholic. Meanwhile Emma works with Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins’ scientists from the last movie to try capture and study Godzilla and other giant creatures like him. This is to try find a way to discover how monsters and humans could exist symbiotically. When Emma and her daughter are kidnapped by a group of radical environmentalists (led by Charles Dance), Mark is brought out of exile to help find his ex-wife. Her captors are travelling around the world, freeing skyscraper sized monsters as they believe the destruction they wreak is the only thing to save Earth from being destroyed by human hand. The Dark Universe with movies like Dracula Untold and Tom Cruise’s (Show Me) The Mummy struggled to build a shared MCU like universe based around properties acclaimed for their villains. No one wants to watch a heroic sexy Prince of Darkness or Tom Cruise becoming a kind-hearted version of an Egyptian boogeyman. Legendary’s MonsterVerse of which this is the third entry (after Kong: Skull Island) has fared a lot better. This is by realising all that’s needed is a series of movies loosely connected by their central monsters doing what they are famous for, all while a set of different each time human characters deal with their own issues tied to the creatures. Emma and Mark’s story is not exactly deep. Plus, it falls to the wayside (along with any commentary on environmentalism) as soon as the monsters take over. However, it provides just enough of an emotional spine in between kaiju fights to keep audiences invested. Here you have two parents dealing with grief in radically different ways and the daughter caught between them. There’s a tragedy there that is hard not to sympathise with. All that said, the real reason to see Godzilla: King of the Monsters is its gargantuan monster brawls –  the biggest put on screen maybe ever. While the worry is during these sequences the movie will descend into CGI mush, here what they resemble is Rembrandt tableaus. Or at least those on steroids – depicting giant gods dueling for the fate of the world in the midst of bright heavenly lights. The latter the effect of either an oxygen bomb designed to kill the monsters, the lightning that gathers any time Ghidorah is present or the radiation used by Godzilla to get increasingly jacked. You watch these fights and forget you are seeing a movie. They transcend the medium, becoming almost abstract art. It’s because of them you ignore the many flaws of Godzilla: King of the Monsters.

"Sep 27, 2019",NEGATIVE," 
Going into Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I expected off-the-charts monster clashes and not a lot else. Instead of posters littered with human characters, we’ve got a spotlight on the sort of cast audiences have longed for since 2014’s relatively Kaiju-less Godzilla. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah – and really, what else do you need?
For less than half the movie’s run time, my wish was fulfilled, either by witnessing the slow reveal of each monster or watching them engage in full-on combat. For the other more-than-half-ish, though, I was engaged in an internal battle of my own: how much does the good outweigh the bad?
The joy you get out of Godzilla: King of the Monsters may depend largely on how much goodwill it earns from you with the kaiju clashes. What’s the exchange rate for boring human drama to nostalgic monster fights? Is every 1 minute of Mothra worth 5 minutes of Kyle Chandler frantically yelling about his daughter? How about 10? The value of that kind of currency will vary from one person to the next, but the answer to these kinds of questions is a basic litmus test for whether this film really works.
Godzilla: King of the Monsters employs a sort of nesting doll approach to conflict. The largest in scale and easily the most engaging is the battle of the Kaiju, pitting Mothra and Godzilla against Rodan and Ghidorah. Move down a layer and you’ll find the least interesting, most convoluted plot: that of various government entities, including Monarch, a special unit researching the Titans (e.g. monsters), and even environmental terrorist organizations. Each has a different opinion and approach in how to best handle the potential threat from the Titans. This piece of the story somehow, almost impossibly involves both the most exposition and the least amount of clarity. It’s a major but mostly needless obstacle to telling this story, filled with boring McGuffin chasing at best and complete nonsense at worst.
In the final layer, we have the the drama surrounding a family torn apart by tragedy and, well, Godzilla. This is the part of the movie that could have worked in different circumstances. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown do their best to make us care about this family, but the effort falls flat as it gets trapped in the underpinnings of that second layer of plot previously mentioned.
But, like I said, it’s not all bad. Because then you have the kaiju. In 2014’s Godzilla, the lack of appearance from the titular character was the main complaint I heard from people who were unsatisfied with the film. This is, fortunately, not a problem here. Monarch spends most of the film’s running time tracking and chasing Godzilla, and this time we even see enough of him to see glimmers of personality. Mothra is also well-served by this movie, getting moments in battle that are pronounced enough to almost make her feel more human than the film’s leads. On the other side, Ghidorah and Rodan are mostly served up as pure monster menace, with an even elaborate bit of Ghidorah’s back-story woven into the central plot. It’s clear that director Mike Dougherty is a fan of these creatures, and he does them justice.
I also thought the visual effects looked good here, though I could understand complaints that they’re a little murky: the film uses lots of Earth tones for the Titans and the biggest fight scene is portrayed in the dark and in the rain (not unlike Pacific Rim). But I thought those choices helped the film light up more drastically when special powers or brighter colors were used, and everything was still crisp and clear. Small snapshots within the film were artful enough that you could see how gorgeous each moment would look as a still. The music only adds to the nostalgia factor, and fans of the older movies will recognize some of the themes of Bear McCreary‘s score. I would add that if you’re interested in seeing this, I expect the big-screen experience would be vastly more rewarding than waiting to catch it at home.
Godzilla: King of the Monsters poses several questions about humanity and the burden we put on the Earth and our environment. Do we deserve to reign over this Earth if we will destroy it in the process? I’m not sure it was the intent, but I walked away from the film with a clear feeling: we really don’t need the humans after all. Just bring on the kaiju. Shin Godzilla is amazing. I’m sad that we’ll never see a sequel to that, but then again it’s a miracle that first one exists at all. I’ll admit the 2014 Godzilla has its moments. It’s better than the ’98 misfire with Matthew Broderick. (Most things are.)
Still, any movie that makes Elizabeth Olsen uninteresting has some problems."

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Remember the trailer for the 2014 reboot? György Ligeti’s Requiem played over J. Robert Oppenheimer’s speech regarding his role in creating the atomic bomb. As he quoted the Bhagavad-Gita, it seemed as though it would be the darkest Godzilla movie since the original. Arguably, Michael Dougherty’s long-awaited follow-up is darker and far more intense than its predecessor, with the potential to eclipse its success at the box office.  The events of the MUTOs and Godzilla fight has deeply affected Mark and Emma Russell’s marriage. 5 years later, they’re apart and the only thing they have in common is their daughter, Madison. The human drama is neither complex nor uncharacteristic for these types of movies, but on the contrary, Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler deliver their lines and perform respectably enough to save the audience from a potential sense of ennui that would have undoubtedly sunk this sequel, had it not been for their casting.  Millie Bobby Brown plays Madison, Mark and Emma’s daughter, who struggles with her parents’ inability to see eye-to-eye. The Stranger Things actress gives a terrific performance as the heart of the human side of the story. Even the supporting cast perform adequately and convincingly enough to underpin a story rich in atmosphere and emotion. The government adamantly expresses its disdain for keeping the titans alive. The military seem to agree it should be under their control, but Monarch feels confident they can learn to coexist with the monsters. Whereas one group collectively look at the destruction as a new beginning, the rest are fearful of extinction of humankind.  If you’re concerned Godzilla: King of the Monsters cuts away from the thrilling monster action and focuses mostly on the human drama like its predecessor, you’ll be delighted to know this one’s loaded with intense, suspenseful action sequences and the CGI is brilliantly crafted. The kaiju are magnificent and are shown in beautiful, awe-inspiring ways. Director and co-writer Michael Dougherty milks the sequences, nurturing and establish a presence for each creature. The visuals are absolutely stunning and Bear McCreary’s impressive score awesomely compliments each and every scene, nuance and the ethereal subtext, all the while celebrating the franchise by incorporating some familiar score pieces.  Celebrating Godzilla seems key here, as the creative team were referencing the original in ways you might’ve not picked up on immediately unless you’re a diehard Godzilla fan. If there’s anything to feel uneasy about, it’s one specific scene between the family. Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re expecting total realism and logic, none of the Godzilla movies are for you and most certainly not this one. It does make an effort to logistically explain things, but the specific moment that had me raising a curious brow is utterly nonsensical in virtually every sense. Of course, Godzilla, Rodan, King Ghidorah and Mothra all make up for any questionable decisions our human characters make. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography, Tom Woodruff Jr.’s contribution to the visual effects and Michael Dougherty’s directing ability (and even his knowledge of horror) make this installment one of the more appealing in the franchise. There are moments in which you might laugh, jump in your seat with excitement, or feel momentarily startled. There’s a real effort put into this production and it’s certainly worth the trip to your local theater.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters is 2 hours and 12 minutes of well-paced movie magic with rich performances and an incredible score. The story may be simple, which, on the bright side, anyone can easily follow, but it’s not the worst I’ve seen — especially in this franchise. It’s not a boring entry as it delivers on the action and excitement, and the cast and crew seem to genuinely respect the Godzilla legacy.

"Aug 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,"  Look, who are we fooling here? Does anyone go to a Godzilla movie for the plot? Or the human actors? For years I’ve been agitating for a disaster movie that is all disaster, or a giant-monster movie that is all giant-monster destruction, and to hell with the pallid subplots about parents trying to track down their kids in the midst of the maelstrom or whatever. Such a movie would be a pure-cinema mammoth with no dialogue and no stars except the disaster or the monsters. Name me one moviegoer who said “Let’s go see that new Kyle Chandler monster movie!” I’ll wait.  I should’ve known Godzilla: King of the Monsters, despite its promising title, would not be the answer to my demands, but really Godzilla’s amount of screen time has traditionally always been scant; in the original 1954 Gojira, the big guy only showed up for less than nine minutes (out of a 96-minute running time). But by now, the footage of humans staring at screens or discussing what to do about the kaiju or having moral debates while cities burn is so. fucking. dull. I appreciate that they’ve tried to get terrific actors like Chandler and Vera Farmiga (playing a divorced scientist couple) and Millie Bobby Brown (as their daughter), and there’s some comic relief from a sardonic Bradley Whitford. But there’s so much pressure on a big expensive thing like this — from Warner Bros., from Toho, from its own fan base — that it can’t truly be surprising or inventive.  The suspicion is that the old-school Godzilla movies play better in nostalgic memory than they do in actuality. And at least the old man-in-suit throwdowns between Godzilla and, say, Ghidorah — his big nemesis here — were fun, in a goofball way, and easier on the eyes and ears. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘R Treat), the fight scenes between kaiju are always shot at night or during terrible rain or snow storms, the better to hide the CG seams, and the design of the creatures is “dark,” grim, gritty, ugly, lacking the charm of the old critters. And when they fight, they take down skyscrapers by the dozen, and even though the movie takes pains to establish mass evacuation, so what? These are not real buildings with real people inside. The assumption that we care about loss of human life in these movies is hypocrisy. Of course we don’t. The height of true sadness here comes when Godzilla appears to be dead.  The trailers for these things are always electrifying. When the trailer for this film landed and we first saw Godzilla and Ghidorah racing at each other in the middle of a city, we shuddered and laughed and swore to catch it on an IMAX screen — I did, anyway. I’m sort of glad I didn’t bother. There’s Godzilla and Ghidorah and Mothra and Rodan and a few other beasties named Scylla or Behemoth or Baphomet or Dennis, and there’s forever the problem of showing action between really tall creatures on a really wide screen — either you have to pull way back, or go so close in you might as well be watching leather suitcases bashing into each other. (The O.G. Gojira occupied the squarish 1.37:1 aspect ratio.) Godzilla started out in black-and-white movies and, for all intents and purposes, has circled back there. The look of this film is gray with the occasional blast of colorful radioactive breath; the sound is bass-heavy, headache-inducing. It’s not a good time or aesthetically pleasing or even very exciting. There are two or three fantastic apocalyptic images (see above), but that’s about it.  At this point, I prefer off-the-beaten-path big-monster stuff like Big Man Japan or The Host or even Colossal. They don’t have the big guy’s name recognition, or the giddy buzz (which soon dies when you see the actual thing) of going to a Godzilla flick. But they have more interesting things to say, and therefore better things occupying our brains between kaiju rampages. This movie tells us that the monsters are vital to the survival of the human race because they maintain “balance,” even though they tend to destroy cities (Boston gets turned into an ashtray here). Their destructiveness holds our destructiveness in check. This is a bitter pill to swallow when we’re watching the Amazon rain forest die in real time, and our children’s future with it. Save us, Godzilla! But he won’t. No one will. And movies like this add to the delusion that there’s hope to be found in the rubble."
"Aug 27, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla: King of the Monsters is rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction, and for some language. The running time is 2 hours and 12 minutes."
"Aug 27, 2019",NEGATIVE," Over the course of 65 years, the “Godzilla” franchise has certainly seen its ups and downs. The original 1954 film is a decent monster flick (“kaiju”) that, while somewhat cheesy in this day and age, still holds up as a classic, with the multitude of films that followed (i.e. “Godzilla vs…”) having a solid fanbase. However, in more recent years, the films have taken an obvious turn for the worse. The 1998 “Godzilla” is constantly criticized as being a big mistake, while the less said about the disastrous 2014 reboot, the better. With this in mind, you would think a sequel to the 2014 film would be another big mistake for the franchise, but because it made some money, you knew it was inevitable, so now we’re faced with “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a follow-up that attempts to up the kaiju action considerably. Would the sequel finally be the one to get the series back on course, or were audiences simply in for an even bigger disaster than before? Taking place five years after the previous film, we begin by following Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), a member of Monarch, a group that seeks out and studies monsters akin to Godzilla. While she is researching a recently born creature known as Mothra, her group is attacked by eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), who kidnaps both Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), in addition to stealing a piece of machinery known as the “Orca,” which can influence the behavior of the monsters (known as “Titans”). Monarch approaches Emma’s ex-husband, Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), to help get them back, and while he eventually agrees, the situation only becomes more complicated when it is discovered that Emma is actually working with the terrorists to help free more Titans, believing that they are needed to help heal the Earth from damage caused by humans. With the terrorists waking more and more Titans around the world, Monarch must pin their hopes on Godzilla and his allies in hopes that they can bring the other monsters to heel. With a film like “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” there’s really no beating around the bush. There are several things that can be said about it, but unfortunately none of them are good. The film is simply one of the biggest, noisiest messes you will see in this, or any other year. When the previous film was criticized for having a very noticeable lack of Godzilla until near its conclusion, apparently the folks behind the follow-up took that to mean that the next film should be as overloaded with monsters as possible, even to the detriment of the characters and plot. Granted, no one really goes to see a film like this expecting to see anything near a well-rounded human character, but for this sequel, it feels as though they put in even less effort than before. For those watching the film just hoping for a good bit of mindless kaiju action, there’s certainly plenty of that. Unfortunately the rest of the audience will be bored silly by the flat characters, nonsensical plotting, and the mind-numbing action. What’s even more frustrating though is that it wastes an incredibly talented cast in the process, including Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Bradley Whitford, Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, David Strathairn, Ken Watanabe, and Ziyi Zhang. Alas, even such a remarkable ensemble as this would never be able to breathe life into Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields’ insipid screenplay, which ultimately ends up being the glaring source of the film’s multiple problems. It’s really rare to find a film like this that has no redeeming qualities about it. The direction is sloppy, the action is dull, the characters are lifeless, and the plot never becomes compelling, or even slightly interesting. It’s a two-hour mishmash of monsters fighting and one-dimensional human characters running around trying to do something about it. When all is said and done, it’s rather easy to label it the worst film of the year, and it’s quite inconceivable that anything would be able to take the title away. In that sense, and in that sense alone, this “Godzilla” truly is king. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” comes to Blu-ray in a 2.4:1, 1080p High Definition transfer of outstanding quality. This is a very dark and special effects-heavy film, but the picture remains perfectly sharp and clear throughout its 132-minute runtime. The Dolby Atmos-TrueHD audio is equally impressive, giving you all of the dialogue, score, and the extensive sound effects in excellent quality. Overall, the kaiju fans in the audience will no doubt be thrilled with the wonderful treatment that the film has received. With its mind-numbingly dull action, flat characters, and nonsensical plot, it’s rather difficult to find a single redeeming quality in the entirety of the two-hour tedious mess that is “Godzilla: King of the Monsters."" Also going so far as to waste a great cast consisting of multiple Oscar and Emmy nominees, it easily makes a case for being the worst film of 2019. Will anyone dare challenge the king for the title? It seems very much doubtful."
"Aug 12, 2019",POSITIVE,...there's enough here to keep kaiju fans hooked for at least one more outing.
"Aug 8, 2019",POSITIVE," A confession: After an alarm mishap I accidentally slept right through my Lion King critics screening earlier in the week. Upon waking I was angry with myself because there is no way I wanted to actually pay to see photorealistic animals singing. After perusing the early reviews both pro and con, I became convinced that the sleep was no accident but a divine intervention from the cinematic gods. My new stance is that I can wait for the screener to arrive during awards season... as no movie has ever struck me (from afar) as less necessary than this one. In truth I don't even love the 1994 picture (as Disney renaissance movies go, it's low on my personal list). Anyway, on to movies we have caught up with recently that we either haven't reviewed or talked at length about on the podcast... Spider-Man: Far From Home (Jon Watts)Synopsis: In the absence of The Avengers, Peter Parker's school trip is interrupted by an alien superhero (Mysterio) and a new apocalyptic threat that requires immediate attention. But appearances can be deceiving... Capsule: The best that can be said about the now oppressively dominant superhero genre is that the movies are often very enjoyable in a communal delayed call and response way (i.e. internet memes and funny reads) as well as an in-the-movie-theater popcorn munching sense. That is when they're done right. You could actually argue that they're thrilling in similar ways to older genres like swashbucklers or musical comedy:  bold splashes of color, thrilling displays of physicality, and broad emotional feeling that's not in conflict with the comic winking. There's much fun to be had here and Tom Holland continues to make the perfect Spidey. So why does it feel so insubstantial? Or is it simply that it arrives on the heels of the single most inventive and funny Spider-Man movie (Into the Spider-Verse) and just isn't in that league?  Toy Story 4 (Josh Cooley)Synopsis: Bonnie makes a new toy at school named ""Forkie"" but Forkie think he's trash causing comic mayhem. As Woody seeks to rescue Forkie (again and again) and convince him that he belongs with Bonnie, Woody reunites with Bo Peep and questions his own journey.  Capsule: It was fun while it lasted but it's the first Toy Story movie to evaporate in the memory quickly after watching it. Which means it's the first non-essential entry. It's chief problem is the repetitive under-plotting (how many times can Woody be tasked with rescuing a wayward toy in these movies? Surely there are other potential sources of adventure and conflicts!) but mostly it just struggles to feel necessary in the long shadow of Toy Story 3's full circle finale. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (Michael Dougherty)Synopsis: Several sleeping titans are awakened causing mass global chaos and lots of monster-on-monster throwdowns. The humans struggle to survive the carnage as Godzilla takes on his greatest enemy, King Ghidorah. Capsule: Given the lackluster response to this film, one assumes that you have to have grown up with this franchise to really be into it. The Godzilla films were always in syndication on television when I was a tiny boy so I felt giddy as each famous monster emerged and I could name them before the characters could. But recognition alone does not a satisfying movie make and only 1 of the ""extra"" monsters get anything like a satisfying beat within the narrative. Overall this isn't a patch on the eery beauty of 2014's underrated Godzilla, though Mothra's big moment is a ridiculously beautiful image. What's more the villain's plan and adjacent family drama are unearned as if the film couldn't commit to them in the desperation to up the monster count. And vice versa, actually; the balance always plays out strenuously. Nevertheless I mostly enjoyed myself though this installment definitely lacks for personality.  Papi Chulo (John Butler)Synopsis: A weatherman (Matt Bomer) breaks down on live TV. During his forced leave from work he hires a painter (Alejandro Patiño) to work on his house and tries to force a friendship to ignore his pain. Capsule: John Butler's follow up to the underappreciated Handsome Devil is more polished but not as successful due to the discomfort at its core. Regarding that polish: this is the kind of movie that's never noted for its cinematography but some of the lighting choices by the cinematographer Catthal Watters are just lovely. Though we haven't read any full reviews we assume it's been chastised, as most interracial dramas are, for focusing on the emotional journey of the white man. How the film avoids the other pitfalls of its hot potato subgenre, is that (if you're paying attention) it's pretty clear that the film understands that the men aren't actually friends (helped in large part by Alejandro Patiño's sly sometimes silent performance... as he's trying to figure out what his strange employer's deal is). The movie has been reductively described as a friendship drama or a bromance so the potential misreads makes sense. Like Butler's earlier film, it is about a relationship between an oddly matched pair, one gay and one straight, only this time they don't actually become friends friends. They just become friendly while navigating a fraught emotional breakdown and peculiar circumstances. The film's stealth and difficult-to-dramatize subject is grief and the inappropriate ways people in pain try to project what they need on to other (often unsuspecting people). I wish the movie were more successful as its chosen and worthy topic but it does get distracted and distracting while attempting to dramatize cross cultural divides especially when it tries for comic beats or while making some pretty iffy narrative leaps in its last half hour. Yeah, Spider-Man had all the pieces, but just felt dull somehow. As for Toy Story 4...I was traumatized by Toy Story 3 and was given excellent closure by the finale. Toy Story can’t just stroll back into my life like a 2015 twitter post, I’m fragile. Ha, I was wondering if anyone else in the world had even noticed that Papi Chulo was a thing that made it into theaters. I totally agree that the final beats were suspect, but I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads. As you say, Patiño in particular provided the skeptical side-eye that the film absolutely requires. I find myself joking often, ""más que un día... más que one day."" Toy Story 4 was fun. I think that the ending with Woody staying behind was rewarding and a nice place to go for the franchise after what felt like a definitive ending in part 3. But yeah, it was the exact same plot as the other 3. But it was fun. عند اختيار قطع الأثاث المُناسبة وقبل البدء بتصميم القطع وتنسيق مواقعها يُفضّل اختيار نمط تصميمي موحد لكافة أرجاء المنزل، بحيث يكون الأثاث في كلّ غرفة أو منطقة متناسقة مع باقي الغرف والمناطق في المنزل، إذ يُفضّل أن يكون كامل أثاث المنزل بكلّ غرفه على النمط الكلاسيكي أو النمط الحديث على سبيل المثال، ممّا يجعل التصميم مُريح للرؤية، ولا يشعر الشخص بالفوضى من كثرة أنماط التصميم، كما أنّ ذلك يُتيح نقل قطع الأثاث من مكان إلى آخر، أي يُمكن استخدام قطع أثاث غرفة المعيشة في غُرفة النوم."
"Aug 5, 2019",POSITIVE," Previous director Gareth Edwards has been replaced by Michael Dougherty, best known for his horror efforts like the Halloween anthology film Trick ‘R Treat and the Christmas movie Krampus. With an all-star cast of acclaimed thespians, rising talents and franchise returnees and free reign to utilize other monsters in the franchise, will the film be as fun as the premise promises? There really feels no need for a synopsis with a film such like this, especially since the marketing materials make it clear we’re only here for the monsters. And those monsters certainly make their presence felt, and the film crew do their darnedest to make their action scenes as vast and impactful as possible, especially in terms of scale. That said, the simplistic story is a fitting continuation from the 2014 film, following on from the disastrous events in San Francisco. Although the film fulfills its promise to show monsters duking it out, the story is still quite effective, thanks to the inclusion of an interesting moral dilemma, that both pays tribute to the social commentary of the classic films, and offers food for thought. Without sharing any spoilers, Godzilla: King of the Monsters leaves humanity questioning whether the monsters are a positive or negative step in the natural order, and this compliments the characters quite well, making their questionable, though honourable, motivations convincing and even empathetic. Action scenes take place in varied settings ranging from Antarctica, to cities like Boston and islands like Mexico’s Isla de Mara, all captured vividly from both human and monster perspective by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. Editors Roger Barton, Richard Pearson and Bob Duscay manage to shift perspectives between action scenes briskly, and the grand musical score from Bear McCreary (whose prior work included cult monster dramedy Colossal), compliments the film beautifully, as McCreary adapts original composer Akira Ifukube‘s score and brings his own touch to proceedings, using both to great effect. The monsters are coded with a certain colour, hinting at their allegiances, and plenty of respect is paid to their original appearances. Their movements bring to mind actual animal behaviour, which lends them a stronger and more believable presence, such as how King Ghidorah attacks in a manner of a King Cobra. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is led by a top-notch cast, whom all bring credibility and approachable presences that makes it easy for us to sympathize with. Kyle Chandler brings his salt-of-the-earth average joe charisma to the character of Dr. Mark Russell, Vera Farmiga is convincingly conflicted and forceful as Dr. Emma Russell, and Millie Bobby Brown does well as the moral center, bringing tenacity, wonder and initiative to the character of Madison Russell. The supporting characters are all colourful and add to the fun. Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch and O’Shea Jackson Jr. all amuse in their parts, while Charles Dance, Aisha Hinds and Zhang Ziyi lend authoritative presence to their roles. Franchise returnees including Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn and Ken Watanabe are given more to do (particularly Watanabe) and really make the most out of their parts. No one in the cast act like they are above the material and look like they are actually having fun, which makes a positively huge difference. Also adding to the fun experience are the numerous callbacks to the franchise. It is quite clear that director Dougherty and co-writers Max Borenstein and Zach Shields are big fans of Godzilla, peppering many witty references throughout the film, including a certain plot device from the 1954 original film, a callback to certain characters relating to the origin of Mothra, and a clever role reversal that calls to mind a major moment in the 1954 film. It is moments like these that franchise devotees will truly appreciate. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an incredibly fun continuation of the franchise, and one that respects and honours its roots. Thanks to solid direction and a committed ensemble cast, the film provides the extravagant action that franchise devotees will salivate for, while providing a story that brings forth an interesting moral dilemma that calls to mind the environmental messages of prior installments."
"Jul 12, 2019",NEGATIVE," 
GODZILLA films are rarely balanced affairs between their kaiju stars and human counterparts. The vast majority of Big G movies (excluding the original 1954 entry, 2016’s SHIN GODZILLA, and maybe a couple of others) have scant amounts of monster action in between long stretches of inane human drama populated by characters that no one really cares about. The human element is a necessary one for these giant monster stories for scale purposes—it lets audiences know how big and powerful the creatures are while also putting some semblance of emotional faces and weights to the destruction being caused. Throughout the GODZILLA films, there have been attempts to make the human components at least as close as interesting as the kaiju brawls. This leads to intrigue with spies and assassins, space aliens that look like PLANET OF THE APES castaways, terrible MATRIX rip-offs, and a bunch of labyrinthine plots that are so far removed from making sense that the light from making sense won’t hit them for another seven years. Or there are attempts to make the human element compelling through drama — GODZILLA VS BIOLLANTE‘s ghost daughter plot, for example, or all of that terrible schtick from 1998’s GODZILLA — but they rarely work. The human element in GODZILLA films remains a formula to which most filmmakers don’t have a solution. GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERS doubles down on that by not only giving the people a lot more screen time but trying out melodrama and action as a means to make the film’s bloated run time interesting as well. It doesn’t work, and it’s only one problem with the film in a sea of many issues. Following 2014’s GODZILLA, the world is now fully aware of these “titans” that exist on this planet. Godzilla hasn’t been seen in five years while the government debates between ordering the military to wipe out all of the titans or continuing to let the Monarch organization (headed by Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and Thomas Middleditch) continue to monitor and study the colossal beasts. With this backdrop, Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has just created a means of communicating with the titans by issuing specific noises that imitate predators, friends, etc. When she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are abducted by ecoterrorist Jonah Allen (Charles Dance), estranged husband/father Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) is brought in with Monarch to find her and not let the communication device be used to manipulate other titans across the globe. Calamity ensues. 2014’s GODZILLA is a flawed movie. Whether it’s the wasted use of Elizabeth Olsen in a meaningless storyline, or drab Aaron Taylor-Johnson appearing at every meaningful moment in the story like a kaiju version of BAND OF BROTHERS, or how long it takes to introduce Godzilla into a movie with his own name on it — issues abound with it. However, to its credit, there is very little unnecessary melodrama when the monsters aren’t around, and the action is usually caused by (or a symptom of) the carnage the giant creatures are causing. And when Godzilla does show up, it’s for a savage fight that feels choreographed but brutal, and all of it is beautifully captured on frame. GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERS, as directed by Michael Dougherty (KRAMPUS, TRICK ‘R TREAT) from a script by Dougherty along with Zach Shields (KRAMPUS), doesn’t have those positives. Not only is the human story so invasive and poorly done, but it is also badly captured in an incredibly inept way. For the first five scenes that Mark is introduced, there are constant shots of pictures with him and his daughter (or it cuts to his face when his wife and daughter are mentioned) to underscore that this man is related to these people — a fact that has actually already been established previously in the movie (thanks to, yes, more photos). And then Mark shows up and becomes Captain Amazing for the rest of the movie — he knows strategy better than the military, can outflank an armed team of mercenaries better than soldiers, knows the science in all sorts of specialties better than everyone else in the room, and constantly has the “crazy idea” that just might work that every qualified leader is only too happy to listen to and obey. If internet fanboys were honest in looking for unearned abilities and sudden talents outshining the rest of the cast in their fictional characters, Mark Russell in GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERS is an incredible example. The plot keeps trying to be action packed for the humans and also full of melodrama involving betrayals and the Russell family’s issues, and it just doesn’t work. If the filmmakers leaned into it more, elevated it to camp with all sorts of nonsense and mustache-twirling villainy — while cutting the screen time WAY down—then maybe this could have been something. So that just leaves the monsters — or, the reason people are coming to this movie (sorry, David Straitharn stans). They are… okay. Every Godzilla entrance is badass and fun and makes viewers feel excited about what’s about to happen. He’s shown off early in the film, and there are more scenes of him and the other kaiju than 2014’s movie (but there is just so much more time devoted to the awful human plot that it becomes a moving ratio). There are some great moments in the fighting and cool elements that deliver on promises of imagining what a Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah fight would look like in the 21st century. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of awkward shots and cutting away. It is the only time in any GODZILLA movie (except maybe 1998?) where I couldn’t figure out the geography of the action; buildings would suddenly pop up to be destroyed but then it would look like a leveled city again, and it was hard to figure out exactly where each creature was at points. GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS isn’t without its charms, of course. The titular monster, as I said, looks great and has real personality — it’s just a shame he’s not used as much as people would like. Charles Dance is very catty as the ecoterrorist unleashing apocalypse, which makes his scenes very fun. Middleditch, Watanabe, and Ziyi Zhang are good in their roles and effectively sell their thin characters. Bear McCreary’s score is a great adaptation and update of classic themes from past Toho films, but with newly added percussion and choruses that make it very engaging and pulse-pounding. The f/x are fairly well done when the poor editing and action cinematography isn’t getting in the way. It’s a hard problem to solve, the human/Godzilla balance. Maybe humans aren’t needed? Maybe we as a people have seen enough disasters (natural and man-made) in just the past two decades to get the suffering and grief and empathy we should be feeling. Or maybe filmmakers need to figure out what type of movie they are telling, with their giant lizard monster in a central location, and build the tone around that. Is it a sober warning about climate change or impending wars? Is it a popcorn bit of entertainment with brawling titans? GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS never knows and tries throwing all sorts of dead-end plot threads and ineffective emotional beats at the audience. Onto GODZILLA VS. KONG next, I guess.

"Jul 10, 2019",NEGATIVE," You can tell a lot about a country by the way it writes about Godzilla. “Godzilla is the son of the atomic bomb,” explained the original film’s producer Tomoyuki Tanaka. “He is a nightmare created out of the darkness of the human soul.” Meanwhile Gareth Edwards’ lauded and commercially successful Godzilla in 2014 was critiqued for a lack of nuance when it came to the atomic age: “Rather than offering caution about nuclear energy,” summised Godzilla expert Ed Godziszewski, “the new film almost gives you the idea that nuclear weapons are actually the answer to everything.” If the West’s last Godzilla outing seemed to have an intriguing take on warheads, then King Of The Monsters feels like it almost lusts for nuclear conflict. It is astonishing to see a movie series that was once focused on assessing nuclear technology’s vices now suggesting that nuclear holocausts are necessary and beautiful and – more times than is safe to count – relying on atomic weapons to save the day. This might sound very confusing and you are correct to think that. The thing about King Of The Monsters is it makes absolutely no sense. Not in a fun, campy way either: I could chart every scene of the movie for you, but why any of them happen is absolutely beyond me. Crucial character work happens off stage all the time: Charles Dance (in a atrocity of a role) reveals, in passing, that he has been working with Vera Farmiga, who up until this point we thought was his hostage and this is not lingered on or explored. This is, I cannot stress enough, one of the most crucial pieces of information in the whole movie. Another character dies in such a turgid fight sequence that it took me 20 minutes to realise she wasn’t just off screen. Nobody even mourns her passing. This is because in King Of The Monsters – part of a series literally built on exploring the consequences of human power-lust through the heightened lens of science fiction – there are absolutely no consequences to anything. It pays lip service to the idea of consequence the way all epic cinema does in the post-Avengers age: it suggests all extras in its decimated townscapes are “evacuated” though never really lingers on how. But we are never left with any idea of the damage being done by the monsters that roam throughout this movie: we do not see if the few civilians given screen time are saved or killed, or what impact battles have on those who survive. Yet it’s a movie based on characters who made it through the conflict of the first film, but even their PTSD is unclear: do they love Godzilla? Fear him? Hate him? Everyone seems to just change their opinion on him depending on what the movie requires. There are moments when the film almost dares to pause and think. Not many mind – at one point Ken Watanabe says “There’s no time for debate,” which is actually the one time in the film I would have killed for one – but sometimes it manages to take a moment to provide us with a slow moment of terribly written dialogue. In one, Ziyi Zhang – in a welcome return to western blockbusters because she knows how to present the spectacular with poise – explains to Kyle Chandler’s Dr Mark Russell that slaying dragons is a western concept, while in the east they are seen as messianic. This concept is not... really expanded on much. Or it is, I suppose, but not by her character and not in any sort of order. Other characters praise Godzilla and the monsters as ways of saving humanity, but who says it, again, just depends on who is needed to say it rather than who has any reason to think it. Every character has something akin to motives and every character does things. These two factors, however, rarely come together to affect each other. On the note of Ziyi Zhang: at one point in the movie she appears in a completely different location, intrigued by Mothra, and then in the next scene she is back with the main cast. It turns out, according to Wikipedia, that this is because she is playing twins. This twin literally only appears in this one, tiny vignette, doesn't say any lines and could honestly be the same character. When did it fall back to IMDB to explain plot points to me? It’s also a movie that falls back on so many lazy, lazy tropes it staggers me. This is Godzilla – the ultimate trope – it’s allowed to fall back on the archetype it comes from. But wider cinematic clichés, for example “this character died off screen so are they really dead?” or “this character says ‘I'm coming!’ which everyone believes but actually they're sacrificing themselves” are so bored, so overused, that they don’t feel like homage but fromage. All of this adds to a movie that seems to like Godzilla and the other monsters simply because they’re just cool to look at. This is fair, the CGI is great (most of the time: Ghidorah is tough to watch in a post-Drogon world), but it defeats the point of a movie about nuclear weapons. A film in which the drive is to see all these allegories for thermonuclear devices is aesthetically staggering, but it doesn’t entirely match up to the truth and the power of the Cold War as a storytelling device, which is: nobody actually wants to see them. The greatest threat is just knowing they’re latent. Gareth Edwards got that. This film absolutely doesn’t. Godzilla (2014) was a huge turning point for the franchise. Japan even went back to it, leaving behind the kaiju traditions of men dressed in lizard suits to bring in some CGI. They got the exceptional Hideki Anno – a man whose opus Neon Genesis Evangelion practically gets off on the true depths of human trauma – to direct and write. It’s a movie that overwhelms, that is filled with banality, that presents Godzilla as a diplomatic and bureaucratic nightmare as much as a deity. It is also fascinated to go into the wider implications of every part of its mythos, down to exactly how dangerous the half life of his atomic breath might be. It’s not a perfect film but it got a lot of love for the right reasons: it told a compact story well. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters tells a big story very, very poorly. By the third act, I did not care who lived or died in part because I no longer really knew who lived or died. It has a diverse and wide-ranging cast, but it is not charming or particularly representative: there’s a short haired woman of colour who... I think she’s a pilot? She’s trotted out the same way my overwhelmingly white secondary school kept putting my one black friend on every prospectus cover: to suggest that her being there is as relevant as giving her something to do. This kind of surface level inclusion means the film is more interested in ticking boxes than in giving life to the ensemble it gathers together, meaning I just don’t care about their personal stakes. Then again, neither does the script. In the third act, the cast of burgeoning famous actors are all sent on separate missions, which have no real reasoning behind them and which just happen on rails as if to give everyone a little bit of screen time. There’s one moment where a mission in a submarine aims to shoot nuclear missiles at Godzilla underwater (I just... I can't) and then this is scuppered by a vaguely familiar background actor saying, “Sorry, but the missile launching facilities were destroyed in the crash.” Or something similar. What is “the crash”? I couldn't tell you, because this is a movie of collision after collision. The characters decisions from that point on, then, are not the product of a logical sequence of decisions that impact on each other, but caused by completely inexplicable external parties forcing characters this way or that. This is the film’s constant way of suggesting characters act the way they do. “They have no choice!” people tell us. No, Medea had no choice. Hedda Gabler had no choice. These people never present or explore the many avenues they can no longer go down to get to “no choice”. It is almost impossible to pick apart all the reasons I found to loathe Godzilla: King Of The Monsters without sitting you down to watch it and pausing every five minutes to decode, but that would involve us buying tickets for a movie that should be killed off faster than most nuclear programs. And this is part of a cinematic universe! A universe! One that they will not stop reminding you of all film: so many references to King Kong, just so they can weave these two beasts together for another dreary cash cow in 2020. The constant reminders that this isn't the end made me wish I was about to be wiped out like something out of the BBC's Threads. We have seen grandeur enough times on the big screen now to know it can be clear, intelligent and as driven by characters as it is by plot. Everything from The Incredibles to Captain America: Civil War to Game Of Thrones proves in its own way these can be done. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters wants to cash in on these successes but puts in none of the work. Avoid it like a nuclear bomb site: this is the sort of film that'll make you think cinema is dead."
"Jul 8, 2019",POSITIVE,"This is a film that fixes some of the previously problems in this universe. But, it also makes some new mistakes. But, I was never bored and it absolutely delivers the action, mayhem, and destruction you want from the genre."
"Jul 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn't hold back on the big monster fights, and it's definitely the best Godzilla film to date from Hollywood."
"Jul 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," For a film series that has long since outstayed its welcome, the latest in the very first superhero saga – X-Men: Dark Phoenix (dir. Simon Kinberg, rated M) – seems to be in an awful hurry to wrap things up. The culmination (and likely finale) of the film series that began long ago with X-Men in 2000, and has seen actors and storylines come and go (with the occasional time-travel retcon here and there) is a zippy little thing that nevertheless seems bursting at the seams and sagging with the weight of a series that just can't seem to end, already. Returning to ground covered in the much-maligned X-Men: The Last Stand, this film follows the X-Men as they face one of their own, Jean Grey (Sophie Turner, who does well to hold the whole thing together in a cast of sleepwalkers) when exposure to cosmic rays gives her immense, uncontrollable powers. One gets the impression from Dark Phoenix that the film-makers are trying to make up for the ""sins"" of that previous film, but this one commits too many of its own in trying to play it safe to fare any better. Packed with actors who seem desperate to simply run out their contracts (particularly Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, whose brief appearances here may as well have featured them picking up their paychecks), the action itself is at least solidly entertaining and occasionally even thrilling. Indeed, there are moments of inspired genre film-making that occasionally elevate the whole operation, boosted by a reliably bombastic Hans Zimmer score. The inclusion of a nonsensical and unnecessary alien subplot slows things down enormously, and there is little in the way of catharsis or a sense of an ending here – if it is to be the end of this iteration of Professor X, Magneto, Cyclops and the like, they've gone out less with a bang than a whimper. Rating: Two-and-a-half stars. The problem with the fledgling mega-monsters series that began with 2014's Godzilla, followed by Kong: Skull Island and now the woebegone Godzilla II: King of the Monsters (dir. Michael Dougherty, rated M) has never been the monsters themselves. The series has always had the ability to deliver agreeably epic visuals of titanic monsters ripping into each other in giant tableaus like something out of a Bosch painting. No, the problem with this series has always been the characters running around the monsters – the human element that somehow takes up so much of the filmmakers' concern and yet remains so very boring. Godzilla II picks up sometime after the first appearance of everyone's favourite rotund super-lizard, and largely follows an estranged family (Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown) as the actions of an eco-terrorist cell revive a coterie of long-dormant giant monsters hiding beneath the earth. Globe-trotting without feeling like it gets anywhere, packed with quips without being funny, and featuring muddy, messy action devoid of excitement, Godzilla II is a mostly pointless in-between instalment before the inevitable King Kong/Godzilla showdown to come. Rating: Two stars."
"Jul 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Maybe it's time to include Godzilla in the discussion of our richest cinematic franchises.
"Jun 27, 2019",NEGATIVE," It's really hard to tell what kind of movie Godzilla: King of the Monsters wants to be. The predecessor to this garish, nonsensical monster mash, 2014's Godzilla, was a moody take on the famous kaiju, sparing in its depiction of scaly flesh. While some -- including yours truly -- found it dull, it also amassed a vocal critical fanbase. The follow-up seems to nod half-heartedly to artistry, but it's more interested in the brainless crash-bang of a bunch of CGI creatures duking it out. The cast is stacked with otherwise brilliant actors stuck in a borderline incomprehensible plot and forced to play second fiddle to monsters whose powers of wonder wear off fast. This is franchise filmmaking at its most unnecessary, a last gasp to salvage a series that seems to have little chance at survival. Because, yes, this is supposed to be part of a bigger MonsterVerse, all leading up to a showdown between Godzilla and King Kong, the latter of whom was featured in 2017's Kong: Skull Island. Those two don't go at it in King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty, though there are some offhand mentions of the large ape. Instead, this installment features some more wheel-spinning and tedious exposition involving Monarch, the monster research organization that's this franchise's version of Marvel's S.H.I.E.L.D. King of Monsters focuses primarily on the Russells, a family that was caught in the rampage that made up the finale of Gareth Edwards' earlier movie, in which Godzilla battled some Mutos and saved San Francisco, but created a big mess in the process. The stomping beasts killed Mark and Emma Russell's son, and in their grief the couple split. She (Vera Farmiga) went to live on a Monarch research base with their daughter Madison (Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown). Emma has been building a sonic device that can control and subdue the monsters, called Titans. Meanwhile Mark (Kyle Chandler) has dedicated his life to photographing wolves. He's eventually brought back into the fold when Emma and Madison are kidnapped by eco-terrorists led by a scowling leader named Jonah Alan (played by Tywin Lannister, a.k.a. Charles Dance). Except -- in a headache-inducing twist -- that was part of Emma's plan. She's teaming with Jonah against Monarch because she misguidedly thinks she can save the planet by letting the Titans roam free, thinning humanity and its pollution. Like Thanos before her, Emma's ostensibly noble intentions cause a litany of issues issues when it turns out that one of the ancient giants that Monarch has been monitoring, the three-headed King Ghidorah, is especially cruel and powerful, and not willing to submit to Godzilla's more benevolent impulses. If this sounds needlessly confusing, well, it gets worse when you factor in that the script seems cobbled together from various unfinished drafts. It casually drops references to characters and scenarios in a way that assumes the audience has a bigger investment in the narrative the film ever earns. Perhaps the most baffling moment is when it's revealed, with little to no explanation, that Ziyi Zhang plays identical scientists on different sides of the world who may or may not be twins. Speaking of the cast: It's filled to the brim with otherwise excellent performers, most of them either slogging their way through perfunctory technical dialogue or taking the whole mishegoss way too seriously. The only one who seems to know what movie he's in Bradley Whitford, who at least thinks all the nonsense is funny. At times, Dougherty manages to create some arresting images of wings emerging from clouds. There's a big brawl that ends in Boston, of all places -- a Dunkin' sign tragically falls in the fight. Godzilla remains king, Mothra's the queen, and there are a few human casualties. It's not a conclusion that elicits many further questions, but that doesn't mean the studio has skimped on the frustratingly obligatory post-credits scene. In the tag, Dance's Jonah sets out to purchase one of the Ghidorah's heads, implying that it may return for the next round, when presumably Kong will get involved. Like it or not, there will be another film in the Godzilla universe. But at that point -- if you've even made it through the credits -- you'll probably have the same reaction I did: Who cares? King of the Monsters does nothing to prove that the MonsterVerse should continue. When you can't get a crowd excited for kaiju fighting one another, what's the point?

"Jun 24, 2019",POSITIVE," Dirección: Jonah HillReparto: Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Sally HawkinsTítulo en V.O: Godzilla: King of the MonstersPaís: Estados Unidos Año: 2019 Fecha de estreno: 21-06-2019 Género: Fantástico Color o en B/N: Color Guión: Michael Dougherty, Zach Shields Música: Bear McCreary Fotografía: Lawrence SherSinopsis: Los criptozoólogos de la agencia Monarch tratan de enfrentrarse a un grupo de enormes monstruos, incluyendo el propio Godzilla. Entre todos intentan resistir a las embestidas de Mothra, Rodan o del último némesis de la humanidad: King Ghidorah. Estas ancianas criaturas harán todo lo posible por sobrevivir, poniendo en riesgo la existencia del ser humano en el planeta. En un único instante de su farragoso ir y venir tratando de convertir el kaiju eiga nipón en un blockbuster de seria severidad de autor, el Godzilla (2014) de Gareth Edwards comprendía de verdad a sus criaturas mitológicas. Era una escena brillante, en la cual el saurio mítico y ese enemigo mutante ciclópeo que el pánico nuclear había sacado de su letargo se retaban en un plano general visto a ras de suelo, desde el punto de vista de los personajes humanos. En ese glorioso (lamentablemente un oasis entre el resto del pesado metraje) instante, rematado con unos portones inmensos (los de la isla de King Kong, claro), ambos titanes parecían señores disfrazados a punto de arrasar la maqueta de San Francisco. Mike Dougherty, el director de Godzilla: rey de los monstruos sí que entiende este universo, y toda su película es una sucesión de (espectaculares) decorados que parecen la más cara y naíf maqueta jamás soñada; de dioramas ante los que su terceto de dioses terrenales (Godzilla, Rodan y Mothra) y ese otro de origen alienígena (Ghidorah) posan como los luchadores de sumo antes de librarse a peleas de candorosa fisicidad humanoide. Y sus monstruos utilizan toda la última tecnología digital para imitar la textura de especialistas embutidos en disfraces de caucho. Incluso cuando caen en la lid, sus posturas son las que los fans del opus producido por la Toho (también la Daiei, pero esa es otras historia) recuerdan jalear en los cines de barrio disfrutando con esos tipos en traje de fantasía. Gastar más de 240 millones de dólares en replicar esa artificialidad, esa no realidad de infantil inocencia, enfurecerá a muchos espectadores, algunos de ellos enarbolando un purismo sobre el legado del kaiju eiga que demuestra su profunda ignorancia respecto a este. Cualquiera que haya perdido sus dientes de leche y cambiado la voz a base de maratones de esta clase de películas (sobre todo de Los hijos del volcán, a la que Godzilla: rey de los monstruos cita con la generación de gemelas y la conexión telepática) sabe que ese cine no era riguroso, que era infantiloide, poético también, pero que funcionaba sin apenas guión, a trompicones, saltando de escena a escena sin ningún tipo de homogeneidad dramática, tan solo por el amor a la aventura y a dar al público lo que querían.  Mike Dougherty y sus guionistas han hecho un film así: deslavazado, sin conexión entre sus escenas tal como reclamaría la heterodoxia, pero bella y estimulantemente coherente con el alma del kaiju eiga, del opus de su profeta, Ishirô Honda. La acción pasa de un retablo a otro, de una localización a otra, atenta a dibujar ese cuadro inolvidable (las apariciones de Mothra, de Rodan, la resurrección de Godzilla, las luchas cuerpo a cuerpo…) que apela a lo legendario tal y como aquel cine lo imaginaba. Nada importan (como no importaban en los títulos japoneses de los años 60 y 70) las personas, sus dramas y traumas de folletín, en Godzilla: rey de los monstruos. Los seres humanos están siempre a los pies de los titanes, casi como si sus escenas se rodaran ante una colosal pantalla donde, vía retroproyección, tuviera lugar otra película, otra cosa, otro mundo. Es ese mundo, ese universo, el que engrandece el trabajo de Dougherty. Un lugar donde un submarino (por supuesto que el de Latitud cero (Donde el mundo acaba), de Ishirô Honda, 1969) puede llegar a una Atlántida pulp que pocos sabrán apreciar, acaso los mismos entusiastas de Honda, Jun Fukuda, el británico Kevin Connor o nuestro Juan Piquer Simón. Da igual que sean, que seamos, pocos quienes apreciemos todo ese cariño y conocimiento de causa hacia sus seres fantásticos XXXL que derrocha Godzilla: rey de los monstruos.

"Jun 22, 2019",NEGATIVE," Al cine dionisiaco, el que apela a las más bajas pasiones, a la desmesura, a la intrascendencia, a la efervescencia y a la extravagancia, sin mayores ambiciones que las de provocar en la platea un par de horas de exaltación más o menos colectiva, solo hay que pedirle una cosa: que esté bien contado, que esté bien narrado desde el más elemental sentido de la palabra, el que alude a unos personajes, unas situaciones, un tiempo y un lugar, y que todo ello se comprenda. Pero ni eso es capaz de cumplir el espantoso armatoste Godzilla: rey de los monstruos, secuela de aquella Godzilla del año 2014, dirigida por Gareth Edwards, que al menos tenía un puñado de imágenes símbolo de estimable belleza formal. Este kaiju-eiga (ya saben, películas de monstruos nacidas en la cultura japonesa), dirigido y coescrito por Michael Dougherty, confía simplemente en la acumulación, y para mejorar a una criatura tan emblemática como Godzilla cree que solo hace falta sumarle otras: tres monstruos mejor que uno. Sin embargo, Dougherty es incapaz de componer imágenes brillantes, el efecto político del original japonés (Hiroshima y Nagasaki, en el recuerdo) y de alguno de sus renacimientos es aquí ininteligible y, lo peor, nunca acaban de percibirse con nitidez cuáles son los objetivos de los personajes dentro de un panorama en el que el cliché familiar (la hecatombe mundial, la catástrofe de un matrimonio y su hija) supone un elemento más para el sonrojo. Es una lástima que Legendary Pictures y Warner Bros., productores del evento, hayan desterrado del todo el estruendoso sentido del humor y el espíritu de sano gamberrismo de Kong: la isla calavera, segunda entrega de lo que se ha dado en llamar franquicia monsterverso, para apostar por la grandilocuencia, la mirada penetrante y el arqueo de ceja vacuo y pedestre. Si Ray Harryhausen y el Gordon Douglas de La humanidad en peligro (1954) levantaran la cabeza y vieran este trasto de impostada seriedad, no darían crédito."
"Jun 21, 2019",NEUTRAL," It’s a clash of the Titans, literally, as gargantuan monsters battle it out while around them skyscrapers collapse like sand castles and the decibels rise and rise. The 2014 Godzilla managed to step beyond the creature feature with its suspenseful Spielberg-ian homage and (shock horror) character work, but there is little restraint or care here. Everything is dialled up by 300 per cent and it’s unrelenting — which is not necessarily a bad thing if all you’re after is some mindless fights between beasts, like a night out at monster trucks (is that still a thing?). Godzilla’s design has been updated to be more fearsome (he’s obviously been working out), while classic kaiju characters King Ghidorah, Mothra and Rodan are added to the mix. When you can actually see the monsters — because, somewhat inexplicably, every battle is obscured by sleet, storms and smoke — their designs are impressive. When the volcano-dwelling Rodan spins midair, his fiery and expansive wings are really remarkable.  Godzilla II: King of the Monsters’ effects are generally impressive, if you’re willing to suspend the logical part of the brain — I’m pretty sure Millie Bobby Brown gets hit by a concrete slab at one point and just keeps running like it was styrofoam (because it was). The story, because there is one, merely serves as fodder between the Titan smashes, like most commercial TV programming serves as minutes between insurance ads.  In the five years since Godzilla and the two MUTOs destroyed San Francisco, the creature hasn’t been seen by the world. But he has been secretly monitored by Monarch, the organisation connected to these giants for decades. Monarch has also identified 17 other beasts, which they’ve contained in clandestine sites around the world, including at Uluru (presumably this is the monster they call Bunyip). They’re joined by a cast of new characters, including the Russell family — animal behaviour specialist Mark (Kyle Chandler), palaeobiologist Emma (Vera Farmiga) and plucky teen Madison (Brown). The Russells lived in San Francisco at the time of the 2014 attacks and lost their young son Andrew in the process. They’ve since separated. Emma has developed a nifty gadget called the Orca, which can simulate the bioacoustics of the monsters, potentially controlling them with its corresponding “alpha frequency”. When Emma and Madison are kidnapped by a group of ecoterrorists headed by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), Mark is recruited to help locate them and the Orca before all the dormant and captive creatures are let loose. The most odd part about Godzilla II: King of the Monsters is not the number of times characters say “something’s really wrong”, but rather that it managed to sign up so many well-regarded actors, including Chandler, Farmiga, Dance and returnees Hawkins, Strathairn and Watanabe. There are also the likes of Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch (as Monarch employees who provide most of the comic relief), Aisha Hinds and Zhang Ziyi. It’s a really great cast, but the vast majority of them are not given much to do. Watanabe probably has the most compelling scene to play, and Chandler has been aped on by director Michael Dougherty to go much bigger than he needs to. The movie, and the promotional tour, will tell you Godzilla II: King of the Monsters is a fable about environmental degradation and human destruction — and there’s a speech by one character that could’ve been a word-by-word pep talk from Avengers’ Thanos. Blah blah, natural balance, blah blah. But it doesn’t hit those notes particularly well. It tries but then gives up and goes back to the monster fighting. Which is … fine, I guess? Godzilla was created in the 1950s in response to nuclear weapons and the bombs dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and many of the Toho movies since then have had a subtext at play. This one works better when it forgets it’s trying to have one. Sometimes you have to be honest about the movie you really are — smashy smash. The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event."
"Jun 18, 2019",POSITIVE," Let’s get this out of the way first: In a movie that includes a tri-headed dragon and a Nakatomi plaza-sized spider, Mark (Kyle Chandler) is easily the most grotesque monstrosity. This dude is introduced to us while he’s shooting B-roll wolf footage for a knockoff Planet Earth. Yet somehow, within minutes, he’s bossing around the entire global military on Armageddon eve. Mothra vomits sticky webs, but Mark’s mansplaining is the vilest thing to come out of any mouth in the entirety of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which is otherwise a damn good monster-stravaganza. Ever see what you’re convinced is a terrifying murderer in your home, only to realize that it’s nothing more than an article of recklessly discarded clothing disguised by poor lighting? That’s what screenwriter Zach Shields and writer/director Michael Dougherty have done with the plot here. Wisely, there isn’t one. Oh sure, it looks like there’s a plot. There just isn’t. Bad eco-terrorists reawaken long-dormant monsters hiding around the world to restore “balance to the planet.” Godzilla fights those monsters while being alternatingly helped and hindered by humans and Mothra. (colorreflections.com)  That’s not a plot. That’s nothing more than set-up for long-overdue, glorious Kaiju fetishization. Hooray! When it comes to intricately detailed toys, imagination should ideally spark just as vibrantly when posing them as when smashing them into one another. Dougherty and company get that. They spend significant time having Rodan, King Ghidorah, Mothra and the titular G-man preen and flex in atmospheric lighting. It is somehow both beautiful and blissfully cheesy. The creature design for Ghidorah resembles early Harryhausen stop-motion designs. Mothra is somehow equally endearing and terrifying. Rodan murders planes like he’s being controlled by a malevolent, giant, invisible toddler. Godzilla has an atomic seizure. Admittedly, they only fight each other a few times, but the film never strays its gaze too far from them. Remember: You can only blow your action figures up with firecrackers once. A legion of typically insightful detractors have somehow surprisingly blasted Godzilla: King of the Monsters for leaning too hard into the humans and away from the creatures. Maybe it felt that way to some, but it’s literally just untrue. The film doesn’t go 10 consecutive minutes—most often less than 5—without a monster on screen. From the opening sequence to the final frames, it is chock-a-block with Kaiju juju. The job of the humans is to give the camera a ride to the next monster sequence. In its understandable obsession to prioritize the monster squad, Godzilla: King of the Monsters admittedly fails to synthesize a thesis worthy of the franchise. It’s entirely possible that the American psyche simply does not easily permit the kind of condemnations of hubris and militarization that are trademarks of the best works in the series. Likewise, making villains out of those who legitimately fear for the planet’s extinction may be a misguided narrative tactic at a moment when the United States is ghosting the global movement against the climate crisis. However, what Dougherty and company have done here is fairly stunning. Not since the original Jurassic Park have massive CGI creatures felt this majestic and menacing. Long after memories of Mark’s whining and interrupting have faded, the sound of Godzilla firing up his electrical barf will remain. Please note: If one annoying character is able to ruin everything for you, you’re going to have a very exhausting road to November 2020."
"Jun 18, 2019",NEUTRAL," ¿Puede ser sutil un monstruo gigante? Hace cinco años, Gareth Edwards se empeñó en probar que sí. Y, aunque la jugada distó de salirle perfecta, su Godzilla logró al menos que el viejo reptil recuperara, a base de drama y conspiranoia, parte de la dignidad que Roland Emmerich le había arrebatado en 1998. Qué noble esfuerzo. Y qué lástima que Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos llegue ahora para mandar sus logros al traste. La película de Michael Dougherty (coguionista junto a Zach Shields) aspira a recrear los fiestones kaiju de cintas como Los monstruos invaden la Tierra. Y, empeñado en llenar la pantalla de criaturas demoledoras, olvida que estas no bastan para sostener un filme. No es ya que su libreto, estructurado según las arcanas leyes del desbarajuste, sea incapaz de transmitirnos las motivaciones de sus personajes humanos: es que tampoco sabe hacernos ver las de esos monstruos que se enfrentan en escenas repletas de un caos que no es ni estimulante ni abrumador, sino solo confuso. Por otra parte, mientras el tratamiento dispensado al personaje de Vera Farmiga hace preguntarse si Un Tío Blanco Hetero ha trabajado aquí como asesor,  la cinta se permite relegar a toda una señora Mothra, pese a su importancia en la mitología godzilliana. Así pues, uno abandona la sala deseando revisar Shin Godzilla (Hideaki Anno, 2016): tal vez ese filme, última excursión del bicho en su país natal, sea cruel e irritante, pero al menos es fiel a sí mismo y a su criatura. La agencia criptozoológica MONARCA se enfrenta al mayor desafío de la historia: una invasión de monstruos gigantes en la que Godzilla se enfrenta a una variedad de criaturas como Rodan, Mothra o su némesis, King Gidorah. Los mitos se alzan de nuevo, y la supervivencia de la humanidad pende de un hilo.

"Jun 18, 2019",POSITIVE," ‘Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos’ llega este viernes a los cines españoles con tres semanas de retraso respecto a su estreno en Estados Unidos. Allí no ha funcionado tan bien en taquilla como se esperaba de ella, dejando en duda la continuidad del Monsterverse con el que Warner pretendía emular una vez más a Marvel. La película parece una respuesta directa a aquellos que se quejaron de que el monstruo no aparecía lo suficiente en ‘Godzilla’, una notable superproducción que se centraba más en ver los efectos que provocaba el resurgir de la bestia en la población que en su lado más devastador. Aquí eso cambia y se apuesta por una sobredosis de destrucción que arrasa con todo a su paso. El resultado es inferior a su predecesora -y también a ‘Kong: La isla calavera’- pero como pasatiempo también tiene su lado positivo. Michael Dougherty da el salto a la primera línea de Hollywood con ‘Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos’ tras las muy estimables comedias de terror ‘Truco o trato’ y ‘Krampus: Maldita navidad’, por lo que uno podría esperar de su elección que el humor tuviera una presencia importante en el relato. Podéis ir olvidándoos de eso más allá de alguna puya aislada entre personajes secundarios. Aquí prima un tono dramático, marcado desde el inicio por el potente prólogo que marca las motivaciones de la familia protagonista. A partir de ahí la película da un pequeño paso atrás en términos de intensidad para luego ir creciendo sin control hasta que todo se convierte en casi un videojuego con criaturas gigantes dándose de leches y destrozando todo a su paso. Esa faceta destructiva es lo más estimulante de la película, ya que es cierto que se tiende a una ambientación visual más oscura, probablemente para no tener que realizar una inversión aún más gigantesca en efectos visuales -se estima que ha costado la friolera de 170 millones de dólares- sin que eso suponga renunciar a la avalancha de monstruos sembrando el caos. Aquí pesa más la cantidad que los esfuerzos porque cada una de esas escenas luzcan de la forma más vigorosa posible -se echa en falta la exquisita planificación visual de Gareth Edwards para algunas escenas de 'Godzilla'-. Luego a la hora de la verdad son muy pocas las que tienen una relevancia real en el devenir de los acontecimientos, pero aporta cierta variedad para que uno no se canse de ver a los mismos monstruos enfrentándose una y otra vez hasta que todo se zanja de forma definitiva. Además, todas son impresionantes visualmente y abordando la película desde una perspectiva más sencilla es fácil dejarse llevar por el derroche de efectos visuales. El problema lo encontramos con los personajes humanos, pues es cierto que ‘Godzilla’ adolecía de unos protagonistas sin la entidad suficiente para liderar el relato a partir de la desaparición de cierto personaje, pero a cambio ofrecía una visión global más estimulante del drama humano. Aquí la humanidad en sí misma es algo inconcreto que en la que solamente se hace hincapié para ver cómo se intenta rescatar a un grupo de anónimos o para incidir en el drama de algunos de los personajes principales. Una decisión que en sí misma no es negativa, pero que ayuda a dejar más al descubierto las limitaciones del guion firmado por Dougherty y Zach Shields. Algo me dice que no gozaron de la libertad adecuada para explorar la historia, ya que cuesta asumir que de su mente salgan diálogos tan planos, como si fueran fruto de la plantilla resultante del acuerdo de un comité. Eso daña la película, pero no de forma irreparable. Lo que sí provoca de forma innegable es una inestabilidad dramática, bajando el interés cuando la historia tiene que centrarse de forma inevitable en ellos y además restando empaque a las grandes catarsis emocionales de la película. Momentos con una fuerza innegable que no consiguen el impacto deseado por todo el lastre que la película había ido acumulando con anterioridad. En definitiva, ‘Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos’ funciona como entretenimiento al que no pedirle más que ver a monstruos arrasando con todo. El resto no pasa de prescindible en el mejor de los casos, pero hay tantísimo momento de combate entre criaturas o sembrando el caos que personalmente sí me ha merecido la pena.

"Jun 17, 2019",NEGATIVE," Since franchises and “universes” are the rage in Hollywood, this is Legendary Entertainment’s attempt to get in on the action.  Godzilla II: King of the Monsters marks the third film in the series following on from two reboots, Godzilla (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017).  If you’re wondering where it goes next, prepare yourself for Godzilla vs. Kong which is slated for release in March 2020. As for this film… it picks things up about 5 years after the original.  The world now knows that monsters are real and the political fall-out has been huge.  That’s particularly evident within a government-run organisation known as Monarch.  It was originally established to locate and destroy monsters to ensure mankind remains the dominant species.  There’s now a differing view held by some within Monarch that the monsters (or most of them) are friendly and to kill them would disrupt the world’s natural order. It turns out there are roughly 17 monsters on the planet, including Godzilla, and a team of scientists have been studying their genetic composition.  It may sound ridiculously dangerous but the monsters are in a hibernating state.  A catalyst is required to create drama and it comes in the form of an eco-terrorist (Dance) with confusing motives.  On one hand, he wants to make money by trading monster DNA but that seems counterproductive considering he wants to kill most living things on the planet. In the same vein as the 2014 film, I’d argue that the human characters in this movie have the charisma of a wet sponge.  They’re a dull, boring group of people who between them, magically have the answer for every problem.  It’s part of the reason why there’s so little tension in the movie.  These characters should have died countless times but help and/or good fortune always arrives at the last possible moment.  The only actor worthy of a mention is Bradley Whitford (The West Wing) who adds a splash of comedy to break up the tedium. It’s the monsters who should have provided all the excitement but writer-director Michael Dougherty struggles to creating something meaningful amongst the chaos.  We can see a myriad of monsters duking it out (the three-headed dragon looked cool) but it’s largely the same stuff from scene-to-scene.  I wish I’d kept count of how many buildings were destroyed.  I’m sure there were humans in them but it’s best not to think about that."
"Jun 15, 2019",NEGATIVE," Of the nine films currently showing in local cinemas, six of them are either giant studio-remakes or sequels. It’s typical of the last few months, where trips to the cinemas may have triggered feelings of déjà vu, with some equation of superhero-sequel or Disney sequel/remake or monster remake commanding the majority of screens. This week, two continuing releases continue to thrive at the local box-office. “Dark Phoenix,” the seventh film in Fox’s main X-Men series is in its second week of release against “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a quasi-sequel to the 2014 “Godzilla” which is part of another newly extended universe that will see Godzilla battling with King Kong in the near future. In 2014, director Gareth Edwards’ sombre “Godzilla” was antithetical to the immediate spectacle of the franchise as it opted instead for a muted aesthetic. It worked to good effect for me, despite the criticisms of too little time with the titular monster. Michael Dougherty’s direction in “King of the Monsters” seems intent on course-correcting this sombre predecessor. And not for the better. This new film picks up five years after the first, in a world where Godzilla and titans like him are known and studied. The (mostly) new cast of characters are dealing with the fallout and ramifications of living alongside these ancient monsters, whose powers have been reignited and exacerbated by human interference. It’s a thoughtful, if familiar, science-fiction plot-point – human folly precipitating apocalypse. And, in its way, it’s a hook that announces “King of the Monsters” as vaguely conscious of the role of humanity in a world of fantasy: humanity as both destroyers and saviours of the world. Except, despite this marginally thoughtful hook, plot and ideas are negligible in “King of the Monsters.” The film ostensibly surrounds paleobioligist Emma Russell, whose research and skill has been able to lead to the construction of a device that communicates with the titans. Although the film nods to a plot in Dr Russell having lost a child in the battle that ended the 2014 film, “King of the Monsters” is all about the monsters. We meet our first titan ten minutes into the film and it keeps launching news ones at us until the final battle sequence that sees Godzilla in a gargantuan face off with Ghidorah, an alien monster.  That final battle is a brawl that gives you all the high-energy thrills you could want from such a thing. It offers exactly the promised CGI-centred spectacle one expects from the franchise. But, the deployment of the battle also feels perfunctory and oddly dull in ways that represent “King of the Monsters” strange inability to sustain tension over the course of its run-time.  This issue is exacerbated when the human story takes over, with the majority of characters teetering between rote existences and preening tedium. Their incapacity to ground the (large amounts of the) film when they are the focus kills the momentum. But it is also doesn’t help that the consistent focus on the monsters makes the final battle lose some of the thrill of discovery since we’ve already seen them do so much. By the time we reach the would-be climactic end, we feel exhausted and just want it to be over. Within the film’s unsatisfying trajectory, the real titan is Vera Farmiga, who harnesses her acting prowess to superheroic heights in the role of Dr Russell to force some sort of emotional resonance and sense into this thing. Her final lines in the film make a valiant attempt to make this all worth it. She does not succeed. But her attempts are valiant and compelling enough to make the film around her more credible. Luckily, “Dark Phoenix” fares better, even if critical response has been unkind. In this final film of the X-Men series, Jean Grey earns her own film as she must deal with her growing powers after a space mission goes awry. At first, “Dark Phoenix” seems like it may be biting off more than it can chew. The film’s opening, which (perhaps inadvertently) mimics the opening of the enjoyable “Shazam” from earlier this year, gave me pause. It has to work as a story of Jean Grey while functioning as an X-Men film, and that seems like a whole lot for a film like this to cover. And the opening scenes struggle a bit at building the world – Jean Grey’s ambivalence, the team’s ennui, and Professor Xavier’s pride at making mutants accepted tipping over into carelessness. But, by the time the film creates its first crisis – a solar flare envelopes Grey, making her inexplicably stronger – things get better. “Dark Phoenix” is able to satisfy both sides of desire; it is compelling as an examination of that familiar superheroic ambivalence we’ve seen a lot of lately but also thoughtful in its examination of the isolation of being a hero, and the value of found families and (yes) the value of love. Certainly, the central thesis here is overly familiar. We know this story. And in this way, “Dark Phoenix” is not doing something particularly new for superhero stories, or stories of families. The expectation for the series to end on something explicitly unique may make what it is doing seem banal. What it is doing is crafting a narrative that depends, emphatically, on emotion and sensitivity that’s buoyed by spectacles that complement its story. The film is aided by a stunning sound design that cultivates the sounds of fury and rage with stunning effect. Sophie Turner (of “Game of Thrones” fame) is, in some ways, riffing on her familiar performance as Sansa Stark. There is much of Sansa Stark in Grey’s own emotional journey, and even as the protagonist Jean is not the most dynamic player in her story. But it’s that earnest sincerity that “Dark Phoenix” has going for it. The film may seem to tremble at the umpteenth scene of Xavier extolling the all-conquering power of love to his team, and even though he and director Simon Kinberg seem to believe that, the “Dark Phoenix” is nuanced enough to recognise that love is always complicated and sometimes unsatisfying. In this way, this sort of humble focus may seem muted for the end of a franchise, especially in the wake of the way the recent “Endgame” ended, with pomp and ceremony. Jean Grey is not necessarily a character one would extract as central to the series, and “Dark Phoenix” exacerbates that potential issue by pairing her with a villain who is more schematic and illusory than one would hope. But, it’s all towards an end-result that privileges the small-scale, ragtag camaraderie of the series and these group of characters. “Dark Phoenix” feels thoughtful and meditative in a way that surprised and left me surprisingly moved when the credits rolled."
"Jun 15, 2019",NEUTRAL," Somehow, Legendary Pictures found a way to totally muck up the greatest Godzilla premise ever with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a movie that is all things great and terrible at the same time. This movie has some terrific monster battles in it, and the special effects are mind-bogglingly good. Godzilla squares off against such legendary foes as multiheaded Monster Zero and Rodan, while getting some much needed assistance from the great Mothra. All of these monsters, including the title character, are wonders to behold when on screen. As for the internet bitching about the movie’s appearance being dark and murky, I think the darkness was fitting, made things scarier, and didn’t diminish the effects. But, and this is a big but, I cannot endorse this movie overall. The human stuff in between and during the fighting is dreadful. Homo sapiens get too much screen time. The writing and staging for that screen time is so bad that the film derails every time it goes to military types in a war room. The plot has the world in a state of disarray after the 2014 attacks on San Francisco and Las Vegas depicted in the last Godzilla movie. OK, that’s kind of cool. How do we dust ourselves off and find a way to coexist with the likes of Godzilla and big monster moth things after the decimation of the Bay Area? Apparently, according to writer-director Michael Dougherty (Krampus), we deliver inane dialogue real slow-like, and inexplicably play with a sonar gadget that supposedly calls out to the monsters in a manner that either chills them out or fires them up. That gadget is created by Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who lost a child in the San Francisco attack and is attempting to talk to the monsters with her daughter (Millie Bobby Brown), while Dr. Russell’s husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler), is off taking pictures on safari. Once the gadget thing sends out a call that basically kicks off the monster apocalypse, the action goes from nicely staged monster battles featuring beautiful close ups and battered landscapes, to a bunch of lost actors sitting around in a situation room observing and commenting. Bradley Whitford basically gets the Jake Johnson-in-Jurassic World role. That is, he’s the nerdy guy cracking wise from afar while monsters eat people and military folks scratch their heads. While Johnson had crack line delivery and some honestly funny moments, Whitford looks like the victim of a director who said, “Hey, Bradley, say some funny shit about monsters!” and Whitford had nothing. Brown is OK here, but there’s not much one can do with material so bad. She has the movie’s dopiest moment. When fleeing Monster Zero as it’s destroying Fenway Park, Godzilla comes up behind her, and she turns and posts a calm, satisfied smile. No paralyzing fear, no screaming in terror at being in between two massive charging monsters. Just one, calm, movie star smile, because Godzilla might be her friend or some shit like that. Give me a break. Brown has already completed her shots for Godzilla vs. Kong, due out next year, so she’s not escaping this franchise. Dougherty, who messed this movie up, had low grade, OK horror films (Krampus, Trick ’r Treat) on his resume. The next film’s director, Adam Wingard, is also a director of horror films (You’re Next and the awful Blair Witch reboot). Also, Dougherty, who co-wrote this messy movie, contributes on the next film as well. Not good signs. Perhaps Legendary should stop putting large blockbusters such as this into the hands of relatively new and mediocre horror film directors. They got it right with Gareth Edwards on Godzilla (2014). They blew it with Dougherty, and I fear for the future. If you are uninitiated, as I was, this movie will come off as a useless blur. If you love you some Pokémon, perhaps you won’t hate it."

"Jun 14, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla: King of the Monsters pits the assorted scientists and soldiers of Monarch – the secret government crypto-zoological agency tasked with studying the creatures – against a plethora of gargantuan monsters. The monstrous menagerie in­cludes Godzilla itself, and newbies Mothra, Rodan, and the supreme­ly powerful three-headed Ghidorah. As the members of Monarch prepare for the ultimate battle to save mankind, they begin to suspect that the monsters’ intentions may not be merely blind destruction but something more intelligent – and ultimately necessary.  From its opening scenes to the final showdown between the two behemoths, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a mess of a movie. It starts with the discovery that many of these monsters have lain dormant in oceans’ depths around the world, then a device that communicates with the monsters is introduced, and then there’s the ultimate theory that Godzilla may actually be causing the destruction purposely to balance the forces of nature (a theme visited with much more success, nuance and believability in the final two Avengers’ movies). It’s a disjointed and poorly-written plot, hurried and incoherent and exacerbated by the deafening cacophony of the action scenes that come at the audience thick and fast. Not that any of this is badly done. With the technology available nowadays, it is rare to have sub-standard CG effects in a film like this. Fans of the monsters will have a ball but it doesn’t disguise the lack of coherent plot narrative or engaging character development that many audiences may expect. Speaking of characters, the extensive ensemble for the most part faff around exchanging dialogue that is peppered with pseudo-scientific mumbo jum­bo. The extensive cast of familiar faces feels like a throwback to the disaster movies so prevalent in the 1970s – à la The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. Naff those films may have been, but at least the cast of characters in them were given a chance to leave some emotional impact. No such luck here. They all do their best, yet they have little meat to chew on from the script by director Michael Dougherty, which he co-wrote with Zach Shields. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown (probably the best thing in the movie) play a family torn apart by the events around them. Bradley Whitford does his usual quippy thing, Sally Hawkins is completely wasted – before disappearing, Charles Dance does the British baddy piece, and Ken Watanabe as Dr Ishiro Serizawa and Zhang Ziyi as Dr Ilene Chen respectively seem to be there to do little more than add international flavour. That first Godzilla film – actual title Gojira – has become a cult classic, not because of its depiction of the creature and its destructive nature, but more importantly for its bleak and powerful message about the tragedy of nuclear war – this was less than a decade after the cataclysmic events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Somewhat predictably, that message has been diluted over the decades – to the point that here, the use of nuclear weapons is celebrated as a good thing, with nary a hint of subtlety or solemnity about their repercussions. The Hustle (Classification 12A) – Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson star as female scam artists – one low rent and the other high class, who team up to take down the men who have wronged them. Ma (Classification 15) – A lonely woman befriends a group of teenagers and decides to let them party at her house. Just when the kids think their luck couldn’t get any better, things start happening that make them question the intention of their host.

"Jun 11, 2019",NEUTRAL," Legendary Entertainment has super-sized the sequel to its 2014 hit with three “new” monsters, all of which originated in the imagination of Godzilla creator Toho. It’s hard to recall another action fantasy in which nuclear fission is employed so liberally, and with such little attention to the consequences — apart, perhaps, from King of the Monster’s immediate predecessor. Ghidorah is a formidable opponent who draws his elemental power from ancient folklore as well as the surrounding weather patterns. He doesn’t breathe fire, he blasts it. For Godzilla’s close-ups, Legendary’s animators render the prehistoric alpha predator in loving textural detail; this uber-lizard feels as though he’s been hewn from the very rocks of existence. The utter futility of this tactical response is brought home by the scene in which an ant-sized pilot ejects from his fighter plane, only to land in one of Ghiborah’s open mouths. With all that combined technical nous, all those hours spent in the animation lab, all those dollars spent, it seems almost inconceivable that nobody bothered to pay close attention to the dialogue. “Hold on,” says scientist and absent father Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), when Ghiborah’s tail thwacks down, spinning the getaway helicopter onto the edge of an icy abyss. And while Vera Farmiga (The Conjuring) is the sort of actress who can add a touch of class to any genre, she struggles to make an impression here. But while the scene in which Godzilla belches radiation in his final showdown with Ghiborah is a whole lot of fun, it doesn’t offer a lot of hope for Boston’s post-apocalyptic regeneration. The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event."
"Jun 10, 2019",POSITIVE," While not as thematically rich as its predecessor, Godzilla: King of the Monsters dials up the Kaiju action as it delivers stunning visual action sequences and awe inspiring Godzilla moments that will please most fans.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Kyle Chandler as Mark Russell,  Vera Farmiga as Dr. Emma Russell, Millie Bobby Brown as Madison Russell and Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. Directed by Michael Dougherty and distributed by Warner Bros, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the direct sequel to 2014’s Godzilla and the followup to 2017’s Kong: Skull Island. Part of the wider MonsterVerse, Godzilla: King of the Monsters tells the story of the fallout of 2014’s Godzilla and how characters have changed due to the climactic event, how the world reacts to Titans and the wider implications of Godzilla’s place on the Earth.  One of the reasons why 2014’s Godzilla was praised was Gareth Edwards’ commitment to showing Godzilla from a human perspective. Making his presence feel larger than life and only using him a limited amount was effective but left more to be desired from longtime Kaiju fans. Godzilla: King of the Monsters takes the opposite approach to this. Instead of focusing on the human element and the interaction between man and Godzilla, this time the Titans have motivations of their own as they battle for control of the Earth to either protect it, or destroy it. While the human characters end up suffering because of this, fans of Godzilla won’t care much as the titans are firmly put in the forefront to the story and the action superseded the plot.  The true ‘king’ of Godzilla: King of the Monsters are the Titans themselves. Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidorah and Rodan all shine and have stunning moments accompanied with a strong score and almost impeccable VFX work. From the icy terrain of the arctic rain soaked battles in Boston, Godzilla: King of the Monsters lets the Titans roam free and in turn provide a stunning backdrop for the Titians to do what they do best, destruct. The chief battle of the film is between the Apex predators of Godzilla and King Ghidorah. Ghidorah, who can command the other Titans of Earth to destroy while Godzilla commands them to save the Earth causes a strong sense of tension and drama between these mythic beasts. Pleasant surprises of the film included Mothra, whose Wonder Woman like entrances and moments highlight some of the best moments of the film. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is firmly rooted in a larger cinematic world involving these Titans. The third film in what looks to be a 4 film story, Godzilla: King of the Monsters sets up a lot of seeds for the franchise’s future, namely for 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong. While it does succeed in planting the threads to which the future films will spin off of, one can hope that the future films will keep the human plot threads to an even greater minimum and just let Kong and Godzilla run the show in the IMAX spectacle it is meant to be.  Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a solid summer blockbuster experience. In a world where superhero franchises are king and other blockbusters have trouble finding their footing, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has the potential to possibly add another player to the battle for King of the Blockbusters."
"Jun 10, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla: King of the Monsters will satisfy those  looking for a giant-sized monster bash, yet itâs the human element that weighs  down this colossal titan from becoming king of the monster movie. The relationship between man and beast has always been  vital in the giant monster movie genre. One cannot think of King Kong without Fay Wray coming to mind as well. The reason is obvious: these colossal  creatures â although intimidating and awe-inspiring â do not drive a story or give  it any depth. They are the superstar player on the champion winning team. Yet  that team goes nowhere without those role players putting in the grunt work. There  is no terror if the stakes â primal, emotional, human â are not in play. For Godzilla:  King of the Monsters, those stakes are minimal at best.  That is not to say that a good show cannot be presented.  Directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus) this second instalment in  Legendary Films Godzilla reboot franchise is as spectacularly big and loud  as they come, a blockbuster in name and size that features our favourite  rampaging titans throwing down with wild abandon, setting up a shared universe  with a promise of Godzilla v King Kong down the road. But then the humans start talking. Yes, there is nothing like  the domestic first world problems of an incredibly dysfunctional family to put  a damper on the glory of watching a nuclear fuelled lizard monster take on a  three headed dragon alien giant. This âhumanâ element is like a pesky infection  attacking its host. The personification of this is found in the Russell family,  consisting of shouty angry scientist dad Mark (Kyle Chandler), quiet yet  manipulative scientist mum Emma (Vera Farmiga), and emotionally confused  teenage wannabe scientist Madison (Milly Bobby Brown). Their squabble is over  an invention that can control the mind and mood of these colossal creatures  battling for dominion of the Earth, which is in the hands of eco-terrorist  Jonah Alan (Charles Dance in automatic villain mode). Rounding out the human  cast is Ken Wattanabe as kaigu expert/groupie Ishiro; David Strathairn and his cement  faced scowl; and a blink and you will miss her Sally Hawkins.  The human drama sub-plot is not only forgettable, but annoying  in its distraction from the real show on offer: super-duper giant monsters laying  waste to one another and the world. It is here that Godzilla: King of the  Monsters is a success. Doughtery, along with the VFX wizards from the Moving  Picture Company (among others), and an excellent sound team deliver giant-sized  action set pieces that will rattle-bones and make mouths a-gap. Godzilla has never  looked as ferocious, and a plethora of iconic monster characters (including Mothra  and King Ghidorah) all make an impact both frightful and stunning. A shared universe is in place here, and there is much potential  for it to be good. All is needed is for those pesky humans to sit a few rounds  out, and let these titans do what they do. "

FILM REVIEW – GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS. With Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Bradley Whitford, Charles Dance. Written by Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields. Directed by Michael Dougherty. Rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction, and for some language. 131 minutes.  There are some interesting ideas and strong actors playing around in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, but they’re doomed trying to compete against Godzilla, just like the kaiju alumni he battles. (Kaiju is the name for the Japanese genre of giant monster movies.) The result is a movie that probably could have been much shorter, since we’re really only there for the special effects. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a scientist working on a project dealing with the giant monsters, whom she believes are an important part of Earth’s ecosystem. At the start of the film, she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown of “Stranger Things”) are kidnapped by a mysterious terrorist group led by Jonah Allen (Charles Dance). The government turns to her ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), who had abandoned the project she’s continued, to help find her. He’s more concerned with rescuing his daughter. It turns out the terrorists are looking to unleash Mothra, Rodan, and the three-headed King Ghidora to lay waste to civilization. Who can battle such creatures? Why it’s Godzilla, who has appeared in various forms in Japanese cinema – many of which have made it to the U.S., although the original “Gojira” (1954) was re-edited with added scenes featuring American actors. The film plays with environmental issues and family psychodrama, and even has some well-known characters actors in small roles like Bradley Whitford, Joe Morton, CCH Pounder, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. None of it really matters. The thin script ties up most of the loose ends, while leaving a few threads for a sequel, including the promised showdown with King Kong, which is teased here as it was at the end of “Kong: Skull Island” (2017). The problem is that the appearance of four giant monsters leaves less time for plot and character development, which gave “Skull” its flavor. Here you just want to sit back and enjoy the monsters. There are nods to the earlier films – such as the twins associated with Mothra – but it’s all just marking time until the main event, which is Godzilla battling King Ghidorah at Fenway Park. Yes, that’s right. Dr. Russell’s home base is Boston and the device used to lure the monsters is broadcast over the public address system at the stadium, using the open-air park as a giant transmitting dish. Some effort went into making Fenway look like the real thing, but once the monsters start trashing Boston it looks more like a generic city than any specific location. Daniel M.

"Jun 8, 2019",NEGATIVE," Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla was pretty good. It wasn’t bad. Not excellent but better than Matthew Broderick in the rain. It caught some flak for holding back on the titular beast and instead opting for a human story – and killing Bryan Cranston off pretty quickly too. Now, Trick ‘r Treat director Michael Dougherty takes the chair for this follow up in the Monsterverse that boasted a stunning marketing campaign and the promise of more monsters! The trailers depicted this visually outstanding epic – honestly, some of the trailer shots looked like pure paintings – and Godzilla: King of the Monsters rocketed up people’s hype lists (also piggybacking off of the success of peer Kong: Skull Island). Unfortunately for ‘Zilla fans and for Michael Dougherty – Godzilla: KOTM is awful. It’s really not good which is a massive shame as I was one of those who was amped for this. A lack of Godzilla itself is a claim that cannot be levelled at this movie - he’s everywhere - shooting that blue flame stuff at anything that gets in his way – and his massive monster friends and foes are along for the ride – King Ghidorah (a three-headed dragon beast), Rodan (a flying beast) and Mothra (a giant…moth). The beasties themselves look great and, unsurprisingly, deliver the highlights of the movie with their titanic battles – Ghidorah especially was ace – the problem is this time the humans are side-lined completely and become simple plot devices. Everyone is underdeveloped or stereotyped and, to be honest, I wasn’t bothered if they got chomped or not. Kyle Chandler is the limpest hero committed to screen in a long time, Vera Farmiga had dollar signs in her eyes and Millie Bobby Brown became more annoying as the movie rolled on (that facial overacting was something else). The company behind it all, Monarch (they track own all the titans and have done since 2014’s Godzilla), now just seem like a collection of Austin Powers baddies in their lair and are on Jurassic World-levels of uninteresting villains and corporations. With all of that, I doubt it’ll come as a surprise to know that the writing throughout is atrocious – to the point where the characters literally spell out what is happening. It’s mind-numbing even for a movie like this. One of the soldiers delivered the line “What the f*** is that?!” upon Ghidorah’s intro and it was probably the best acting/delivery in the movie. When the subpar dialogue is mixed with overly-long CGI fights, things get very tedious very quickly. The majority of the action is just fine, but by the end, it stretched out for too long and became almost boring. Whilst the score was good, Godzilla: KOTM is a prominent case of style over substance. Things look great but there’s nothing to cling to behind the visuals. Three movies into this Monsterverse and we’re at an impasse. Godzilla was decent, Kong: Skull Island, too, was decent and this was awful. So, next up? Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020. Despite Godzilla: KOTM being a toilet blocker, it’s hard not to get just a wee bit excited at that title, however, can they balance the human drama with the all-out action? We’ll see and Adam Wingard is tasked with the job (eek…). Surely it can’t be any worse than this massive let down. Bigger isn’t always better and that’s absolutely the case with this monstrous disappointment."
"Jun 8, 2019",POSITIVE," When it comes to the cinema of the 2010s, the 2014 Godzilla is The Manchurian Candidate of my moviegoing experience. I know I saw it — I have the review right here in front of me — but damn if I can recall any of the particulars. In the immortal words of that esteemed 20th century philosopher Curly Howard, “I’m trying to think but nothing happens!” Yet if I scrunch my brain really hard, I vaguely recall Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a particularly boring hero, Bryan Cranston as his grumpy dad, and a Godzilla whose pot belly suggested he had spent the past few years guzzling Kirin Ichiban or Sapporo Draft while lounging on the ocean floor. Nothing else surfaces beyond that, although I do remember it being superior to 1998’s terrible Godzilla vs. Ferris Bueller, in which the oversized lizard was no match for Matthew Broderick’s incessant schtick. Indeed, glancing over my review of the ’14 model, it appears I mildly enjoyed it but found no compelling reason to see it again. I expect to hold a similar reaction to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the latest in the MonsterVerse (Christ, what a daft name) franchise that began with the 2014 Godzilla and continued with 2017’s Kong: Skull Island. It’s fairly engaging in the moment, but there’s absolutely no reason to ever want to revisit it. Like all films of this nature, the real battle isn’t between the monsters duking it out with each other but between the excitement of the creature-feature scenes and the banality of the copious sequences focusing on the human protagonists. It isn’t always a losing battle: In the 1954 classic Gojira (the original Japanese version, not the depoliticized 1956 American edit released as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!), the segments centering on the humans were charged with the picture’s overriding theme of nuclear devastation, lending urgency to the plight of a people coping with the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki less than 10 years removed from the bombing. Godzilla would morph from villain to hero in later series installments — heck, he would even sire a baby boy named Minilla (not to be confused with the equally nauseating Milli Vanilli) — but here in Gojira, the title behemoth is collectively Fat Man and Little Boy, and his towering presence over Tokyo triggers a queasy flashback for the city’s citizens. With the 2014 Godzilla and now Godzilla: King of the Monsters, there’s an effort to add import to the human sequences by invoking global warming, overpopulation and other manmade disasters at every turn. But it never sticks the landing as effectively as the nuclear angle in the original, largely because the filmmakers spend too much time on personal relationships that aren’t very compelling. In 2014, it was Taylor-Johnson’s soldier and Cranston’s activist; now, it’s Kyle Chandler’s Mark Russell and Vera Farmiga’s Emma Russell, a divorced couple whose marriage was destroyed following the death of their young son during the monsters’ rampage five years ago. Mark has gone off grid while Emma looks after their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) even as she works on a device that she hopes will allow humans to control the Titans (i.e. Godzilla and the planet’s other ancient gods). Employed by the monster-watch outfit Monarch, Emma is kidnapped by eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), which leads Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Grahame (returning actors Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) to contact Mark in order to fashion a rescue attempt. What happens next is a betrayal so ludicrous that, when one character yells at the turncoat, “You’re out of your mind!” they should instead be yelling, “You’re an absolute imbecile!” since the plan that’s put into motion (and the reasons behind it) is beyond moronic. Nevertheless, this plot pirouette largely triggers the critter skirmishes that involve Godzilla and other kaiju such as Mothra, Rodan, and the all-powerful King Ghidorah. Ever since my youth, when I first caught him in the 1968 all-star creature romp Destroy All Monsters, the three-headed Ghidorah always struck me as the most dynamic of all Toho grotesqueries. His appearance in Godzilla: King of the Monsters does not disappoint, and he remains a terrifying entity. The CGI work on display in this picture is particularly robust, with all of the marquee monsters rendered in stunning fashion. And when they get ready to rumble, there’s enough body-slamming, head-biting, and limb-twisting to satisfy all kaiju groupies (and, presumably, wrestling devotees as well). Indeed, fans of Godzilla: King of the Monsters will praise the picture for its monster-on-monster action, and they’ll be correct. But detractors will condemn it for its human interludes, and they’ll be equally right. A bingo card of clichés would quickly be filled with such soggy lines as “We opened Pandora’s box, and there’s no way to shut it” and “It sounds like you admire these monsters,” and drab characters like a stammering scientist (Thomas Middleditch) and a wisecracking scientist (Bradley Whitford) add nothing to the proceedings. When it focuses on the marquee attractions, Godzilla: King of the Monsters roars to life. At all other times, it’s merely Godzilla with a zzzz."
"Jun 8, 2019",POSITIVE,"Contrivances come from [putting] everyone in the perfect [plot-specific] place. The ""why"" of those actions, however, is consistently steeped in what we know of their nature."
"Jun 7, 2019",NEGATIVE," There's no rushing a Joanna Hogg movie—the making or the watching. After a six-year hiatus, the English auteur hits a career peak with The Souvenir, an oblique study in heartbreak she says has gestated for 30 years. In 1980 Sunderland, England, film student Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) meets Foreign Office suit Anthony (Tom Burke). He's somewhere between a mysterious stranger and a haughty bore, but evolves their relationship from tea conversants to roommates to lovers all the same. Swinton Byrne (daughter of the great Tilda, who plays Julie's mother in the film) gives an admirably earnest performance, but Burke is upsettingly good, turning on the charm after long spells of avoiding eye contact and spouting empty rationalizations for why he needs to move in or borrow 10 quid. It's a toxic relationship, yet The Souvenir probably wouldn't abide that more political diagnosis. It's told from so close up that dramatic irony around Anthony lying and Julie enabling hovers only on the edge of consciousness. Alluded to in some weaker art school scenes, The Souvenir is intended as a patchwork of memory, not a document. This side-door approach is as elusive and dissatisfying as revealing and true. Experiences are not life lessons until they're over. R. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Clackamas, Fox Tower. Coming so closely on the endlessly bedazzled platform heels of Bohemian Rhapsody by the same director (Dexter Fletcher), Rocketman follows a familiar '70s-steeped music industry biopic blueprint: monster of pop rock towers over the monoculture despite a semi-closeted homosexuality that seems in retrospect glaringly obvious. If the film's biggest laugh comes from Elton (Taron Egerton) swaggering down a shadowy corridor in full Fire Island demon regalia ready to rock…a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, its best joke might just be the heart-shaped, rose-colored frames he wears throughout a subsequent vividly authorized 120-minute confessional in which all public embarrassments and career misfires are blamed on the eventual disappearance of Mom, Dad, manager/boyfriend and hairline. Elton's only successful relationship, we're reminded again and again, has been with long-suffering, lyricist-for-life Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), which also neatly explains away the film's greatest failings—don't expect anything more than a jukebox musical outlining the piano player's true-ish story. To its credit, Rocketman seems to understand the gossamer-thin origins were always of far less importance than the tunes collected along the way. Scenes of middling interest repeatedly give way to all-singing, all-dancing dramatizations of that platinum songbook, but expertly unlocking the MGM-styled schmaltz within the heart of its subject does not justify the existence of such a laborious vanity project.

Trudging along in the milewide reboot steps of 2014's dully reverent Godzilla and 2017 shoot-'em-up Kong: Skull Island, this third installment of Legendary's ever-more-creaky MonsterVerse franchise introduces an undercard of supporting kaiju for the once and future lizard king to trounce en route to next spring's throne match against the great ape. Alas, even as an empty spectacle intended solely to focus attention on the coming main event—Godzilla: Don King of the Monsters?—the results never satisfy. There's a nervous energy bristling throughout that seems wholly separate from the, y'know, ongoing planetary destruction continually dismissed as either logistical puzzle, ecological mission bleed, or too-apropos metaphor for the familial hurdles bedeviling estranged parents/bio-audio techs Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga along with their precocious daughter Millie Bobby Brown—i.e., Coach Taylor, Norma Bates and Stranger Things' Eleven. While disaster flicks of every stripe have long cast small-screen staples in recognizable parts to paper over plot holes, so many familiar faces are asked to flesh out such negligible characters that the first act plays like a fever dream of recap sequences sewn together from unconnected shows. Had cult horror-steeped director Michael Dougherty been just a shade less invested in arguing the teleological value of our New Testament Godzilla, a daft popcorn epic could've been forged from the sheer cavalcade of stream-worthy icons (Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford) encountering second-tier big bads (Rodan, Ghidorah, Mothra) amid forbidding environs from Atlantis to Antarctica to the Red Sox's storied ballpark.

"Jun 7, 2019",NEUTRAL,Godzilla itself looked incredible...but too much humans...
"Jun 7, 2019",NEUTRAL," Making a serious Godzilla film must be a difficult task. The lumbering nuclear-powered monster works better as an icon and - ironically - in small bites. It does not help that while you get a lot more monster action than before, the key lesson from five years ago has yet to sink in: We do not care about the human drama. We want Godzilla versus Ghidorah, not Godzilla versus Kramer versus Kramer. Aside from poor scripting, it also doesn't help that there are too many human characters. Then there are many dangling plot threads such as Zhang Ziyi suddenly having a twin only for it to never be mentioned again. It is a simple premise where lifelong friends fall out after their first time, only to reunite years later when their lives are going in different directions. And yet, this feels like a fresh take on the genre. While the finale is a tad too cheese-tinged, overall this is warm, funny and hits the note every Netflix film should strive for: Why didn't this get a theatrical release?"
"Jun 7, 2019",NEGATIVE," For more than six decades, almost every Godzilla film has ended pretty much the same way. But at least the original Japanese efforts conveyed a campy rudimentary charm that made them distinct. The latest incarnation of the franchise, which began five years ago and continues with GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, is merely a derivative example of spectacle trumping substance, filling the screen with incoherent mayhem while taking itself way too seriously. In the story, people take a backseat to the massive monsters, headed by Godzilla, who emerged as an ally for humanity in the prior film. He fills the same role here, thanks to the hubris of a collection of scientists known as Monarch, an organization tasked with keeping Earth safe from Titans. Among them are a paleobiologist (Vera Farmiga) and her preteen daughter (Millie Bobby Brown), whose efforts to spawn a new Titan larva named Mothra are interrupted by an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) with sinister plans. Soon afterward, ancient predatory beasts are awakened from the ocean floor, including the three-headed fire-breathing adversary Ghidorah, leading to failed military efforts to contain them. As the hapless humans flail away by land, sea, and air with weaponry large and small, Godzilla emerges as the only hope for restoring peace. As you’d expect, KING OF THE MONSTERS contains some impressive action set pieces and some imaginative creature renderings. However, like its predecessor, this Godzilla movie needs a rooting interest, either in the resilient humans or in the beasts trying to wreak havoc. Instead, the screenplay by Zach Shields and director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) offers little incentive for emotional engagement, opting instead to repeatedly flaunt its technical prowess and big-budget effects — masking its lack of narrative integrity and scientific logic with constant chaos. Only a few of the actors from the first film’s multicultural ensemble are back on the payroll here, with the understanding that humankind’s collective brains and brawn is feeble as the oversized reptiles unleash their obligatory pattern of destruction with the future of the planet in the balance. Of course, there’s little creative justification for this follow-up, which hardly advances the Godzilla mythology in any meaningful way. Aside from box-office aspirations, the intent is to set the stage for the next pre-planned franchise tentpole in two years, during which our amphibious hero will again prove indestructible."
"Jun 7, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Jarringly choppy, under-developed and relentlessly cliched, the material underserves its fine cast of actors and never creates anything terribly meaningful from its titanic line-up of creatures."
"Jun 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Godzilla remains a political monster.
"Jun 7, 2019",NEUTRAL," Five years after Godzilla levelled half of San Francisco, an outpost for the global monster-monitoring outfit Monarch is attacked: scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped along with Russell’s experimental device ORCA, which can communicate and even influence giant monsters. Once this technology is used to awaken the three-headed dragon Ghidorah, it sparks off a rise of multiple ‘titans’ including the volcanic bird Rodan, the giant insect Mothra, and the return of Godzilla himself. 2014’s giant monster remake Godzilla finally gets a sequel in writer/director Michael Dougherty’s explosive, messy, and effects-driven effort Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Proving that sometimes more actually is more, this faulty and uneven effort does benefit from the increase in named ‘kaiju’ in terms of upping the action and improving the all-round quality of the film. It still does not manage to successfully develop a must-see Summer blockbuster, but it does at least pick up the pace compared to Gareth Edward’s pedestrian effort. The same overall problems do remain, however, just in a less egregious fashion. Writing remains the Achilles’ heel, with a relatively silly narrative and risible dialogue interspersed between the expected scenes of giant monster mayhem. Doherty and Zach Shields’ script shifts the human focus from a separated family to… well, okay, to another separated family, but this time they do come better framed within an ensemble of Monarch employees racing to contain a worldwide crisis. Plotwise the film takes itself much less seriously than its predecessor, which is a positive sign, but what replaces that dour take is still badly under-motivated and poorly expressed. Charles Dance plays a radical eco-terrorist: we know this because other characters say he is, and he is given no real opportunity to demonstrate this or suitably reveal his motives. Other characters are saddled with the most stereotypical of motivations. A surprise development at the end of the first act sees one trusted character be revealed as a villain. This is a bold move, but said character spends the first 30 minutes as an audience viewpoint and as a result the twist jars badly. Other characters undertake numerous actions to push the plot forward, but there is no internal motivation that quite makes sense. The result is a terribly messy story that collapses under scrutiny. There should be a question asked every time a scene of the human characters is written: is this scene more interesting than Godzilla punching a giant monster in the face? If the answer is no, then the scene really should be replaced with a better one – or it needs to step out of the way and let the monster fight take control. There are essentially three key scenes of monsters fighting here, which feels like more than in the 2014 Godzilla – indeed more than several other Godzilla films – yet the paucity of strong human scenes still make it feel like are being under-served. Fans of giant monster movies will not have come to the film for a human story, of course. Dougherty frames his four monster protagonists brilliantly. Tom Woodruff’s revised designs for each are exceptionally good, and they are captured in atmospheric and dynamic ways from scene to scene. The sound design is particularly brilliant, returning Godzilla’s own roars to the 1954 Japanese original and finding freshened takes on Rodan, Ghidorah, and Mothra at the same time. The film’s main draws – devastating battles between the titans – are distinctive and inventive. Dougherty has been given an almost unfair task in taking the deliberately fantastical and ridiculous set of monster characters, and giving them a sense of realism and weight. I am a particularly keen fan of Mothra, and had doubted any director’s ability to faithfully reconcile the more serious tone of American cinema with a rainbow-coloured giant moth, but Dougherty marvellously succeeds. The same goes with Ghidorah: a three-headed gold alien dragon that has never seemed so terrifying. They are shot from dynamic, powerful angles, and they have a palpable weight and power to them. Here is the ultimate problem though, and it addresses not only the bad screenplay but also the film’s commercially disappointing performance in cinemas: all three American attempts to develop a Godzilla feature (1998, 2014, and 2019) have suffered from being mainstream ‘tentpole’ releases. Godzilla is iconic, but the character’s actual films are comparatively niche. They do boast a healthy, dedicated audience of fans in Japan, but they have never been what Hollywood professionals describe as ‘four-quadrant’ hits – films appealing to men and women both young and old. Godzilla: Final Wars (2004) was only the 44th highest grossing film of its year in Japan. Shin Godzilla (2016) fared much better, only topped by the anime Your Name and grossing US$75 million in Japanese cinemas, but it was also the first home-grown Godzilla picture in 12 years and brought a resonant element of social satire with it. Conversely, the American Godzilla films are bankrolled to the equivalent of Star Wars and The Avengers. They are structured and financed as four-quadrant blockbusters, yet broadly retain the same style and narrative conventions of their Japanese cousins. They are being advertised as big screen epics without epic storylines. Put simply: Warner Bros is spending too much money. Budgeted at $60 million, and the story quirks and weak characters would not stand out so visibly. Budgeted at three times that, and the studio is simply setting itself up for failure. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is definitely a disappointing film, but it is not about what was delivered, which is simply a particularly pretty replica of a Japanese equivalent, but what the studio continues to promise. What is needed here is not reproduction, but rather reinvention: an American-targeted Godzilla film rebuilt from the ground up. We tried that already. It did not go well. In fact, it went so poorly, Toho bought the rights to it just so they could have Godzilla absolutely trash it in Final Wars."
"Jun 6, 2019",POSITIVE," What's killing the cinema, No. 448 in a series: not enough exclamation points in titles, a clear proof of lack of confidence. And bring back shiny subordinate clauses. Dracula, Prince of Darkness has far more heft than plain old Dracula. The very title of Godzilla, King of The Monsters has brio that makes up for Michael Dougherty's bewildering direction. Raymond Burr was injected into the American version of Ishiro Honda's original Godzilla, King of Monsters! (1956; note the exclamation point). His reporter, ""Steve Martin,"" returned for the 1985 redo—the camera closing up on red sleepless eyes, as if Martin had had a long, hard 30 years since first he saw Godzilla. The suggestion of PTSD is back, with paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) waking up from the familiar nightmare of a giganotosaurus trampling San Francisco. Farmiga is a favorite tragedian, a woman of constant sorrow who never wears out that mood. Her Emma lives with her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown)—here taking on the traditional kaiju role of the plucky schoolkid in short pants, who understands things the adults fail to take into consideration. The animism is crazy. Like any other religious picture, Godzilla, King of Monsters has some dogma that has to be swallowed whole, like a crane choking down a frog. Earlier versions suggested that the ever-regenerating beast was more than just a raging monster unleashed by the atomic age É that he was indeed beyond good and evil—a living warning against destroying the planet with nuclear war and pollution. This Godzilla doesn't drop H. P. Lovecraft's name, but Lovecraft's lore suggests the idea of these ""titans"" being Elder Gods; thus the visuals of drowned ancient cities with bas-reliefs of the giants. The actual battles are highly satisfactory, even if no one gets to shout, ""Destroy all monsters!"" Happy moments include Godzilla swimming up to glare through a lab's undersea window; he glows with bioluminescence, like a pissed-off cuttlefish. Even more unnerving is the triple-headed King Ghidorah. ""Sounds like gonorrhea,"" says Bradley Whitford, the movie's Jeff Goldblum, here to add some peculiar commentary to the situation in a MONARCH control room. Ghidorah's heads don't just bob at random like a marionette's head, as in the old days; now they sync up with each other, and they're able to scowl viciously. When Ghidorah nests on an erupting volcano as seen from a weather cam atop a church, there's a cross atop a cathedral. One gets a thrilling sense of the heft of the monster, as if no mere symbol could hold him back. Meanwhile the prop-wash of the 500-foot pterodactyl Rodan knocks over a Mexican town like a hurricane. (Quetzalcoatl, is that you?) By contrast the mammoth Mothra is clearly on the side of the angels, a glowing Tinker Bell to Godzilla's Peter Pan. All credit to Ken Watanabe reprising his role as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa from Godzilla (2014). He gives the beast all reverence: ""We must keep our faith in Godzilla."" Serizawa gives the grimmest warning a Japanese scientist can possibly give in a kaiju: ""This is a dangerous path!"" Insincerity does not dwell in Watanabe, and his final contact with Godzilla is quite touching, a tribute to the dramatic underpinnings of the better Toho studio movies. If it's sometimes hard to tell which MONARCH base we're at, what city we're in and which direction the monsters are coming from, at least we always know the proper attitude to approach Godzilla: on our knees. "
"Jun 6, 2019",POSITIVE," 2014’s Godzilla was a bit of a mess. It was often grainy and unintelligible to watch, and with the exception of a couple of notable supporting actors (Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and Juliette Binoche), it had a largely unexciting cast that never really captured audiences. It also, somewhat shockingly, had surprisingly little actual Godzilla in it — by most estimates, there were no more than nine minutes of the monster shown in the entire 123-minute runtime. It’s a film I enjoyed watching because it’s a Godzilla movie, though not necessarily because it’s a good movie. Since then, we’ve had a rousing, exciting King Kong movie in Kong: Skull Island that seemed to promise a broader, more monster-heavy future for the franchise, now in the hands of Legendary Pictures and titled the “Monsterverse.” It took a little bit, but now they’re back with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and they’ve clearly taken some of those criticisms to heart. The new film, despite being a good deal more apocalyptic than its predecessor, is also a good bit more fun. This is no surprise considering that director and co-writer Michael Dougherty cut his teeth with the sublime Trick ‘R Treat, and it made the film significantly more enjoyable. But there’s also a feeling of desperation to the production, as if they wanted to overload on everything to try to compensate for the weaknesses of its predecessors. Unlikable leads? We’ve got that covered! We brought in everyone — Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Millie Bobby Brown, Tywin Lannister, Thomas Middleditch, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Zhang Ziyi, Aisha Hinds, in addition to the returning Watanabe, Hawkins, and David Strathairn. The film is packed with characters, and given its nonstop action, this has the unfortunate side effect of the audience never really getting to know any of them. Yes, you learn about the family dynamic between divorced scientists Mark and Emma Russell (Chandler and Farmiga) and their daughter Maddie (Brown, who is terrific here). But everyone else is essentially defined by a few lines of clever dialogue, which is a shame when you have that strong a set of actors to play with. That’s not to knock the action, which is constant and almost exhausting. But it does almost feel like overcorrection. There was a certain degree of nuance to the first film, a more contemplative style that was well-used by its director (Gareth Edwards, Monsters, Rogue One). This one? Hell no. It’s a cacophonous horse race from the get-go, and at 132 minutes, that sometimes feels like a long-ass race. The plot is a wild one, featuring the reappearance of the shadowy monster-seeking organization Monarch, government interference, murderous eco-terrorists, weird technology that relies on bio-accoustics, and everything else in-between. The long and short of it is that the various “titans” of the world have been long dormant, but are either waking up, or being woken up. These monsters respond to an “alpha”, and the problem that humanity faces is which alpha will they follow — the benevolent-if-terrifying Godzilla? Or the malevolent, more terrifying Ghidorah, a three-headed, two-tailed behemoth that seems determined to reduce the world to ashes. What follows is a series of harrowing scenes of devastation, as the monsters rampage across the world and trash everything in their path. Entire cities are laid to waste, while the agents of Monarch try desperately to figure out how to stop them, leading them to inevitably try to team up with Godzilla. There’s a lot happening, story-wise, and unfortunately, a good bit of it is either superfluous or needlessly complex. There’s a Maguffin of a suitcase that holds the key to everything, and it’s chased around the globe alongside the monsters themselves. But despite all this chaos and mayhem, King of the Monsters manages to be surprisingly fun. Kudos to Whitford, Middleditch and Jackson for keeping things occasionally light, a nice compliment to the relentless and often overwrought seriousness that Chandler brings to the table — they make things fun even if you never really get to know them. But more importantly, the film feels like more of a loving throwback to the Toho classics than the first film, as if a bit more of that spirit was present. If it sounds contradictory — this juxtaposition of global apocalypse with enjoyable romp — it is. And it is at times difficult to reconcile. The fact is that over the course of the film, literal millions probably die, and it’s hard to think of that as “fun”. But at the same time, it’s also … giant monsters. Like, GIANT monsters. And they’re beautifully rendered and animated, with stunning sounds and fluid movements, engaged in well-choreographed battles that feel real. The film is absolutely gorgeous, using far more color this time around, and not filmed exclusively on rainy nights and all of this keeps it engaging and at times, even enthralling. Yet at the end, I feel I must repeat — sort of — what I said earlier about the first film. I think there’s joy to be found in Godzilla: King of the Monsters because it’s a very good Godzilla film (and definitely superior to the 2014 film). Yet I’m not certain how much love it will garner for those who aren’t fans of the big greenie. It’s exciting and there’s a strange loveliness to be found amidst all the bedlam that these monsters wreak. But it also feels quite bleak at times, and it’ll be up to the individual viewer to reconcile those things. Those of you who grew up with Creature Double Features, who yearn to see these new incarnations of Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidora and their ilk back on the screen? I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.

"Jun 6, 2019",POSITIVE," Five years after Godzilla defeated the MUTOs in San Francisco and reduced a sizable portion of the city to rubble, crypto-zoological agency Monarch is on the verge of being put under United States military control. But before that can happen, scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) have been kidnapped by the unscrupulous Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his band of mercenaries. Their goal is to awaken the god-like monsters, dubbed Titans, Monarch has been studying around the globe from their slumber, believing that the destruction and carnage these creatures leave in their wake will help the Earth heal from centuries of misuse on the part of the human race. But their list includes the mysterious Monster Zero, also known as Ghidorah, a three-headed behemoth who may not be of this world, and instead of restoring the natural balance this vicious beast’s goal might just be the complete eradication of all of humanity. Monarch scientist Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) enlists Dr. Russell’s estranged ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) to assist him in the search for the kidnapped mother and daughter. He understands her work better than anyone, so the feeling of Dr. Serizawa and his trusted fellow scientist Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) is that he is their best option to stop to Alan from awakening these Titans. But his resolute hatred of Godzilla, potentially the only creature capable of destroying Ghidorah, could prove to be a catastrophic roadblock for the Monarch team, Mark blaming the kingly creature for the death of his son in San Francisco five years prior. I thoroughly enjoyed director Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It made me smile. That does not mean I think it is as memorably great as Gareth Edwards’ 2014 hit Godzilla which birthed this so-called “Monsterverse” for Warner Bros, or that it is as giddily enjoyable as Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ 2017 adventure Kong: Skull Island proved to be. It also cannot hold a candle to Ishirô Honda’s 1954 Japanese classic that started this giant monster craze 65 years ago, that magnificent motion picture standing the test of time something fierce. But Dougherty, the mind behind inventive low budget horror gems Krampus and Trick ‘r Treat, has an obvious affinity for the Toho Studios creatures, and not just the titular star. Along with Ghidorah both the usually benevolent Mothra and the fiery Rodan are also utilized here, the director showcasing all four in action with consummate skill. Rodan’s entrance is particularly fantastic, the pterodactyl-like monster birthed from inside a Mexican volcano and subsequently proceeds to lay waste to an entire village with blistering fury before finding itself in conflict with both Godzilla and Ghidorah out in the middle of the ocean. It’s a stunning sequence, one that is delivered in true late 1980s, early 1990s Toho Godzilla sequel splendor, the unabashed silliness of their clash juxtaposed with devastating respect for the might and muscle of the creatures that’s suitably incredible. At the same time, also much like many of those Japanese epics from the tail end of the 20th century, the human component of this story grows increasingly asinine as events progress. Co-writing the script with Krampus collaborator Zach Shields and working from a story the pair dreamt up with Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island scribe Max Borenstein, Dougherty’s screenplay is unquestionably stupid. Alan’s plan never makes much sense, and his indifference when he realizes that Ghidorah isn’t part of the natural order but instead an alien invader intent on domination is demonstrably absurd. As for Dr. Emma Russell, her motivational flip-flops are impossible to keep track of let alone understand, making it difficult to care whether or not she is going to be reconciled with Mark let alone invest emotionally when she’s inevitably forced into a fight for her own survival. It’s also a tad
strange just how quickly Monarch has developed as a scientific defense force in
the span of five years. The organization has essentially become the
Monsterverse’s version of Marvel’s S.H.I.E.L.D., complete with secret
underwater headquarters where they’re able to monitor Godzilla’s movements and
a huge flying fortress that allows them to zip around the planet in no time flat.
Granted, there’s a similar agency in the latter Toho Godzilla films, so the fact Monarch morphs into the Earth Defense
Force (given that name in Godzilla: Final
Wars) or the Global Defense Force (as called in Godzilla: Unleashed) isn’t a big surprise. It’s just the speed in
which they suddenly have all of this technology and equipment available to them
that’s hard to buy, especially considering there’s a major plot point regarding
the U.S. government wanting to put them under the control of the Pentagon meaning
they’re not a military organization. Still, there are sequences
of such staggering beauty, not the least of which is a journey to Godzilla’s
underwater layer where Dr. Serizawa gets a heartfelt close encounter or the
birth of Mothra from her cocoon beneath a Central American waterfall, and I really
loved how much Dougherty appreciated the size and scale of the various monsters.
I found the climactic showdown in Boston to be well worth the wait, and while I’d
rather we stop staging these clashes shrouded in darkness and sheathed in rain,
that doesn’t mean I could take my eyes off the screen for a single second of
the Ghidorah-Godzilla smackdown. It’s likely I was as close to being in-the-bag for this sequel as anything I’ll see and review this summer and I feel I need to admit that. I adore Dougherty’s previous films. As already stated, I love the most recent Godzilla and had a heck of a good time watching Kong: Skull Island. Most importantly, I’m as devoted to the Japanese Godzilla pictures as anyone, and while I’d never say I’ve liked all of them, even the ones I don’t particularly care for I’d watch again at the drop of the hat if the opportunity to do so were to arise. Heck, composer Bear McCreary (Backcountry) even manages to work in Yûji Koseki’s “Mothra’s Song” and Akira Ifukube’s iconic original Godzilla theme into his magnificent score, and it’s quite possible I might have shed a silent tear the first time the latter’s thunderous refrains splashed upon the soundtrack. None of which means that I think Godzilla: King of the Monsters is perfect or that everyone will enjoy it near as much as I did. It does have flaws, and its missteps are egregiously obvious. But I was able to look past most of those as I let the joy of seeing Mothra and Rodan soar through the sky in mortal combat and the euphoria of Ghidorah and Godzilla locked in a lethal embrace sweep over me in continuous waves. I had a blast watching Dougherty’s take on these legendary creatures, and it goes without saying I’ll be heading to the theatre again to see this sequel for a second time relatively soon.

"Jun 6, 2019",NEUTRAL," “Then war broke out in heaven. Godzilla and his angel, Mothra, fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels, called Rodan and others, fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or King Ghidorah, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.” Just look at that cross. “Subtle” is not how one would describe Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Instead, it’s awesome, in every sense of the word: inspiring a sense of genuine awe, as well as being, y’know, pretty cool. It’s also quite stupid. The overall plot and the humans who inhabit it are either overstuffed or under-baked. Some characters are given far too much attention and narrative importance, while others are vacuous avatars for various monster movie tropes: No-Nonsense Military Leader (Aisha Hinds), Snarky Soldier (O’Shea Jackson Jr.), Non-American Eco-Terrorist (Charles Dance), Goofball-but-Brilliant Tech Guy (Bradley Whitford). I don’t recall any of these characters’ names, and I don’t have to. The actors all seem like they’re having a good time embodying these stereotypes (especially Whitford, who is totally hamming it up). The basic plot centers around a family of scientists, Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga), and their daughter Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown). There was a fourth Russell, a son and brother who died during the battles in San Francisco from the 2014 Godzilla film, a plot detail intended to ground the characters’ decisions as motivated by grief, but often feels like attempting to add pathos to a film that doesn’t ask for it. Since that tragedy–and somehow in connection with Kong: Skull Island (a film I haven’t seen)–the Russells have been part of Monarch, a covert research group with a mission of studying the not-so-dormant Titans (that’s what they call the big beasties). They have developed an audio device MacGuffin, the Orca, which is used to somehow control or speak to the Titans. When Emma, Maddie, and the Orca end up in the hands of eco-terrorists trying to set the Titans free, it prompts Mark to rejoin Monarch, which is being led by Godzilla‘s Ishiro Serizawa (Ken “Let Them Fight” Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). Much like director Gareth Edwards’ approach with the 2014 film, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is at its best when the Titans are shown to full scale in all their glory, with the puny humans staring up at them in fearful wonder. There are some marvelous images generated here–I would dare to call some of Mothra’s moments beautiful. It’s what makes the original trailer so frisson-inducing and transcendent. When the characters spout off silly lines or unfunny jokes, it distracts from the film’s purpose, very much akin to a priest or minister attempting humor in a sermon while preaching in a vast and lofty cathedral. We’re not here for your jokes, Pastor; just let us gaze at the light shining through the stained glass, feel the weight of the hymns and organ, joyfully partake in the eucharist, to find the glory (thank you Malick). As Godzilla is portrayed as the rightful and good king over the Titans–indeed, he is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords–the connections here between Godzilla and his divine namesake shouldn’t be dismissed as superfluous, even within a silly summer blockbuster of giant CGI monsters duking it out in various global locations. Such an awe-inspiring religious spectacle which is also about humility–about when not to attack but to simply be–is unique and praiseworthy in our cultural ethos. When the prophet Isaiah saw the glory of God in Isaiah chapter 6, his response is to cry out, “Woe is me! for I am undone…for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.” It’s an appropriate response to coming face-to-face with a god. Or a Godzilla."
"Jun 6, 2019",NEUTRAL," Hay dos formas de hacer una película de
Godzilla. La primera es usar el monstruo japonés como una metáfora del
comportamiento destructivo humano. La otra es decir “¡que se fastidie!, vamos a poner a pelear bestias como niño borracho chocando
sus juguetes”. Aunque me gustan las que siguen el primer estilo,
me complace decirles que Godzilla: King of the Monsters es de las segundas; fantástica
acción kaiju que complació mi deseo infantil: ver estas magnificas criaturas con
presupuesto de Hollywood en la pantalla más grande posible. Hay historia envolviendo drama humano pero,
¡vamos!, ir a ver Godzilla por sus humanos
es como ir a un negocio de comidas rápidas para que te hagan los impuestos: lo
pueden hacer pero probablemente tendrás que cambiarle el techo a tu casa. Cinco años después del surgimiento de los “MUTOS” y la revelación de Gojira como una especie de guardián del balance en la tierra, el mundo continúa monitoreando la presencia de estas y otras antiguas bestias. Los esposos Emma (Vera Farmiga) y Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) trabajaron juntos para desarrollar el “ORCA”, un equipo capaz de reproducir las ondas de sonido de los monstruos con la potencial habilidad de calmarlos o hasta controlarlos. Su matrimonio, sin embargo, ha quedado disuelto luego de la muerte de su hijo menor durante el primer ataque en el filme anterior. Mark quiere eliminar todos los kaijus mientras Emma los considera una fuerza necesaria de la naturaleza. El conflicto se traslada a Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), su hija mayor, a quien usan como pelota de ping pong entre sus distintas perspectivas. Cuando el terrorista Alan Jonah (Charles
Dance) roba el orca y secuestra a Emma y Madison, Mark necesita la ayuda de
ambas organizaciones, ya que Jonah planea despertar el “Monstruo Zero”, una
inmensa bestia, mezcla de dragón e hidra que los fans reconocemos como Rey
Ghidorah, uno de los enemigos clásicos de Godzilla. La cinta original de Ishiro Honda en 1954 fue una referencia al armamento nuclear, específicamente los efectos de los bombazos en Hiroshima y Nagasaki. Con su versión del 2014, Gareth Edwards lanzó una referencia al cambio climático, y la reciente Shin Gojira fue una crítica a la mediocre respuesta del gobierno japonés a la crisis de la planta nuclear en Fukushima. King of the Monsters intenta igualar la vibra, al hacer comentarios obvios sobre la influencia del humano en su entorno, la incapacidad de gobiernos contra los retos climáticos y otras cosas más que el guion de Michael Dougherty no fue suficientemente inteligente para manejar. Uno de esos libretos que confunden “complicado” con “profundo”. También director, Dougherty al menos
reconoce la oportunidad que tiene de lanzarnos a un mundo de bestias
combatiendo entre sí destruyendo todo a su paso, y la aprovecha todo lo que
puede. Ese presupuesto de efectos especiales se usó hasta el último centavo, el
último día no les debió quedar ni para un café de Game of Thrones. Lo único más grande que los Kaiju es la fantástica
banda sonora de Bear McCreary, manteniendo la emoción de los zarpazos y rayos atómicos,
definitivamente para escucharla con las mejores bocinas disponibles. Godzilla: King of the Monsters es hecha
especialmente para todos los fans del “Monsterverse”, y aunque comete el viejo
error sobre exponiendo trama para anticipar futuras entradas a la franquicia
(como Godzilla vs Kong el próximo año), tiene la ventaja de tener seguidores (como
yo) que no les molestará ver demasiados monstruos. Si ver a Mothra contra Rodan,
y a Gojira contra King Ghidorah combatiendo en pantalla grande no es suficiente
aliciente, siempre hay algún drama en fine arts que puedes buscar. Podcastero, comediante, crítico de cine y TV miembro de la Critics Choice Association, crítico certificado en Rotten Tomatoes, y padre de gatos. Una vez cuando niño entré a un cine, y en cierta forma nunca salí."
"Jun 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"A noisy movie with a couple of exciting or visually arresting moments, but also with a lot of filler and gratuitous content. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jun 6, 2019",NEUTRAL," To call Godzilla 2 King of the Monsters ridiculous would be an understatement, but it’s not without its charms, chief of which is a truly A-list cast speaking ludicrous dialogue with absolute commitment. It must have been tough, saying lines that make no sense in a story that is incomprehensible; I imagine them all - Charles Dance, Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn - sitting around at night, trading bonkers lines of dialogue they’d had to say that day, as a kind of drinking game. Some of them have pedigrees with freaky creatures. Hawkins famously shtupped a slimy merman and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination in the terribly over-rated The Shape Of Water; Dance spent four seasons on Game of Thrones, where he at least co-existed in a dragon world. Many of them are returning from Godzilla (2014), which lives in the same cinematic universe as the rebooted King Kong; a clash between the great ape and the nuclear lizard is coming, so there’s something to look forward to. The plot, such as is discernible, involves Dance as an eco-warrior in charge of a bunch of like-minded British mercenaries colluding with Vera Farmiga, as a scientist and mother traumatised from Godzilla’s last rampage, to free all the monsters on earth from their secret burial grounds so that they can rid earth of most of humanity in order to save it, while a plane-load of other scientists and soldier-types try to stop them, or something like that. In other words, it pits extremist greenies against the government. Whatever. Over a very loud, very confusing, but never boring couple of hours, the main fighting is between the big monsters, and at the end of the day, Godzilla wins. Of course he does. He’s the king of the monsters. I grew up on Asterix, and now have the pleasure of introducing my young daughter to his world: of forests and wild boars, druids, villagers, feasts, adventures and Romans. It is a warm world of great wit; the books have always worked simultaneously for kids and adults, because the wordplay is so funny and the satire so astute. Luckily, Asterix: The Secret Of The Magic Potion, an animated feature with an original story, honours the spirit of the books with grace and integrity. It also nods to girl power, which, of course, was good news for me and my little one. Getafix the druid, having had a near-death experience, decides to share the secret of the magic potion to a young druid-in-training, and takes Asterix and Obelix along for protection; a young girl with a passion for science stows away with them, and is treated with respect by the gang (and the filmmakers), ultimately overcoming a traditional gender bias or deux. I’ve now seen the film in French and English; the version being shown in Australia, dubbed into English by a crack squad of Canadian voice artists, is faithful and funny. Far less formulaic and far wittier than your average American animated feature, this is truly fun for old and young."
"Jun 5, 2019",NEUTRAL," A raíz de la batalla que Godzilla sostuvo en San Francisco contra los kaiju llamados M.U.T.O., la paleobióloga Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) desarrolla ORCA, un dispositivo tecnológico que permite la comunicación auditiva con los Titanes, y podría ser la clave para la supervivencia de la humanidad. Sin embargo, cuando ella y su hija Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) son secuestradas por el excoronel Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) y su peligroso grupo paramilitar y ecoterrorista, el invento corre el peligro de caer en las manos equivocadas. Al mismo tiempo, el exesposo de Emma, Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), un erudito y especialista en comportamiento animal, trabaja para Monarch, una compañía encargada de proteger a Godzilla y otras criaturas que habitan diversas regiones del mundo. Mientras Monarch lucha por el control de los monstruos, el coronel Jonah tiene un perverso plan en mente: despertar al Rey Ghidorah, un depredador de tres cabezas mejor conocido por ser el antiguo enemigo de Godzilla. Godzilla II: El rey de los monstruos (2019), escrito y dirigido por Michael Dougherty, es la tercera película del MonsterVerse -un universo cinematográfico ampliado dedicado a los enormes monstruos Godzilla y King Kong-. Olvidémonos del viejo lagarto que surgió como metáfora del desastre atómico a mediados del siglo XX; olvidémonos del dinosaurio verdoso que conmocionó a Nueva York en 1998; Godzilla es, ahora, prácticamente el “bueno” del nuevo universo, una criatura mitológica que salva a la humanidad de los monstruos malvados que quieren su destrucción. Los antiguos Titanes, que habían sido considerados leyendas, se levantan con la intención de propiciar un nuevo equilibrio en la Tierra, como si fueran auténticos anticuerpos en el planeta y que volvieron a despertar para enfrentar problemas como la superpoblación y la negligencia humana ante las catástrofes ambientales. Para los amantes del género, poblado por explosiones y peleas entre monstruos gigantes, la película funciona. Godzilla II es una frenética odisea de explosiones y combates; cada secuencia en la que aparecen las criaturas es un espectáculo para los ojos. Después de un breve prólogo, los Titanes causan estragos en el planeta en una serie de emocionantes y sensacionales secuencias; Dougherty y el cinefotógrafo Lawrence Sher (Garden State, 2004) les dan vida de una manera que conjuga el tono sombrío de Godzilla (2014), de Gareth Edwards, con la expresividad de Kong: Skull Island (2017), de Jordan Vogt-Roberts. Al proponer esta fusión, la película se nutre de una paleta de colores vívidos (azul ártico, naranja desértico, gris lluvioso) que sirve para distinguir visualmente los cambios de atmósfera. Las secuencias adquieren mayor vigor y contundencia por la audaz banda sonora de Bear McCreary, que utiliza una mezcla ecléctica de instrumentación y reimagina los temas icónicos de Godzilla y Mothra. Sin embargo, las principales fallas se encuentran en las frágiles capas de los seres humanos. Aunque Brown, Farmiga y Chandler depositan compromiso y talento en sus personajes haciendo lo posible para convertir el drama en algo conmovedor, la trama familiar no es más que una sucesión simple de eventos cursis -cuando no, torpes- con poca relevancia entre ellos, que de manera inverosímil pretende colocarse en el corazón de la película."
"Jun 5, 2019",NEUTRAL,Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a monster movie that feels like a restaurant that gets your order wrong. Thanks for more monsters but I requested to hold the unnecessary human drama.
"Jun 5, 2019",NEGATIVE," The third film in Legendary Pictures’ Monarch Cinematic Universe (after Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ Kong: Skull Island), Godzilla: King of the Monsters course-corrects the lack of the titular beast in the first movie but also expands on the elements that weren’t so popular. There’s a glut of unnecessary, dull, dumb, human characters and while the monster fights are frequent, they often look murky and lack visual dynamism. Unfortunately, this movie misses the gorgeous cinematography of Guillermo Navarro, who conjured the awesome aesthetic of Pacific Rim or Larry Fong’s striking visual palette in Kong: Skull Island. Watching both Godzilla’s I’m left wondering if we’ll ever see the king titan clash under clear skies. The excitement of seeing this beastly royalty on screen is dampened by the restrictive storm of dusty, smoky, greys and browns. It’s a visual dirge that made me ache for the breath-taking HALO jump from the 2014 movie or practically any monster shot from Skull Island (honestly… check my earlier review. I took a lot of flak for unashamedly loving that movie). Seeing the sheer number of iconic beasts and the loving fan-service, liberally slathered on screen should have been a joyous thing but sadly, they’re competing for screen-time with a phalanx of hollow, grating human characters. It’s bad enough director Michael Dougherty squanders the scenery-chewing Charles Dance, we also have to endure the human slice of dry white, crustless bread that is Kyle Chandler.  Vera Farmiga’s character motivations are astoundingly stupid and cliched, Bradley Whitford delivers naff quips, Zhang Ziyi espouses vaguely Asian mysticism and Ken Watanabe returns to intone super-seriously. Millie Bobby Brown gets a little more to do than most but the family dynamic between her character, Chandler and Farmiga’s is ill-defined and has no satisfactory resolution. Oh… and there’s an utterly wasted Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, avid Stathairn, Joe Morton, Anthony Ramos and O’Shea Jackson Jr. to name a few. There’s simply too many human characters that whenever we lose sight of the titans the movie becomes a trudge. In that regard, Godzilla: King of the Monsters suffers from the same issue the Transformers movies had, where the spend way too much time with an inordinate number of unlikeable characters, delivering terrible dialogue and doing idiotic things. What could have been a lean, mean clash of creatures ends up a monotonous meander between muddy-looking, incomprehensible battles. That aside, the Bear McCreary score is aces and there’s a couple of unintentionally hilarious moments that helped me through this overstuffed, undercooked pretender to the crown. If you’re a fan of the 2014 movie you may enjoy King of the Monsters at face-value. There are plenty of call-backs to the rich history of Godzilla and the promise of more gargantuan tussles in future but as a casual fan I was bored.

"Jun 5, 2019",NEUTRAL," Most disaster-style movies follow a basic structure. They open with a tease. Then they let you meet the characters. Then they lay out the stakes. Then they kill off a character. Then they let the remaining characters mobilize and formulate a plan. Then they unleash hell for a chaotic climax in the third act. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters hits many of those same beats, but the unleashing hell parts happens almost constantly throughout the whole movie. In fact, the pacing is so strange that after about the twenty minute-mark, I had no concept whatsoever of how far into the film’s runtime we were. I’m usually pretty good at timing out a movie in my head and estimating what percentage we’ve completed. Not here. Not even close. There’s no slow burn or escalating momentum. The whole movie is in the deep end. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is just a relentless haze of destruction throughout, a creative decision that obviously brings with it an enormous amount of pros and cons. The pros are, of course, we get to see a ton of amazing visuals. The special effects work is consistently wonderful throughout, and some of the set locations in major cities are a sight to behold. Whether you’re emotionally invested or not, it’s riveting to watch major landmarks get wrecked by gigantic prehistoric leviathans. The cons are there is so much destruction it’s hard to focus on anything else and be particularly moved by any single moment. We’re given human characters. There are a few attempts to make us feel something for them, but because Godzilla: King Of The Monsters clearly cares about the fight scenes more than anything else, that emotional connection is never established. There’s just not enough time and not enough moments without frenetic urgency. They say you learn a lot about people during a crisis, but that only works if you know their personalities and can guess at how they would seemingly react. Those human characters have names and some of them have minor backstories, but I’m not sure any of that really matters. For the sake of being thorough: there’s a woman (Vera Farmiga), her ex-husband (Kyle Chandler), their kid (Millie Bobby Brown), some scientists and a lot of monsters. There’s also a villain played by Charles Dance, who is always a delight. Some of the characters want to use a sound frequency machine to control the monsters, or titans as they’re called here. Others just want them to go away. The beasts are eventually set free and go on a rampage that makes the carnage in Man Of Steel look like a slap fight between two little kids. It’s all a lot in the best and worst ways. Despite existing in the same universe as Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters shares almost nothing in common with that movie, at least when it comes to tone. There are some light jokes from Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch that are worth a smile here or there, but basically, it’s all monster fights all the time with intense, brooding and emotional undercurrents bubbling beneath the surface. If you’re the type of person that gets excited about the idea of numerous prehistoric beasts invading major cities and leaving them in utter ruin, this is a great movie for you. You’re going to absolutely love it. If you’re the type of person who cares about the story first and the visuals second, this probably won’t be one you feel the need to see a second time. Still, it’s hard not to at least mildly enjoy Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. With some of the best visual effects you’ll see this year, solid enough acting performances and big scary unnatural animals wandering about and breaking everything near them, the end product does enough to justify its two hour plus runtime and perhaps justify the cost of a ticket.

"Jun 5, 2019",NEGATIVE,"       They made the first one in 2014, and you asked why, and then they went ahead and made another one, and it'll make you scream, Why!  Godzilla: King of the Monsters comes with the unoriginal tag line ""one king to rule them all"", a lazy and force-fitted hat-tip to Lord of the Rings.    Michael Dougherty’s sci-fi action adventure is a breathless series of action pieces and elaborate special effects building up to a possible apocalypse. The story opens a few years after the earlier film. Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler) are estranged, dealing with the loss of their son Andrew in the last movie. Caught somewhere between their angst is their daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Emma works for Monarch, a corporation that monitors and protects Godzilla and the other Titans. To this end, Emma has developed a machine that is able to control their behaviour through bioacoustics.    But eco-warrior Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) has his own greater plan and that’s when things begin to go terribly bad. Emma and Madison are captured and Mark is enlisted to help track them down.    Eventually a whole lot of monsters are stomping around Earth, reducing it to rubble. A three-headed creature is commandeering the dormant Titans (monsters) but can he outwit Godzilla, aka Gojira? Or will Godzilla show that co-existence is possible and save the planet from annihilation? The WWE of monsters is almost fun, but then the humans, with their trite lines, spoil the (limited) drama.    Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and Zhang Ziyi also appear. A third part is inevitable, as Godzilla goes head-to-head with King Kong in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". Godzilla 2 might have worked as a B-grade creature feature or a contemporary comic homage to such films, but it is neither. It's just a big-budget waste of resources that weakly attempts some eco-warrior gibberish and leans heavily on disaster movie clichés. Unlock a world of Benefits!

"Jun 5, 2019",NEUTRAL," I am not here to disparage your work. On the contrary. I have a huge amount of respect for visual artists who work in CG, and you deliver stunning images that are truly the definition of movie magic. This is especially impressive to someone like me, who has a technical aptitude of approximately zero. I am in awe of your craft. Unfortunately, I’m significantly less in awe of Godzilla: King of Monsters. Godzilla has been around since the 1950s. Which means he’s pushing seventy and probably starting to lose his eyesight. I am a little more than half his age, and about twenty minutes into Godzilla: King of Monsters, I worried that I might need to see my optometrist; this film is so murky I began to wonder if my corneas were malfunctioning. But I soon realized it wasn’t me. It was you.  To be fair, I’ll assume this murkiness was a conscious decision made by director Michael Dougherty, who decided to shroud this narrative in logical darkness, too. This second installment in the Godzilla portion of the Legendary/WB “Monsterverse” franchise falls into the trap that many middle-chapter films do: it’s a placeholder, a forgettable episode in a who-knows-how-long saga. The Godzilla mythology is vast, and Godzilla: King of Monsters introduces other monsters (aka. Titans) for the titular mutant to reign over – Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidora – setting fans up for an epic kaiju showdown. This set-up pays off, but only barely, and only after slogging through too many scenes of a put-upon cast sputtering rote exposition. Stuffed between the monster fights is a finger-wagging ecological conundrum, a globe-spanning chase, and a kitchen sink family drama, all of which are as tedious as they sound. If spectacularly rendered monsters are what audiences are after, then they’ll have to work for them here. Despite a few notable exceptions, their screen time is mostly frustrating. Rodan’s appearance atop a volcano, Mothra’s technicolour splendor, and the final battle between the three-headed Ghidora and Godzilla in Boston’s Fenway Park are scenes that stun and delight the way a film of this scope demands. When your work is discernible, Marcello, it complements the grandeur of these beasts, highlighting rough dermis and glinting eyeballs, and showing just how enormous and formidable they are by scaling them against the crumbled cityscapes. But the rest of their antics are bathed in a smoky patina, their majestic details obscured by rain and cloud.  Perhaps the worst part is that the film was too dark for me to check my watch, which I attempted to do many, many times. Not simply because I wanted to know how much longer this film would hold me hostage, but because looking away from the screen was a respite, however brief, from the convoluted, interminable human narrative. This all takes place five years after San Francisco was levelled in the first Godzilla movie. We meet an estranged couple, both scientists, who lost a child in the disaster. They are swept up, along with their teen daughter. in separate plans to either help or hinder the apocalypse, among them Project Monarch’s attempts to track the Titans and eco-terrorists hell-bent on destroying them. Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, and Millie Bobby Brown (in her feature debut), are joined by Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, Charles Dance, Zhang Ziyi, O’Shea Jackson and others in their quest to make a silk purse out of this sow’s ear of a script. The comic relief, such as it is, is played out between Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch as a game of “Duelling Sarcastic Guys”, who, along with the rest of the cast, seem determined to spout their dialogue as quickly as possible so they can put this whole monster mess behind them. That they conduct their business in barely-lit control rooms and underground bunkers should be no surprise, as Godzilla: King of Monsters seems to have mistaken darkness for depth. It takes itself so seriously that it would be almost laughable if it weren’t all so exhausting. All of this, of course, is just a bloated premise for the main event, which will see Godzilla take on King Kong in 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong. I was firmly Team Kong, if for no other reason than 2017’s Kong: Skull Island has everything a neo-classic monster movie should have: a compelling but easy to follow plot, a steady and consistent upping of the stakes, clever world-building, and, most importantly, an engaging cast who knew exactly what kind of ridiculous film they were making. Kong: Skull Island proved that you can have CGI creatures stalk and terrorize in the daylight without sacrificing tension or awe. But with that film’s director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, prepping a new film for Sony after almost being killed by Vietnamese gangsters (yup, that happened), and none of Kong: Skull Island’s writers returning for Godzilla vs. Kong, and Michael Dougherty and co. returning instead—well, let’s just say my anticipation has dimmed considerably."
"Jun 5, 2019",NEUTRAL," The sequel to Gareth Edward’s 2014 reboot of the ubiquitous Godzilla franchise could well be the first truly abysmal big budget production of the summer. Directed and co-written by Michael Dougherty (Krampus), Godzilla: King Of The Monsters presents such a preposterous and idiotic plot, that even those with expert knowledge of the franchise might find it impossible to follow. Set five years after the end of the first instalment and starring Vera Farmiga (The Departed, Up In The Air) and Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights, Manchester By The Sea), the story follows the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its scientists face off against more giant monsters. As well as reacquainting audiences with the mighty lizard king Godzilla, this new chapter introduces some new adversaries, including the powerful three-headed behemoth Ghidorah. After suffering a great loss five years earlier in the first attacks, Dr Emma Russell (Farmiga) has dedicated her life to attempting to understand the nature of the monster who killed her son. On the other side of the world, her husband Mark (Chandler) is finding it equally impossible to come to terms with the events which went on to destroy his marriage and kept him away from the couple’s teenage daughter Madison (played beautifully by Stranger Things teen star Millie Bobby Brown). When both Emma and Madison are taken hostage by a group of eco-terrorists headed by Jonah Alan (a suitably sinister Charles Dance), Mark must locate his family and retrieve the Orca, a scientific gadget created by Emma and which could help stop Armageddon. Even if one is willing to forgive its ludicrously complicated and drawn-out plot, there’s no ignoring the fact that Godzilla: King of The Monsters is simply not a very good movie. Michael Dougherty presents a poorly written screenplay and a story so devoid of any coherence that it seems unable to decide what to do with its protagonists. Squandering the bulk of an undoubtedly huge budget on some dimly lit and poorly thought-out action set pieces, the film fails to bring anything new to a franchise which, impressively, is on its 35th instalment. Elsewhere, the usually excellent and hugely funny O'Shea Jackson Jr (Straight Outta Compton, Ingrid Goes West) is wasted in a role which barely sees him uttering more than a couple of sentences throughout. The immeasurable talent of Sally Hawkins is squandered on a “blink and you’ll miss it” appearance."
"Jun 5, 2019",NEGATIVE," There is such a clear disdain for the human element in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, one wonders if there wasn’t a way to make this sequel with monsters alone. Co-written (with Zach Shields) and directed by Michael Dougherty, this film picks up five years after the wreckage of the first. The loss of life was devastating for many, the Russell family included. After the death of their son, Mark (Kyle Chandler) fell into a bottle and ran away while Emma (Vera Farmiga) fell into her work for Monarch, the agency devoted to discovering and protecting/destroying these mammoth creatures, which they call titans. While Mark and Emma’s daughter (Millie Bobbie Brown) tries to keep the relative peace between her parents, Emma perfects a device that allows humans to communicate and pseudo-control these beasts. Since Mark was one of the initial creators of this device, he’s forced back into the fold. Unfortunately, nefarious motivations prevent things from going smoothly. A straightforward villain played by Charles Dance is just the tip of iceberg in a script that lives for its twists, logic be damned! Credit where it’s due, Dougherty does (sometimes) deliver on the promise of his film’s subtitle: there are plenty of monsters, and Godzilla does appear to be the king. When they fight, there are glimmers of the B-movie banger that was promised. There are also, however, cutaways to a slew of supporting characters quipping incessantly at the action, Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch chief among them. Gareth Edwards’ outing got a lot of credit for holding its proverbial cards back and ramping up tension throughout, filling out the world in which Godzilla was emerging. And while this writer was not as enamored with that strategy (and execution) as others, King of the Monsters serves as a reminder at the difficulty in making one of these movies. There is not a single human character in this picture worth investing in. Furthermore, much of the narrative is formed from rationalizations that feel devoid of real thought or consideration. Most of these people are scientists and military higher-ups, making the lack of intelligence hard to swallow. Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, and Sally Hawkins all return and are given markedly less to do. And though Aisha Hinds and O’Shea Jackson Jr. are welcome additions, they are left with scraps in a screenplay painstakingly devoted to introducing monsters and reacting to their glory. There has always been a lack of logic to these movies, but all pretense slips away here. Within minutes, Mark offers the most logical answer to the problem of “we found huge creatures underground whose existence will surely kill us.” He’s quickly ignored. Meanwhile, other, far more problematic, stop-gaps are put into motion throughout that result quite literally in the destruction of the planet. Who knows how many actual human beings are left at the end of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but after the lizard’s forthcoming bout with King Kong, let’s hope they’re not forced to endure much more. Dan Mecca is the co-founder and managing editor of The Film Stage. He is a producer and filmmaker living in Pittsburgh. He watches a lot of movies and tracks them on Letterboxd."
"Jun 5, 2019",POSITIVE,"What I got was something admirable, beautiful, bombastic, but in the way of itself too many times."
"Jun 5, 2019",POSITIVE," It’s yet another kaiju movie. Kaiju, in Japanese, means “strange creature,” but in English is has come to have a meaning more like “monster.” Generally, kaiju movies involve military action, fight scenes and social commentary – and this features all of the above. This takes place after the 2014 ""Godzilla"" reboot, continuing the idea that monster such as Godzilla and Mothra, which are called the Titans, are ancient creatures that once ruled the world. In the 2014 film, and the 1954 original, too, Godzilla awakens because humans misuse technology. In this one, Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler, “Manchester by the Sea”) and his ex-wife Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga, “The Conjuring”) along with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown, television’s “Stranger Things”) take center stage. It doesn’t really matter how it happens. Suffice it to say that several monsters begin to threaten each other and humankind. There is talk about how people are destroying the planet, and how the Titans have returned to take over. The monsters, or at least some of them, may want to maintain the balance that humans are ruined. Russell has created a sonic device called the Orca, which she uses to great effect when a giant larva hatches. The Orca manages to calm what comes out of the egg – at least temporarily. Someone else wants the gizmo, and soon Emma and Madison are kidnapped. Ghidorah, a three-headed monster, arrives along with Rodan and Mothra. Are they forming an alliance? Is there hope for the human race? I grew up watching these monsters, and I think a lot of other people – viewers of all ages – did too. I loved the references to the early films, and I wanted to see the battles and up-close action with the critters. I wasn’t disappointed. I love the way Rodan rises out of an active volcano, for example, and how Godzilla at times gets close enough to really look at a single human. Bear McCreary’s score is incredible – it’s as big and impressive as the monsters, with a symphony, Japanese Buddhist monks’ chants, throbbing percussion and a gorgeous chorus. The credits are pretty cool, too. Not only do they claim each monster is played by itself – this cracked me up - but there’s a touching dedication to ""Godzilla"" veterans: Producer Yoshimitsu Banno and the late actor Haruo Nakajima, who so often wore the Godzilla suit in the early movies."
"Jun 4, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters ultimately collapses under its own weight, the result of trying to do too much all at once. It'll scratch your giant-monster-fighting itch, but don't expect much else."
"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE," The new American film Godzilla: King of the Monsters honors a tradition that has won millions of fans over sixty years. The Japanese “kaiju,” or giant monster movie, struck it big in America back in 1956, with the American release Godzilla, King of the Monsters! That alternate version of the 1954 Japanese picture Gojira (a.k.a. Godzilla) tacked on scenes with American star Raymond Burr, but these days, Godzilla movies are made in America to begin with: what a world. Godzilla enthusiasts came out to support the big guy’s return in 2014’s Godzilla, but while Gareth Edwards’ reboot was well-received, fans have impatiently awaited a movie like its sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters. That’s because the sequel, directed and co-written by Michael Dougherty, dusts off other iconic creatures from the Godzilla “family”: giant-moth-thing Mothra, pteranodon-esque Rodan, and three-headed monster King Ghidorah. The promise of monster-on-monster action—in various combinations—is all the true believers need to get their butts in seats. But for everyone else, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has a higher bar to pass. Aside from Godzilla and fellow MonsterVerse entry Kong: Skull Island, the CGI blockbuster era has spat out the Cloverfield movies, the Pacific Rim movies, Rampage, and more (including earlier stabs at both Godzilla and Kong). Dougherty’s take, then, emphasizes its plethora of monsters, but it also gathers a cast of character actors in an attempt to create a human-interest story on which to hang the action. The biggest human star here, oddly enough, is teenager Millie Bobby Brown, making her big-screen debut on the strength of her Netflix sensation Stranger Things (another sci-fi monster tale). Brown plays Madison Russell, whose estranged parents are kaiju experts. Paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and anthrozoologist Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) couldn’t keep their marriage together after the loss of their son in a monster attack. When kaiju start making havoc again, and Emma and Madison get lost in the shuffle, monster-managing organization Monarch brings a reluctant Mark back into the fold. From there, it’s a lot of character actors gathered around consoles in dark laboratories, under big radar maps that track the monsters’ movements. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins reprise their roles from the 2014 film, and we’re introduced to new scientists played by Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, and Zhang Ziyi. Dougherty makes every night dark and stormy and every interior shadowy, making for a night at the movies that sometimes feels more like a patience-testing blackout at home (3D only enhances that impression). We spend too little quality time with Godzilla for him to register as a character (it’s a tough trick to give a creature personality, but hardly impossible), and the human characters prove one-note, mostly because there’s no time to discuss anything but monsters (the screenplay mostly consists of debates over monster policy). While every plot twist is explained, that doesn’t mean every plot twist is believable, and the Russells are so grumpy and/or kooky that there’s no rooting interest in bringing them back together. The CGI creatures impress—a star is reborn in Mothra—and their battles, though dark and often too tightly framed, basically deliver the fire-breathing goods. It’s just unfortunate that in the process of giving fans more of what they want, the filmmakers squander the tastefulness of Edwards' franchise launcher and significantly dumb down the proceedings. As a result, the picture as a whole lumbers a lot like its forty-story star."
"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE," Godzilla returns to the big screen after a 5-year hiatus, this time he’s prepping to take on King Kong by fighting a 3-headed dragon and a giant moth? Batman Shane pinch-hits for Richard as we try to make sense of ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ and discuss some news coming out of Netflix."
"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE," After a long five-year wait, Godzilla is back visiting the Hollywood hills once more. The kaiju is ready for a close up as Godzilla: King of the Monsters prepares to hit theaters this month, and his glamour shots weren't done in vain. After all, the sequel is a worthy addition to the Godzilla canon and stands as the best U.S. adaptation of the monster by far. For those curious, Godzilla: King of the Monsters kicks into motion several years after Godzilla has his monstrous showdown in San Francisco. Audiences follow a family torn apart by his cataclysmic debut, and things only get worse when several new threats get involved. When Emma (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are forced from one of Monarch's research stations and taken hostage by eco-terrorists, an intense reckoning comes for all the Earth's Titans. And when all else fails, it falls to Godzilla to restore balance. And yes, it is Godzilla who does all the heavy lifting here. While Monarch does step into its own as a military operation at last, Godzilla is the one who fans will want to keep a close eye on. The apex predator isn't about to let the Earth fall to pieces under his watch, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters finally gives him some real challenges to face down. Plenty of fans might have been disappointed by the outright lack of monster-on-monster fights in Godzilla back in 2014, but its sequel doesn't suffer the same mistake. Godzilla: King of the Monsters kicks off with all-out action as Mothra comes into play within its first few minutes. Not only is the moment truly epic, it sets the tone for Godzilla's eventual return and formidable fight with Ghidorah. To say these scenes are intense would be putting things lightly, and each battle will leave audiences blown away by their sheer scale. The final act of Godzilla: King of the Monsters forced me to the edge of my seat for its entirety and kept me there well after the credits rolled. Not only does Godzilla: King of the Monsters deliver when it comes to action, but its epic soundtrack and visuals make the sequel a delight for cinemaphiles. The soundtrack for the sequel lifts in all the right places, and its godly bravado enhances all of the kaijus as they fight for dominance. Few films as of late have managed to pair sound effects so well with footage, and fans will surely be scrambling to relive some of the sequel's best moments by sampling its soundtrack. As Godzilla: King of the Monsters combines its stunning aesthetic with a painfully relevant eco-centric message, the movie carves a niche into the Godzilla franchise that's completely worthwhile. This is the easily best Godzilla film made in Hollywood without question and aligns itself with themes posed by fan-favorite entries like Shin Godzilla. For fans new and old, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is packed with fiery thrills which beg to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Despite some overly complicated story lines tying the film's human leads together, Godzilla and his kaiju compatriots overshadow those flaws with their ever-escalating beefs. So it is easy to see why audiences will walk away from Godzilla: King of the Monsters uttering a simple phrase: ""Long live the king."" Godzilla: King of the Monsters hits theaters on May 31st. Will you be seeing it? Let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @MeganPetersCB to talk all things comics and anime!"
"Jun 4, 2019",NEGATIVE,"[The movie] overcompensates for not enough Godzilla. The fights are very cool, I have to admit, combined with the best special effects money can buy...but what makes it very difficult to sit through is just how loud it is."
"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE,It's an agreeably entertaining mess of a summer spectacle that nevertheless delivers the kaiju mayhem.
"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Since King of the Monsters only exists to get audiences to see Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020, the attempt to be something more than just a loud, dumb bridge to the next episode is appreciated."
"Jun 4, 2019",NEGATIVE," by Walter Chaw Everyone is really stressed out in Michael Dougherty's dreadful Godzilla: King of the Monsters (hereafter Godzilla 2), the crass follow-up to 2014's Godzilla, Gareth Edwards's lovely, Spielbergian reboot of the storied Toho franchise for the American market. Everyone here starts at about a 9, temple-veins popping and spittle flying–the undercard attraction to the titanic title bouts between immense CG phantoms. For his part, everyman wolf biologist Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) starts at ""Nicholson in The Shining"" and ramps up to ""Pacino in Heat"" before settling down somewhere near status quo William Petersen for the remainder. That little muscle in Chandler's jaw gets a good, clenched workout. Mark is called onto the scene because his ex, batshit Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga), has spirited away their high-strung daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), who's designed an electronic doohickey called ""Orca,"" the better to talk to all the giant monsters people have discovered across the globe. Operation of said doohickey appears to involve standard smartphone skills, so the necessity of pulling Mark out of the wilderness to help track down Emma is suspect. He's certainly scream-y and agitated about the whole thing. 
Emma's plan is to Thanos Earth through the intervention of these radioactive kaiju, the better to cull the human contagion and inspire new plant growth. It's the only way, you see, to counteract the effects of climate change. One fascinating thing about Godzilla 2 is it's a doomsday fantasy that essentially embraces the notion that it's too late to do anything about anything. She's right, in other words, and her plan is a good one, except that one of the monsters she awakens, King Ghidorah, is from…wait for it…wait…yes, Outer Space. Our screechy humans realize this when they discover hieroglyphs in Atlantis or some shit, which they promptly nuke out of existence because nuclear power, set up against the electrical power Ghidorah represents, is the far superior option to… Look, I have no idea what this movie's message is, ultimately. The characters sit around saying stupid things in stupid ways, and then it gets incredibly loud for a while. Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), who provided a welcome anchor to the Toho series in the 2014 film, is reduced here to fanboying Godzilla for no real reason before delivering long, rambling, wise speeches he read in ""a fortune cookie."" Having him say that instead of Ziyi Zhang's Chinese mystic Dr. Chen (or Dr. Ling–she has a twin, I think, I don't know, stop asking) makes it less overtly racist than actively an attempt to avoid racism while still preserving a fundamentally racist line. Godzilla 2 isn't racist, though. It's too stupid to be racist. Most of the human parts of the film are centred around a flying aircraft carrier/stealth bomber run by a constantly-yelling Col. Diane Foster (Aisha Hinds). There's a cantankerous old Quint figure, Dr. Rick (Bradley Whitford), who comes to replicate Robert Foxworth's legendary performance as a righteous Mike Brady in John Frankenheimer's cult-classic eco-terror flick Prophecy. Ice Cube's son is in this, too, as a soldier tasked with giving the ""easy"" version of the technobabble (""Oh, I get it! You want we should jump into the lightning ball!""). Charles Dance plays the bad guy, who–TWIST–is not that bad compared to Mrs. Thanos. And Sally Hawkins reprises her Godzilla role for two minutes to tell Mark he's the only one who can make the squiggly lines bigger or smaller on his ex-wife's whatsit. Later, Mark hotwires the fucking thing with a paperclip or something when this gadget that everyone wants is stolen from a maximum security facility by Madison, who promptly attaches it to Fenway Park's PA system. There's a bit in the second Jurassic Park film where allegedly smart people can't figure out why a mother T-Rex is chasing them, covered as they are in the animal's baby's blood. Godzilla 2 replicates that scene when Maddy, trying to get away from King Ghidorah after summoning him, holds fast to the thing she used to summon him. Godzilla 2 is full of these head-scratchers. The motivations are hazy and not made any clearer by all the shouting and crying. The dialogue, when it isn't nonsense exposition (Mothra is married to Godzilla, you'll learn–it's like Mad Libs but for blockbusters), is mostly people barking deadlines. ""Six minutes until arrival!"" ""Four minutes until touchdown!"" ""Twelve minutes until detonation!"" It's never not groan-inducing, because each countdown means at least that much time is left until the whole ordeal stops. Imagine a dentist's visit where the only thing they ever say to you is how much longer they're going to be drilling into your face–and it's never ""zero."" When Edwards's Godzilla came out, I was stunned by its patience and how respectful it was towards both the audience and the Godzilla legacy. And its set-pieces were just gorgeous. It's a film made by people who truly love the Godzilla movies. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is made by people who hated Edwards's film. Everything comes to a head in an incomprehensible monster brawl where the outcome is inevitable and the stakes are hazy and indistinct. But at the end of 140 minutes of narrative foaming-at-the-mouth and eardrum-shattering nonsense from the school of Michael Bay, no one in their right mind probably expects more than man-children bashing their action figures together in a fit of orgasmic destruction. That's the state of things now in our age of tantrums and organized campaigns to homogenize popular art. Difference will not be tolerated and so all of these films, after a certain threshold, hold to the same pattern of set-up to escalating action. Like porn, our most expensive entertainments cater to our animal logic and desire for familiarity. The worse it gets out here, the more desperate it gets in there. Godzilla: King of the Monsters suggests it's hell out here. It's not wrong."

"Jun 4, 2019",NEUTRAL,This film turned back time over 20 years for me and I was a child again being exposed to a whole new world of action and excitement.
"Jun 3, 2019",NEGATIVE," Decades before massively interconnected universes took hold in American cinema, Godzilla roamed the earth fighting whatever titan parent company Toho could throw at him. Since 1954, the King of the Monsters has battled King Kong, Frankenstein, Mothra and a whole litany of creatures who have spawned plenty of spin-off films of their home. The idea of Legendary Pictures doing a MonsterVerse that includes Godzilla makes plenty of sense, a natural trajectory for the character. The execution of this broader universe created some unfortunate trouble for Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a direct sequel to 2014’s Godzilla. Five years is a long time to wait between installments, especially when so few of the human characters returned. As a character, Godzilla needs no introduction, but King of the Monsters largely relies on the fallout of the last movie. Newcomers Drs. Mark and Emma Russell, played by Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga, are essentially retconned into the latter portion of the first film, having lost their son in the 2014 attack. The real-world fallout from Godzilla’s last romp through civilization weighs heavily on King of the Monsters, as the characters ponder the morality of what to do with such magnificent yet destructive creatures. Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn reprise their earlier roles, fighting to understand humanity’s role in circumstances beyond our control. The trouble with having the earlier film play such a prominent role in the narrative is that the film never really seems clear on what it wants to be, too overstuffed with strands of plot to form anything cohesive. Millie Bobby Brown, who plays the Russell’s only surviving child Madison, gives an energetic performance that often feels out of place given everything else going on. Charles Dance’s villainous Alan Jonah finds himself in a similar role, an awkward antagonist that the film doesn’t seem to have much time for. The ties to the earlier film do serve some useful narrative purposes, allowing the film to get going without much need for world building. Watanabe’s Dr. Ishirō Serizawa is given a few moments to shine, delivering some emotionally resonant scenes that are undoubtedly enhanced by his prior appearance. Between Serizawa and his team of researchers and military personnel, it’s hard to see why the Russell family was needed for the narrative. As a result, the film feels overstuffed with human characters, quite problematic for a film featuring multiple monsters. Godzilla feels surprisingly diminished in his own movie. Much of the focus is given to Ghidorah, understandable given the monster’s role as the villain, but the title character barely gets a moment to shine. There’s simply too much going on for anybody in the film to stand out. The action scenes are well-crafted, but there’s too few of them for a film with a runtime of over two hours. The script has a few timely bits of humor, but the dialogue is pretty clichéd and boring. The film didn’t need to do much to create an entertaining experience, but muddled the waters with an overstuffed narrative that failed to leave any kind of lasting impression. The film spends a bit too much time setting up next year’s Godzilla vs. Kong. While every entry in an interconnected universe naturally needs to set up the next installment, the best teasers tend to be either subtle or at the end of the narrative. King of the Monsters includes numerous mentions of Skull Island throughout the film, a puzzling decision considering the amount of creatures already present in the narrative. Instead of making the audience excited for the next film, the end result makes one feel a bit disappointed that King Kong didn’t make his entrance in this one. Godzilla: King of the Monsters clutters its narrative with too many loose strands of plot while failing to let its title character shine. None of these iconic monsters needed grand introductions to a public who’s known about them for decades. An enjoyable experience would’ve sufficed. Unfortunately, this film tried to do too much, crumbling under its own excess. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "

"Jun 3, 2019",NEGATIVE," Two hours wasted: that’s how I feel after watching Godzilla: King of the Monsters. This bloated production starts out as an enjoyably tacky monster movie but doesn’t know when to quit. Every pseudo-scientific explanation (and there are plenty) has a counter-explanation in order to keep the story going…and every apparent climax leads to another climax. There’s even a post-credits scene, as if we needed one. We don’t. As for the story, suffice it to say that forces have awakened Mothra. When soldiers foolishly fire on it, a two-hour chain reaction is set into motion around the globe that threatens to wipe out humanity. The monsters involved—here called Titans—all happen to be owned by Japan’s Toho movie studio: Godzilla, Ghidorah (also referred to as Monster Zero), Mothra, and Rodan. Can there be too much of a good thing? I’d submit this film as evidence that the answer is “yes.” By the end of the picture when the monsters are busy battling each other the effect is remote and not scary. A 10-year-old might feel different but I somehow doubt it. The overall effect is numbing. Along the way there are uninteresting human characters: a scientist (Vera Farmiga) who lost her son to Godzilla and isn’t about to let that happen again, her husband (Kyle Chandler) who’s been exorcizing his grief by leaving the family behind, and their adolescent daughter (Millie Bobby Brown), who is torn between them. There are also a number of eggheads and authority figures played by such estimable actors as Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson, Jr., David Strathairn, and a menacing Charles Dance. Whitford stands out from the crowd because he gets to deliver a steady stream of wisecracks, all of them welcome."
"Jun 3, 2019",POSITIVE," La nueva Godzilla tiene a su favor la obligada comparación con las fallidas versiones anteriores. Tanto la de Roland Emmerich de 1998 como el pésimo reboot de 2014 incursionaban en un pastiche pomposo y mal actuado, preñado de efectos de estridente acumulación y confusión narrativa. Aquí, Michael Dougherty parece dispuesto a recuperar el espíritu de la historia original, esa oda a un rey temible que también puede salvarnos, en un relato de apocalipsis global con aires de reconciliación familiar. Todo comienza con los ecos de la estelar aparición de Godzilla en San Francisco, y los consabidos temores al reino sumergido de Titanes que hiberna desde los orígenes de la Tierra. Un poco de fábula, otro de historia, el cruce entre la ciencia y la fantasía es efectivo sin genialidades, y logra entretejer las disputas entre criaturas míticas y prehistóricas, la distinción moral entre amos e intrusos, todo con una extraña mezcla de épica y nostalgia. Uno de los saltos notables de esta secuela -además de construir con criterio las relaciones familiares que serán epicentro de la película- son las actuaciones. Vera Farmiga y la excelente Millie Bobby Brown nutren a sus personajes de impulsos y motivaciones que exceden las directivas de guion. Ese mundo de decisiones éticas y deberes profesionales consigue dar vida a una historia que, a la larga, se dirime en la lucha encarnizada de monstruos digitales. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Jun 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," Honestly, I’d love to be able to say that in Godzilla: King Of The Monsters I saw some sort of grand cinematic homage at work. Either to the original, cautionary nuclear-age Godzilla films made in the Fifties and Sixties by the Japanese film-maker Ishiro Honda or, more simply, to the golden era of monster films when skilled model-makers and stop-motion animators joined forces to terrify/entertain more susceptible cinema audiences. That’s what I’d like to say, but unfortunately I can’t. Because what Godzilla: King Of The Monsters turns out to be is less a homage, more a very long, incredibly noisy and only occasionally spectacular film about gigantic monsters fighting each other and, every now and then, mankind too.  There’s the logic-defying plot, the challenge of keeping up with who’s who, and dialogue so clichéd that you’re never quite sure whether it’s going to be greeted with giggles or groans. It begins where the last film from 2014 left off, amid the ruins of a devastated San Francisco. Gone are the entire Brody family – you remember, surely, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen… no? – and in their place arrive the Russells.  Scientist father Mark is played by Kyle Chandler, scientist mother Emma by Vera Farmiga, and their predictably feisty teenage daughter Madison by Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown. Slowly we learn that the Russells lost a son, Andrew, in the attack on San Francisco, a loss that has taken its toll – with the parents now estranged and Madison living with her mother… in China.  Dr Russell turns out to work for Monarch, the shadowy private company that now attempts to keep tabs on Godzilla and his so-called Titan friends, of which there are now 17.  Whether that includes the office-block-size caterpillar that is about to be hatched at their high-tech facility is unclear, but don’t worry, Emma has been working on some sort of bio-sonic communication system that should allow her to control this army of monstrous beasts.  If the original Godzilla films can be seen as warnings of the destructive power of nuclear weapons, then this new film, directed and co-written by Michael Dougherty, does at least try to aim similarly high.  But it does so in a way so ham-fisted – and I’m not just talking about the arrival of Charles Dance as a murderous eco-terrorist – that you can almost hear the screenplay groaning under the weight of its own towering improbabilities.  The monster-on-monster fight scenes are endless, particularly once the all-powerful Monster Zero raises its scaly head… or three heads and a pair of wings, to be precise. But it’s the lack of an emotional heart that does the real damage. Unlike Kong, Godzilla has no discernible character and is impossible to root for. But the human cast is little more engaging. One gets eaten, two do what men/women have to do in this sort of film, and we never give a fig about poor dead Andrew, which, given what he’s set in motion, seems significantly more than a shame. Ken Watanabe – his presence acknowledging the franchise’s Japanese origins – has the only decent scene in a production other cast members are likely to prefer to forget.  Black actresses – even Oscar-winning ones – don’t often get the chance to play the baddie in a slasher-horror pic, so you can see why Octavia Spencer was so taken with the idea of starring in Ma that she co-produces it too. Sadly her reliably classy presence is not enough to save this standard teens-in-peril offering, with director Tate Taylor injecting neither the scares nor humour required. A gang of underage, small-town high-school students like nothing more than getting drunk, so when veterinary nurse Sue Ann (Spencer) agrees to buy them alcohol, they think they’ve won the jackpot.  This is a film with lots of charming moments but almost as many less-than-charming ones too, which is maybe what we should expect from a small independent picture with two directors and a five-strong writing team. Brian Cox plays Rory, an ageing, irascible and alcoholic Scotsman who travels to San Francisco to be reunited with his estranged son and meet his infant grandson. Some of the scenes involving the baby and his often unlikeable grandfather are painful but, helped by nice cameo contributions from Peter Coyote and Rosanna Arquette, we just about get there in the touching end. Jim Cummings stars, writes and directs this distinctly off-beat story of a small-town cop whose life falls apart when his mother dies soon after the collapse of his marriage. "
"Jun 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," What’s Godzilla been up to? It’s been five years since Gareth Edwards rolled out his high-pedigree reboot of the big lizard franchise in 2014, starring David Strathairn, Sally Hawkins, Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche, of all people. What money can buy. As accomplished as Edwards’s film was, those who wondered whether $160m was too much to spend on a film about a giant lizard — weren’t the wobbly-set, man-in-a-rubber-suit originals a warning against American technological know-how? — will have their fears borne out by the sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It’s directed by Michael Dougherty, who sees his first job as explaining the big guy’s absence from the screen. He’s been in hiding in a series of giant underwater tunnels, apparently."
"Jun 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," Edwards’ sombre reboot, with Godzilla and co. leaving city-smashing tsunamis and earthquakes in their wake and the 1954 original’s A-bomb roots honoured, was impressively intelligent. That is, until you stopped to ask the point of a realist Godzilla film. New director Michael Dougherty instead creates eco-myths from the carnage. In traditional monster sequel style, he has piled on as many creatures as possible, including Godzilla’s hydra-headed nemesis, Ghidorah, and Mothra, a giant moth now mooted as the lizard king’s mate. The humans are led by Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler), traumatised, divorced survivors of Godzilla’s 2014 rampage, whose teenage daughter Madison (Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown) is torn between them. Emma works for Monarch, the government organisation which knows that monsters are real but tends to haplessly enable their rampages. In common with ruthless eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (a jobbing Charles Dance), she sees the appearance of mythic predators alongside humanity as a chance to rebalance the world, which our hubris has sent hurtling towards extinction. “Humans have been the dominant species for millions of years,” she declares. “And look where it got us.” It’s a fair point, undercut by the script’s remarkably laissez-faire attitude to nuclear explosions (Godzilla not only eats them, but becomes one this time around). These are serious, timely issues to smuggle into a film primarily designed to get famous monsters fighting. Dougherty doesn’t wholly lose sight of them. Narrative sense does, though, melt in the radioactive battles. Too shadowy to make sense of in Edwards’ film, Dougherty’s duking super-beasts also sometimes make you pine for the simple clarity of Toho Studios’ man in a rubber suit. The fine Japanese actor Ken Watanabe returns as Dr. Serizawa, again intimating Hiroshima’s ghosts as he explicitly worships this venerable Japanese monster. Some scenes justify this reverence: Mark blacking out to the nightmare sight of a roaring Godzilla looming over him in Antarctic snow; and Mothra hatching straight into captivity, seen from her fuzzed, frightened alien perspective. Watanabe is, though, saddled with lines which creaked when Boris Karloff said them, actually intoning to his colleagues: “You are meddling with things you cannot understand.” Another intelligent actor, Farmiga, squints meaningfully, as if reading a different script. This Godzilla is at its best when casually obliterating lost underwater cities and holding forth on Hollow Earths, slipping the romance of H. Rider Haggard adventure yarns into cold franchise extension calculations. As Warner huffs and puffs to keep its DC Universe afloat, its MonsterVerse at least has the virtue of simplicity. Any pathos to its notably inarticulate leads comes as representatives of an embattled natural world. Beyond that, it’s just lizards wrestling."
"Jun 3, 2019",POSITIVE," Such is the mantra of most big budget monster disaster movies, and it’s one of the main reasons why many devotees of the genre love them. There are certain things most fans want in a kaiju movie too, and “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” delivers on all counts. This large scale, action-packed adventure stays true to Godzilla lore and even includes a few nods to the old school monster B-movies of the past. Crypto-zoological agency Monarch is at it again, this time creating a man-made battle for supremacy between an army of monsters, including Mothra, Rodan, and the terrifying, three-headed nemesis, King Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species rise again, an epic battle ensues, leaving humanity’s existence hanging in the balance. Can Godzilla be the savior hero the world needs? That answer is yes. There’s not much plot to speak of, but there is a decent amount of subtle social commentary about humans screwing up the environment. The plot is as predictable as they come, and a better screenplay would’ve made this a slightly better movie. The writing is nothing to get excited about (I wouldn’t quite go so far as to call it bad, but it’s certainly not very good), but we all know that’s not why you are going to see a movie like this in the first place. And boy oh boy, are the action sequences a ton of fun. The CGI effects are impressive (especially in 3D), creating a seamless world inhabited by monsters as they destroy major cities, the military, and each other. (I never thought of Mothra as beautiful before, but this animation changed my mind). There are plenty of emotionally satisfying, rousing moments to thrill fans. If you don’t feel like pumping your fist in the air when Godzilla rises again with his mighty roar, you definitely aren’t the target audience. The trend of casting talented actors to fill in the blanks proves useful here too, with better than average background performances that take a back seat to the thundering action onscreen. Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown give especially strong performances, with solid supporting nods from the likes of Ken Watanabe, Bradley Whitford, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and Kyle Chandler. When put up against other movies, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” isn’t going to land anywhere near the top of the list. But when compared to similar films in the kaiju genre, it’s a grade A effort. I keep seeing Mothra mentioned in the reviews I’ve read. I wasn’t thrilled by the last Godzilla movie but I know where to set my expectations at least for this one. I’m looking forward to it! My Husband was so excited to see this, I personally can wait. Haha. But reading your review makes me a little more excited to go watch it. I just found your page, and I really enjoy your reviews! You are so cool! I don’t suppose I have read a single thing like that before. So great to find someone with original thoughts on this subject matter. Really.. thank you for starting this up. This site is one thing that is needed on the internet, someone with some originality!|"
"Jun 3, 2019",NEGATIVE," Since being introduced by Toho in 1954, Kaiju have fascinated movie audiences with their sheer enormity and devastating destructive abilities. Then they took it up a notch by shifting the beasts’ focus to each other as the giant creatures battle for supremacy while still obliterating everything in their paths. With dozens of pictures in their catalogue and fans all over the world, they’d essentially created a genre. Now, as Hollywood continues to reach back in time for inspiration, they’ve decided to reboot the stories and rebuild the world of “titans.” In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the giant reptile is in hiding but the government would prefer him dead. Five years after Godzilla destroyed a city — and a family — Project Monarch is debating its efficiency with the government and trying to avoid falling under military jurisdiction. However, something is happening that may require everyone to agree to work together to prevent global annihilation. A former project member, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), has designed a way to communicate with and mollify the titans. When she and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), are kidnapped by an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) who wants the valuable machine, it’s up to her estranged husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler), to return to the fold and save the world from a new dawn in which humans are no longer at the top of the food chain. The movie preceding this one positioned Godzilla as a creature that maintains the world’s balance, awakening in order put other beasts in their place while also destroying entire cities. He’s since been dormant in his underwater lair. When the big three — Ghidorah, Rodan and Mothra — are released, as well as some of their friends, Godzilla rises to restore order. The result is some epic monster clashes on land, and in the sea and air. The big improvement from the last picture is these battles are visible to audiences, rather than shrouded in darkness and quick editing. Their appearances and subsequent fights are undoubtedly the highpoints of the film, particularly as they fill the IMAX screen and their calls reverberate from the speakers. But there’s not a lot more to praise in this movie. The choppy and cliché dialogue is often laughable and moderately annoying. The string of self-sacrifices are very melodramatic and seemingly unnecessary — especially when there’s a military team better equipped and at the ready to give their lives for their country. Then there’s the problematic reasoning that informs the main plot, borrowing from science fiction narratives (and to some extent, the MCU) in which unsympathetic A.I.s rely on deductive reasoning alone for their ultimate decision-making. It’s incredibly flawed and leads to plot-driven mistake that likely would not be made under normal circumstances.  Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins resume their roles from 2014, but they’re the only real connecting thread beyond Godzilla himself. They’re now also joined by Ziyi Zhang, Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford, O’Shea Jackson Jr. and David Strathairn, leaving no shortage of recognizable names in the picture. But no amount of acting talent can entirely rescue a poor script. COPYRIGHT © 1998 - 2023 DIGITAL JOURNAL INC. Sitemaps: XML / News .

"Jun 3, 2019",POSITIVE," Five years after the MUTO was defeated leveling San Francisco, the Monarch agency has continued researching and categorizing “Titans,” massive skyscraper-sized creatures theorized to have once roamed the Earth — possibly an essential part of the ecosystem. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has been working to recreate a sonar broadcasting device invented by her husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), enabling it to summon or calm such creatures, a fail-safe intended for global emergencies. During a crucial test of the apparatus, an eco-terrorist named Jonah (Charles Dance) kidnaps Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), seemingly intent on using the technology to weaponize the Titans against humanity. Informed of the incident, Mark is recruited to work with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) to recover the stolen tech and rescue his family, but the dormant Titans are all awakening — seventeen that they know of — and humanity’s last hope might be the one they are most fearful of: Godzilla. The best of these films follow a simple formula: humanity does something ecologically stupid, a huge problem/creature occurs, and Godzilla has to kick some butt (not you, Godzilla 1998) — cute twin Japanese girls optional but preferred. The 2014 reboot may have been a little plot-heavy with the human interference stuff, but director Michael Dougherty (Trick r’ Treat, Krampus) knows or thing or two about what monster-lovers yearn to see. Using the latest in CGI compositing and stuffing the roster with favorite classic critters — Rodan, Mothra, and Ghidorah among them — can the sequel overcome the lack of monster battles and over-reliance on human characters that bogged down the 2014 film?

Godzilla fans of all ages watch and wait for that first glimpse of the big guy to make his on-screen appearance. The latest production goes one better, reveling in the reveals of future foes, showcasing their emergence and foreshadowing the fights they’ll join. King of the Monsters delivers all this and more, so by the time we finally see the King himself, it’s icing on the cake with extra scoops of ice cream. Having already established the existence of Monarch in 2014 and in Kong: Skull Island, this new installment minimizes plot complexities to provide just enough character drama to let audiences catch their breath between throw-downs. This is a monster disaster film intended for the biggest screens packed with a cheering audience watching a string of money shots framed like murals in a museum. As a climate change metaphor, the question is whether man can co-exist with territorial giants for any benefit they might provide. There are arguments on both sides — to kill or save them all — but someone decides for everyone else and all hell breaks loose. Actors like Vera Farmiga, Ziyi Zhang, Charles Dance, and Millie Bobby Brown are welcome additions to help out Ken “let them fight” Watanabe. Verizon spokesman Thomas Middleditch also adds a generous amount of proper sarcasm along with Bradley Whitford as needed. It’d been nice to have seen Millie do more, but it’s Kyle Chandler’s part as a main-ish character that seems the most wasted, looking clueless or whining more often than succeeding at anything. Once again, the humans aren’t the star attraction, reducing characters to flare-carriers luring dinosaurs from disaster to disaster. It’s not their fault; the monsters just look that good. Speaking of which: anyone having read Jurassic Park knows huge chunks of the novel were devoted to the specifics of hacking a computer system to reboot the park; guess what was reduced to a mere footnote in the film to make room for more rampaging dinosaurs? The same logic goes here. You can spend days arguing rushed plot details, but it’s all glossed over for the star attractions. Frankly, among the best human character moments is when rain-soaked Millie Bobby Brown smiles; if you already guessed why and at what, this movie’s for you. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction, for some language, and the ire of diehard Red Sox fans. I watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters again. My initial thoughts were that my original assessment was too tough, that maybe it deserved a fairer shake. Upon the rewatch, I think I instead saw exactly what I was meant to: my review was right on. Knowing what happens by the end informs several character performances (spoilers are coming). Emma actively warns a fellow researcher that maybe he should take a break; she knows who and what is coming. When Jonah appears, she’s taken aback by his sheer and thorough brutality. As the film progresses, Emma had also told Madison what might be coming BEFORE Jonah showed up, but it was that same display of brutality that made her rethink if it was ever a good idea for her mom to get involved with the guy. Jonah even scolds Emma several times in front of Madison — intent that she hear it — for ever involving the kid. In other words, the performances are more nuanced than they should be in a film like this, mostly because it’s already overstuffed with enough kaiju and city destruction for a full-season order at Netflix. The human drama comes off as melodramatic because there’s no time to build it up; we’re just meeting these characters, and there’s too much other stuff going on. That said, rewataching it makes one appreciate all the detail and work that went into it, especially clocking in at about two hours. It’s exhausting, yes, but also very complete."
"Jun 3, 2019",POSITIVE," El cine de monstruos gigantes (o kaijus) casi siempre tiene un talón de Aquiles: sus protagonistas humanos. Y Godzilla 2: El rey de los monstruos, que es una continuación directa de Godzilla –dirigida por Garreth Edwards  antes de adentrarse al mundo de Star Wars con Rogue One– no es la excepción. En Godzilla 2: El rey de los monstruos seguimos, para nuestro pesar, la historia de una nueva familia: los Russell. Ellos son sobrevivientes de la pelea que libró Gojira con el MUTO en San Francisco y están completamente ligados al descubrimiento de las nuevas criaturas que habitan nuestro planeta. Vera Farmiga y Kyle Chandler son un matrimonio separado por una desgracia, mientras que Millie Bobby Brown es la hija que trata de aprovechar a sus padres al por mayor.  Otros humanos que aparecen en la cinta están ahí meramente para ayudar a avanzar la historia o para ser los personajes que explican lo que está sucediendo: “Godzilla necesita esto” o “Hay que ir aquí para evitar que X monstruo haga Y”. Los peores ejemplos de esto son un par de secuencias en las que parece que los personajes –en medio del caos y apocalipsis desatados cuando las criaturas despiertan de su letargo– de alguna forma tuvieron tiempo de armarse una presentación en Power Point (con todo y videos) sobre lo que sigue en la historia. Todo esto no es más que tiempo desperdiciado en intentar explicar una trama que pide a gritos ser simplificada.  Los actores hacen lo que se puede con un guion que por momentos peca de inocente o sin sentido. Es claro que por momentos su presencia es únicamente justificable para ver las acciones desde su punto de vista. Mostrarnos a “humanos en conflicto intentando sobrevivir las pisadas de Godzilla” nunca es necesario. Mención aparte para Ken Watanabe, quien parece haber sido contratado para repetir una y otra vez «¡Gojira!» –sin temor a equivocarme, sólo un japonés podría pronunciar tan bien el nombre de su kaiju–.  Ya con tres películas dentro del “universo de monstruos” de Legendary, probablemente estemos ante una franquicia más estable para Warner que la que está armando con DC. A lo largo de la trama se nos menciona o aparece la figura de King Kong, el rey de la Isla Calavera, varias veces. Así sea en dibujos prehistóricos o apuntes sobre la localización de Skull Island. Sin embargo, al estar ubicada la acción en la época actual, no tenemos presencia de los personajes de Tom Hiddleston o Brie Larson, quienes aparecieron en Kong La isla calavera.  Toda la mitología alrededor de Godzilla y sus monstruos ayuda a afianzar su universo cinematográfico. Aquí tenemos una secuela que no sólo se produjo para tener una película más del monstruo con un mayor número de enemigos. Lo que esta película abre es la puerta hacia el esperado choque de dos titanes de Hollywood. Una vez más y con efectos visuales mucho más detallados, prepárense para la próxima épica pelea entre Godzilla y King Kong.

"Jun 3, 2019",NEGATIVE,"A terrible step backwards for the ""Monsterverse."" [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Jun 3, 2019",NEGATIVE," Hollywood se encuentra en constante búsqueda de renovación, explorando formas de expandir fórmulas probadas, importando ideas de diferentes partes del mundo y, en ocasiones como esta, incorporando elementos adicionales a las narrativas más populares, como ""la estrella juvenil del momento"" o ""la actriz que protagonizó otra película de monstruos ganadora del Oscar"", con el fin de actualizar historias ya conocidas y consumidas innumerables veces. Sin embargo, este afán por cumplir con todos los requisitos puede llevar a que las propuestas pierdan su esencia y coherencia, convirtiéndose en una amalgama de lugares comunes que afectan la continuidad narrativa y la verosimilitud de la historia. En esta ocasión, la fórmula de ""corré que ahí viene el monstruo"" se potencia con la introducción de criaturas mitológicas ancestrales, despertadas por los villanos de turno con la intención de dominar el mundo. Este escenario es elegido por Michael Dougherty (Krampus) para revisitar el mito de Godzilla, que surgió en pantalla en 1954 y sigue siendo popular a nivel mundial. La trama se sitúa en un futuro cercano, donde la manipulación de información confidencial y experimentos genéticos complicados con seres poderosos desencadenan una búsqueda para restaurar un equilibrio necesario para la supervivencia de la humanidad. Sin embargo, Godzilla 2: El rey de los monstruos presenta fallas que ni siquiera la presencia de Millie Bobby Brown de Stranger Things, Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler o Sally Hawkins pueden superar. La historia se sumerge en la exploración de formatos televisivos y la confrontación entre monstruos para salvar el mundo de una extinción inevitable, resultando en un relato tedioso que recuerda a un eterno episodio en loop de Mazinger Z o Power Rangers. Godzilla se enfrenta a las criaturas siniestras con el objetivo de proteger a la humanidad, mientras que los humanos quedan reducidos a simples espectadores que intervienen mínimamente en la trama. Aunque el guion de Dougherty intenta añadir drama familiar para establecer una conexión entre humanos y bestias, la falta de continuidad y la disolución del punto de conflicto hacen que la película no resulte atractiva ni siquiera para los fanáticos más acérrimos."
"Jun 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," For most of GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, the eponymous monsters pretty much go about their business without taking any notice of the small, scuttling humans that flee in their wake. For their part, the humans, when they are not scuttling, are providing the exposition between bouts of special effects eruptions. Hence, if you don’t know going in that Mothra is not only the queen of monsters, but also on the right side of said monsters’ attitude towards the scuttling humans, or that Monarch is the agency in charge of keeping tabs on the monsters waking from their millennia-long naps, no worries. All is made abundantly and relentlessly clear, livened only with occasional, and much welcome, digressions from techies Thomas Middleditch and Bradley Whitford holding forth on monster mating videos and the hollow earth theory. This sequel to 2014’s GODZILLA picks up with a flashback to the devastation visited upon San Francisco by the monsters, and with mama Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) screaming in the flaming rubble for her only son. He, alas, is no more, and five years on, neither is her marriage to Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler). The estrangement also includes their daughter, Maddie (Millie Bobbie Brown), who is increasingly worried about her mother’s obsession with having meaningful dialogue with the monsters via a nifty audio device called the Orca. She should be.  Mom’s judgement is not everything it could me. She has, after all, not only whisked Maddie to a top-secret Monarch installation, she has given the teen access to the parts of the base where its monster cocoon lives.  As the monster cocoon is waking up from its hibernation.  It doesn’t make much sense, but then, so little else does here. Designed to be competing tropes of bombastic action and tedious exposition, the entire effort boils down to the fate of the world being determined by how well mom and dad and Maddie handle their domestic issues. Events depend on coincidences of uncomfortably improbable proportions, and travel between distant points happening almost instantaneously, and not the ones Whitford credits to the putative network of tunnels through the hollow earth. How there are tunnels in a >hollow< earth are never explored, but there is a set-up for another sequel, so maybe there will be more about that later. Ken Watanabe returns as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, a man given to wry quips and an absolute belief in Godzilla’s protective nature when it comes to the scuttling humans. Just go with it. Characters who have spent five years with a giant, radioactive lizard on the loose may have succumbed to a form of Stockholm Syndrome. As an outside observer, I can only think that Godzilla is less interested in us than he is in defeating the evil King Ghidorah, who wants to take over as the alpha monster.  At least, that’s what they expository dialogue reveals in yet another interlude of chatter in front of brightly lit screens and hi-tech machines that do everything but go ping. Charles Dance shows up to bring his Lannister brand of evil as an eco-terrorist, and Sally Hawkins chirps her way through a perfunctory role as yet another scientist in the room, while David Strathairn looks suitably bemused as the admiral intoning such time-worn mantras as “may God have mercy on our souls” as things become progressively bleaker. At least the visuals are rousing.  Cars fly, lighting fills the sky, and so do monsters as they emerge from spewing lava or create ice chasms as deep as they are long.  And they are very long. King Ghidorah is particularly well-rendered, with three heads that snipe fitfully at one another as they squabble over food (scurrying humans) and take on Godzilla himself. Also notable is how effectively a moth is made to look genuinely scary, even with the aetherial glowing wings. The rest is just so much dreck, despite the environmental message. This a film where the restraining field is activated after a monster is revived, and the emotional arc of any given human is less fully realized than the irritation these monsters so obviously feel about having to interact with any of the scurrying humans. Kudos to a cast that, despite everything, still goes full bore melodrama when there is nothing consistent in what makes their characters tick. Next time, let’s just let the monsters out to play without the distraction for them or for us of those scurrying humans."
"Jun 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Balances its convoluted plot with some truly breathtaking imagery and bone-crushing kaiju battles.
"Jun 3, 2019",POSITIVE," The most memorable scene of Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, the first film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, came near the end when a group of soldiers parachuted into the ruins of San Francisco. As they plummeted towards a cauldron of smoke and flame, gas canisters ribboned red smoke behind them, marking their fall like a dozen bloody claw-marks in the sky. It was perhaps the only moment of unbridled, primal beauty in a film that seemed oddly embarrassed of the sort of spectacle that made Godzilla—and by extension kaiju movies—so beloved internationally. Five years later Michael Dougherty has given us its sequel Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and woe to anybody who assumed this film would repeat Edwards’ mistakes. Here’s a film seeking to overload each frame with as much excitement, energy, color, and majesty as possible. The monsters—or “Titans”—here don’t just casually lumber into the frame as they do in so many of the Shōwa era Japanese films, they come spilling in from above, crashing in from the side, or erupting from out of the bottom. And this time there are a lot of them. To glance over the plot involving the puny, insignificant humans as quickly as possible (which are, as always, a necessary evil for these films), a group of eco-terrorists led by paleobiologist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) seek to awaken the sleeping Titans the world over who’ve been hibernating since the dawn of man. With the aid of a doodad called the “Orca” which can kinda sorta control them, they want the Titans to ravage the world spoiled by humanity and renew it for both species, man and Titan—the old sacrifice-millions-to-save-billions angle. While this plot may not be the strongest out there, it’s perfect for choreographing bone-chilling set-pieces where the Titans fight, and do they ever. Yet it’s the moments before and between the fights that are most striking: Godzilla starring into an underseas control room, scales shimmering a blue warning; three-headed King Ghidora bellowing atop a Mexican mountain framed by a cross from a nearby church; a mature Mothra unfurling her wings beneath a waterfall; the shadow of Titans fighting in the irradiated clouds above Washington DC like a Goya painting. This is cinema as unapologetic spectacle, done properly, done reverently, done joyously. Who cares if the script is weak? The King has returned."
"Jun 3, 2019",NEUTRAL," Its big, loud and lumbering, and that’s just the beginning. Godzilla II is a disappointing sequel to the 2014 film that amplifies its worst tendencies. In my review of the prequel, I wrote: ‘Godzilla squanders the potential of its fantastic cast in favour of huge set pieces and special effects’. The same comment is applicable here as lessons have not been learnt. Some might argue monster movies never properly service their casts because it is about the beasts. However, it is not unreasonable to demand more when the talent is this strong. Actors Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn reprise their roles and are joined by Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, Millie Bobby Brown, Bradley Whitford, Charles Dance, Zhang Ziyi, and O’Shea Jackson Jr. Considering the actors, the material is embarrassing. Godzilla II is only concerned with dull action scenes and cluttered, unimpressive visual effects. The clumsy plot is about a family who lost their son, Andrew, when Godzilla was last fighting monsters in the city. Andrew’s mother, Emma (Farmiga), still loves her daughter, Madison (Bobby Brown), but has divorced from her husband, Mark (Chandler). He blames Godzilla for Andrew’s death. Emma continues working for Monarch, a research company that believes that Titan monsters like Godzilla and Mothra can be used to protect the earth. The company is soon attacked by the evil Colonel Alan Jonah (Dance) who wants to steal Titan DNA. He kidnaps Emma and Madison and steals Emma’s sonar device, the Orca. Mark invented the gizmo, which uses frequencies to communicate with the monsters. When Mark discovers that Emma and Madison have been taken, he is told by Monarch that if he finds the Orca, he will locate his family. The rescue mission is interrupted by Emma’s conflicted motives and the clash between Godzilla and several Kaijū beasts, including the three-headed dragon Ghidorah, which are trying to harm the world. Godzilla II devolves into action so briskly that one must ask if mainstream Hollywood has now dispensed with characters and exposition entirely. After one lame family scene, the film bombards us a flurry of monsters and heavily armed soldiers. This is largely the fault of director Michael Dougherty, who replaces Gareth Edwards. Dougherty has made several horror comedies and is unfortunately credited with writing the story for X-Men Apocalypse (2016). He is only interested in pyrotechnics and ear-splitting sound effects rather than character. A few months ago, the film’s distributor, Roadshow, released several images showcasing the special effects. Individually, the frames looked legible and impressive. In the context of the whole film, the visuals are completely overblown. Dougherty pounds us with overwrought set pieces. It is not the scale of the action that hurts but the composition. Every sequence is over-the-top and cluttered with competing visuals elements, including fire, snow, rain, lighting, and dust. Bar one surprise jolt, there is no sustained tension. This is partly because the set pieces are governed by improbable physics. In one snowstorm scene, an airship is trashed by giant monsters while its occupants remain unharmed. In another, a rescue transporter crash lands inside of an airship with no sign of fuel damage. While plotted on a scale spanning multiple countries, the images of destruction are derivative when photographed through a blue lens. The dust from the destroyed cities evokes the same tired 9/11-esque visuals of chaos that Hollywood has exploited since the September 11 terrorist attacks. As for Godzilla, he appears in the first scene in the film, which is an improvement over the original where he was absent for long stretches. Yet given there are multiple enemies, the king is still overpowered by his foes. It is something the dreaded third movie will address. Despite cities being destroyed and mass numbers of people screaming, King of Monsters is disinterested in humanity. The screenplay is poorly written and ineffective in creating multidimensional characters for its high-quality cast. The main human drama is a cliché setup about an American family wounded by the death of a child. A cheesy family reunion where they put their differences aside to work together is inevitable. Except for a character choice at the end, the family’s central conflict is overly formulaic and corny. In one laughable scene where Mark and Emma are fighting, he squeals, ‘you already put our daughter in danger!’ Too many scenes are also hampered by exposition where the actors look at computer screens to spout scientific nonsense or explain the plot. The character motivations are clouded and silly too. One moment Emma is captured by Jonah and then in the next scene she speaks like a villain as though a transition or three was cut from the film. Vera Farmiga has a deeply expressive face, evident in a teary first close-up. However, as Emma she is also forced to recite an idiotic Thanos‑like monologue about the world needing renewal, and, most improbably, humans co-existing with the Titans. Her performance is hampered by a structural flaw in the screenplay. The decision to split the cast into two groups means that the film spreads itself too thin. Farmiga and Bobby Brown have little to do until the final quarter, and the latter’s magnetism is underused. Kyle Chandler ensures Mark is wounded and driven by feelings of loss, but he is humourless and heavy-handed even when discussing fighting a three-headed dragon or relying on the assistance of a giant lizard. The other characters are boring and paper-thin. Sally Hawkins is barely seen (what a waste) and Dance’s Jonah is too similar to the baddies in the recent Jurassic World films. O’Shea Jackson Jr.’s comedic talents remain untapped, but the unintentionally hilarious dialogue does its best to compensate. Both Ken Watanabe and Bradley Whitford compete for the film’s worst lines. At one point, Whitford’s character is rooting for Godzilla and says embarrassingly: ‘C’mon, big guy!’ He also excitedly announces that Godzilla is rejuvenated by lizard juice! In a different scene, Watanabe’s Dr. Ishiro Serizawa gives a motivational speech that he says he took from a fortune cookie. Even when the film tries to be funny it is awkward and forced. Despite a new director and a richer cast than the original, King of Monsters is only interested in presenting dull special effects sequences. The director has no feel for pacing or building the tension and the screenplay is terribly written. There is nothing interesting about the characters and the actors are saddled with lousy dialogue that diminishes their performances. This series would benefit from fewer but more relatable characters the next time Godzilla is on the rampage. Yet these features are dialed up to one emotional register and are unlikely to change. This is not a film but a loud, dumb tech demo that only exists to house images haphazardly sketched on a computer. Damien Straker is a freelance writer and film critic.

"Jun 2, 2019",NEUTRAL," I’m always down for a good monster movie, and Godzilla is one of my favorites.  After seeing the 2014 Godzilla and 2017’s Kong: Skull Island, the anticipation for the next chapter was excruciating. It’s been a long wait, but director Michael Dougherty has brought the radioactive kaiju back to us with some of his closest frenemies in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Animal behaviorist Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) has thrown himself back into his work after his family was shattered with the loss of his son during Godzilla’s epic San Francisco battle in 2014.  He is a former employee of The Monarch Agency, a cryptozoology outfit researching Godzilla and other animals they call massive unidentified terrestrial organisms (MUTOs) or titans, hibernating beneath the earth’s surface for millions of years. His estranged wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) still works for them and is devising a machine to communicate with the titans. An eco-terrorist group has different ideas for the device and kidnap Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) to use the device to awaken the beasts so they can take back the world from the most destructive force on the planet: humans. Mark is enlisted to find his estranged wife and daughter and save the world. I can’t say I enjoyed the story of Godzilla: King of the Monsters much.  With such a heavy-handed script, there wasn’t much to like. We have to remember Godzilla’s origins through his many iterations – to simplify, he is a creation of the post-nuclear attack fears of the Japanese. To make him and his nemesis monsters a global concern is of course important as nuclear threats have no borders, but I felt the fabulous Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa needed more Japanese backup, so-to-speak.  As far as diversity though, I was happy to see some familiar faces front and center like Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Elizabeth Ludlow, and Ziyi Zhang. The theme of wanting to help rid the earth of us pesky humans was a concept I could get down with but it was conveyed in such a pedantic way it became tiresome, and the family melodrama seemed like saccharine filler. Director Michael Dougherty, the man behind Trick r’ Treat and Krampus, gave us plenty of eye-popping visuals but none of the substance of his previous films because there was too much talking and not enough monster time. Too much exposition, “‘splaining”, emoting and platitude after platitude; along with some aggressively comedic moments hammed up by Bradley Whitford of Get Out and West Wing fame. In fact, there was so much talking, some weirdo came into our cinema off the street and shouted at the screen. Godzilla himself was simply glorious. The fights, animation and sound design created an immersive experience on the IMAX screen. The scoring by Bear McCreary payed homage to Godzilla’s epic theme originally written by Akira Ifukube, and Ghidorah, Mothra and Rodan all had their time in the spotlight. Godzilla’s concept design was true to his historically cranky “Hey, you kids just woke me up from my nap and I’m gonna whup your asses” look. With radioactive blue beams and his signature giant stomping foot, it was worth enduring all the human hot air to see him rise and fight his monster enemies. There’s not much else to say except see Godzilla King of the Monsters for, well, the monsters. Pay the extra to see it in 3D and IMAX so you’ll at least appreciate the top-notch visuals amidst all the jibber-jabber, but don’t expect much more. Here’s hoping the next chapter has a better story and script when Godzilla meets Kong. © View From the Dark and viewfromthedark.ca, 2023.

"Jun 2, 2019",NEGATIVE," It’s been five years since our last Godzilla outing, and the blockbuster films that dominate the theaters have never been more powerful, not to mention more expensive and demanding – demanding of audiences for critical success and, of course, for financial riches. Of course, the riches outweigh the successes every time in terms of “importance.” Still, the spectacles screened before our eyes nowadays, with their connected continuities and post-credit stingers, fight tooth and nail for our attention and wallets, pushing out smaller films and crafting a near monopoly for themselves.
 Five years is a long time to be resting. Godzilla: King of the Monsters has a less cynical approach to big budget destruction and creature features, with a genuine heart and wonder-filled set of eyes for beasts dueling above men. It’s refreshing to see actually, despite the movie itself not being very good. Above all else, it appears that those behind the camera dug and believed in what they were doing, like excitable filmmakers plucked from obscurity and granted all the cash in the world to build and tear down whatever they want. This isn’t exactly that situation, but it feels close to it.
 King of the Monsters is sanctimonious in bad places and incoherent in even worse ones. It’s about a sect of eco-terrorists looking to unleash as many titans (giant monsters) as possible, to destroy society and rebuild anew in a better, “saved” Earth. It’s about a father looking to save his daughter and redeem himself to his family. It’s about a godly being called upon to fight, once more, for a population most vulnerable and a world on the brink. The story itself reminds one of a Roland Emmerich type movie, not just for its faux complexity and faux Michael Bay-ism, but also its faux grand scale. No matter how big Godzilla and crew are, no matter the fights they have, I never felt anxious or wowed by the size of it all. This isn’t to say I didn’t feel anything from the monsters, but it certainly didn’t come from the fighting for the sake of it.
 A character dies out of nowhere, but it was so confusing visually (the picture too dim and the edit too quick) that we had to be told via on-screen graphics. The villainous plan is up its own butt (as it should be), but the movie presents it as if looking down on everyone, especially in one extended expositionary speech. And while there are differences in design, the monsters share a color palette too stale, far and away missing the costumed uniqueness of the Toho productions. Silly with big ideas, the imagery of the creatures make for a staggering light show not seen since the last time I went to see fireworks. These moments of blue and yellow an red pack a punch, as do the body language of the monsters themselves. The fights may not have the OMG-ness we’d like, but the performances of the fighters do. We see Godzilla get put through the wringer and come out to fight again and again. Watch closely, and you’ll be able to read a vastly more interesting story from the titans’ movements and reactions than anything from the ground-level humans.
 Godzilla: King of the Monsters assumes a lot about its place in moviegoing today, but understands very little. Things have changed since the majesty of the first new Americanized Godzilla in 2014 and even since that new Kong movie. The landscape requires either something better or something bigger. To rely just on brand appreciation and occasional moments of bliss is not enough. Unfortunately, this is where we’re at. Go big, go best, or go home. Not enough room for the inbetweeners or for experimentation – not that King of the Monsters has much gusto.

"Jun 2, 2019",NEGATIVE," The tussle for power between giant monsters and humans is a timeless theme, tackled by the likes of Transformers, Jurassic Park and Pacific Rim franchises with varying degrees of success. The problem with Hollywood’s latest take, Michael Dougherty’s reimagining of the Japanese studio Toho’s famous kaiju series, is not its predictability, but its utter gracelessness. The plot picks up after 2014’s Godzilla. A sonar device developed by Vera Farmiga’s Emma to control the monsters has been hijacked by an eco-terrorist; her ex-husband (Kyle Chandler) is drafted in to track it down. Their teenage daughter (Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things) is a distraction, caught in the middle of her divorced parents. Battle scenes occur in weather conditions so extreme that the action is rendered indecipherable (as are the beloved giant creatures, including the three-headed serpent King Ghidorah, bird-like Rodan and winged Mothra). The ugly visual effects are outdone only by the sound design, which is relentlessly loud and thunderingly tedious. Verbal exchanges between the humans are devoid of wit and barely functional in communicating the story."
"Jun 2, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Godzilla and pals aside, King of the Monsters is a disappointing follow-up to the 2014 reboot. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jun 2, 2019",POSITIVE," 
There 
		goes the neighbourhood.  What did anyone expect; that once you forcibly 
		wake a giant, irradiated prehistoric beast from its millennia-long 
		slumber, it was going to calmly walk off into the sunset?  Of course 
		not.  And if you find one supernaturally large creature that could 
		obliterate humanity as we know it, surely, theres bound to be more. 
		 Thats where we are at the beginning of GODZILLA: KING OF THE 
		MONSTERS.  Years after the devastation caused by Godzillas tiff with 
		the large, insectoid enemy, MUTO, the government searches wildly for any 
		other dormant behemoths, with the intent to either control or destroy 
		them. On the 
		control side, scientist Emma Russell has perfected a sonic pacifier 
		called the Orca, that is currently on hand at the hatching of an 
		enormous larva.  Its a trial by fire as the caterpillars debut goes a 
		lot more violently than planned, proving the machine to be quite 
		powerful in its ability to sooth the savage beast.  Its no surprise 
		that others covet it, and Emmas kidnapping -- along with her visiting 
		daughter (Because this was Take Your Daughter To a Highly Dangerous 
		Monster Hatching Day) -- is simply inevitable.  
		Seemingly forced by a cadre of eco-terrorists, Emma unleashes a new 
		creature; a golden, three-headed dragon, meant to act as a counter to 
		the danger of a certain unpredictable, fire-breathing lizard.  Emmas 
		machine wakes up more than King Ghidorah, and soon the world is overrun 
		by kaiju -- giant monsters -- popping up all around the world, more 
		inclined to heed the big shiny guy than the glow-in-the-dark dinosaur.  
		Suddenly, the eco-terrorists plans arent quite so eco-friendly, as 
		King Ghidorah shows a certain flair for total human extermination.  Who 
		can save the earth (Save the earth!), from the monster who was 
		meant to save the earth from the other monster?  
		GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is a vast improvement over the 2014 film 
		that set off this spate of monster movie reboots.  Most notably, the 
		addition of the A-team of classic monsters from the Japanese Gojira 
		canon -- King Ghidorah, Rodan, and Mothra (amongst others) -- is 
		the best thing that couldve happened to this US franchise.  Bringing 
		them in not only acknowledges and plays to Godzillas longtime fans, but 
		also those kaiju really were brilliant inventions to either challenge or 
		team up with the Big G.  The battle scenes are beautifully arranged and 
		exciting when they arent needlessly interrupted. Some 
		of my loudest cheers occurred when -- after continuously 
		putting themselves directly into harms way, including under the very 
		feet of the kaiju -- it seemed remotely possible one of the 
		troublemaking clan might actually be stomped by one of the creatures.  
		This isnt just a narrative complaint; the amount of camera cutaways 
		from the monster battles to show us the reactions of the human 
		characters was infuriating and unnecessary.  I didnt come there to see 
		Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, the STRANGER THINGS kid, or Bradley 
		Whitford play version 2357626253865 of the same snarky role; I wanna see 
		Godzilla step on stuff, blow flames, and beat up other monsters.  Its 
		really that simple. 
		With the advent 
		of the other classic monsters fighting for dominance, comes the 
		opportunity for dynamics and interaction, which was always a huge part 
		of Godzillas appeal: He was never just a pretty face.  There was always 
		a hierarchy in the kaiju world, and Godzilla was on top, due as much to 
		his forceful and cool personality, as to his mighty, blue flame-spitting 
		fabulosity. (To this end, this is why I miss the man-in-suit days, 
		because the actors inside the skins gave the creatures their quirks and 
		qualities.) For 
		the first half of the movie, King Ghidorah is called Monster Zero, which 
		refers to his name in his 1965 film appearance.  There are other 
		kaiju awakened around the world (It turns out there are many more 
		than our featured quartet), and while not officially named, we seem 
		to have tiny glimpses of what looked like classic monsters from the 
		Gojira pantheon, including new versions of the giant spider, Kumonga (Or 
		Spiga, as I knew him), and the praying mantis, Kamacuras.  It could 
		just have been a fancy of mine, but I could have sworn in a scene set in 
		Munich, there was a spiky, shelled creature pushing out from 
		underground, and I held my breath hoping it might be Tohos toughest 
		stalwart, the Ankylosaurus, Anguirus, but I couldnt see for sure.  The 
		return of the Oxygen Destroyer from the original 1954 epic is not 
		necessarily a welcome one.  There is also the image of the red, 
		radiation overloaded Godzilla that hearkens back to 1995s GODZILLA VS. 
		DESTOROYAH, that looks quite chilling here.  While 
		not really an Easter egg, the post-credit dedication to 
		director/producer Yoshimitsu Banno {Godzilla vs the Smog Monster 
		(Hedorah)}, and the late, great Gojira icon, Nakajima Haruo, the very 
		first man to put on the suit -- and wear it for many years -- was very 
		touching.  
		GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is miles ahead of its disappointing 
		predecessor, and surprising in its pure enjoyableness.  But for the 
		start and stop of the dreary people story, the movie is a pure blast of 
		summer fun.  If the filmmakers can get it through their heads to shuffle 
		off the silly Kabuki dance of trying to make us care about the human 
		subplot, and remember who the audience paid to see, I actually might 
		have hope for the US Godzilla canon going forward."
"Jun 2, 2019",NEGATIVE," Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla (2014) left audiences fairly divided upon release and in the years since with viewers typically falling into one of two camps. Its fans seem to feel that the monstrous visuals and action more than make up for any shortcomings, while detractors point to poorly written human characters, a contrived script, monsters seen mostly in darkness or clouds, and Godzilla’s surprisingly minimal screen time as insurmountable faults. Well, depending on where you land, I’ve got good news or bad news. It’s been five years since Godzilla, and the Mutos ravaged parts of the world, and a lot has changed in that half a decade. Monarch — the not-so-secret organization tasked with investigating the giant and monstrous Titans — have built dozens of underground bases around the world, each near a new creature that’s been discovered and monitored. The U.S. government thinks Monarch should be under military control, but scientists Serizowa (Ken Watanabe), Graham (Sally Hawkins), and Coleman (Thomas Middleditch) make a far from compelling argument that they are doing just fine on their own. They’ve built some impressive infrastructure in five years, but it’s soon made clear they have no goddamn clue what they’re doing when it comes to these monsters. Eco-terrorists attack a base just as Dr. Russell (Vera Farmiga) has cracked communicating with the beasts via a digital turntable named ORCA, and they take her, her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), and the device with the intention of awakening all of the known beasts. Next on their list is Ghidorah, a three-headed monstrosity rivaling Godzilla in size and attitude, and their motivation is simple — humanity is a disease, and these old gods are the cure. As the world once more crumbles beneath the power of the Titans, it’s up to Monarch and Madison’s father Mark (Kyle Chandler) to stop them by fighting fire with, well, Godzilla. Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘r Treat, 2007; Krampus, 2015) is clearly a man who loves monsters, and his affection for the beasts comes through in small beats (we get a tease of sorts regarding Mothra’s connection to the twin girls), Bear McCreary‘s memorable and franchise-aware score, and the handful of money shots afforded each of the Titans. They look fantastic at times and can’t help but bring a smile to the face of lifelong kaiju fans who’ve longed to see their favorites back on the big screen with the budget to match. Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidorah, Rodan, some malformed mammoth dude — they’re all here and ready to party, and if that’s all you’re looking for in a Godzilla movie, then it’s your lucky day. (And you should probably stop reading right here.) For the rest of us, though, what should be great big fun is instead a remarkably dull and dumb experience. Dull because despite the 130 minute running time the actual monster action is fairly limited, and dumb because the script (co-written by Zach Shields), the story, and the characters are endlessly idiotic and convoluted. The film offers up plenty of throwaway shots of Titans shambling around and causing destruction, but when it comes to actual fights between the beasties, it shortchanges audiences with only a few meetups. We get some frame-worthy shots elsewhere — Godzilla blasting his breath into the sky, Ghidorah standing atop an active volcano like a god while a church’s cross sits cowering in the foreground, Mothra lighting up the sky — but the fights are brief, heavily reliant on close-ups, and universally shot in shadow, clouds, or other obstructive weather elements. This shit should be cool as hell, but instead, we’re left feeling like the monsters are being hidden behind artificial gibberish simply to make the CG seem more effective. Ghidorah literally travels with his own hurricane. Say what you will about Kong: Skull Island (2017), and I have, but at least it acknowledges that the sun exists. All of that’s disappointing enough, but viewers hoping for anything extra in their big monster movie are most definitely out of luck. Global geography is treated like it’s flexible as everything and everyone is only five minutes away, the monsters’ scale fluctuates depending on the circumstance, and at one point Godzilla follows a submarine straight up from the ocean’s depths only to stand (!) beside it as if the water was just twenty feet deep before diving under again. Human characters run the gamut of obnoxious and stupid with only a single exception — Charles Dance‘s lead eco-terrorist Jonah Alan. Sure he wants the Titans to obliterate most of humanity, but the dude has a plan, he believes in it, and he sticks to it. Everyone else spends the film cracking bad jokes (Bradley Whitford), continually saddled with painfully minor exposition (Ziyi Zhang), lacking anything resembling a coherent motivation (Farmiga), looking desperately for the exit (Hawkins, Watanabe), or feeling crammed into scenes for no reason other than why the hell not (O’Shea Jackson Jr.). The performances are all fine enough, but as with its predecessor, the film seems intent on interrupting the monster action for human drama that we give no shits about. We’re repeatedly pulled away from what should be the epic face-off between Godzilla and Ghidorah to look for young Madison — the monsters are duking it out in downtown Boston, but rather than reward viewers with that spectacle we’re forced to witness a family reunion of characters we don’t care for. It’s doubly frustrating when we know glory and awe are brawling just out of frame. The script sets the monsters loose — that alone should be more than enough to delight — and then spends most of its time highlighting how clueless the Monarch folks are, how the terrorists really didn’t think things through, and how Godzilla is a punk bitch. Seriously, the film feels like a marathon consisting of watching Rocky (1976) three times in a row and then finishing with the final twenty minutes of Rocky II (1979) as Godzilla is beat down and labeled a loser again and again before finally deciding enough is enough. And speaking of repetitive motions made by Godzilla, he arrives as an actual deus ex machina no fewer than three times. Three times someone’s about to bite it before the notoriously light-stepping Godzilla sneaks up and saves the day. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a bloated experience heavy on uninteresting human antics, contrivance, and nonsensical story beats. The monster action we do get — what should be the core of the movie — is minimal, obfuscated, and treated as a distraction from the real story about humans struggling to find their place in the world. It shouldn’t be this hard to make a good giant monster movie, but for Hollywood at least, it remains the stuff of legends."
"Jun 1, 2019",NEGATIVE,"A heaping radioactive pile of garbage, with cookie-cutter characters enduring loud scenes of destruction and then uttering banal profundities in the silence that follows."
"Jun 1, 2019",NEGATIVE," King of the who? I typically do not need a reasonable excuse to deploy a Monty Python reference, but in the case of this movie, it’s so very apropos. We’re told that Godzilla is *check notes* king of the monsters — ancient titans of nature that long predate humanity — which now, newly reawakened (oh shit), number *checks notes* 17 (and counting) roaming the Earth and doing their worst. And, like, I guess we need to just take the movie’s word on it that there are any monsters here at all. Cuz, I mean, I suppose I can just barely make out some indistinct gigantic-kaiju-ish forms moving around in the dark and the rain and the fog and the just generally awful CGI. We’re told they’re even battling at some point. Sounds exciting. Be nice to see that. If there’s one thing Godzilla: King of the Monsters does well, it is this: It makes me long for the cheesy, badly dubbed Japanese Toho flicks I watched in my jammies as a kid on a Saturday morning on a crappy, staticky black-and-white TV. Guys in rubber monster suits awkwardly sparring! At least you could see them. Now, being coy about the monster worked in Gareth Edwards’s 2014 Godzilla, to which this is a sequel, but that’s because there were some other interesting things going on. Not so much the human drama (though still better than what passes for that here), but at least some meaty metaphors about humanity at the mercy of a violent natural world, etc. No such luck here. Somehow even though King is literally about nothing more than how these monsters are destroying human cities, all subtext has been apparently surgically removed, and even the best glimpses we get of these titans are on TV news reports casually and randomly playing in the background while human characters squabble. Fine if a movie wants to be all about the monsters, and very occasionally about them fighting each other for supremacy, but then it has to actually be about the monsters. As in showing us the havoc they are wreaking. But this movie does not give good disaster. It’s no fun at all. There’s nowhere near enough monster action in this unsupportably overlong (alleged) monster movie. And yet it also utterly fails to make us care about what dominates the screen. Which is a whole lotta kaiju researcher Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe: Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, Bel Canto) fretting and moping. (I adore Watanabe, but he’s a serious wet blanket here.) (Oh, and Sally Hawkins [Paddington 2, X+Y] as Serizawa’s colleague Dr. Vivienne Graham almost instantly disappears after a brief initial appearance, which is criminal.) Another kaiju researcher, Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler: First Man, Game Night), mostly rages about how his ex-wife and one-time scientific partner, Emma (Vera Farmiga: The Front Runner, Boundaries), and their teen daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), have been kidnapped by Bad Guy Jonah Alan (Charles Dance: Johnny English Strikes Again, Ghostbusters), because Reasons. It’s truly appalling that in a story that posits that the fate of the planet and of all humanity is endangered because of the rampaging titans, the putative protagonist — that would be Mark — is primarily concerned about the theft of his female property. I know, I know: this is probably meant to be a kind of metaphor for worrying about humanity and the planet. But fuck this shit all to hell. Men motivated by threats to their women is a cliché even older than the titans. And King of the Monsters doubles down on the misogynist bullshit by failing to realize — or realizing but not caring — that it didn’t even need Dance’s character. (I love Dance. This is not about the actor but the way the story is structured.) All the purpose that he serves narratively would have been better achieved without the whole kidnapping nonsense. The potential that Farmiga’s Dr. Emma Russell has for great and gripping narrative power is drained off into Dance’s villain, and it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, except that male filmmakers are completely blind to what women can be. I hate to be the one to say this again, but director Michael Dougherty has previously made a couple of low budget horror flicks (one of which is 2015’s Krampus). That’s it. Who the hell thought he could handle a $200 million science fantasy action blockbuster? (Spoiler: he can’t.) As a screenwriter, Dougherty — who cowrote the script with Zach Shields, who has even less experience — demonstrates a shocking lack of imagination. This is a movie that suggests that the entire evolutionary history of planet Earth is weirder than we have imagined, that the natural world is more strangely wonderful than we have believed. And yet they couldn’t come up with dialogue that wasn’t all awful platitudes and dumb one-liners. The plot — the straightforward depiction of the action — is an absolute mess, often lacking any context for us to understand what is going on. This is the sort of movie in which an almost random character will intone, “I’ll go,” when something dangerous has to be done, and we have no appreciation for the motivation for such a sacrifice. And other characters will repeatedly say things like “apex predator” and “hollow earth” because they sound cool, and little else. It’s all total gibberish, even compared to movies in which guys in rubber suits grapple awkwardly. How does this shit keep happening? Why do male filmmakers with a bit of small success and a limited resume — if even that — keep getting handed the keys to big-budget movies, and keep cranking out such junk? MaryAnn,
  I could agree with various lines of criticism of this film (though I think it’s a very good “*Godzilla* movie”); but “insufficient monster action” isn’t one of them.  And while I do wish that we had had at least one old-school, broad-daylight monster battle, I rarely found it difficult to see and understand what was going on (except inside the hurricane, which makes sense).  And I’m someone who could barely make out about half of the Battle of Winterfell.
  Is it possible that you didn’t have a very good projector? I had the same reactions as you, Allen.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but I’m definitely judging it on a “good for a Godzilla movie” scale, which may be a different one than I’d use for other movies.  (On my kaiju movie scale, when evaluating the human part of the movie, the absence of a Kenny in short pants alone gives it a passing grade….) But I really did see the problems with Mark’s character and his motivation.  And did you notice the scene where Ziyi Zhang’s character starts talking to the Admiral, and Mark actually interrupts her and mansplains what’s going on.  Now, it may be that his animal behavior answer is what was needed, but we’ll never know what Zhang was going to say…. I really get your point about Dance’s character and Farmiga’s, MaryAnn (though Dance does have a role, sort of – does being a bad guy in the next movie count?) Emma should have been the villain, right?  It would make way more sense for her, being so close to both the science, to come to the conclusion that human civilization needs to be destroyed than for a random British colonel turned “eco-terrorist” to do so.  She’d be the driving force, the person who hired HIM, and the source of all that kaiju DNA he was selling. Yeah, that other person could have been the villain… or even NOT a villain. Does this movie even *need* a villain? Better writing could have given us a movie in which decent people have reasonable disagreements over what is best to do. There’s plenty drama and narrative antagonism inherent in the monsters. I suspect the filmmakers think they are being progressive and feminist in the “twist” that Farmiga’s character hasn’t actually been kidnapped, but all shaping the story like this does is remove her character’s agency and make her a pawn, not any real driving force in the story. I don’t agree with your statement. While there is some monster action in the movie, for a 2 hour 15 movie it wasn’t enough. Especially not one that is billed as such. And if the human drama had been interesting to watch it might not have been such a problem, but the characters were 0-dimensional. i seldom groan or complain while watching a movie in the cinema, as I consider it rude when others are talking during the show, but there were several moments in this movie that were so dreadfully conceived and/or written that I just couldn’t help myself. While I still feel that there was enough monster action, I can understand (though still disagree with) the position that there was *also* too much non-monster melodrama.
  Though:  It’s my strong impression, unsupported by research, that GKotM has a similar proportion of monster action to human drama as does the average Toho Godzilla film (average, not something like Final Wars).  And I dare say that GKotM did the human drama better than most Toho offerings did. This movie was awesome. Dougherty is a truly underrated filmmaker (both this film and Krampus have been unfairly attacked by “critics” who are too stuck up to sit back and have fun) and I hope he continues to find success. I totally agree more female filmmakers need to be handed the keys to large franchises, but that doesn’t mean a I’m not allowed to enjoy a thrilling blockbuster made by a man. I did not find anything about this movie misogynistic; that is absolutely ridiculous! GO SEE IT! Do you *really* imagine that critics don’t want to have fun at a movie? For most of us, this is a shit job with shit pay that brings us constant abuse like this. Why the hell would we do this if we didn’t love movies and want to have as much fun as possible with all of them? Krampus has a 67% on RT by critics and only a 51% audience approval score, so no idea why you are suggesting it’s the CRITICS who “unfairly” attacked it.  Everything about this movie was pretty awful except when the monsters starting fighting but even then I couldn’t help but be disappointed when comparing it to the 2014 movie.  Aesthetically I thought the movie looked pretty good and I have no idea what the critic is talking about there.  Like wow, you hated that the cinematography attempted to provide a little bit of atmosphere and tone to the movie instead of spotless, bright colored unicorn crapping look of Marvel movies?  Marvel movies look like trash, this looked decent.  The only reason this movie looked decent though was because it was attempting to poorly imitate Edwards’ tone and McGarvey’s fabulous cinematography of the 2014 movie. In horror it’s pretty much assumed you’ll be showing the action at night. And not only because you want to hide a shoddy monster suit, but because a lot of horror stuff wouldn’t be scary in broad daylight. To some extent that works here. The introductions of the Kaiju are, maybe not scary, but certainly ominous. I personally would have done the final battle in broad daylight though. Tell ya what. Next movie, I will poll all my fellow critics afterward to find out what they thought, and then I will ensure that my reviews says exactly the same thing. Does that work for you? You have two options here. You can either presume that I do not, in fact, believe that there isn’t enough monster action in the movie but that I’m lying about it for some nefarious reason. Or you can presume that I honestly disagree with you about this. FYI they actually did that in a scene of Godzilla vs. Gigan, in the Japanese release. The monsters got comic book style speech balloons with monster-toJapanese translation. Reactions like your are why we need a lot more female film critics than we have now. Thanks for being That Guy. You’re a prince. Sounds to me with your ending comments…you’re being sexist. All the throwbacks to the older godzilla movies are awesome. The plot and ideas from the other 2 films are in this movie enough to give you an idea with out over boring you. No monster battle action cause it was obscured? What the fuck are you watching? I’m done with this..no point in complaining to a moron. I’ll be seeing this movie a 3rd time asap. Do you not understand what the main monsters represent. LONG LIVE THE KING!!! Many people are very sad and lonely and desperate for human interaction, even if it is over the Internet and consists entirely of abusing a total stranger. I lost count of how many times they cut to that goddamn family photo, but every time it did, I wanted to kick the seat in front of me. Kyle Chandler is one of those actors who I just want to punch, while pouring wet cement in his mouth. Don’t care what he says or does, just the fact that he’s there is…wrong. Get the hell offscreen already! Also, while it might be slightly lower on the bullshit scale for a movie like this, the way they perpetuated the myth that wolves have alphas was bloody annoying. We could be made to care about them. The problem isn’t that the humans are in a monster movie. The problem is that the writers don’t give a shit about the humans. Awesome monsters battles and human characters we can invest emotionally in are not mutually exclusive. Haha. Well, here’s one thing we can disagree on. His character was awful, but Chandler is gorgeous, so a chance to look at him for a bit was one of this movie’s small saving graces. That was a bit nasty of me to say, but I couldn’t stand Chandler here. I’ll have to see him in something else to see if it was just my negativity around this movie that made him so unbearable.  I did genuinely love some of the shots of the monsters, but none of them were really held for long enough to truly become majestic and memorable. It would have been so easy to do that. On the way home I was humming Akira Ifukube’s original Godzilla theme. Thought that was a nice touch they threw in. No, that’s fine, I get that! Everyone’s taste is different. I only found it funny because he was one of the few good things for me here. I found Bradley Whitford intolerable just in the trailer, and I usually find him the absolute exception to my growing “middle-aged men who sound like Aaron Sorkin and Joss Whedon characters just by saying ‘hello'” intolerance. I thought Thomas Middleditch was going to be providing the annoying quips, and instead he feels vaguely uncomfortable to be in the entire thing. I’m not sure which would be better. if you go into this movie with expectations of solid story telling,and fleshed out characters,whose motivations that make sense in context.plot lines that follow logical trajectories. but if you want to be transported to being a 10 yr old kid who has been waiting for five decades to see a monster battle royale could look like with the right budget?
this is your movie.
it is loud.
it is unabashedly campy and cheesy at times.
the love and care put into a homage to Japanese kaiju movies is so apparent,and when the movie breaks into godzillas original theme music I found myself giggling like a schoolgirl.i was literally grinning like a loon for the last past of the movie. if you want monster battles…you got it.
you want loud and over the top auditory assaults?…got that as well.
you want easter eggs and hat tips to hardcore fans?..too many to count.
want kitchy and cheesy dialogue?..this is your movie.
did I mention monster battles? HOOOOOHA! I just watched the original 1954 Godzilla, and it breaks into this movie’s house and craps all over the place. The climactic Tokyo attack sequence is jaw-dropping. And sympathetic human drama is all over it. There’s a grandeur and awe-inspiring horror embedded throughout. I’d forgotten how great it is. I’ve no problem accepting an obvious man in a suit if the film takes it seriously. Going into my fifth decade I find suspension of disbelief in movies to be easier to indulge in than ever. Concerns about being ‘dated’ as far as production values don’t even occur to me. It’s a really good feeling to be able to eagerly accept — without cynicism — the reality that a movie presents, if it’s an engaging narrative.  “There’s a learning process that moviegoers go through. They begin in childhood without sophistication or much taste, and for example, like “Gamera” more than “Air Force One” because flying turtles are obviously more entertaining than United States presidents. Then they grow older and develop “taste,” and prefer “Air Force One,” which is better made and has big stars and a more plausible plot. (Isn’t it more believable, after all, that a president could single-handedly wipe out a planeload of terrorists than that a giant turtle could spit gobs of flame?) Then, if they continue to grow older and wiser, they complete the circle and return to “Gamera” again, realizing that while both movies are preposterous, the turtle movie has the charm of utter goofiness–and, in an age of flawless special effects, it is somehow more fun to watch flawed ones.” We’re told that there are giant monsters asleep all over the world, who at any time might wake up and cause unimaginable destruction – but it might be possible to destroy them in their sleep before this happens – and we’re supposed to believe we shouldn’t do this – because some of these monsters might be nice?  And that isn’t even the debate – both the good guys and the bad guys agree we should let these monsters do their thing – the actual debate is whether we should encourage all the monsters to destroy the world, or encourage some of the monsters to restrain the others – and this is what they’re forcing these poor actors to argue as convincingly as they can – when they’re not getting misty-eyed watching Godzilla have a NSFW moment with Mothra (?!) I was just mildly curious as to why they used the music cues from “The Wizard of Oz” in the trailer. Did that pay off in any way at all? I just saw this film of a mind that I was just going to see some giant monsters fight, and maybe have to ignore some bad acting for half the film. Instead, I emerged genuinely offended. I may not be the closest to my Japanese heritage, but I do have an interest and respect for the culture. I’m also not a huge Godzilla fan, but I do have some knowledge of its history and have watched a few guys in rubber suits throw down. Having the token japanese character, whose role in the 2014 film was to beg the US military not to use nuclear weapons then deliberately set off a nuclear weapon to wake up Godzilla while holding his grandfather’s watch, which was stopped by the Hiroshima bombing was a really, really bad look. I mean, Godzilla has sometimes been a pretty silly franchise, about guys in rubber suits slapping each other in increasingly strange contexts, but it’s always been pretty consistent on the central message. Nuclear weapons are bad. Having that central message being not only being betrayed by the film, but being betrayed by that specific character not only feels wrong, but feels deliberate. Like a thumb in the eye of the original films, their legacy, and the people who made them, and the culture who used them to express a grief and horror without an outlet outside the realm of science fiction. And then on top of that, the same character then turns around and passes the torch to the unstable, unhelpful white guy.  And then dies. I’m pretty white.  I’m only a quarter Japanese, and I don’t really identify as Asian.  But that moment felt like a Snyder/Batman v Superman jab in the gut, a gross and deliberate attack on a cultural touchstone that looked genuinely deliberate, especially at the point of having a line of dialogue about opinions and times changing. I was distressed enough about this “fun popcorn flick” to log in and let out my feelings someplace I thought they might be heard or listened to. As always, love your reviews MaryAnn.  We might not always agree, but I can always see your perspective and respect your opinion.  But here I think we’re pretty close.  Being about the people rather than the monsters ruined this film in the worst way."
"Jun 1, 2019",POSITIVE," The largest problem with Western adaptations of Kaiju film, specifically of the Godzilla franchise, has long been the focus on humanity as separate from the story of the monster. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the fate of kaiju and humanity is intertwined. While director and writer Michael Dougherty has a human story, it’s strength is its ability to map out a monster mythology that thrives on the interaction between the two species and ultimately, focuses on the kaiju. Taking place in the same world as 2014’s Godzilla film, the crypto-zoological agency Monarch has risen to locate, catalog, and handle all the chain reaction of awaking kaiju set off by Godzilla in the the first film. As a direct sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters smashes down on the first film, installing a pantheon of kaiju, called Titans in the film, right on top of it. While the story is told through the scientists of Monarch, and specifically the Russell family, broken apart by Godzilla’s attack in San Francisco in 2014, all roads lead back to Godzilla and the myths around him. When the kaiju begin awakening at a faster pace thanks to an eco-terrorist organization, Monarch must face off against a battery of old gods including the mighty Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and the ultimate kaiju, the three-headed King Ghidorah. What ensues is less of a human narrative and more of a growing understanding of the Titans as Dougherty and Zach Shields‘ script unfolds their world, letting myth guide them and their characters in the ultimate battle to bring down Ghidorah. To talk about Godzilla: King of the Monsters is to talk about a film that embraces the tropes and almost 80 year lineage started in 1954 with Japan’s Gojira. Everything from the weapons used by humanity to the creature designs and unique fighting styles of each kaiju is deeply rooted in the kaiju genre, something missed by those who haven’t seen anything beyond Matthew Broderick on the streets of New York City or the film that sold us Bryan Cranston and delivered us much less. Embracing the use of kaiju as symbols in order to tell a high level themes, Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ human narrative is focused around the belief that human are the virus killing the Earth, and that the Titans are the balance, a way to stop our own extinction. While the dialogue in the film is either right on the nose or slightly obtuse, the high level messaging works when seen where its meant to be seen, in the background, with the best performances and lines delivered by those who out the kaiju first. In traditional kaiju genre fashion the human story is a broader theme, while the main focus is our monsters. While the Russels are a family unit that works, with Mark, Emma, and Madison played by Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown respectively, they don’t stand out. While some may critique this, I fully believe that in this story, they aren’t meant to. In some ways, their family is there as a b-plot, while Ken Watanabe drives the main story as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, building out the world of the monsters. As a returning character from the first film, Serizawa’s reverence towards the Titans is reminiscent of that shown by real-life conservation biologists and other natural scientists towards their work. They begin to see them as more than just animals set a part from the world of humans, and more as beings worthy of consideration on par with humanity. While this is a very specific perspective that I can thank living with a biologist for, Watanabe’s character is perfection. The standout performer in Godzilla: King of the Monsters is undeniably Watanabe, with his character providing the view into Godzilla’s world. While they provide exposition, they do so as storytellers, as the kaiju fan pulling a new audience into their genre, as this installment in the American Godzilla canon is the most fit to be labeled as a kaiju film. Through him, we see the world grow, as the myths surrounding Rodan, Ghidorah, and even Godzilla himself opens up and reveals more than just radioactive creatures. This is expanded by not only the science but also the research into the histories of cultures and myth facilitated by Dr. Ilen Chen, played by Ziti Zhang. All of this is done in order to understand the Titans as more than monsters. By learning about how they communicate, how they feel, why they’re here, Dr. Serizawa has developed a belief in Godzilla, in his benevolence, calling out to the 90s era of Godzilla films that cast the King of Monsters as an anti-hero of sorts. One of the best spots of Godzilla: King of the Monsters is that we not only learn where the Titans come from, but we, the audience, get to learn how they work, how they set up a hierarchy, and ultimate the brutality with which they fight. All of this unwinding of myth is nothing without imagery and Godzilla: King of the Monsters may has some of the most visually stunning images I have ever seen on a theater screen. The love and respect put into the creature designs of the kaiju is something I can only liken to the work on creatures by Guillermo del Toro. As Titans, each character used their entire bodies, showing the utility of a stinger, a wing-span, and of course three-heads. From barrel rolls to electric storms and atomic breath, the scale at which the Titans fight is epic, yet, they never feel cumbersome. This is due to each fight scene being dynamic, showcasing the differences in the kaiju, creating individuals fighting, and ultimately showcasing beautiful and brutal dances between these old gods as the cities and landscape crumble around them. Dougherty also uses color to play with the fights, using beautiful blues to symbolize one side of the battle and a yellow and red palette to showcase the other. Happening in mostly unlit locations at night, there is never a visually dark moment as Dougherty relies and executes color and lighting to perfection, ultimately using strategic lighting to achieve some of the most colossal visuals, and some I never knew would look so regal on screen. This is best showcased through Mothra, a kaiju and a queen, I have never before seen her so elegantly and epically represented. But don’t let the elegance fool you, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a smorgasbord of battle sequences as the kaiju on kaiju battles for dominance happen periodically throughout the film. Truthfully, it feels like Dougherty took the critique of too many humans, not enough Godzilla in the franchise’s 2014 outing and chose to tackle it head on. The result? A visual adventure filled with Titan violence that sings. That being said, the score is one of the weaker points of the film, with some of the mood music falling flat, especially in some of the earlier battle scenes. Too often, we grade films as if each entry into cinema must be groundbreaking in the same way, must be fit into one dramatic mold. This is often the reason that genre film, while being embraced by the public and fans within it often fall short of large nominations and wins during award season. Now, I’m not calling for this film to receive an Academy Award, instead I am calling for those viewing and reviewing it to look at it for what it is, a kaiju film. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is kaiju perfection. While it may not be be winning awards against Oscar-bait, it excels within its genre and provides American audiences with a scale and mythology worthy of the 80 year legacy of Godzilla. It is clear from star to finish that the creatives involved with this film were writing a love letter to TOHO, honoring and loving the world of kaiju first, and putting humans second. Which, in truth, is all I have ever wanted from a kaiju film. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is kaiju perfection.

"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," It is, as they say, good to be king, but uneasy lies the scaly, airliner-sized head that wears the crown. As Godzilla: King of the Monsters opens, our hero is in a sulky, self-imposed exile that may be penance for laying waste to San Francisco five years earlier, or possibly a strategic conserving of energy for an upcoming title fight. Strip away the movie’s layers of convoluted plot, and what’s left is a parable about a wizened old fighter trying to maintain supremacy—a narrative with a niftily self-reflexive dimension. Just as Godzilla desires benevolent dominion over the Earth, so too would Warner Bros. like to dominate the box office, as well as follow Marvel’s lead in establishing one of those franchise fictional universes that are all the rage these days. Godzilla may be big and green, but his parent studio doesn’t see him as the Hulk; between this $200 million sequel and next spring’s Godzilla vs. Kong, it’s banking on him being their Iron Man. As an act of pure brand extension, King of the Monsters ticks off all the required boxes, introducing more than enough new characters and complications to bridge the gap between Gareth Edwards’s recent reboot and any forthcoming sequels—which is another way of saying it’s overloaded and exhausting, especially compared to its predecessor. Writing for The Dissolve, David Ehrlich described Edwards’s Godzilla as the first “post-human blockbuster,” referring to the relative insignificance of its various interpersonal dramas, all of which were gradually dwarfed—if not obliterated—by the mid-film arrival of the title character. “The lack of a compelling homo sapien protagonist helps clarify the film’s true trajectory,” wrote Ehrlich. “This is a story about exposing the myopia of the human perspective and then humiliating our inherently egocentric POV.” It was a shrewd read. And certainly, matters of perspective and POV were woven into Edwards’s aesthetic, with its strategies of vast, spectacular establishing shots and consistently sly play with scale (qualities that also figured into his Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One). A half-decade before Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible—Fallout HALO jump, Edwards’s Godzilla exploited the vertiginous possibilities of an action sequence at 30,000 feet while also mixing in a sense of severe, painterly beauty.  King of the Monsters is directed by Mike Dougherty, who has credits on several superhero movies (X2: X-Men United, Superman Returns) and directed the holiday horror comedy Krampus. He cribs liberally from Edwards’s stylistic playbook, but insists on making action heroes and noble martyrs of its ensemble. What was previously an effective and even elegant interplay between form and content gets trampled—and flattened—into something at once more conventional and haphazard. It’s a massive but uninspiring movie, a visual effects extravaganza without a vision. King of the Monsters opens with a scene that so directly recalls the prologue of Batman v Superman that it’s not out of bounds to call it a rip-off (notwithstanding the fact that there are much, much better movies to rip off). We flash back to 2014, when Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) searches futilely for his young son Andrew amid the devastation of Godzilla’s battle with the MUTOs; it’s a bad sign that it took me a minute to remember whether Mark and his scientist wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) were actually forgettable returning characters (they’re not). In Batman v Superman, hinging Bruce Wayne’s beef with Supes on the collateral damage to Metropolis was risky, but at least the characters could support such a weighty vendetta. Here, the idea that a good-looking dad has unfinished business with a 40-story lizard is just too silly to recover from, no matter how much Chandler tries to sell the idea that he’s moving toward a personal showdown. In short order, Mark is absorbed into a task force comprising members of the previous movie’s cast, including Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe as scientists sympathetic to Godzilla’s cause. The latter is used, for the second movie in a row, as a piece of human shorthand for the material’s Japanese roots. “Let them fight,” whispered Watanabe’s Dr. Serizawa at the climax of Godzilla, a highly memeable moment that also implicitly condoned the monster’s destructive tendencies. He’s spouting much the same shtick this time, patiently explaining to Mark—there is a lot of explaining in this movie—that Godzilla may be our best hope against a menagerie of similarly humongous monsters awakened from hibernation around the world by a specialized sonar signal being broadcast by Emma across the globe. The subtext of this development seems to be that starting a podcast can have catastrophic consequences. Emma’s transformation from a grieving mother into a Thanos-like supervillain, preaching the doctrine of principled mass-destruction—with Ghidorah being unleashed as a cure for civilization’s wasteful practices—could make for a complex narrative hook, with climate change as the millennial variation on the original Godzilla movie’s atomic-age paranoia. But in truth, it’s all just a pretense for the hot titan-on-titan action promised by the film’s title. With this in mind, the gang’s all here, and their CGI incarnations pay homage to earlier, lower-fi versions: Mothra, Rodan, and the evil King Ghidorah (a.k.a. “Monster Zero,” a.k.a. my favorite MF Doom side project) have been designed to split the difference between state-of-the-art and old-school throwback.  At times, the creatures are quite beautiful—especially the glowing, translucent Mothra, who was always the most lyrical of Toho’s creations. But for every striking widescreen composition or effectively abstract image—a massive shadow passing over a Mexican town has the ominousness of No Country for Old Men by way of Jaws—there’s a five-minute pileup of quick-cut, incomprehensible ground-level carnage. That Dougherty and his effects team are trying something deliberate by staging nearly every scene in the midst of either swirling snow or pounding rainfall is obvious, but it undermines any truly satisfying fight choreography. There are more memorable punch-kick combos between the cardboard kaijus in “Intergalactic.” In the end, ugliness is not the cardinal sin of King of the Monsters so much as cheesiness. In theory, the mid-film reveal of an undersea kingdom where Godzilla goes to recharge his batteries in between battles should have a mythic, Lovecraftian grandeur, and it does, but it’s infiltrated by a gesture of absurd sentimentality engineered to give a human character a tragic send-off: The model is clearly Leonard Nimoy’s death in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, except that this particular figure doesn’t have the gravitas of Mr. Spock.  The mix of pushy pathos, strained familial drama (Mark and Emma are also fighting for the affections of their daughter, played by Millie Bobby Brown), and Roland Emmerich–style zaniness (Bradley Whitford is uncommonly obnoxious as a pathological one-liner machine) starts out queasy and grows positively toxic. It’s one thing for a blockbuster to skillfully mix tones; it’s another when nobody involved in the production seems to have been decisive about managing the overall vibe. Compare this draggy, lumbering movie to the most recent Japanese Godzilla movie—2016’s springy, satirically agile Shin Godzilla, which skewers bureaucratic buffoonery while alluding to the Fukushima nuclear disaster—and it’s no contest. It’s the difference between a movie that knows how to tell a joke and one that keeps ending up as its own punch line.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"

critic's rating: 



2.5/5

A quasi-government entity called the Monarch Organisation has over the years been gathering evidence of ancient giant monsters lying dormant in different places on earth. Monarch scientist Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is estranged from her husband  Mark (Kyle Chandler) after losing their son to Godzilla's attack five years ago. She lives with her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and develops a device wherein she can communicate with the monsters. However, she suffers from a huge Thanos hangover and with the help of an eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) wants to use her gadget to awaken the monsters so that they can bring out an apocalypse. As she thinks humans have totally defiled the world and a purge is necessary. How Godzilla comes to the earth's rescue and becomes the king of the monsters by defeating Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah forms the crux of the story.

The Japanese Godzilla films which came out in the '50s gave voice to the underlying fear of nuclear devastation. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which occurred a decade ago were still fresh in the minds of the audience. A lizard made big by nuclear radiation was a symbol of the horrors of nuclear warfare. The Hollywood films, however, steered clear of that subtext. Godzilla (2014) hinted at those connections but the present film makes no pretence whatsoever of touching base with reality. It draws upon ancient myths and legends instead. According to the film, our planet was once a place where giant monsters were revered as gods and such creatures exist in deep hibernation still. 

The pseudo-science explaining all this feels like pure gibberish. One can see that the actors are saying the dialogue by rote rather than investing emotions in them. The writing is all over the place indeed. The character definition is flawed. We never get to know the true reasons why Vera Farmiga or Charles Dance want to end the world. Farmiga develops motherly pangs in the climax and goes on a rescue mission for her daughter, so out of keeping with her character graph so far. Sally Hawkins' character is suddenly absent. There's no explanation for it. Two characters heroically lay down their lives -- which is a blatant attempt to push the emotional buttons of the audience. But till then one is so put off by the haphazard nature of the proceedings that the effect is lost. 

The saving grace of the film are the CGI monsters. It gives you a rush watching these giants hammer each other to death. Our only complaint is that the fights are shot with grainy camerawork, using a grey colour palette, and hence lack definition. A better attention to detail would have made them more appealing. The film's ending leads up to the fact that there might be a face-off between King Kong and Godzilla in future. Indeed, that's the next film in the monster-verse cooked up by Warner and will be releasing in March 2020. So be prepared for another epic CGI battle. Let's hope it's better choreographed than its predecessors...
 A quasi-government entity called the Monarch Organisation has over the years been gathering evidence of ancient giant monsters lying dormant in different places on earth. Monarch scientist Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is estranged from her husband  Mark (Kyle Chandler) after losing their son to Godzilla's attack five years ago. She lives with her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and develops a device wherein she can communicate with the monsters. However, she suffers from a huge Thanos hangover and with the help of an eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) wants to use her gadget to awaken the monsters so that they can bring out an apocalypse. As she thinks humans have totally defiled the world and a purge is necessary. How Godzilla comes to the earth's rescue and becomes the king of the monsters by defeating Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah forms the crux of the story. The Japanese Godzilla films which came out in the '50s gave voice to the underlying fear of nuclear devastation. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which occurred a decade ago were still fresh in the minds of the audience. A lizard made big by nuclear radiation was a symbol of the horrors of nuclear warfare. The Hollywood films, however, steered clear of that subtext. Godzilla (2014) hinted at those connections but the present film makes no pretence whatsoever of touching base with reality. It draws upon ancient myths and legends instead. According to the film, our planet was once a place where giant monsters were revered as gods and such creatures exist in deep hibernation still.  The pseudo-science explaining all this feels like pure gibberish. One can see that the actors are saying the dialogue by rote rather than investing emotions in them. The writing is all over the place indeed. The character definition is flawed. We never get to know the true reasons why Vera Farmiga or Charles Dance want to end the world. Farmiga develops motherly pangs in the climax and goes on a rescue mission for her daughter, so out of keeping with her character graph so far. Sally Hawkins' character is suddenly absent. There's no explanation for it. Two characters heroically lay down their lives -- which is a blatant attempt to push the emotional buttons of the audience. But till then one is so put off by the haphazard nature of the proceedings that the effect is lost.  The saving grace of the film are the CGI monsters. It gives you a rush watching these giants hammer each other to death. Our only complaint is that the fights are shot with grainy camerawork, using a grey colour palette, and hence lack definition. A better attention to detail would have made them more appealing. The film's ending leads up to the fact that there might be a face-off between King Kong and Godzilla in future. Indeed, that's the next film in the monster-verse cooked up by Warner and will be releasing in March 2020. So be prepared for another epic CGI battle.

Story: There’s a threat to humanity once again and in order to survive, a bunch of scientists come to a rather preposterous solution. Instead of wiping out the mammoth monsters who can cause human extinction, they hope to coexist with them by reawakening their king — the mighty Godzilla. Only he can restore the nature’s balance by destroying the bad monsters, especially the invincible three-headed Ghidorah aka Monster Zero.Review: Most Hollywood visual extravaganzas, be it disaster epics or superhero fantasies, thrive on the same theme — a few sacrificing people struggling to save the world against all odds. Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters is no different. It reproduces the same survival logic that (Marvel’s villain) Thanos endorses. Destroy half of earth’s population for a better tomorrow. They try to achieve this by unleashing various gigantic radioactive monsters. Apparently they deserve to rule the world as they came here first.Even if you choose to overlook the script that’s littered with daftness, the predictability is hard to ignore. A loud background score doesn’t hold attention. It only screams for attention and that makes the film even more difficult to digest. The reverence for Japanese monsters, especially the atomic lizard as if it were a pet and will do what is expected out of him is hard to buy.The only aspect that goes in the film’s favour and keeps you awake is the epic scale fights between the good and the bad monsters. The dysfunctional family subplot, uncalled for sacrifices hold no relevance in the bigger scheme of things. If you get a kick out of watching disaster movies involving massive creatures, you can watch this one while munching on some popcorn. Despite the plot’s blatant stupidity, the visuals showcasing destruction of epic proportion and the terrifying arrival of King Godzilla offer some solid jump scares. Overall, this clash of the titans tale is forgettable and cliched. Every time any character harps on ‘symbiotic relationship between monsters or restoring the nature’s balance and human-monster coexistence’, you want Godzilla to fart on them so that they stop talking.

"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is a sequel to 2014’s “Godzilla,” though the only returning characters are the title abomination and a few ancillary figures played by Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn, the latter two evidently only available (or willing) to participate for a few minutes apiece. Actually, that’s true of Godzilla, too, though a lack of Godzilla screen time in a Godzilla movie is not a new phenomenon. Several other things are missing from “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” as well, including excitement, humor, and the visible light of the Earth’s sun. There are over a dozen giant so-called Titans in the film, but nearly every scene in which they are present takes place at night, underwater, or in thick fog, smoke, or rain. We’re never very interested in the humans in these stories, who just spend the whole time getting knocked around as collateral damage while the monsters fight; but in this one, the first big-budget film by “Krampus” director Michael Dougherty, the monsters are just as uninteresting as the people, their one appeal — how huge, awesome, and scary they look — obscured by so much CGI debris and too many tight close-ups. Five years after the events of the previous movie, a secretive government agency called Monarch has established outposts at all locations worldwide where Titans have been found, keeping them contained and hibernated with a device called Orca that uses the creatures’ bioacoustics to produce a calming “alpha frequency” that mimics the one their lord and master, Godzilla, communicates with. Orca was developed by ex-spouses Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who have opposite views on the Titans, i.e., Mark wants to kill ’em all, Emma wants to restore nature’s balance by learning to co-exist peacefully with them. Their teenage daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), is caught in the middle, living with Mom but concerned about her. Then along comes an eco-terrorist group led by one Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) that wants to awaken all the Titans and let nature run its course. Among these is one nicknamed “Monster Zero,” a nasty three-headed dragon so fearsome that even ancient monster lore has little to say about it. It is feasible that humanity will survive, but we’ll need Godzilla to assume his role as our protector and take control of his fellow beasts. But where is Godzilla? And does he even know he’s supposed to be helping us? For a movie uninterested in its human characters, it sure introduces a lot of them for us to also not be interested in. Why, there’s the delightful O’Shea Jackson Jr. as an Army guy! He does nothing. Here’s Thomas Middleditch as a scientist, along for the ride. Bradley Whitford is the obligatory snarky-casual analyst, not one of his comments funny. According to IMDb, Ziyi Zhang plays two characters, though I’m not sure how. The film jumps around between locations so frequently that it’s easy to lose track of who’s where (or even who’s who), leaving CCH Pounder, Joe Morton, Aisha Hinds, and numerous others out in the wind. Watching the cast list roll by at the end means frequently thinking, “Oh yeah! He was in this!” You know that thing in movies where an expert’s vacation is interrupted by a helicopter that lands right there next to the lake where they’re fishing or whatever and whisks the expert off to an important mission? That happens. You know that other thing where a hatch or a door or something is stuck, so someone has to stay behind and open it manually to deploy the weapon, thereby sacrificing himself heroically? That also happens (twice, though it’s unclear whether the second person survives). All anyone wants from a movie like this is memorable monster fights. What we can see is often spectacular, and Mothra’s design is beautiful, but it’s always too brief, too choppily edited, and smeared with evidence of the current weather patterns. The film, the cinematic equivalent of a rerun, offers no justification for its existence. Have I seen too many movies? Probably. But I think the real problem is that too many movies are just like too many other movies."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Drawing upon themes and ideas from the original Japanese Godzilla/Gojirah movies, hugely popular since the titular figure first appeared in 1954, this again (and of course) uses oodles of top-shelf CG instead of the more familiar sweating-stuntmen-in-baggy-suits routine, and the effect is mostly enjoyable and these monsters have never looked so good. Purists will rage about it not being honest but, well, too bloody bad. Others will rightly fume about the dodgy script as we open with Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) still haunted by the events of 2014 when those weird MUTO creatures destroyed San Francisco while battling the essentially virtuous Godzilla, a gargantuan, atomic-powered, thunder-thighed dinosaur with slightly anthropomorphic facial expressions. Her surviving kid Madison (now played by Millie Bobby Brown from Netflix’s Stranger Things in her first feature film) worries about her Dad Mark (Kyle Chandler), who split and left the cryptozoological group Monarch and therefore isn’t with them somewhere in China as they observe the emergence of the outsize Mothra, one of the few female kaiju, in a larval stage. Emma and Madison are then kidnapped by the forces of eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance – who else?) and Mark is compelled to rejoin Monarch by continuing representatives including Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) and Dr. Ishirō Serizawa (Ken Watanabe as a character whose surname links him directly to the 65 year old original), while Emma and Mark find themselves in what’s supposed to be Antarctica (but isn’t). It’s there that Jonah is setting about thawing ‘Monster Zero’ (another in-joke), a three-headed dragon-hydra that fans know is King Ghidorah, and awfully convoluted scripting leads to the revelation that these ‘titans’ are all rising for some reason, and that Emma thinks she’s doing the right thing by activating her very scientific gizmo ‘Orca’. Whoops! All that is just the pretext for a series of confrontations between a rejuvenated Godzilla, a fully-moth-like Mothra, an enormous hawk/pterodactyl called Rodan and Ghidorah, one of the nastiest beasts from Toho Studios and certainly a worthy adversary to ‘The Big G’. And, as they variously kick the stuffing out of each other in Boston and beyond, the human characters try to get a word in edgeways, as the screenplay squeezes every cliché out of the goofily grieving Russell family dynamic. And, even though co-writer/director Michael Dougherty’s effort isn’t a Marvel movie, it’s nevertheless part of an established cinematic series so please note that there is something after the endless final credits which might (or might not) serve as a teaser for next year’s Godzilla Vs. Kong. It’s proof once again that aside from Godzilla, there are few beasts more gargantuan or resilient than a movie studio with some bankable, established intellectual property in its jaws."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," At the insanity of it all — the excess, the staggering amounts of cash, the cynical actors all collecting a paycheck even though they could see the script was crap and knew a very profitable movie studio had put a no-budget horror hustler in charge of the enterprise. Because all “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” was ever going to be was the priciest B-movie in history. But what’s the rule with B-movies, kids? I don’t know which is worse, the endless “Godzilla” reboots or this homage to the Japanese series (taking its title from the Raymond Burr starring 1956 film) with all the monsters on the Warners’ payroll deposited into one “universe.” They included the cautionary parable, monsters awakened by “atomic testing, the lesson that “history shows again and again how nature points out the folly of man,” to quote Blue Oyster Cult — which the film does. In “King of the Monsters,” we’re a long way from “The Day the World Discovered Monsters are real.” That was back in 2014, and now monsters are popping back to life, from the South Pole to Skull Island. It must have something to do with that heartless corporation, Monarch. But surely not. Not with Sally Hawkins, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Kyle Chandler, Zhang Zuyi and Ken Watanabe on the payroll! Millie Bobby Brown spent a “Stranger Things” vacation shooting this, a movie that’s pretty much instantly awful, in large part due to the efforts of the screenplay to work a headstrong and company-connected kid (daughter of feuding scientists Farmiga and Chandler) into the heart of the action. Because all these monsters being awakened need a counter-balance, and that’s what the Lizard King is for, at least in these movies. He is our protector from, oh, Mothra, Rodan and that hydra-headed thing, Ghidorah. The military (David Strathairn is an admiral, with Aisha Hinds and O’Shea Jackson Jr. are the fighting elite) is inclined to shoot first and ask for budget increases later. “Admiral, you MUST have faith in Godzilla!” Watanabe, a holdover from the last “Godzilla” movie, declares. “Poor Watanabe” is all I could think. Almost the only thing American audiences see him in is Godzilla movies.  Charles Dance shows up as a villain, the kid is put in jeopardy here and there, characters die; off-camera, as if their agent knew this was going to be a stinker, or nobly, in self-sacrifice, because that is a favorite trope in such Save the World spectacles. All just fillers — the locations, the explosions, the debates, the attempted one-liners. Because we know even without seeing the trailer that this is headed towards a Monster Sumo Mash finale. The idea that some might see the deliverance of The Titans (what they call these monsters) as a good thing, a cleansing “reset” for Planet Earth, is straight out of Bond villainy. Cynical and heartless, perfectly in step with the rest of the picture, in other words. At least the effects houses that digitally rendered Godzilla & Friends (Frenemies?) got paid for hurling radiation-zapping kaiju at me and you, usually brawling in the rain, often in edits that make even the lumbering slow motion a monstrously murky blur. Warners is going to make a buttload of bucks with this, and I don’t usually begrudge the business side on the hard decisions they take a flier on — $200 million for this, or four much better human stories with few special effects? But as the truism “If you’ve seen one ‘Godzilla’ movie, you’ve seen them all” still applies, I kind of hope they choke on the cash from this one. Huh. I almost inevitably see eye-to-eye with you on the big budget stuff, but not here. Thought this was passably fun, stupid, summer stock, and was surprised to see a metacritic score about 10-15 points lower than expected."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," Marking the five-year return of the lovable Godzilla is Godzilla: King of the Monsters. His return is a direct sequel to the 2014’s Godzilla and returning is Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa and Sally Hawkins as Vivienne Graham. Quite frankly, I forgot a lot about the 2014 film, which is a testament to how much seeing the first film really doesn’t matter. You just have to know, there are giant monsters and they’re about to crush popular cities across the nation. After losing their son in the 2014 San Francisco disaster by Godzilla and friends, scientists/zoologist/knows-better-than-us couple Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) call it quits on their marriage. Mark heads out into the wilderness to take photos of wildlife and Emma takes their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) to a remote laboratory, where Emma creates a device called Orca that uses the science of bioacoustics (apparently it’s a real thing) to communicate and control these titans. Emma developed the Orca for an organization known as Monarch. Led by Dr. Serizawa, Monarch has located and currently monitors over seventeen hibernating titans. Their mission is to understand and one day co-exists with these super-extra-large creatures. The Orca device is successfully used to awaken and communicate with the titan known as Mothra. Just as the experiment is declared a success eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) invades the Monarch facility, kills most of the staff and takes the Orca, Dr. Russell, and Madison hostage. Alan’s motivations are quickly revealed, as he plans to release all the Titans and have them wipe humanity off the face of the earth and bring balance once again to nature. As you’d guess, Alan’s plan works as he releases the three-headed hydra known as King Ghidorah, the only Titan who can stand toe-to-toe with Godzilla himself. While the general plan of releasing the titans works, it is not without disastrous consequences. You kind of point out the problem I had with this film. They don’t seem to get that we want to SEE the fight. Setting it at night and during rain and shooting it in a lot of close shots is not the answer. Where are the wide shots where we can see these monsters lumbering over the city? Any time they show them they cut away so fast you don’t have the time to take in what you’re seeing. These fights need to be shot like a boxing match on TV for them to be truly fun. How it is now just feels like a blur of images that are hard to decipher. The purist cinema of Catalan Albert Serra was never easy to assimilate whether due to its deliberate fluctuating pace or challenging topics, yet, in my... The setting is Panem, the remains of a collapsed North America; a country made up of 12 districts, all serving the Capitol. There used to be 13 districts,...

"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Okay in the monster battle moments but fairly dull and boring when any humans take over the screen time. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," One goes to see Godzilla: King of the Monsters for the enormous supernatural creatures destroying cities and each other, not for nuanced drama and characterizations. Which is good, because there’s considerable large-scale carnage—and very little logic—to be found in this big, dumb and only sporadically fun monster mash. Set five years after Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla (with Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s Navy snooze thankfully nowhere in sight), Michael Dougherty’s sequel finds Monarch, an organization dedicated to locating and handling the world’s growing population of “titans,” sparring with Congress over how best to handle the threat posed by the beasts. This argument is more or less irrelevant, however, because Monarch’s Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has developed a device known as the “Orca” which allows communication with titans via their “biofrequency.” With her ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) having abandoned his Monarch work—and their marriage—following the death of their son during Godzilla’s previous San Francisco rampage, Emma uses the Orca to awaken Mothra. And, with her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) by her side, she then makes friends with the giant insect. No sooner has that victory taken place than Emma and Madison are kidnapped by Colonel Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), a rogue “eco-terrorist” who covets the Orca. This forces Mark to rejoin Monarch, an outfit populated by a host of recognizable faces—Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, O’Shea Jackson, David Strathairn, Zhang Ziyi and Bradley Whitford—whose function is to either spout exposition or to make funny quips about the ongoing madness. They all have names, I’m sure, but if you’ve seen prior disaster films such as Independence Day, The Core or The Day After Tomorrow, you’ll immediately recognize them as familiar clichés designed to serve basic narrative functions, including saying things like “We must have faith in Godzilla!” and routinely staring upwards, in awe or terror, at the giants among them. Although trying to destroy these monsters would seem to be the sound national/global course, Godzilla: King of the Monsters can only exist if its CGI stars stick around long enough to tussle. Thus, Dougherty and Zach Shields’ script bends over backwards to depict a world in which presumably smart people—in particular, Watanabe’s Dr. Ishiro Serizawa—believe that some titans are our enemies but others are our friends; and furthermore, that they’re part of the natural order of things, and thus vital to the planet's continued well-being. Obviously, this is all just an excuse to posit Godzilla as both fearsome and on our side, thus giving us a rooting interest when his fellow titans awaken and not all of them are cool with sharing space with humanity. Coexistence with gargantuan monsters is an outright absurd idea. Yet it pales in comparison to Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ early twist: Emma hasn’t been kidnapped by Jonah, but is actually working with him. Emma believes that summoning these fiends from their ancient slumber will help restore the Earth, which is suffering from overpopulation, climate change and war (we’re “the infection”), and which will again find balance after the titans destroy civilization and foliage sprouts up in its ruined cities’ place. The fact that Emma doesn’t view this as, you know, THE APOCALYPSE, and instead thinks mankind will survive and then rebuild, is so insane that it throws the entire film off its axis, sending it into a tailspin of unintentional humor from which it can’t recover—at least, during its human-driven sequences, which are marked by laugh-out-loud moments like Strathairn’s admiral discussing “disasters we don’t even have names for yet.” Child-in-peril scenarios and noble martyrdom inevitably play a role in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Along the way, many fine actors are forced to navigate nonsensical situations and spout cornball dialogue. Chandler is such an innately charming and stout screen presence that he emerges from the fray unscathed. Most of his castmates aren’t as lucky, reduced to chatting and cracking wise in dull-looking control rooms. By hewing so closely to hackneyed conventions, the film provides no reason to pay attention to these sections, which—making matters worse—take up an inordinate amount of the 132-minute feature. By the time Emma tells her unhappy daughter, “I know things haven’t gone exactly as planned”—arguably the understatement of the cinematic century—Godzilla: King of the Monsters has gone off the rails; except, that is, for its signature clashes, most of which involve Godzilla as well as King Ghidorah, the three-headed dragon that Emma foolishly blasts out of Antarctic ice (at Outpost 32, a sly nod to John Carpenter’s The Thing), and quickly becomes the puppetmaster of its fellow titans. Ghidorah is a fearsome winged hydra, and its face-offs with Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan are suitably colossal. Dougherty stages his battles with a thunderous viciousness that’s tailor-made for a big screen (and Dolby sound system). He also regularly seizes opportunities to linger on images of mythic grandeur and beauty, be it King Ghidorah perched in triumph on a flaming volcano beneath a smoky burning-red sky, or Godzilla plummeting through a canopy of clouds as a flaming fireball. In those Heavy Metal-esque tableaus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters conveys a sense of awesome magnificence and terror. There’s a slightly cartoonish quality to its CGI monster designs—especially during its finale, when Godzilla, ‘roided up on atomic energy, comes a bit too close to resembling his Saturday Morning Cartoon counterpart. Still, Dougherty doesn’t skimp on the destructive spectacle. Boston (and Fenway Park) figure prominently in the last showdown between Godzilla and King Ghidorah, which is to say, Boston (and Fenway Park) are eradicated with a conclusiveness that will make Yankees fans cheer. That Madison watches the beginning of that ballpark bout from the press box is a cheeky gag that makes one wish Godzilla: King of the Monsters had a better sense of humor about its fantasticality (where is the Green Monster joke?!). As it stands, it’s the sort of serviceable summer extravaganza that will play best if viewed with friends who aren’t averse to chuckling at its more outlandish ticks. Moreover, it suggests that, for his forthcoming fight with the king of the jungle (via 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong), Godzilla would be wise to eliminate his human co-stars from the get-go, the better to seize the spotlight for himself. "
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," It’s been 65 years since this massive beast first stomped into cinemas in a Z-grade Japanese creature feature, and Godzilla (or Gojira) remains one of the genre’s most enduring icons. He smashes, he hatches, he’s open to subtle subtext. This time around, though, even the smashing doesn’t work.  A sequel to the 2014 blockbuster Godzilla, …King of the Monsters fails in almost every respect. The plot is flimsy — Godzilla collides with three other outsized titans to determine the fate of the planet. The movements of the behemoths are monitored by Monarch, a scientific research organisation whose members include an estranged couple (Vera Farmiga–Kyle Chandler) and their teenage daughter (plucky newcomer Millie Bobby Brown). An eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) is also on hand to ensure the success of a sinister scheme involving these prehistoric predators. Incoming director Michael Dougherty struggles to animate a slack screenplay that seems to think CGI malarkey can make up for the fact that there’s no story. Even the climactic smackdown between Godzilla and the three-headed arch-nemesis Ghidorah aka Monster Zero falls flat. Incidentally, the next film in the ongoing franchise, Godzilla vs Kong, is slated for release in 2020. Anticipation has already reached fever pitch as fans try to guess who will be the last monster standing. We can only hope the next one will be worth the hype. "
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," It is a travesty to waste Shakespeare on a film as soulless as Godzilla: King of Monsters but it was such a perfect fit, I couldn’t resist. Unlike the Bard’s classic Macbeth from where the line is borrowed, Godzilla’s latest inane iteration has enough sound and fury to fill up a dozen trashy films. The story, alas, can be written on a fortune cookie. Here’s taking a stab at it – Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) lost their son the last time the 355-feet lizard paid San Francisco a visit. The tragedy broke them up – while Mark found succour in wildlife photography, Emma lives with daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and embraces the Monarch programme to ensure a tragedy like that doesn’t recur. Because, surprise, surprise, Godzilla isn’t the only one, there is a total of 17 titans out there from the classic kaiju era and they need to be kept accounted for. On what appears to be ‘bring your daughter to work day’, Emma and Madison head to a super-secret Monarch facility when a titan is to be birthed. What follows is a twist so crackpot that the film never recovers – Emma and her daughter are kidnapped by an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) and soon we are in the middle of a Thanos-like spiel about restoring the ecological balance by letting the titans run wild; they can right humanity’s wrongs, such as overpopulation. The idea is so hare-brained that your sanity is the collateral damage. Avengers: Endgame carried it off because the one propounding it was called the ‘Mad Titan’ built up over the years, but here the characters lack both complexity and heft. And anyway, the film unspools whatever little goodwill it has built about its intentions by revealing the origins of its key villain. You can feel the Bryan Cranston-shaped hole in Godzilla: King of Monsters. If the film is supposed to be treated like a kitschy B-movie, which it is, someone forgot to mark the cast on that email. With their most serious faces on, the cast spouts the most asinine of dialogues and goes through motions that stretch common sense to beyond breaking point. There is not a moment of levity despite the film being about an ancient nuclear god Godzilla, a giant luminescent moth called Mothra, their arch-nemesis King Ghidorah who is a cross between a dragon and a multi-headed serpent, and a few other beasties. Where you want the film to embrace its campy origins and have some fun, it wants you to take it as a save-the-world enterprise with most of humanity acting as monster fodder. The face-off between the two perspectives is nothing short of the climactic fight between Godzilla and Ghidorah and ends similarly too – as an all-round mess. Talking of the fight sequences, they seem to be shot as a tribute to Battle of Winterfell. Everything is so dark and murky, sometimes, it is hard to make out which monster is winning, or whether that is a monster or a particularly violent thunder and clouds. The phosphorescence the film liberally applies on its monsters with doesn’t help either. I hold Michael Bay responsible. Godzilla: King of Monsters gives up on its rich kaiju past to embrace Transformers-like action sequences where big beasts fight with even bigger beasts and quantity is considered the perfect replacement for quality. If watching cardboard characters flit through an insane narrative as stop-gaps between kaiju havoc is your idea of a fun, then this is your juju. Me, I was ready to follow the actors and scream in terror. "
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," It’s hard to find a popular franchise film more divisive than Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, which alienated viewers for a number of reasons when it debuted back in 2014. Edwards attempted to hone in on the horror, in both destruction and in the realization of our cosmic insignificance, that a giant monster like Godzilla or the “MUTOs” would inspire, at the expense of the monster action that fans had come to expect from the franchise. The film is practically stuffed with arresting imagery, such as the strike team’s HALO jump in the skies above the burning ruins of San Francisco, of which only a filmmaker like Edwards could be responsible for, but it failed in one key attribute: The casting. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was not the man to lead this film, and his performance helped to suck some of the life out of an otherwise breathtaking experience. Kong: Skull Island, for all of its faults, managed to rectify a number of the character issues that the first Godzilla had, perhaps because of its Vietnam War-era setting, or, more importantly, because King Kong movies have always been able to carve out a niche for their characters that exist in pleasant opposition to the giant ape at its core. This is a harder feat in something like a Godzilla movie, where existential terror is more of the point, rather than the cruelty in humanity’s exploitation of the natural world, but we Americans are always going to give our stars screen time.  So, Mike Dougherty’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an attempt to straighten out the new Godzilla franchise by making it conform more easily to the conventions of the disaster movie genre, much like Roland Emmerich did back in 1998. Of course, it is a thousand times more successful on that front than the Matthew Broderick vehicle ever was, and its action is stronger at times than in Edwards’ film, but it ultimately feels like a half-measure for this new franchise, meant to please too many people at once, and, in the process, it loses its identity. The stretch-marks of continuity are ever-present across this film’s bloated runtime, as it’s pulling double-duty, attempting to set up the Monsterverse’s first big crossover, hitting theaters next year, and the inevitable Godzilla sequel in the future afterwards, in order to keep the Big Kaijungus himself at the forefront of our collective imaginations.  Godzilla, this time, serves as the main metaphor for the destruction and schism caused by a parent’s change in attitude after a divorce, whether that be in the form of an attraction to fundamentalism or depression. Those parents are played by Kyle Chandler (it is very fun to imagine this being a movie that his character from Peter Jackson’s King Kong is starring in) and Vera Farmiga, who, in the aftermath of losing a child to Godzilla’s battle against the MUTOs in 2014, fell apart. Chandler’s a wildlife photographer who buries himself in his work and his whiskey, and Farmiga’s a scientist for MONARCH, the SHIELD-equivalent of the Monsterverese, who has developed a way to communicate with the “Titans” that are hidden all over the world. Their remaining daughter, played by Stranger Things star Millie Bobbie Brown, is understandably upset about her parents’ separation, but she’s able to follow along with her mother on her travels, and is able to see things that the average human could only imagine, so it’s a pretty good trade mark. One day, we’ll truly be able to understand the havoc that the Spielbergs’ divorce had on American pop culture over the years, but Dougherty feels very indebted to the beard in his checklist-like approach to the emotional material here. It’s sort of acknowledged and never really quite explored, and it feels very performative and perfunctory.  Anyways, after an eco-terrorist group attacks the facility that Brown and Farmiga are staying at and kidnaps them, Chandler’s recruited by MONARCH scientist Ishirō Serizawa (Ken Watanabe, once again elevating this movie simply by his presence) and G-Team head Diane Foster (Aisha Hinds) to help track down his wife, and to perhaps give some advice about Godzilla’s potential movements. But the eco-terrorists have a plan, of course: Their leader, as played by Game of Thrones’ Charles Dance, wants to resurrect all of the monsters lying dormant beneath the Earth’s crust, starting with King Ghidorah, who is encased in Antarctic Ice (those potentially worried about superbugs coming from melting ice-caps: You should now be concerned about three-headed dragons coming to fuck your shit up as well). So, the G-Team, which comprises a few Special Forces soldiers (including ones played by O’Shea Jackson Jr. and Anthony Ramos, given fuck all to do here), silent scientists (Sally Hawkins, whose brief appearance here makes it clear that she got the fuck out of dodge the minute The Shape of Water started to get Oscar heat), and comic relief characters (Thomas Middleditch and Bradley Whitford, each competing to see who can give the audience a migraine first), must stop the eco-terrorists from completing their goal. As you probably have surmised, they fail, and the world is basically over. So humanity must turn to their last protector, Gojira himself, in order to save their bacon. There are a few stabs at comparing the Kaiju to climate change, or other eco-disasters, but they’re just glancing blows, which never really stick.  Dougherty feels torn between two impulses: On one hand, he wants to maintain the scale and staging of Edwards’ previous installment, and on the other, he wants to give into the crowd who was angry about the lack of monster-thrashing that happened in the 2014 film. This results in a half-hearted compromise, in which a number of action sequences are set at the ground level that frequently interrupted said kaiju throwdowns. There are moments when the former approach works here — for instance, a Spielbergian interaction between Farmiga, Brown, and the larval Mothra is able to capture the scope and wonder of that encounter from a child’s perspective — but others, like a scene in which our leads, on the diamond of a ruined Fenway Park, have to evade the footsteps of Godzilla and Ghidorah in their final battle, are so hopelessly incomprehensible and ugly that they just take you out of the viewing experience all together. There are times in which it gets incredibly frustrating, as well, such as the moment when, right after said apocalyptic final battle starts, the airplane that our heroes travel onboard swoops into view, and we’re taken away from the action for another two or three minutes, so that we can see our human protagonists ooh and ahh over unknown spectacles that we aren’t privileged enough to see. It’s so frustrating and disappointing that this, of all things, is what the makers of the Monsterverse took away from Godzilla, instead of the pulse-pounding fear and existential helplessness that such a gigantic creature would cause to a species so convinced  of our worldwide dominance, which Edwards realized so smartly.  That said, there are still some awe-inspiring moments sprinkled throughout (especially the emergence of Mothra’s final form, which is worthy of the IMAX treatment), especially during the fight sequences. They’re well worth the ticket price for the Godzilla fan, including a special moment near the end of the film that, trailers be damned, I won’t spoil for you here. In addition, Dougherty does have some wild ambitions which manifest themselves in the film’s second half, which manages to take King of the Monsters to some really interesting places (and I mean that literally, as there is a setting in this film that single-handedly saved the movie for me). Had he been able to make his Destroy All Monsters with a studio budget behind it, I imagine I would have enjoyed this a ton more, as he clearly wants to go there! There’s no better proof in the fact  that, when liberated from the human POV, he excels at giving some solid monster-on-monster action.  It’s basically Monstermania XXXV, all things considered, so when Rodan and Ghidorah show up for their tag-team match against Godzilla and Mothra at the end of the movie, it’s not going to be too hard to get the crowd to pop. But I wonder if Dougherty would have been better off being able to make his own film, without the heavy producer oversight here: It’s not like the concept of a “monsterverse” hasn’t survived the presence of stylistic filmmaking before. But the end goal here, after all, is to establish the new status quo for Godzilla vs. Kong, and to ensure that your asses will be firmly in those theater seats next March for Monstermania XXXVI, and if you’re entertained in the process by Godzilla: King of the Monsters, well, that’s a pleasant enough side effect. "
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Story: There’s a threat to humanity once again and in order to survive, a bunch of scientists come to a rather preposterous solution. Instead of wiping out the mammoth monsters who can cause human extinction, they hope to coexist with them by reawakening their king — the mighty Godzilla. Only he can restore the nature’s balance by destroying the bad monsters, especially the invincible three-headed Ghidorah aka Monster Zero. Review: Most Hollywood visual extravaganzas, be it disaster epics or superhero fantasies, thrive on the same theme — a few sacrificing people struggling to save the world against all odds. Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters is no different. It reproduces the same survival logic that (Marvel’s villain) Thanos endorses. Destroy half of earth’s population for a better tomorrow. They try to achieve this by unleashing various gigantic radioactive monsters. Apparently they deserve to rule the world as they came here first. Even if you choose to overlook the script that’s littered with daftness, the predictability is hard to ignore. A loud background score doesn’t hold attention. It only screams for attention and that makes the film even more difficult to digest. The reverence for Japanese monsters, especially the atomic lizard as if it were a pet and will do what is expected out of him is hard to buy. The only aspect that goes in the film’s favour and keeps you awake is the epic scale fights between the good and the bad monsters. The dysfunctional family subplot, uncalled for sacrifices hold no relevance in the bigger scheme of things.  If you get a kick out of watching disaster movies involving massive creatures, you can watch this one while munching on some popcorn. Despite the plot’s blatant stupidity, the visuals showcasing destruction of epic proportion and the terrifying arrival of King Godzilla offer some solid jump scares.  Overall, this clash of the titans tale is forgettable and cliched. Every time any character harps on ‘symbiotic relationship between monsters or restoring the nature’s balance and human-monster coexistence’, you want Godzilla to fart on them so that they stop talking.  Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community. Help us delete comments that do not follow these guidelines by marking them offensive. Let's work together to keep the conversation civil. I missed this when it came out. I am just catching up. This the the worst movie I have ever seen and I like The Pest. Mother is a nut Father is a nut poor Maddie...who knows how to operate the equipment??? How did the have a Monster Zero and not know he was not one a &quot;good&quot; one. They went all the way to wake Zilla up and they didn't know the trigger was busted (although Armageddon). They find the Orcha amongst all the debris and chaos just lieing on the grdon't. Crazy mom shows up to save them...I guess if you leave your brain at the door then maybe...nah..not even then. Just dont."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," Having seen the 2014 “Godzilla” remake and now the new “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” I’m starting to wonder if perhaps these movies aren’t actually made for humans to watch, but for other godzillas. Plot, character, coherent action — maybe these are things that only appeal to us puny humans. Maybe godzillas like movies where all the action looks like it was filmed through a glass of dirty water, or where the characters zip frantically from location to location around the globe for no particular reason. Maybe to the godzillas, this is “Citizen Kane” and not a massively disappointing summer blockbuster. (I realize, by the way, that there’s only one Godzilla, and the correct term for all the giant monsters in these movies is “kaiju,” or Titans. But “godzillas” is more fun to say and type, and fun is in short supply in these movies.) Gareth Edwards’ 2014 “Godzilla” has passionate defenders in some critics’ circles for holding back Godzilla until the last 45 minutes of the movie. What filled the void, unfortunately, were flat human characters emitting terrible dialogue while they waited for the monsters to show up. While “King of the Monsters” at least has monster-on-monster fighting from start to finish, Michael Dougherty’s film can’t make any character shorter than 100 feet tall remotely interesting. After the destruction of San Francisco in the last movie, Godzilla is roaming free while 17 other Titans are being held in suspended animation by a secret scientific organization known as Monarch. A Monarch scientist named Emma (Vera Farmiga) has invented a device called Orca which allows humans to communicate with, and even control, Titans. Just after bringing the larvae-like Titan known as Mothra to life, Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobbie Brown) are kidnapped by an eco-terrorist named Jonah (Charles Dance). He wants to use the Orca to bring all the Titans to life and let them rule the overpopulating, polluting human race. And Emma seems to be on board with this idea. The rest of Monarch enlists Mark (Kyle Chandler), a retired researcher who also worked on Orca, to find Emma and Madison. Mark is also Emma’s ex-husband, estranged from his daughter, and he believes the Titans should all be destroyed. It’s a common debate among divorced couples trying to co-parent; one parent wants to unleash 250-foot prehistoric creatures to create a global apocalypse, and the other doesn’t. Jonah and Emma race around the world, waking up creatures familiar to the original Godzilla movies from Japan’s Toho studios, including Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster; Rodan, the Giant Bird; and Clifford, the Big Red Dog. (I made up the last one, but that would have been amazing). The Monarch team follows in hot pursuit, with Godzilla himself occasionally popping in to throw down with the newly freed creatures. Sally Hawkins, David Straithairn, Ken Watanabe, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Zhang Ziyi — “King of the Monsters” pays a lot of fine actors to stare at giant screens and say some really dumb stuff. At least Madison East High grad Bradley Whitford seems to be having a good time saying lines like “We’ve got Godzilla haulin’ ass off the coast of Argentina!” Characters change motivations from scene to scene, and sometimes within scenes. Mark’s “kill ‘em all” philosophy toward the Titans is immediately forgotten when the plot requires it. Moments of fan service (like the reveal that one character has a twin sister, a “Godzilla vs. Mothra” callback) land with an ungainly thud. And while the creatures look great, the fights are often sludgy and incomprehensible, the CGI carnage they cause (another American city goes down in the climax) unconvincing."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,"Director and co-writer Michael Dougherty's roided-up sequel offers exuberant fan service at the expense of dramatic storytelling, but the multitude of monster battles delivers king-sized entertainment."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE,"By the time Godzilla literally gets charged up with nuclear energy in the final act, moviegoers who decided not to check their brains at the door still might find themselves in a cinematic coma."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," Initiated in 1954 as an allegory for the USâ detonation of a nuclear bomb in Japan, the Godzilla franchise has slowly segued from political commentary into spectacle. In 2014, the franchise was rebooted to lackluster reviews and the introduction of a new shared universe involving a string of popular monsters. Five years later, audiences are ready to see Godzilla again with Godzilla: King of the Monsters (a title drawing on the 1956 Americanized remake of the original feature). Unfortunately the same problems that plagued the 2014 incarnation remain, with an overemphasis on wafer-thin human characters and a series of monsters you never see clearly. The team at Monarch, the secret program known for finding and harboring the monsters known as âTitans,â are at risk of being shut down by the government in the wake of Godzillaâs 2014 attack on San Francisco. When Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) goes rogue with a plan to release the Titans starting with âMonster Zero,â a hydra named King Ghidorah, itâs up to her husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler) to save the world and his daughter (Millie Bobby Brown). A movie starring a giant lizard doing battle with a hydra, something passing for giant woolly mammoth, and a giant moth sounds like the makings of a good time, right? And there are certainly glimpses of said awesomeness within King of the Monsters. If you can see it. Itâs amazing that in 2019 there appears to be a lack of confidence in the CGI work of particular characters. So, in this case, nearly all the fight scenes take place at feet level, with the likes of Brown, Chandler, and Farmiga looking up in awe. Unfortunately that often means the creaturesâ heads are super tiny up there with all that altitude. Thereâs no definition on Godzillaâs face; you can barely tell he has eyes unless a piddly human is standing right in front of them. And every fight scene has to take place inÂ inclement weather, so enjoy seeing your Ghidorah/Godzilla fight scene in rain, snow, and extreme wind with the camera doing the filmic equivalent of the hokey pokey. It never feels like the movie successfully figures out what to do with the giant monsters that inhabit it, so itâs stuffed with a two-hour narrative thatâs as thin as it is clunky. Acting as a sequel, Chandler and Farmiga play characters who were seemingly involved with Monarch but who we never heard about in the last feature. Theyâve been working on a machine to create an âalpha frequencyâ and thus control the monsters, but the death of their son caused their marriage to dissolve. Yes, this is one of those âdivorced parents work out their garbage amidst a literal disaster that acts as metaphorâ plot. Chandler and Farmiga are fine as macho man wolf photographer and definitely murderous yet true believer eco-terrorist. Add in their scrappy daughter who literally has to decide between her parents during a monster invasion and you have the makings for total silliness. The issue is you never care about their personal squabbles and everyone just acts so one-note. Chandler yells a lot and generally acts like a dad. Farmiga says a lot of important dialogue but is generally dead-eyed. And Millie Bobby Brown is the queen of scared and âoh, yeahâ looks. Seriously, nearly half her scenes are done in profile over her shoulder. But, wait, there are even more characters to not care about! Everyone, from Bradley Whitford to Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, and OâShea Jackson, Jr. also populate the film, but thereâs little doubt youâll remember their names. In two-hours thereâs little worth remembering about Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Thereâs a lot of weather, monsters roar, and occasionally thereâs a fight. In the end, it just feels like a blurry mess. We still havenât cracked the right ratio of monster to human here, but it feels like itâs getting worse. Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," Your reaction to the latest Godzilla movie will likely depend on what you expect when you hear the words in its title — Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Are you bracing for thoughtful human drama, or a skyscraper-sized kaiju spectacle? If it's the latter, part with $13 this weekend and see this big, dumb, beautiful movie. If the former, read the title again. Or perhaps it’s the filmmakers who should’ve done that. Michael Dougherty’s contribution to the Godzilla canon — the 35th movie about the nuclear-powered monster since the original Japanese film in 1954, and the third entry in the Warner Bros. MonsterVerse franchise — is a thrill when it seeks to deliver what’s on the packaging. It fails completely when it dishes up its half-assed meditations on the circle of life or the way the re-emergence of prehistoric god-monsters can wreak havoc on a marriage (although, I would probably watch that movie, were it done well). The cast here is actually rather impressive, headlined by Kyle Chandler, Vera Fermiga, Millie Bobby Brown and the returning Ken Watanabe, along with Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins and Ice Cube’s son, O’Shea Jackson Jr. That’s in addition to the major stars: the titular monster, plus the famed Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidora. There are a lot of mouths to feed here, and the humans get the scraps. That’d be fine, except that the filmmakers don’t seem aware of that fact. I can sum up the core of the story here very simply. As prehistoric monsters (and one three-headed alien dragon) re-emerge and fight for supremacy, humans are faced with a disaster of their own making. The trouble is, the film seems desperate to be more complicated than this. There’s Monarch, the government agency tasked with finding and containing the ancient monsters known as Titans; there’s Emma (Farmiga), a Monarch scientist who believes the Titans should be freed to restore balance to the world, and her estranged husband Mark (Chandler), who wants to kill Godzilla and the other Titans because the couple’s son died during Godzilla’s destruction of San Francisco in the first movie. Oh yes, and there’s also a sub-sub-plot about an eco-terrorist played by Charles Dance (that is, Tywin Lannister). None of this adds to the movie, and at times it subtracts from it. Beyond the needlessly convoluted plot, there’s just too much explaining. The wry quips from Bradley Whitford’s character are closer to the tone Dougherty should’ve aimed for. But many times, the capable ensemble is tasked with doing too much telling in a movie that should be all about showing. At one point, Farmiga's character performs what is essentially an earnest PowerPoint presentation on how human behavior has led us to this point and why unleashing the monsters is the best path forward. But anyone coming to this movie in 2019 should know that humans deserve, at this point, to be trampled under a monstrous radioactive foot. We’ve courted disaster. And that would be better left as subtext than overwrought text. Still, I felt giddy when the monsters were in the frame, and their clashes elicited claps and cheers during the screening I attended. There are multiple shots in Godzilla: King of the Monsters that are suitable for printing out and framing. Among them: Godzilla and King Ghidora charging at one another, Rodan emerging from the volcano where it had been lying dormant, Ghidora seated on the throne (also a volcano), and Mothra spreading her incandescent wings for the first time. Because the narrative about film franchises is now followed just as obsessively as the narratives within said franchises, we all know where this is headed — the 2020 release of Godzilla vs. Kong. Still, it’s good fun to see that endgame (heh) teased in the credits. The idea of monsters as a living metaphor for nuclear weapons (or climate change, or an unfit president, or whatever you wish) remains compelling, and the spectacle of a big-screen monster mash can be wildly entertaining. Here’s hoping the franchise's future filmmakers don’t try to bite off more than they can chew."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," THIS sequel to the 2014 monster spectacular Godzilla picks up the story a few years after Godzillaâs massive battle with the insect-like monsters called Muto (massive unidentified terrestrial organism) in San Francisco. Now a scientist who once worked for Monarch (a secret organisation which hunts monsters and tries to contain them), Emma has created a machine called Orca, that can not only communicate with these monsters â who have since been given the nickname of Titans â but also, on some level, control them. While visiting a Monarch lab to see a giant caterpillar-like creature called Mothra, Emma and her daughter Madison (Brown) use the Orca to turn the creature docile. Monarch bosses Drs IshirÅ Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) call in Emmaâs estranged ex-husband Mark (Chandler) to locate the Orca â which he helped create the prototype â and âsave the worldâ. Some aspects of the story will leave you scratching your head, but the sight of Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Rodan will get fanboys and fangirls in a tizzy. Bear McCrearyâs sweeping film score helped too. Adding humour in an otherwise dire global situation are supporting characters such as sarcastic crypto-sonographer Dr Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford), Monarchâs wide-eyed director of technology Dr Sam Coleman (Thomas Middleditch), as well as Monarchâs straight-faced mythologist Dr Chen and her twin Dr Ling (both played by Zhang Ziyi). Still, this is a movie for those who really love Godzilla and his fellow Titans. By the way there is an end credit scene that may have some bearing on the third Godzilla flick."

"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," Warner brothers Monsterverse franchise is back in full swing with their third entry and second Godzilla movie, Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Things are heating up for the big bout expected next year: Godzilla Versus Kong. Picking up from the end of Godzilla, in an oddly similar vein to Justice League, we find Monarch scientists (that secret group that have been monster-watching all this time), Emma, Mark and their daughter Madison searching the rubble of San Francisco for their lost son, Andrew, as Godzilla prepares for his final encounter with the rival monsters from that film. Five years later,  daughter and mother are in Brazil where Emma is continuing her work with Monarch. Mark has retired, after finding it hard to work for an organisation that has involvement with the large creature that inadvertently killed his son. Emma is on the cusp of a breakthrough in communicating with the creatures thanks to a device known as Orca and, would you believe it, only one of these devices exists. Enter Captain Jonah, an  eco-terrorist psychopath and his motley crew, just as Emma is putting the Orca device to good use on Mothra who has just emerged from her cocoon. One carnage of Monarch personnel, kidnapping and trip to yet another Monarch base in Antarctica and things are looking bad for humankind. The eco-terrorists plan is to awaken Titans (posh scientific term for monsters) all over the world in the name of saving the planet, give or take a few billion people I’m guessing. Things get out of hand, I kid you not, the idea of setting Titans loose wasn’t a bad idea to the perpetrators until Ghidorah, three-headed rival to the big G is let loose as part of this well thought-out master plan. It turns out Ghidorah ain’t from around here and has titanic plans of his own. Godzilla: King of the Monsters has one of the most bonkers premises I’ve seen in a while. The slaughter-filled plan to save the planet is up there with the most abominable plans of past dictators give or take a titan or two. But because of this bonkers premise rather than despite it, the film flies along with its sincere bonkerness in the best possible way. The actors do their best despite getting landed with the most God(zilla)-awful dialogue and spending most of the time having terrible ensemble chats, jammed to the cloisters with exposition and on-the-money plot information. At least some of them seem to know they are in a monster movie, which adds to the fun. Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe reprise their roles from the first film as well-meaning Monarch scientists. Ken fares the best of the two and finally gets to be up close and personal with Godzilla. Poor Sally does not fare as well. Hero duties fall mostly to Kyle Chandler who many will remember from Peter Jackson’s King Kong – pure coincidence I’m sure that he is back fighting monsters and looks to be around when Kong returns next year. Millie Bobby Brown fares well as Madison, the conflicted daughter of Emma and Mark. Underused and coming out the best of all is Charles Dance as Captain Jonah Alan, who  gets to be the real beast of the film; when not slaughtering innocents he pontificates about what terrible creatures humans are."

"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," Godzilla: King of the Monsters presents itself as a movie, and indeed: You can now plunk down $15 or whatever for a ticket at your local multiplex, load up on soda and nachos, and spend 132 minutes (not including previews) watching characters say, howl, or screech things and monsters slam each other around, all amid dimly lit rainstorms and backed by very loud noises. It is, technically, A Movie. But King of the Monsters feels oddly stilted, even for a monster movie. The sequel to the favorably reviewed 2014 Godzilla (and the latest entry in a long and storied litany of films about the kind of lizard-like monster) lurches back and forth from kaiju-battle spectacle to brain-numbingly dull human drama. It feels not unlike a particular sort of video game, in that the interstitial bits of dialogue between the human characters serve mainly to get us from one big showdown to the next.  But a good video game also invests time and effort in those bits of dialogue and drama, so that players get interested in its story and themes as more than just window dressing for the parts where they solve puzzles and shoot at stuff. A good movie should probably do the same.  Alas, King of the Monsters does not. But I’m grateful for the film nonetheless, because it gave me 132 minutes to sit patiently and ponder an important question: If everyone seems to be loving the spectacle, should it matter to me if the rest of the movie is a bore?  The story of King of the Monsters is not at all interesting, but in brief: It takes place five years after the events of the 2014 film, in which the human world discovered that monsters were real, and a lot of people died. Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler), a pair of married scientists who have since split up, were there in 2014 with their two young children, one of whom was killed during the attack. The other, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), is now a teenager.  Emma and Madison live in a rainforest in China, where Emma, a paleobiologist, works for a secretive coalition called Monarch; its goal is to find the monsters, which haven’t been seen since 2014. Her main project is tweaking a machine called Orca, which emits radio frequencies that reduce the monsters from raging whirlwinds of destruction to much more docile (if enormous) beasts. Meanwhile, Mark is far away, trying to forget monsters by studying wolves. Then, in a series of bone-wearingly predictable developments, it turns out that some ecoterrorists also want to find the monsters for nefarious means, and that some of the good guys might actually be bad guys, and that humans both caused the impending END OF THE WORLD (by provoking the rise of the monsters) and could maybe also save it, yadda yadda yadda ...  Look, if you have seen any summer blockbuster made in the past decade, I’m confident that you could write a plot outline for King of the Monsters on the back of a napkin in a matter of minutes. The ante on the end-of-the-world blockbuster has been upped so many times that their plots have become largely interchangeable. It doesn’t matter if the threat is Thanos, or Decepticons, or aliens, or whatever — the end of the world has to be looming, the means of destruction has to be bigger than ever before, and blammo, you’ve got a movie. Which is why it’s patently silly to try to shoehorn monsters (or more specifically, kaiju, the Japanese monster tradition to which Godzilla and his ilk belong) into that endlessly rote story arc, if you’re making a mostly Americanized version of the Godzilla story. People are not here for plot. Whether or not the world is about to be destroyed matters very little to the audience.  In fact, why have humans in this movie at all? I found myself wondering as I watched. Some may counter with the notion that viewers need to see other people onscreen to “relate” to a film, and to that, I say I think they are deeply misunderstanding why people go see movies like Godzilla: King of the Monsters.  It’s just not the kind of movie that people want to relate to. Godzilla: King of the Monsters has two purposes. The first is to give audiences a way to watch big creatures fight each other. The second is to overload the senses.  On the sensory overload front, Godzilla: King of the Monsters delivers by blunt force. My parents like to tell a story about how, when I was an infant, I slept so soundly that they could go into my bedroom in their fixer-upper first home and pound nails into the walls without waking me up. After King of the Monsters, I suspect that I may actually be lulled to sleep by overwhelmingly loud noises, and I present as evidence the fact that I struggled much more to stay alert throughout its two-plus hours of wall-to-wall BRAWWWW and BLOOOAAAM and SCREEEEE and CRUUUUUUUM than I do during the quietest of quiet dramas in a language I don’t understand.  Honestly, this almost aligns with the film’s cockamamie plot, since the monsters, too, are lulled into docility by a particular frequency. Perhaps King of the Monsters is just on my alpha wavelength.  Coupled with the spectacle of monsters bashing one another to bits in epic battles — after dropping from storm-strewn skies in retina-searing flashes of light, or arising from the mighty ocean as radioactive war machines, or arriving onscreen in some other grand and overwhelming way — there’s just a lot to take in. It doesn’t look particularly cutting-edge, and because all the monster brawls are staged in dark rainstorms, it can be hard to make out what’s going on, but if you think of it as an animated film, it’s not half bad. Plus, it’s exciting when Godzilla finally shows up. (The movie’s named for him, after all.) All of which is to acknowledge that the reason people watch kaiju movies is to see kaiju fights, and there are a lot of kaiju battles in King of the Monsters. What leaves me in a quandary as a critic, though, is that it’s a cardinal rule of criticism to judge a movie on the basis of whether it succeeds for the audience it’s made for. And by that measure, King of the Monsters succeeds on the whole. But the film suffers from trying to add too much dialogue and drama without doing enough to make it interesting or even original; if you’re betting that someone might say, wide-eyed, “Long live the king” at some point during the movie, well, you may collect your reward.  In fact, if you aim to take your whole movie seriously, rather than simply focusing on the monsters, you may wind up expanding your audience. King of the Monsters, for example, could have leaned into the heritage of kaiju movies and explored the interaction between man and nature, between fear and awe.  At the very least, it could have suggested to its target audience that they are sophisticated enough as viewers to watch a movie that does multiple things at once, and sophisticated enough as consumers to demand more from their entertainment. In that regard, King of the Monsters feels like a cruelly cynical example of a blockbuster cash-in with no heart, an assembly-line product, the movie equivalent of indistinct, high-sodium corn chips designed to fly off the convenience store rack to satisfy hunger pangs, only to be forgotten an hour later. In exchange for your money, they’ll feed you the least they possibly can. (The difference here is that movie theaters want to charge you a lot of money to see the latest blockbuster, rather than just a buck or two for a snack.) Which leaves me, as a critic, with little to say. Godzilla: King of the Monsters has big monster fights in the rain. But it feels by the end like you’ve just spent hours of your life on a fleeting amusement park ride.  If the humans don’t matter, why bother with them at all? Why make these ham-fisted attempts at plot if you’re not going to turn the humans into real characters? Why not just let the monsters duke it out for two hours and call it a day? Or, alternatively, try to give those characters something approaching a spark of humanity, and turn their environmental apocalypse into something that might make the audience think for half a second about their own world?  That’s not too much to ask of a movie — especially a blockbuster with fighting kaiju. It’s too bad King of the Monsters couldn’t rise to the challenge.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Bond who? Star what? Avenge why? The true superstar of franchise filmmaking has nothing do with state-sanctioned murder, space opera or spandex, but is a gargantuan radioactive beast more interested in crushing cities than dispatching adversaries with a salty quip. Godzilla cares not for your bon mot. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, our titular behemoth’s 35th cinematic appearance, we focus on the struggles of the Russell family. Five years after the annihilation of San Francisco – caused by guess-who – killed their son Andrew, mum Emma (Vera Farmiga) and dad Mark (Kyle Chandler) are estranged and daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) lives with Emma in the jungle, working for a secretive corporation called Monarch who are protecting Godzilla and 16 other monsters across the world.  Emma, a bioacoustics boffin, is developing a smarty-pants sound generator that pacifies the monsters in case they get lairy again and start tearing up cities like it was going out of fashion. Enter Colonel Jonah Alan (an underused Charles Dance). An ex-army mercenary with eco-terrorism on his mind, he sees destruction as a way to start off a new way of life and save the world from itself or some such nonsense. He sort-of steals the sound generator (called an Orca) and sort-of kidnaps Emma and Madison and soon, the kipping monsters get rudely awakened and the carnage commences. As savvy readers can tell from the frivolous tone of the paragraph above, this latest ’Zilla is completely ridiculous. It’s a silly, fun sequel to Gareth Edwards’ so-so 2014 Godzilla and part of the Legendary Monsterverse that continues next year with Adam Wingard’s Godzilla Vs Kong.  Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn, as two scientists and an admiral respectively, return from the Edwards effort but one wonders why they bothered. The latter two are barely there and appear to be here as a contractual obligation. Watanabe meanwhile mostly exclaims “Godzilla!” in increasingly Groot-ish fashion: sometimes he’s warning, sometimes he’s enthusing. If these seem like unusually minor characters to reference, that’s merely because their absence is arguably more notable than the key humans. Chandler and Farmiga are competent actors but it’s tough to care about their characters when they show such little personality. For her part, Bobby Brown shows the same winning screen presence she evinces in Stranger Things but she’s not given much to work with. Moans aside, one does not watch a Godzilla movie for complex motivation or interpersonal dynamics. One comes for the booming, crunching thump of buildings being crushed and cities being torn asunder. On that level, King Of The Monsters does not disappoint. Godzilla himself is a fierce brute and his heavyweight rows with volcano-dwelling winged terror Rodan and three-headed fire-breather Ghidorah are spectacular.  It’s immensely satisfying seeing the monsters fight to the death and lay waste to sprawling conurbations in a maelstrom of heat, light and rubble. Indeed, amid the clamour and heat of a stinking rush-hour commute, one can easily imagine the pleasure these pre-historic giants might take in razing neighbourhoods to the ground with the swat of a limb. There’s not much in the way of human protagonists to care about but the monster life looks like a sweet one, even if at more than two hours, Krampus director Michael Dougherty’s film shows a bit too much of it. Even so, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an entertaining diversion from the real-life terrors clogging up news feeds on a daily basis and for that, it deserves some credit."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," There's an ostensible comic relief moment in Michael Dougherty's Godzilla: King of the Monsters that accidentally recalls weather notices in today's headlines. ""Bad news,"" declares a member of Monarch, the crypto-zoological agency formed to monitor the activity and habits of giant monsters around the globe. ""You can just call it news,"" replies chief warrant officer Jackson Barnes (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) with a defeated pout. ""It's always bad."" The reptilian colossus Godzilla was originally conceived by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishirō Honda, and Eiji Tsubaraya as a nuclear-powered bugbear; Honda's 1954 Godzilla film reflects Japan's acute fear of atomic obliteration, a shared cultural terror rooted in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings on August 6, 1945. In the 65 years since Godzilla introduced the radioactive behemoth to the world, he has gradually evolved from antagonist to eco-hero. Where Honda's original film taps into Japan's national trauma to give form to nuclear devastation, Dougherty's film recalls America's present-day anxieties over increasingly intense weather patterns tearing across the country from coast to coast. Tornadoes are tearing across Indiana to Ohio; temperatures are rising to 100 degrees in Jacksonville, Atlanta, Savannah, Macon, all the way up to Charlottesville, a high for the season; parts of Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Arkansas remain under flood watches. Last year, wildfires raged over northern California, taking a $3 billion toll on its inhabitants. Climate change, 2019's collective boogeyman, is the monster whose name everyone knows but whose existence not everyone accepts. Godzilla: King of the Monsters couches climate change fears in egomaniacal ignorance. Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), an embittered ex-Britishy Army colonel and determined misanthrope, foolishly believes humans have set Earth on a collision course with extinction, and that freeing the ""Titans"" — including King Ghidorah, the three-headed alien dragon serving as the film's villain — will tip the scales in the planet's favor. He and his team of eco-terrorists seek out the hidden locations of slumbering behemoths, wake them up, and set them loose on the world. Enter Godzilla, cranky at being disturbed from his long rest — he's been MIA in the five years since the release of Gareth Edward's Godzilla — and ready to rumble. Jonah convinces Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), one of Monarch's paleobiologists, of his perspective; the film proves them woefully offbase. Only Godzilla can tip those scales by kicking monster butt. This continues the long-established characterization of Godzilla as a force of nature; when Earth's natural balance is thrown out of whack, Godzilla emerges from the depths to set things right by roasting foes with his atomic breath, incurring billions of dollars in property damage in the process. Of course, sending in a monster to contain a monster is an extreme answer to an extreme problem. A positive outcome still means countless lives lost, homes and businesses reduced to rubble and ash, and iconic baseball stadiums left smushed into pavement. When the ruckus ends and mankind's monster triumphs, the damage has already been done. It's hard to call that a victory. In its extravagant way, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, pleads for environmental stewardship: Jackson's ""bad news"" line isn't a throwaway but a sober acknowledgement. Weather reports are rarely good. In fact, they're usually dangerous. Dougherty makes that environmental angst the film's throughline, fixating on the weather as both a plot point and an aesthetic. The characters, helpless to the Titans' whims, can only track the creatures' movements and warn others of their imminent arrival. When one monster first emerges in Mexico, a flap of his wings stirs up winds strong enough to send fleeing innocents careening through the streets; when King Ghidorah shows up, he brings a seething tropical storm with him. The monsters don't merely invoke memory of severe weather events; they are the weather events. Not one battle unfolds in clear conditions, and Dougherty uses the elements to advantage his action scenes: Ocean surfaces and cloud cover present opportunities for striking visual cues, Titans silhouetted by water and sky as they engage in epic contest. A literal climate change movie wouldn't be anywhere near this fun to watch. Catastrophe's so much more entertaining when wrought by kaiju. The effect of Dougherty's filmmaking is to marry monsters of imagination with monsters of reality. Godzilla: King of the Monsters' climactic slugfest between Godzilla and King Ghidorah is heralded by advancing storm clouds and punctuated with blinding rains; expendable human characters are vaporized by Ghidorah's lightning strikes, and iconic Boston landmarks are flattened as he trades blows with Godzilla. It's a tragedy, but it's also the only way the planet can move forward and heal. As Dr. Ishirō Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), Monarch's highest ranking scientist, counsels ex-Monarch animal behavior specialist Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), confronting one's demons means making peace with them. We learn in an early recapping scene that Mark and his now-estranged wife, Emma, lost their son in the Edwards Godzilla movie; he's held a grudge against Godzilla ever since. By the time Godzilla: King of the Monsters reaches its finale, he's come around on the big guy and embraced his presence as necessary for Earth's survival. This world of monsters is the new normal. Mark adapts, as those of us living in the real world have to adapt to our own new normal. If we don't, the news will just keep on being news.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," What follows—from prehistoric trills, roars and wails to the sluice of gurgling lava or the crunch of a stomped building—is a master class of immersive, creative sound design. Godzilla: King of Monsters is a film that seems to paint with sound—sometimes Pop Art, but more often large canvas Jackson Pollock splatter. Sound is not just a tool in this film: it’s the main focus. The story is a built around something called the Orca, a biosonar machine that can talk to the animals, Rex Harrison-style. Or more precisely, it can converse with the Titans—the super-sized species to which our titular 400-foot lizard belongs, seventeen of whom have been in deep slumber at different sites around the planet. The good guys can use the machine to chill the creatures out, while the bad guys—including a eco-terrorist played by Game of Thrones’ Charles Dance—can use it to rile them up so they can lay waste to Earth-destroying human society. Of course, if you find yourself paying an undue amount of attention to a movie’s sound design (it was created by Erik Aadahl, an Oscar nominee for his sound editing on last year’s A Quiet Place, 2012’s Argo, and 2011’s Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon), it is usually an indication that there’s probably something lacking with the film, and that is certainly the case here. The guttural growls and plaintive moans of the Orca are far more compelling than most of the dialogue. They are also considerably more emotionally resonant. Like Avengers: Endgame, current cinema’s reigning titan, the bulk of the action takes place five years after the devastation of the previous installment, 2014’s Godzilla, which was the 34th film in the venerable franchise that dates back to 1954. But you never feel the weight of the devastation, despite the fact that the main thread of a story is a family—paleobotanist Emma (Vera Farmiga), animal behaviorist Mark (Kyle Chandler) and their teen daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown)—torn apart by that tragedy. GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS ★★
(2/4 stars)
Directed by: Michael Dougherty
Written by: Michael Dougherty, Zach Shields (screenplay) and Max Borenstein (story)
Starring: Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Zhang Ziyi, Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Charles Dance
Running time: 132 mins. You also feel little shared connection with the beasts—nor do they to each other. This is despite the fact that we are regularly reminded that the rivalry between Godzilla and King Ghidorah (the three-headed interloper from another planet and pretender to the throne) is as old as time itself. Fittingly, their final showdown is in Fenway Park. Seeing these two grapple each other—the CGI equivalent of Andre the Giant facing off against Big John Studd back in the day—is of course the chief selling point of the film, just as it was when the draconic behemoth first shot electricity from its three mouths in 1964’s Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. It’s an epic match-up that is genuinely thrilling, and provides some of the few moments when director Michael Dougherty’s film visually meets the high bar set by its sound. But the classic face-off arrives in an emotional vacuum rather than as an earned catharsis; the big fight never feels like a payoff. Every bit as valiant a battle is waged between the mostly talented cast and the words—often pseudo-scientific jibber-jabber punctuated by unnecessary explanation (“Dude hates Titans”)—they are forced to utter. Of the human characters, Bradley Whitford’s flask-swilling crypto-sonographer, shifting between countdowns (“ETA to Monster Zero, 60 seconds!”) and incongruous wisecracks, registers best, along with Ken Watanabe, returning from the previous film as a compassionate scientist. Watanabe even manages a few engaging platitudes, including one about how making peace with the demons that caused our wounds is the only way to heal them. There is also an initially heroic character who becomes so radicalized by the declining state of our environment that they team up with the bad guy extremists. Both ideas almost resonate in our era of divisive rhetoric and high stakes—almost. But Godzilla: King of the Monsters has only a passing interest in contextualizing its story with real world significance in the manner of the Toho classics. Larger ideas generally remain locked in an arctic deep freeze, just like one of the creatures at the start of the film. But in the film at least, when the ice cracks, you hear the glorious sound it makes deep into your bones. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," At the risk of sounding species-ist, most Toho Studios–designed giant monsters look alike in close-up. This is only a problem if, like the makers of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, you reserve your long, full-body shots for the big moments and the rest of the time cut between steaming reptilian snouts and blasts of blue flame. For much of the movie, I didn’t know who was winning, who was losing, or (half the time) who even was fighting. Is that one of Ghidorah’s heads or is it Rodan’s only one? The director, Michael Dougherty, can’t even seem to find the monsters in the frame. At some point a major character was killed and I missed it altogether. The movie is visual noise — it makes the Battle of Winterfell look like a model of clarity — and punctuated by dialogue so clunky I found myself wishing that Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, the ’98 Godzilla) had been hired to make it pithier. This thing is an unholy mess. If it seems as if there’s too much going on, it’s because there is. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the third installment in the “Titan” series, which posits that ancient monsters live deep in the bowels of our planet and have come out of hibernation because of climate change, pollution, mass extinction, etc. Although they have the potential to flatten cities, the Titans “bring an essential balance to our world,” says a scientist (Ken Watanabe, who knows from city-flattening giant monsters, having grown up with Godzilla in Japan). The problem, we’re informed, is determining “which are here to threaten us and which to protect us.” Guess wrong and there goes another shopping mecca. In the passable 2014 Godzilla, it was established that GodZ was our protector, and much of the previous two hours’ incoherence was forgiven when the big guy propped open the jaws of a M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) and incinerated the creature from the inside out. It was like he was saying, “Suck on this, asshole!” But Godzilla, King of the Monsters has more monsters and less dramatic logic. It also has an opening reminiscent of Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, in which a San Francisco mom and dad blame GodZ — humanity’s savior, for crying out loud — for the death of their son in the last film’s climactic inferno. So, they’re skeptical. They sort of like him but have their son’s bones to pick. Mom (Vera Farmiga) turns out to be another scientist at Monarch, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa’s monster-monitoring corporation around which this terrible series has been built; and partly to memorialize her son she wants more cities flattened by more titans, which makes no sense but is true I swear. She and the dead boy’s dad (Kyle Chandler) had split up when Dad blamed himself for not preventing his kid’s stomping and took to drink, but the Japanese scientist and his Brit sidekick (Sally Hawkins, who knows from aquatic monsters, having had sex with one) travel to where he’s photographing mangled animals and convince him to help them find Vera and his daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), after the pair are ostensibly kidnapped by an ecoterrorist played by Tywin Lannister. (Also opening today: Jaime and the Red Witch fight Islamic terrorists in Domino and Rob Stark sleeps with Elton John in Rocketman.) Kyle hates GodZ but agrees because, “I should have been there for them!” Vera’s stolen invention — the McGuffin — is a sound machine called the Orca that communicates with — or placates or provokes, it’s not clear — the Titans, which will cause them to destroy the planet and thereby save it from the terminal infection that is humanity. It’s like a new edition of Thanos’s Good Earth Guide. I’m not complaining because the movie is dumb. It’s called Godzilla: King of the Monsters, after all. I’m complaining because Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah (a.k.a. Monster Zero), and Rodan deserved better. Humans sort of kill Godzilla, then sort of revive him with a lethal dose of radiation (“Six minutes until he blows!”), but then … I honestly can’t tell you. The film fumbles every opportunity to endear itself. When Madison summons Godzilla to Fenway Park, there’s not even a joke about the Green Monster — what the hell? Godzilla meets King Kong next, apparently, but they’re both good guys in this series so what will make them fight? (Will they discover that both their moms were named Martha?) Frankly, I’m still not thrilled with GodZ being a champion of the natural world. The beast was conceived (in the original Gojira) to be as unnatural as possible — not an ancient lizard but a mix of the primeval and the nuclear apocalyptic. (That roar of his has an electronic component.) It’s true that after a while this metaphor for the A-bomb turned into Japan’s savior, but even Toho never thought to make him crunchy. Next thing you know, he and Mothra will settle down and start a commune."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," “Let them fight” was the raison d’etre of Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, the kaiju-centric creature feature that kickstarted Legendary Studio’s monster-verse back in 2014. Michael Dougherty’s sequel, King of the Monsters has certainly taken its forbear’s mantra to heart, offering up a smackdown between Godzilla and his most iconic enemies, writ extra-large in its IMAX presentation.  The success of Godzilla has always – since the character’s debut in Toho’s original Gojira  – hinged on the audience’s point of view. On the one hand, the clumsy, rubber-suited pagoda trampling of the early films was pure kitsch. But stick a rear-projection of that rubber suit against a foreground of carefully-composed civilians fleeing in terror, and a simple trick of perspective transforms camp into terror. On that knife-edge of spectacle and stupidity sits Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a lumbering, cacophonous monster, lurching recklessly from the straight-faced to the batshit ludicrous at the drop of a hat. This is a very different beast to Gareth Edwards’ predecessor. Where Edwards made us wait to see the titular titan, King of the Monsters throws up multiple monster smackdowns from the first act. This entry is structurally far more conventional than the 2014 film, but conversely, far weirder in its B-movie tone and expositional gibberish. But what we gain in gratuity, we lose in catharsis, resulting in a climactic four-way rumble that feels less impactful than the equivalent finale of Edwards’ effort, despite being bigger, louder and longer. The visuals, too, are muddier than the last film. Baddie monster Ghidorah is perpetually shrouded in tropical storms as a sop to the film’s rather incoherent environmental theme, but as a consequence, the torrential rain and wind blur details of the monsters to the point of obfuscation. Indeed, the visual design of the film is consistently murky: frustrating, perhaps, but also evocative of these creatures as literal forces of nature. When Godzilla emerges from the depths of the Pacific, his silhouette is barely distinguishable against the blue-black abyss; Mothra’s Gaia-like emergence is transcendent in its luminescence, while Ghidorah’s cyclonic necks and lightning breath embody chaotic wrath falling from the heavens. It is as if the environment itself has manifested these titans from the elements themselves. It’s harder to interpret away the problems with the film’s sound mix. Bear McCreary’s operatic score is buried under a ceaseless cacophony that too often blurs into inchoate noise. If nothing else, it serves as a reminder of the deafening power of effectively-deployed silence in disaster movies. Nevertheless, King of the Monsters soundscape does have a few tricks up its sleeve, not least an ocean-bound use of music that will have old-school devotees punching the air with glee and everyone else feeling wistful for the age of classic music themes. An amazing cast, counting Ken Watanabe, Millie Bobby Brown (acting everyone else off the screen), and a cruelly-wasted Sally Hawkins among its number, are redundant, though luckily Charles Dance’s deliciously evil moustache-twirler knows exactly what sort of film he’s in. His Jonah Alan exists purely to do evil things for the sake of being evil, without heed of anything as dull as plausible motivation. Jonah hearkens back to the schlock of the Showa and Heisei eras of the franchise, where humanoid aliens would manipulate the monsters into smashing up Tokyo for the simple purpose of being malevolent little shits. Being able to get on board with such nonsense determines the subjective success or failure of King of the Monsters. In the end, whether one buys into the spectacle, or just sees the proverbial dude in a suit, ultimately comes down to that old trick of perspective."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," Summer season has officially hit by now, which means after the first wave of relatively prestige tent-pole releases (Endgame, John Wick 3), we're settling down into the early doldrums, as studios release doomed, big-hype balloons week after week, only to see them pop into vapor after their opening weekends. Among the endless parade of capes, broad comedies, and teen dramas, we also have to contend with the obligatory, dreary rollout of ""scary"" movies. Anything to entice the young-uns to part with some of their parents' money to watch a litany of monsters get to their deadly business.  The idea of the monster is of course rooted deeply in the human consciousness, a primal fear our early hominid ancestors must have experienced, huddled deep in their caves, terrified of the unknown dangers lurking in the night. This weekend, a pair of films purportedly contend with such nightmarish creatures, one decidedly micro; the other about as macro as possible -- and both pretty much instantly forgettable.  Ma (Octavia Spencer) is a fortysomething woman living in the same small Ohio town she grew up in. Now a lonely single mother of an especially weak and frail daughter, Genie (Tanyell Wavers), and working as an easily distracted veterinary aide, she still harbors the trauma from a horrible and very public sexual humiliation, perpetrated by a leering high school boy she hugely crushed on named Ben (as an adult played by Luke Evans), who also still lives in town. She is desperate in ways tangible and harrowing, with little or no outlet.  That is, until she meets the sympathetic Maggie (Diana Silvers, last seen in Booksmart), a teen just having moved to town with her despondent mother Erica (Juliette Lewis), outside a liquor store where Maggie and her new friends are trying to convince an adult to score them booze. With some initial trepidation, Ma complies, and soon Maggie, her new boyfriend, Andy (Corey Fogelmanis), and their other friends are hanging out in Ma's basement, partying up a storm.  When word gets out at their school, Ma's parties become huge teen events, with free-flowing booze and pharmaceuticals streaming in all directions (and, oddly, everyone grooving to ""Safety Dance""). Naturally, things quickly begin to unravel, and as Ma gets more and more desperate to keep her newfound popularity, her painful feelings of rejection quickly morph into bizarrely bloody sadism.  Apart from a truly absurd script, director Tate Taylor's film performs ungainly political gyrations -- asking us to root against a survivor of sexual abuse and humiliation for trying to gain (albeit misplaced) revenge on her attacker. Sort of a rape-revenge thriller set upside down, such that nothing makes any ethical (or emotional) sense. It quickly becomes an awkward mishmash of impulses, wanting to provide cheap scares while fostering a deeply schizoid sense of sympathy, while managing to fail mightily at both.  Despite yeoman work from the always outstanding Spencer -- whose demeanor rockets between sweetly shy, abusively menacing, and party girl, like a little kid pounding on a toy xylophone -- she has almost nowhere to go with all the work she pours into the character. She's a vessel bereft of liquid.  Four decades ago, Brian De Palma's Carrie asked us to follow a similarly wounded and humiliated young woman -- albeit one with deadly telekinetic powers -- but, by placing us directly in Carrie's horrific life, with an abusive mother and the constant jeering of her peers, it addressed the idea of audience sympathy in intriguing ways (by the end, during Carrie's eventual psychic tirade, everybody -- bad, good, or indifferent -- suffer equally). Taylor has no such intentions with Ma -- a film whose psychological nuance goes about as deep as a whitehead -- which makes for pointless, ignorant slop. It doesn't just blame the victim; it lazily turns her into callous psychopath in the process.  Even such banal attention to character is avoided in Michael Dougtherty's Godzilla: King of Monsters, the frenetically stupid sequel to the surprisingly competent Gareth Edwards film from 2014. As far as this film in concerned, the giant, radioactive-flame-breathing lizard hasn't been seen since, but when a sudden influx of monstrous ""titans"" start raising up out of the mucky deep recesses of the world, the King steps off his hidden underwater throne to go top-side in order to mix it up with other giants, including the gruesome, three-headed Ghidorah, awakened from an Antarctic cocoon of ice by the evil-minded Jonah Allen (Charles Dance), for reasons at first unknown.  In a deeply unabsorbing concurrent story, scientists Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his estranged wife, Emma (Vera Farmiga), still lament the loss of their young son after the first Godzilla appearance, while also worrying about their teenage daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). It is Emma, working for a government division called Monarch, designed to contend with such creatures, who designs a device that somehow reads the ""bio-rhythms"" of the creatures, which she can adjust to produce a calming effect on them.  There is no calming Godzilla, however, after he gets a load of Ghidora, who seems to be summoning all the other giant creatures (including a spider-type, a mastodon, and some sort of bird-beaked bat-like thing) to do his bidding, as if he were the reigning apex predator in what's clearly already the territory of Mr. Gojira.  Moving at constant breakneck speed, Dougherty's film lacks even basic lucidity or continuity -- it might be longest actual screentime (clocking in at over two hours) to the shortest amount of actual time elapsed I've ever witnessed in a summer spectacle. It feels as if all the events of the film take place within a half hour, with every countdown jumping ahead (things aren't even counted down from :10 seconds, they'll start at :07), and scenes rushed through at such an exhausting pace, the film never even tries to cohere. The creatures may clock in at millions of pounds, but this thing is light as a torn up Styrofoam cooler blowing down the beach.  What's actually depressing is seeing the talented cast (including Ken Watanabe, Thomas Middleditch, David Strathairn, and Sally freaking Hawkins) so thoroughly wasted, trying to speak lines as drippy as ""Our planet will perish ... unless we set Godzilla free"" with conviction, or contorting their mouths in aghast wonder staring up at an empty, green-screened soundstage, while imagining the CGI colossuses hurling themselves back and forth at one another.  Our sympathies might not be as torn as with Ma -- despite the movie's many other contrivances, Godzilla does at least pay lip-service to the idea that the monsters are actually a form of nature's balance, an eco-terrorist consortium designed to disrupt human beings' inevitable destruction of the planet -- but by the end, it doesn't even do justice to its own genre. For the film's climactic battle, Dougherty's ADHD camera keeps cutting away from the monsters' brawl (sorry) to showcase the idiot Russells, having highjacked a group of soldiers and a helicopter, frantically searching through the rubble of what was once Boston in order to be reunited with their daughter. Forget the millions of other inhabitants vaporized; at least we've got our Maddie back!  About the only bit of mischievousness in this overwrought mess is the absolute leveling of Fenway Park, as the creatures all battle for world supremacy in front of -- and through -- the Green Monster. Cities all over the earth have been leveled, millions of people killed, and giant beasties roam freely about the earth -- but one can only imagine the horror of what this catastrophe might do to the AL East pennant race. From left, Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), Asaj (Tracie Garrison), Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown), Sgt. Travis (Zac Zedalis,) Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), Asher Jonah (Jonathan Howard) and Sgt. Baker (Joshua Leary) team up with a giant lizard to save the world in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.

                Catholic Church. Frankenstein and King Kong were never, of course, entirely unsympathetic. Count Dracula was pure evil for a long time, but he has gotten more complicated, and for decades vampires have been heroes, antiheroes and romantic leads. On Sesame Street, where friendly monsters abound, the Count, sounding like Bela Lugosi, teaches young children numbers. Darth Vader was redeemed in the end. The Terminator came back as the good guy. Maleficent and the Wicked Witch of the West recently received humanizing back stories. At first a metaphorical expression of Japanese dread over the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Toho Studios’ most popular kaiju gradually metamorphosed by dint of sheer popularity into a welcome opponent of even more fearful characters, eventually becoming a beloved defender of Japan and humanity in general. This seems to be the pattern. At first we create monsters to embody our anxieties or the evils we fear. Yet the monsters are often more compelling than the heroes pitted against them, and we can’t bear to leave them as unmitigated villains. So they evolve into metaphors for something else: the unknown, perhaps, or our own capacity for moral growth. The humanization of monsters can entail a subversive critique of the social structures or norms that judged them monsters in the first place. If the Beast isn’t evil, then the pitchfork-wielding mob is, and indicting witch-hunters easily goes hand in hand with humanizing witches. Whether such subversiveness is pernicious or salutary varies, naturally, with the target of the critique. Sympathy for the devil is tantamount to censure of God, or at least of those who speak for him. Yet as long as human beings wrongly demonize one another, or project their worst fears onto the unknown, there will be a legitimate place for sympathetic monsters. “Slaying dragons is a Western concept,” says Zhang Ziyi’s Dr. Chen in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, responding to a query from an American colleague. In Asian culture, she explains, dragons are creatures of good omen. Yet the Godzilla franchise started out slaying its fire-breathing (or nuclear-heat-breathing) star in his very first outing. (Perhaps, representing American atomic might, he was a Western dragon?) Then, rather like the first How to Train Your Dragon premise, redeeming its dragons by imputing all their mayhem to one truly malevolent mega-dragon, the Godzilla franchise rehabilitated the big guy by supplying him with other draconian monsters to slay, notably King Ghidorah, unambiguously a menacing, triple-headed dragon. The 2014 Godzilla reboot, which launched Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, followed this approach. “Nature has an order — a power to restore balance,” said Ken Wantanabe’s Dr. Serizawa, explaining that Godzilla is here to keep the other kaiju in check. In Kong: Skull Island it was likewise revealed that King Kong played a similar role, defending the island’s indigenous human inhabitants from the far nastier creatures living there. Now, though, Godzilla: King of the Monsters raises a new possibility: Perhaps the world’s giant monsters have evolved as a kind of planetary defense mechanism and the menace they have arisen to fight is (wait for it) human overpopulation, pollution and war. Yet, like the last two Avengers movies, which ultimately had no compelling counterargument or alternative vision to the villainous Thanos’ nihilistic Malthusian argument for wiping out half of all life in the universe, King of the Monsters can’t say why it rejects misanthropic kaiju-based eco-terrorism. (“Murderous carnivores” is another scientist’s dim assessment of humanity, and this time there’s no rebuttal.) They don’t call them kaiju in the films, of course. The 2014 film introduced the acronym “Muto,” for “massive unidentified terrestrial organism,” but bizarrely applied it only to the one species Godzilla fought in that film. Clearly it should have been a catch-all term, like “UFO.” Maybe Muto wouldn’t have worked because at least one creature in the MonsterVerse turns out not to be terrestrial. In any case, King of the Monsters introduces a new term, “Titans,” covering giant beasties of all types — and they’re all here, pretty much. At least, all the big Toho stars are here: Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidora. It’s a regular clash of the, well, I guess they can’t call it that. Only Kong is kept offstage in the buildup to next year’s Godzilla vs. Kong. The 2014 film called Godzilla “a god, for all intents and purposes,” and Kong was worshipped as a god by the natives of Skull Island. King of the Monsters leans into these quasi-religious themes. The Titans are said to be Earth’s “original and rightful rulers,” the “first gods.” These words come from the scientist who called humanity an “infection,” but the idea of the Titans as gods seems to have more warrant. When an incredulous senator asks Dr. Serizawa, who believes that Godzilla is the key to peaceful coexistence between humans and Titans, whether he wants to make Godzilla our pet, Serizawa replies, “No — we will be his.” In one key shot in Mexico King Ghidorah crouches atop one of the volcanoes overlooking Mexico City, roaring to the heavens with an enormous cross looming in the foreground. Ghidorah is expressly called a “false king”; this shot explicitly casts him as a Satanic figure, even an Antichrist. By implication, of course, there’s a true king, a Christ figure, and you know who it is. (Actually, there’s more than one.) I’ve said almost nothing so far about the human characters. Human characters are never the selling point of a Godzilla movie, but this one is downright baffling in its borderline hostility toward its characters. At the center of the human thread is a broken family with a back story so closely and specifically involved with the Titans that I thought they must be characters I had forgotten from the 2014 film, which made such little impression on me that I remembered almost nothing about it. Then I rewatched the earlier film and was surprised to find it a better and more interesting film than I credited it at the time. Certainly a better film overall than King of the Monsters, except for one major thing: King of the Monsters achieves real grandeur in its kaiju battles and the earlier film doesn’t. At times it evokes the wild final battle in Aquaman, except the human actors don’t matter at all. With Mothra, King of the Monsters even achieves a kind of beauty not rooted in grotesquerie.  True fans may feel that the MonsterVerse, like the DC Extended Universe, is pushing its pieces onto the board too quickly, and the alliance of Godzilla and Mothra is established before Legendary got a shot at remaking Godzilla vs. Mothra.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," This super-sized creature feature with a pea for a brain stomps into cinemas intent on ruling the box office by squashing the audience into submission. A sequel to 2014’s visually gorgeous but dramatically sterile Hollywood reboot of Japan’s most iconic export, this is a screaming CGI assault on storytelling as well as the senses. As giant reptiles threaten all human life, it’s up to Godzilla to restore order and balance to the planet, aided by a plucky band of scientists and soldiers armed with nothing but hi-tech bunkers, battleships and fighter jets. Neither Aaron Taylor-Johnson or Elizabeth Olsen return, so humanity’s survival rests on the ability of B-list middle-aged leading man Kyle Chandler to deliver pitifully poor dialogue with the maximum dignity a fine actor can muster knowing his agent has sold him a ginormous pup. As Dr Mark Russell, he’s ­determined to rescue his teenage daughter and ex wife, played by Millie Bobby Brown and Vera Farmiga respectively, from a host of ancient monsters that are battling it out for supremacy. Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe reprise their roles as a pair of anxious and awe-filled ­scientists who stand around and throw scraps of info to the audience. While this delivers on its promise of epic monster action, this is an adventure which manages to make a staggeringly dull spectacle of someone scrabbling through an ancient lost city being consumed by lava to defibrillate a giant monster with a nuclear warhead. Plus, the script suggests we live in a world where massively powerful secretive global ­corporations are a force for good, while eco warriors are evil, and nuclear weapons have health-giving properties."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," The trashy “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” from Universal’s B-movie “Monsterverse,” directed by Michael Dougherty and co-written by Dougherty, Zach Shields (“Krampus”)  and Max Borenstein (“Kong: Skull Island”), has a nasty surprise in store for Boston. The film takes its title from the 1956 version of “Godzilla,” which had scenes with American actor Raymond Burr, who would become famous as TV’s Perry Mason, inserted into a dubbed version of the landmark Japanese kaiju (giant monster) movie and dark, atom-bomb cautionary tale “Gojira” and sold to American audiences. They loved it. They are not going to love this lame attempt to make one of pop culture’s most famous and beloved monsters a corporate shill. In the smoking ruins of San Francisco (and of the 2014 “Godzilla” reboot, which has not aged well), we meet Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown, “Stranger Things”), her father Mark Russell (yep, Kyle Chandler), and Maddie’s mother and this film’s stock mad scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga, of course). Maddie’s little brother, who dies before the action starts, is the similarly stock motivation for most of the film’s emotional conflicts. Returning from the 2014 film are Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) and Adm. William Stenz (David Strathairn), whose sole duty is to try to explain the film’s meaningless plot to us. Apparently, Dr. Russell has been estranged from her husband, Mark, since their son’s death and living with their spunky teen Maddie. Emma has invented a device called an Orca, which can mimic the sounds made by giant monsters. For his part, Mark has been in Colorado, studying wolf packs. In scenes set in China, we see Emma use the device to calm down a giant bug found in a vast mine. The bug is the larval version of Mothra. It makes a purring noise (as you may recall, Godzilla himself makes a trumpet sound, resembling your old man honking his honker). Mothra gets upset and slimes several scientists, while “eco-terrorist” Jonah Alan (Charles Dance, everyone’s favorite bad father) orders his central casting henchmen to shoot people wearing lab coats with assault rifles. Jonah then kidnaps Emma and her Orca. The “god-sized” monsters are known as “titans,” and they have returned because the Earth is in danger of extinction, not unlike the money you spent to see this. In addition to a dead child, this film’s favorite trick is lifted from the original “Alien” — the face-to-face stare down between the film’s teen heroine and a monster. I think we get it like three times here. Also here to explain the plot (and attract audiences in the Chinese market) is Dr. Chen (Ziyi Zhang). I am not sure what character Sam Coleman’s job was, perhaps to pay actor Thomas Middleditch’s rent for the year. In the course of events, we also meet three-headed flying dragon King Ghidorah, aka Monster Zero, and winged “fire demon” Rodan, not to be confused with the French sculptor. The monster fight scenes are so dark I can’t say if the plentiful CG effects are any good. You may notice that three of the four “titans” can fly, while waddling, super-sized Godzilla must honk at them from the ground and hope they come into range of his radioactive breath, no doubt a metaphor for the film’s toxic dialogue. To paraphrase Blue Oyster Cult: Oh, no, there goes Fenway Park. Go, go Godzilla (yeah)."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,Serious and solemn Godzilla: King of the Monsters is more concerned with the digital theatrics of its scenes of mass destruction rather than the humanity of its characters. [Full Review in Spanish]
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," Despite the vacuous content we’ve come to expect from blockbuster films, they do conform to one ubiquitous truth: they’re big, they’re loud, and they’re fun. Well, almost ubiquitous. In the case of Godzilla: King of the Monsters – the third installment in Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, which began in 2014 with Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla reboot – the first two points are entirely accurate: from the obnoxious screeching of the eponymous nuclear-charged lizard, to the roars of soaring fighter jets, it’s excruciatingly loud, and much of the film is shot indiscriminately wide. But fun? You’ll need to look somewhere else. How can that be the case for a film series about grandiose monsters fighting one another to the death, you ask? On paper, Godzilla: King of the Monsters should be the epitome of dumb, popcorn-flick enjoyment. It’s manifestly director Michael Dougherty’s key intent, as dramatic tension and character development are disregarded in favour of explosive set pieces and epic monster brawls. Unfortunately, these set pieces are little more than neurotic – if visually impressive – light shows. This wouldn’t be such an issue if the script was competently written, but Dougherty and Zach Shields’ effort is shambolic. The central plotline relies upon the exhaustingly overdone notion that we humans are the true monsters for our sins against nature. How original! This in itself isn’t entirely egregious, but the screenplay is lined with lazy dialogue, ill-conceived character arcs (Vera Farmiga’s Dr Emma Russell especially gets the short end here) and a problematic evocation of Orientalism. The battles are epic, the shots are wide, and the roars are loud, but no level of overcompensation can make up for laughable dialogue, hokey editing and a disregard for character development. You’ll walk into this with a yearn for monstrous fun, and emerge wanting nothing more than an aspirin. Perhaps two. SYNOPSIS: The crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla finally gets to battle legendary foes like Rodan, Mothra and the three-headed King Ghidorah. The little boy inside many middle-aged men is excited about this one. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” opens Friday, May 31, the third in a renewed series of monster movies since “Godzilla” in 2014 and “Kong: Skull Island” in 2017, with “Godzilla vs. Kong” coming next spring. This version was meant to be a sort of all-star edition of the Japanese Toho studio’s monsters gathering, with Godzilla battling historical creatures like Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah. That happens in this movie, but the following are 12 reasons why “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is this year’s first summer blockbuster that is a bust. This movie should be about monsters fighting other monsters and tearing up cities and knocking down buildings. It should be about almost nothing, outside of a synopsis explained in 25 words or less, other than destruction. We’re not expecting more, and we don’t want more. I remember the old Toho movies from the 1960s, when the Japanese people were largely anonymous and were mostly there to run for their lives. That was better than the people in this movie, who are dumb enough to think that rather than exterminating these creatures, they can come up with a way to control them. Fools. Thinking that monster-fighting won’t be enough, writer-director Michael Dougherty and a team of others come up with a family dynamic: During the events of the original “Godzilla,” a family’s son was killed, we’re told. It turns out that mom and dad (Vera Farmiga, looking stressed, and Kyle Chandler, looking sad) worked for a company monitoring Godzilla and other “titans,” as they’re called, and their young daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) is following in their footsteps in these studies. The work, however, has separated the parents because Mom stayed with the work and Dad wants nothing more to do with monsters. Now, the daughter has to choose between them. It’s too messy, and it’s poorly written, and it’s too big a part of the movie. Oh, the actors talk, but this is some of the most empty dialogue I’ve seen in a while. The family is beyond cliched, while scientists portrayed by great actors like Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Ziyi Zhang and Bradley Whitford speak a kind of dinosaur-DNA mumbo-jumbo about the monsters and their origins that doesn’t even rise to “Jurassic Park”-level believability. Rather than saying anything, most of the time the actors are limited to making facial expressions about seeing the monsters, or making a plan of attack, or realizing their plan has failed. So they usually look like they are staring in dumbstruck awe at Godzilla, or like they have gas. In a movie that must have cost a fortune to make, for all its CGI effects, it’s shocking how rarely we see the monsters close-up outside of Godzilla, who disappears for about an hour of the movie, which feels like a repeat of our barely being shown Godzilla in the first hour of the 2014 movie. As for Rodan (the winged “fire demon” with lava on its wings), Mothra (looks like an exotic butterfly that sprays a blinding web) and the evil King Ghidorah (a three-headed dragon), they look cool, but we rarely see them well. They do battle over the ocean, and water is flying everywhere; the final battle is at night, and it’s raining. They often appear to be trapped in a fog bank. What’s the deal? When there’s not as much monster-fighting as desired, and a broken-family story is a downer, there had better be some laughs. There are not. Thomas Middleditch, playing a public-relations hack for the monster-monitoring organization, tries but fails. There were more laughs in the 1960s films for me and everyone else watching the Japanese actors’ mouths still moving after English-language dubbing didn’t match up with their dialogue. That was part of the fun. “Kong: Skull Island” was the best of these new movies, with Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman hamming it up in a camp-comedy presentation representative of the ridiculous monster-hunting. This movie takes the concept of monsters waaay too seriously. More myth, less phony science, please. It’s funny how closely this movie resembles a bad Roland Emmerich film (like “2012”), but that’s a guy who gives his victims-of-disaster a backstory so we sort of care when they bite the big one. Here, creatures destroy Boston (and Fenway Park) and blow anonymous people down avenues to their deaths in volume, but there’s no time for weeping. How bad is the storyline? Farmiga’s character isn’t just in mourning for her son but for all mankind, which through war, poverty, environmental waste and more has ruined the world, so she has a new idea: Let’s revive all the monsters in hiding and hand the world over to destroy and start over. I can’t remember how many times I rolled my eyes at this head-scratcher. I’ll never forget my friend’s 1975 birthday party, when his mom had a film print of “Destroy All Monsters” with these same monsters. They fought it out repeatedly, to our delight. The effects were as cheesy as the pizza we were eating, but we loved it, and they didn’t try to hide Godzilla and his giant foes. Pizza and monsters, absolutely perfect. The 12-year-old me was hoping “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” would be like re-living that experience. Not even close."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,"Often the phrase ""turn off your brain"" is used too generously as an excuse for a bad movie. With ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"" it should be used as an endorsement."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,Yankees fans will find something to cheer about.
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," There is a point in the new Godzilla film where one of the human characters looks at another human character and whispers the words: “You’re a monster.” If you really like monster battles, and that’s all you came for, you might enjoy this latest Godzilla flick. There have been complaints from some quarters that there are too many monster mashes at the expense of character work, but that’s not true. If anything, having more monster fights would have distracted the audience from the larger problem in the film—all of the characters in this movie are missing their brains. They do not behave like real people whatsoever, and that’s not for lack of screen time. It’s entirely intentional on part of the film, which could have been a legitimate choice if the movie hadn’t wasted so much time pretending that it wanted us to care about said characters. (On a side note, please stop giving Ken Watanabe parts in films like these. Not to ever begrudge an actor a paycheck, but he deserves so much more, he is literally one of the best actors of our era and everyone is wasting him.) Most of the actors in this film are playing modified versions of characters they’ve already played before in other movies, so they’re not required to do much heavy lifting. You know these people, and either already like them, or you don’t. Millie Bobby Brown is just here to prove she should be in more movies after Stranger Things, which was already a given. Bradley Whitford is here to make people laugh, and he does okay with it, but he’s not as effective as Charlie Day in Pacific Rim with the same type of character. The soundtrack by Bear McCreary is gorgeous, so that’s something to legitimately look forward to. This Godzilla is a sequel to 2014’s Godzilla and the third installment in Legendary’s “MonsterVerse” that’s slowly been building up. This film centers itself around yet another largely hapless (and again white, suburban, middle class) family who believes they can understand the monsters and their purpose better than a multitude of professionals around them with more knowledge and experience than they’ve ever dreamed. But at the end of the day, that’s what this film is about: being aggressively ignorant in the face of certain doom. Knowledge is not important in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. In fact, knowledge is actively sidestepped in the most egregious ways possible. There’s a point where the characters find an underwater city, and one of the characters says “This looks Egyptian… or maybe Roman.” These two societies and their art and architecture are really not similar at all, but that’s his best guess. Cool. I cannot stress enough how aggravating it is that the filmmakers chose to frame this MonsterVerse around nuclear power. The fear of nuclear devastation is only one metaphor that Godzilla is steeped in, and it’s not even the first or most interesting one. Godzilla works best when the monster stands as a metaphor for how rapidly the world is changing around us, and how little we can control. Godzilla is best when it represents the raw power of nature and its indifference to human plans and ambition. The movie clearly thinks it’s saying this by batting around the (ultimately incorrect) concept that Godzilla and the other monsters are solutions to how we’re destroying the planet with pollution and war, but this is not a cake you can have and eat too—the last film makes it clear that these monsters are powered by nuclear energy, at which point, you are literally saying that the answer to humanity’s problems is “drop a bunch of nukes on bad things”. It doesn’t matter if Godzilla is harnessing that energy and using it consciously because that concept literally makes no sense whatsoever. The only takeaway possible is that nuclear power is extremely useful for killing off all threats to humanity, which is a wildly unethical and thoughtless stance to take. Also, at this point, the entire earth should be completely devastated from monster attacks and several nuclear events, so how do we even have a planet to protect? The idea of Godzilla working in symbiosis with humanity is great, but not when you don’t bother to consider how planetwide devastation works. This is part of the reason why the best film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse has been Kong: Skull Island—the action of the film was isolated and thought through, and the insistence on painting more complicated characters was actually well considered so that it jived with the film’s plot. This is without calling attention to the most irritating flub of the entire film: the insistence that pack animals have an “alpha”. First off, Godzilla is not the same species as his monster pals, so calling them a pack is something that requires more explanation than what we’re given. Second, and it really needs to be emphasized, the entire concept of alpha animals was an error that has been disproved over and over. It’s bad science, and it reinforces really screwy hierarchical thinking in humans. And that’s without adding an extra, seismic error into the film’s central conceit: Godzilla cannot be the world’s alpha monster and exist in symbiosis with the rest of us. These two concepts are fundamentally averse, but the film keeps insisting that it’s truth anyhow. Sure, it’s a movie, and sure, movies don’t have to have perfect science. I love handwaving that stuff. But these concepts are so basic and widespread, there’s really no excuse for using them in a movie. This easily could have been smarter. It wouldn’t have taken that much thought at all. On the plus side, knowing that Godzilla vs. Kong is on the way in 2020, I do have a preference for the victor after that mealy, soggy mush of a film. Team Kong, all the way. Emmet Asher-Perrin still wants to know how everyone in that film isn’t dead of radiation poisoning. You can bug him on Twitter, and read more of her work here and elsewhere."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," You’re almost tempted to use some truly cliché movie poster quotes for “Godzilla: King of the Monsters.” Phrases like “it will obliterate your senses” come to mind. And indeed it will, but not in the best way. This is a loud, stomping, roaring CGI madhouse curiously obscured by rain and snow. Narrative-wise it’s a sequel to the 2014 “Godzilla” by Gareth Edwards, which was a worthy American heir to the Japanese kaiju franchise in its experimentation with scale and using the iconic, giant lizard to subtly address climate change. “King of the Monsters” is all about scale, with little room for humor or brains. It’s been five years since the events of the last movie and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) finds herself in a distant locale testing a device called “Orca.” With this invention Emma hopes to be able to find a way to communicate with the “Titans,” the giant monsters slumbering all over the globe first exposed when Godzilla emerged from the ocean depths. Emma and her husband, a fellow scientist named Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), lost their son during Godzilla’s San Francisco rampage in 2014. Left with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), the Russells are divided. Mark would like to just kill the beasts, Emma wants to make contact. An eco-terrorist, Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), kidnaps Emma and Madison, demanding he be given Orca. A government task force keeping track of the Titans called Monarch, led by Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) track down Mark to let him know what’s happened. Soon humanity faces cataclysm as a slew of monsters are unleashed, including Mothra, Rodan, and the ultimate threat, the three-headed Ghidorah. But also returning is the main attraction, Godzilla, ready to brawl with radioactive powers. “King of the Monsters” is the kind of digital spectacle that tries so hard to find a reason to justify its existence. “Godzilla” as a franchise has a very respectable genesis. The original 1954 Japanese film by Ishiro Honda is a memorable work of pop political commentary, with Godzilla representing the terror and specter of the atomic bomb. It was inspired by a U.S. hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific that rattled a population still haunted by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 30 sequels were to follow. In the U.S. this iconic monster made its digital-era debut with Roland Emmerich’s derided 1998 movie. In 2014 Gareth Edwards made an attempt with more artistry, using campy sci-fi mixed with grand, awe-inspiring images based on imagining the actual perspective of a small human watching an enormous beast emerging from the sea, or from behind a skyscraper. The editing was patient, with Edwards even applying the György Ligeti music Stanley Kubrick used in “2001: A Space Odyssey” to some sequences. Visually Edwards also made many references to climate change, and humanity’s ill-advised attempts to master nature. By contrast this sequel has no time to be anything other than another explosions fest with the aesthetic of a videogame, meant to do nothing other than to sell a franchise. If it had just been about the monsters it might have worked in a guilty pleasure kind of way, but director Michael Dougherty tries to sell the premise by spending too much time with the boring humans. The characters are recycled from countless other disaster movies, complete with bombs running on timers and hopes to cleanse the world. Like Thanos, the villains are convinced the only way to solve overpopulation and environmental collapse is by wiping out most of us, so the best idea is to unleash all the monsters. Sadly there’s a surprise villain who forces the great “Game of Thrones” actor Charles Dance to become a mere background persona, just standing there uttering a line or two. The performances in general lack the fun self-awareness of other “Godzilla” movies, with straight-faced, long-winded lines about how Godzilla and his fellow Titans are the original gods of mythology, worshipped and feared by past civilizations. This would be more fun if it wasn’t all disclosed in low-lit sets lacking any color scheme other than the blue hue of monitor screens. You can’t help but nearly chuckle when it turns out Ghidora, believed to be the king of the monsters, is actually from space and Ken Watanabe contorts his face and says “a false king!” Mark has no real reason for being here, except to hate on the monsters and then of course realize Godzilla is a good guy. Madison is the required offspring who will eventually get trapped in a destroyed city, seeking shelter from a rampaging Ghidora while mom and dad frantically search for her.  Rehashed plots aside, the true appeal of a movie titled “King of the Monsters” should be the monsters. What we get is a cross between Zack Snyder and that recent, infamously low-lit “Game of Thrones” episode. The second and third acts are designed to shake your chair and slam your ear drums. Doughtery shoots Godzilla blasting through ice caps, Ghidora’s three-headed monstrosity straddling the top of a Mexican volcano, Rodan munching on fighter jets, but everyone is always obscured by snow, wind, rain and smoke. The third act becomes a CGI orgy as Washington, D.C. gets flooded, all is in flames, the monsters fight in the ocean and then obliterate Boston, but we have to squint to get a good view of anything. Godzilla’s first appearance as he battles Ghidora in the arctic will make you wonder either if it’s time to get new glasses or if it’s a sign you need them. Only when the kaijus roar and fire electro currents or radioactive beams from their jaws can we get a decent glance at their digital selves.  What’s worse is how mindless it all becomes. There’s no sense of grandeur, just mind-numbing chaos. The only attempt at delivering something more visually thoughtful is with Mothra, who turns out to be Godzilla’s fellow defender of the planet. When she spreads her wings after emerging from a super cocoon she emits a beautiful, heavenly light, so heavenly that once again we can’t see anything.  After mountains of debris, armadas firing countless missiles, rivers of lava and smoke, we finally get one campy shot of Godzilla holding an opponent’s head clenched by his mighty teeth. It’s not a spoiler to say he’s the actual king of the monsters. In fact the other monsters even bow (not kidding). However the end credits do feature a rousing cover of Blue Oyster Cult’s “Godzilla” performed by System of a Down’s Serj Tankian. It is well-known this is merely a set-up for an upcoming movie where the big G will battle King Kong. It will no doubt be quite the match up, fingers crossed we will be able to actually see it."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,CGI has made Godzilla and his monster friends and the carnage they create more realistic. What it hasn't done is improve the really dumb stories that surround him.
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," Lots and lots of people saw 2014’s Godzilla and this third entry in the Warner Bros. MonsterVerse has a lot of people ready to see where the story goes next. If you like your movies LOUD and full of all kinds of mayhem (and don’t care at all about plot or storyline), Godzilla: King of the Monsters tickets are on sale now! All the action is (again) mostly in the dark. The movie calls on a massive volume of tropes and cliches to try and keep you engaged, and we are promised 17 monsters. We definitely do not get 17 monsters. If this is what you want in a movie, then cool. There is absolutely no soul, emotion, heart, or feeling associated with one second of this $200m production. I dunno. Maybe it’s just easier that way. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the 35th Godzilla film overall to be made and released, the third to be released by an American studio, and the second Godzilla film to come out this year, following the Japanese anime/Netflix release Godzilla: The Planet Eater in January.There is great affinity for the sea monster with moviegoers, and following the box office success of 2014’s Godzilla, Warner Bros. opted to create their “MonsterVerse,” delivering 2017’s Kong: Skull Island, this new film, and 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong.Apparently, since everything has to now be a “(Uni)verse” of some kind, Godzilla: King of the Monsters concocts a story of giant monsters, or titans, awakening around the globe, and wreaking havoc and destruction on anything and everything.We are five years removed from the ending battle between a heavy, tired Godzilla and a fleet of MUTOs in San Francisco. For this sequel, we learn of the unfortunate death of Andrew, the young son of the now divorced Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga). His passing proved too much for the couple, so Mark is working as a scientist studying animal behavior, while Emma and the couple’s oldest daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), live and work with Monarch, the government organization who track all things “monster.”Upon the birth of a creature we will come to know as Mothra, Emma and Madison make a connection to the newborn giant moth, and are interrupted when a group of renegades blast into the control tower, execute every scientist in the room, and kidnap mother and daughter.As we learn, Emma (and Mark) created an audio device recorder known as “The Orca,” which uses titan noises, mixed together, to communicate with the fleet of beasts. Emma, as it turns out, has cut a deal with eco-criminal Alan Jonah (Charles Dance). Jonah wants the device, resulting in Emma delivering some cockamamie speech to a motley crew of scientists, government officials and Mark, that she wants to free all the sleeping titans, so they can first destroy the world and essentially reset everything. Then, she theorizes, they will protect us and somehow, later, after all she’s done, she becomes someone we are asked to root for to save the world.Nevermind that she committed treason and several innocent people were slaughtered because of her actions. Best we just move on.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," “Let them fight.” A pivotal line of dialogue uttered by Ken Watanabe, as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, in Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla foretells the fate of Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. When Kaiju “Titans” engage in city-smasher “take the throne” brawls, energy blasts radiate luminescent divinity while humanity crumbles under monstrous hoofs. Dougherty’s sequel is called “King Of The Monsters” after all, servicing a promise of primitive combat between awakened giants resembling fire-breathing dragons, gargantuan glowing insects and lumbering wooly mammoths. Godzilla’s larger-than-life royal rumble rewards crowds who are hungry for “creature feature” beatdowns, but at 120+ plotted minutes, downtime will have theatergoers repeating Watanabe’s meme-famous line to themselves. After Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island, crypto-zoological agency Monarch finds themselves under government scrutiny for attempting to keep “Titans” alive. Decorated generals want to nuke away these overpowering “threats to mankind,” while Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) reminds everyone humans weren’t first to settle Earth. Monarch preaches coexistence, containing roughly seventeen Titans globally, but an eco-terrorism faction led by Jonah Allen (Charles Dance) begins freeing the likes of Rodan, Mothra, and Godzilla’s arch-nemesis, King Ghidorah. Man must pay for their desecration of Mother Earth, and Titans are the ones to set us straight – unless Monarch, with the help of Godzilla, can topple Ghidorah’s destructive alpha reign. When watching Kaiju movies like Pacific Rim, Cloverfield, and subsequently Godzilla, I yearn to experience microscopic insignificance. Godzilla: King Of Monsters scales sky-high combatants against Boston’s Fenway Park – crushing landmarks into rubble – or during aerial combat while fighter jets swarm alongside barrel-rolling behemoths, or splashing under oceanic waves. As teenager Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown), mother Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), and estranged father Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) share unique face-to-face moments with assorted Titans, Dougherty ensures such helplessness as scaly snouts crane to ant-sized person levels. The multiplication of “monsters” only increases the seismic gravity of uncontained winged and weaponized “protectors.” Kaiju fights, no doubt why anyone’s watching Godzilla: King Of The Monsters, shatter senses with thunderous roars and megaton bodyslams. Rodan’s searing volcanic abilities square off against Mothra’s sticky spewed webbing and pincer-sharp appendages. Ghidorah’s three heads constrict around beefy Godzilla, who begins emitting reddish surges as atomic charges burst pulsating shockwaves. Bolts of powerful mouth-rocketed photons light up the sky while Mark’s family can do nothing but watch, pray, and hope Godzilla is left standing atop ancient corpses in a victory pose. Dougherty delivers the epic heavyweight throwdowns you’re paying to see, splendidly crafted by effects teams who create nimble warriors out of prehistoric fantasy DNA (from Mothra’s delicate elegance to Ghidorah’s medieval lookin’ meanness). It is, on a weaker note, cumbersome to optically sift through chaotic camera angles, spazzing and blurry, during cloaked nighttime action sequences where main characters can die without nary a clue (this happens). Dougherty’s atmospheres are striking at times – Ghidorah’s swirling “Monster Zero” stormcloud cover – while other sequences, particularly when Monarch agents are involved, get lost in dulled-down visibility. Chaos reigns supreme as it should during what could be apocalyptic God-being altercations, but heavy digitalization chucks tiny people bodies around without much attentive visual care. Such heavy reliance on computer graphics clashes against in-flesh actors, resulting in squint-or-you’ll-miss excitement that’s at times more dizzying than defined. “Messy” can describe multiple shots throughout Godzilla: King Of The Monsters, but “messy” can also double down when running alongside Chandler’s desperate and panicking parent – tracking Brown’s rebellious child via a now-stolen Monarch invention intended for Titan communication (ORCA) – or Emma’s endangered hostage scenario. “Villain” motivations flip-flop so seamlessly from unleashing captive Titans, regretting decisions, or allowing characters to vanish after getting “what we need.” Bless Bradley Whitford’s Dr. Rick Stanton for his comedic relief reliability (nerdy science bro), but supporting quips play awkwardly against Dougherty’s otherwise dour tone. Same for Thomas Middleditch’s stammering tech specialist, who drops a “Gonorrhea” joke out of thin air. Dougherty’s best work sustains blockbuster action that distracts from Monarch’s mission at hand, averting attention from generic “adventure quest” beats that are more uniform than a military regulation crew cut. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters exceeds expectations when monsters violently challenge one another for dominance, underwhelms when humans interact with monsters, and diverts off charted courses when humans are left to their own devices. Maybe that’s an effect of two-plus-hours with not nearly balanced enough Kaiju big-battle ringside events, or the film’s sometimes blended visual prowess that can’t distinguish between one dark, rainy attack from the next. Michael Dougherty’s ambitious calling for eco-compassionate futures is met with mild disappointment, and yet I’d still watch Mark Russell track Madison around the globe once more just to witness Godzilla grab Ghidorah by two throats all over again. Mindless ruminations on humanity’s egotistical planetary abuse paired with Godzilla’s pay-per-view worthy face-offs? As a lover of triumphant Titan warfare, that’ll do."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,King of the Monsters is definitely a worthwhile way to kill two hours and change this summer.
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," The next time Godzilla awakens from his radioactive slumber, the first thing he should smash is his agent. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a disappointing entry into the embattled kaijū’s filmography. There are fleeting moments of glorious monster combat, but director Michael Dougherty is too preoccupied with the boring melodrama of his human cannon fodder to give us the consistent schlock that we crave. Yes, we’re way beyond men in rubber suits, but we’re still just looking for a silly good time. In the words of the great Ken Watanabe, “Let them fight!” You can forgive fans of the classic Godzilla films for being excited about their favorite monster’s latest revival. Director Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla (2014) wasn’t exactly a classic, but Edwards showed a good feel for the original Toho Company story formula. Human catastrophe served as the connective tissue between epic monster fights, while Bryan Cranston provided the compassionate heart of the film. It also marked the inauguration of Legendary Pictures’ so-called ‘MonsterVerse’, which seeks to translate iconic monsters such as King Kong and Godzilla into modern action extravaganzas. Edwards’ change of heart about returning for a sequel opened the door for director Michael Dougherty (Krampus, 2015) who, unfortunately, fails to convert on the momentum of his predecessor. Instead of creating a new mythology about a world humbled by the existence of previously-unknown monsters (dubbed ‘Titans’), Dougherty just recycles the tired ‘disengaged dad struggles to reclaim his family’ premise. Calling the plot of Godzilla: King of the Monsters stale would be an insult to the fossilized potato chips hiding between your sofa cushions. Mercifully, the charismatically-challenged Aaron Taylor-Johnson does not reprise his 2014 Godzilla role of ‘Turgid Action Man’. Instead, the always solid Kyle Chandler steps into the lead role as Mark Russell, a father who traded his wife (Vera Farmiga as Dr. Emma Russell) and daughter (Millie Bobby Brown as Madison) for a bottle of booze after Godzilla accidentally pancaked his young son back in 2014. Ken Watanabe (Dr. Serizawa) and Sally Hawkins (Dr. Graham) return as representatives of the shadowy organization Monarch, which seeks to protect the Titans, even as Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn) is hell-bent on destroying them. The most ridiculous (and delightful) elements of the story revolve around ORCA; a “bio-sonar” device created by Dr. Russell to mimic the communication sounds between the Titans. When the ORCA, Dr. Russell, and Madison are kidnapped by an eco-terrorist named Jonah (Charles Dance), Mark joins the Monarch team to track them down. Jonah wants to unleash all of the Titans in an effort to counterbalance the swelling ranks of humanity. Basically, he’s like Thanos from Avengers: Endgame (Russo Brothers, 2019), only much more English. Dr. Russell shows off her ORCA prowess by placating an angry Mothra, newly freed from her throbbing chrysalis. Oh yes, did we mention that Mothra is a she? Apparently, she and Godzilla go way back, though we are free to speculate on the nature of their relationship (this reviewer suggests they were High School sweethearts). Mothra is easily the highlight of Godzilla: King of the Monsters. With her shimmering wings and haunting cries, she provides the film’s only goosebumps when she emerges triumphantly from the clouds. Beyond Mothra’s visual spectacle, this film is a surprisingly dreary mess. Whereas Edwards had the hutzpah to unleash his computer-generated Godzilla in harsh daylight, Dougherty conceals his monsters in perpetual rain. One is reminded of the disastrous 1998 Roland Emmerich version of Godzilla, which hides GINO (the disparaging moniker for Godzilla In Name Only) under a veil of darkness. The darkness in Godzilla: King of the Monsters is so overwhelming that it sometimes confuses the action. It’s difficult to tell, for instance, that a major character is actually killed. Making matters worse, neither the character nor their death is referenced in the remainder of the film. An explanation for the rain and dark comes courtesy of the film’s primary villain; the three-headed alien beast called King Ghidorah. Ghidorah can apparently create weather systems (??), which allows it to circumnavigate the globe in its own private hurricane (“That’s not a storm!!”). These are the goofy plot devices that could make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a hoot were it not mired in all of the pointless drama surrounding the dysfunctional Russell clan. Will they get back together? Will Mark reclaim the trust of his daughter? More importantly, who will give a damn? We just came here to watch monsters fight, not slog through some rehashed family soap opera. The major problem with this film isn’t even the lack of fighting between the monsters – we get a couple of juicy battle royals – but the lack of focus on the monsters themselves. In the classic Toho Company Godzilla films, human melodrama always dovetails with finding the monster’s weakness and formulating an audacious (and usually stupid) plan for victory. We know nothing of Ghidorah’s capabilities or special attacks. Much like horror films, monster movies function most effectively when we understand the villain’s abilities and can anticipate the danger. Here, we don’t understand why anything is happening because we’ve squandered all of our time on Mark’s quest to be a good daddy again. Admittedly, the film picks up steam in its second half. We make a visit to Godzilla’s man-cave, and Admiral Stenz provides the film’s biggest laugh when he unleashes a super-secret oxygen-depleting weapon. This is the type of shameless nonsense that translates into a fun time at the movies. The finalé of Godzilla: King of the Monsters certainly provides a satisfying monster slugfest, but it needs more monster minutiae along the way.Note to the filmmakers: The Oscars won’t be calling; drop the faux meaningfulness and bring on the schlock! “Godzilla, Friend to the Children of the World” It was much easier to sleep at night knowing that Godzilla was out there patrolling the Pacific, dealing out serious beatings to any monster that dared disturb the world order. “The Importance of Being Godzilla” Godzilla … is a mutable symbol, changing to suit the needs of the moment. He has become all things to all people. “Hey Godzilla, Why Are You Such a Giant Cultural Symbol?” Distilling the actions of Godzilla to their most basic, one finds only an overgrown playground bully. What drives our love for this thuggish brute that annihilates our cities? “Godzilla! Run from Your Lives!” Run from your lives from Godzilla 1998, a Hollywood monstrosity so absurd that it makes the film’s title song, Puff Daddy’s cover of Led Zeppelin’s classic “Kashmir”, seem like a good idea. “Imperial Monsters: A Political Analysis of Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Daikaiju Sogougeki” Whereas the original Gojira warned against militarism, this movie, Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Daikaiju Sogougeki, goes out of its way to celebrate it."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," This isn’t the James Bond or Harry Potter franchise. Heck, Toho’s signature find is only slightly more respectable than the “Puppet Master” brand. The main character is no longer a dude in a rubber suit, but the franchise’s DNA remains tied to our inner 12-year-old. The sequel to Gareth Edwards’ 2014 “Godzilla” reboot is junk, but not the kind that delivers prehistoric sharks or gravity-defying stunts. It’s brain dead on arrival, a stupefying mess that can’t even get the monster fights right. Vera Farmiga stars as Emma, a scientist studying the “Titans” phenomena. That’s fancy speak for Godzilla and his oversized chums. Are they here to help or hurt humanity? Emma thinks she has the answers, but only in that crazy scientist way that sci-fi movies adore. Except she’s meant to be one of the film’s heroes. Her claim to fame is Orca, a device that may be able to control the Titans. The operative word here is “may,” a risky bet when the wrong move can leave hundreds, if not thousands, as flat as the proverbial pancake. From there we learn about the two sides in the great Titans debate. Some think we should kill them all … they’re too dangerous to be trusted. They have a point, no? The other side? They were here before us and are helping restore the global order … by wiping out lots and lots of people, Thanos style. Yes, it’s another eco-hysteria movie, with Emma prattling on about pollution, over-population (already debunked, sorry!) and other world-threatening woes. The science banter is as muddy as the visuals. And that’s saying something given how murky the whole enterprise looks. Still, we’re still knee-deep in a Godzilla movie, where dopey hope springs eternal. The dumbest of the dumb plot points can be brushed aside in this series. Give us great monster fights and a handful of human moments that don’t bore us to tears. Scene after scene rolls on without purpose, rhythm or logic. We get intense, and emotionally inert peeks into the dysfunctional family at the film’s core. Take a bow, Millie Bobby Brown (“Stranger Things”) and Kyle Chandler. They play an estranged daughter and dad unit that plays a big role in the fate of the world. The “dialogue” consists of lame jokes, action movie cliches or exposition. Someone exclaims “God…” after another pointless slab of destruction. A nanosecond later a colleague mutters “…zilla.” Ken Watanabe, an actor whose middle name is “gravitas,” is so embarrassing here it’s hard to fully  describe. Suffice to say his character probably etched a heart surrounding his name and Godzilla’s in a nearby tree. We also meet minor, flavorless characters who we follow across the globe for no discernible reason. And poor Bradley Whitford. The “West Wing” alum is stuck with the Everyman and Comic Relief role all in one. Chandler, so mesmerizing in Netflix’s “Bloodline,” pours everything into his part with nothing to show for it – save that paycheck. The young Brown reminds us of her plucky screen presence, but that’s the best that can be said about her character. Director Michael Dougherty (“Krampus”) snags a few stunning stills from this wreckage. The visual team work overtime to evoke the grandeur of the monsters, including a gorgeously realized Mothra. A few monster-on-monster fights threaten to entertain us but never fulfill that promise. The film’s finale is similarly stale. Revisit 1968’s “Destroy All Monsters” to see a rumble that evokes a child-like joy in its audience. HiT or Miss: “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” isn’t just dumb. It’s busy and boring, poorly lit and horribly executed. In short, a total waste of time."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,Godzilla: King of the Monsters succeeds in spectacular fashion in its depiction of the Titans but still struggles with its human storytelling.
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” has a sense of wonder. After I left the screening late at night and emerged onto a dark city street at nearly one a.m., I wanted to look up rather than straight ahead, just in case Ghidorah the three-headed dragon or Rodan the giant pterodactyl came screaming down from the clouds. That's not the same thing as saying this is a perfect movie. It's far from that. But its errors fall mainly under the heading of failing to get out of its own way, and its imperfections are compensated by magnificence.  Directed and cowritten by Michael Dougherty (""Krampus""), the movie follows on the heels of the 2014 ""Godzilla"" and the 2017 ""Kong: Skull Island."" It's conceived as part of a shamelessly Marvel-styled ""shared cinematic universe"" of stories that interlink and build towards a series of peaks (the first of which is 2020's ""Godzilla vs. Kong""). The human heroes are part of a top-secret project called the Monarch Initiative. This mythology re-imagines Godzilla and the other giant monsters made famous by Toho studios, including Ghidorah, Rodan, Mothra, and King Kong (an American creation folded into Japan's universe) as part of an ancient ecosystem of long-hibernating giant monsters that predate the dinosaurs. They can travel from one part of the globe to the other quickly via tunnels through the center of the planet (this is what's known as ""Hollow Earth theory"") and are emerging now in response to humanity's despoiling of the environment through atomic testing, nuclear and chemical waste-dumping, mountaintop demolition mining, and other assaults on Mother Earth. This Hollywood-financed American series is an internationalization of original Toho Studios-produced Godzilla pictures, with a correspondingly international cast, all representing different takes on the monster problem, such as it is. There are appearances by characters from the 2014 film, including a couple of Monarch monster specialists played by Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins, but the main characters are a fractured nuclear family, consisting of two Monarch project scientists, Doctors Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga) and their teenage daughter Madison (""Stranger Things"" star Millie Bobby Brown). They lost the fourth member of their family, Madison's older brother, five years earlier during Godzilla's battle with the MUTOs in San Francisco, and the parents ultimately separated. It soon becomes clear that their split was equally due to grief and a philosophical disagreement over how to deal with Godzilla and his ilk—the father thinks they should all be exterminated, while mom believes they can be manipulated through a special sonar device that mimics the dynamics of whale songs.  At least that's our impression of the mother, but everyone in the family (and by implication, everyone on the planet) is dealing with the monster problem in their own powerfully emotional way, and some are secretly or not-so-secretly destructive in their coping. The openly destructive contingent is defined by Charles Dance's Colonel Alan Jonah, a former British Special Forces veteran turned eco-terrorist. Although the US military (represented by David Straithairn's admiral Stenz) insists that Jonah is a war profiteer looking to extract and sell monster DNA to hostile governments, Jonah is a radical ideologue, a true believer who thinks the monsters are punishment for humanity's sins against the environment and is working to awaken as many as possible, the better to hasten the thinning of the human herd. As revealed early in the film (as well as in all the teasers and trailers), Emma is on board with Jonah's take on things, and actively participates in waking up the creatures—including Ghidorah, a lightning-spitting dragon who represents the only serious threat to Godzilla's position as the Hollow Earth's boss predator.  One of the film's fascinations is the way it treats the monsters as outward manifestations of the characters' personal issues, at times like enormous doppelgängers or golems representing their grief and trauma. But in addition to showing empathy for the personal pain being experienced by individuals, ""King of the Monsters"" is suffused with grief for what might be the eventual death of human civilization itself, which is a scientific certainty if we don't turn our environmental act around over the next century or so, starting immediately.  Jonah and Emma are quite explicit (too explicit; this is a talky film when it's not blowing stuff up) in their belief that humanity has, via inattention and greed, become bystanders in the drama of its own extinction—and that we might as well go ahead and speed things up with help from Godzilla, Ghidorah and company, since that's what the planet needs, and what humans deserve. Emma even compares human civilization to a virus, and the monsters to a ""fever"" that could wipe most of it out and restore biological balance. A sort of compacted TED Talk in the middle of the film even reveals that once the monsters have finished fighting, and depart the ruins of a city, the radiation they leave behind acts as a biological accelerant, activating the rapid growth of plant and animal life that all the concrete, glass and steel once restrained or destroyed. But at what price balance? That's the big question, the Thanos of it all. The great Ghidorah—frozen in a wall of ice in deep underground in an Antarctica-based Monarch facility, and looking like the biggest, baddest art installation of all time—is this film's equivalent of the extinction-level threat, the fever bomb fated to burn through the human virus. Dougherty and his army of designers and special effects people do a great job of building up Ghidorah as if he (it?) is an ancient and unstoppable evil force whose name fills the heart with dread, even envisioning him as a Voldemort-like threat, the dragon whose name can't be spoken (he's also called Monster Zero, shades of Patient Zero) and whose true image must be altered or distorted, as if to picture him precisely is to summon him. (A selection of past artwork allegedly depicting Ghidorah includes William Blake's painting The Great Red Dragon and Woman Clothed in Sun, also a fixture in Hannibal Lecter stories).  Gareth Edwards' franchise-starting ""Godzilla"" was a huge international hit, but divided viewers because of its flat, action figure-like characterizations, its meticulous, almost ""Jaws""-like unveiling of Godzilla and the two Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Objects (MUTOs) that he ended up fighting, and its relative dearth of actual Godzilla footage (about seven minutes). The movie also placed the big fella within the larger ecosystem of wolves and snakes and birds and such. It contained more nature footage than you expected to see in a city-stomping kaiju epic, to the point where you half-expected Terrence Malick shots of honey-tinted fields and perhaps a narration by Godzilla (""Fire ... water ... why do you wrestle inside me?""). There were fears (among those who loved the original) and hopes (among people who hated it) that future movies would offer less philosophizing and atmospheric indulgences and more footage of giant monsters beating the tar out of each other, and the Vietnam-era period piece ""Kong: Skull Island"" delivered plenty, pitting the now super-sized ape against a series of Lovecraftian giants that seemed to be half-insect, half-demon, and making sure that the story didn't go five minutes without a burst of violent spectacle.  The monster cast is overpopulated as well. Like the too-hurried rollout of the future Justice League members in ""Batman vs. Superman,"" we don't really have time to appreciate the personalities of the supporting monsters the way we do Godzilla, Ghidorah, Rodan and Mothra—though the latter is at the center of many of the movie's most breathtaking images, such as a mural-like shot of the transformed creature unfolding its glowing wings behind the translucent curtain of a waterfall.  For all its crash-and-bash action, this is a real science fiction movie that goes to the trouble of not merely creating a world, but thinking about the implications of its images and predicaments. It cares what the people in it must feel and think about their situation, and how it might weigh on them even when they aren't talking about it. It's also suffused with a spiritual/theological awareness, and takes it as seriously as recent DC films took their comparisons of caped wonders to figures from the Old Testament and ancient mythology.  A friend who saw this movie with another friend told me that afterward, they debated which of the monsters most resembled Jesus, and realized they could make an equally convincing case for several of them.  The constant need to summarize and annotate every significant moment grows wearisome (it's like being stuck watching a game with sportscasters who don't know when to shut up), but at the level of image, sound and music, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is a frequently brilliant film that earnestly grapples with the material it presents, and a religious picture about faith and spirituality, sin and redemption, where monsters die for our mistakes so that humankind won't have to. It deploys state-of-the-art moviemaking tools to try to return audiences to a stage of childlike terror and delight. Arthur C. Clarke observed that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This movie is magic. Matt Zoller Seitz is the Editor at Large of RogerEbert.com, TV critic for New York Magazine and Vulture.com, and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in criticism."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,"If the next installment in this MonsterVerse (""Kong vs Godzilla"" due out in 2020) is as narratively incomprehensible as ""King of Monsters"" - God help us all."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,"There are two types of Godzilla movies: the ones that use the radioactive giant as an allegory and the ones that are just plain, dumb fun. This one is one is all about the ""Giant Monster Action""."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," This is a Godzilla movie, so if you watch it expecting non-formulaic storytelling, you'll be disappointed. Then again, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" doesn't need an original story: Like all kaijū movies, it only requires awesome monsters, epic fight scenes and some subtle social commentary. Like the 2014 ""Godzilla"" film, which effectively rebooted the franchise (it is the 35th film overall in the series), the story matters less than the underlying lore. Most important to the lore is its central premise: Giant monsters like Godzilla, known as Titans, are ancient beings that used to rule the planet and are reclaiming it for themselves, showing human beings how insignificant and powerless they are in the process. In the 2014 movie (as well as the 1954 original), Godzilla was awakened and/or empowered by the irresponsible use of technology, particularly misused nuclear weapons. That event proves to be the catalyst for unleashing a world of giant monsters who fight with each other, at our expense, in dozens of sequels. Sometimes the monsters fight on our behalf and sometimes not, but in the end we are merely their ""pets,"" as one character aptly puts it; they are in charge, and Godzilla is their king. That's the lore. Against this we have, as other critics have noticed, a routine plot. In ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" the two protagonists are Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his ex-wife Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga). They are joined in the story by their precocious daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), a standard issue military antagonist named Colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), twin mythologists Dr. Ilene Chen and Dr. Ling Chen (Zhang Ziyi), an all-knowing character whose genius is so obvious that it's remarkable no one listens to him (Ken Watanabe reprising the role of Dr. Ishirō Serizawa from the 2014 movie) and a series of other kaijū genre archetypes. You can predict every plot beat here, from how things will play out in the main conflict — between those who support Godzilla as humanity's best hope against the evil Titans and those who want to kill Godzilla — to how the characters in the dysfunctional family subplot will grow or redeem themselves. The main point of a movie like this, though, is to see the big monsters fighting — and it is in this crucial way that ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" delivers. The stars of the show are Godzilla and Mothra, who are more or less the ""good guys,"" and Rodan and King Ghidorah, who pose the direct threat to humanity's survival. While the special effects lean a bit too hard into their CGI, which can make the monsters look unconvincing at times, they're realistic-looking enough that the fight scenes give that adrenaline rush which fans of kaijū movies have come to demand. Even better, Godzilla himself has a certain charisma to him here that makes you actively want him to win, and not simply because he's technically on humanity's side. He has a dignity to him when he is in repose, a regal strength when he is triumphant and a poignant suffering when he is nearly dead or defeated. There have been monster movies where I felt like I was watching mindless beasts (or, more accurately, soulless special effects) and wasn't invested at all in what happened to them. I cared about Godzilla's fate in ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"" which says something. There is also, as mentioned before, a bit of social commentary in any good ""Godzilla"" movie — and this one is no exception. Here it happens as Dougherty's characters explain how human beings are destroying the planet through our environmental depredations, a suitable substitute for the original movie's emphasis on the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the Titans are a corrective to the scourge of human beings. The film isn't preachy in making its point, but it is intriguing how the plot really couldn't work without it. The idea isn't that humanity was hunky-dory until these Titans came around squashing things; it is rather that people were screwing things up on the planet and needed to be contained, like a plague, lest we cause too much damage. This is where Godzilla comes into play as a force for balance, as well as a metaphor for the damage we are causing our planet. A word must be said about Michael Dougherty, who directed and co-wrote this film with Zach Shields (the two men came up with the story alongside Max Borenstein). This is Dougherty's third feature-length film as a director: the first, 2007's ""Trick 'r Treat,"" is a Halloween-themed horror anthology that brilliantly subverts linear storytelling techniques to enhance its subplots a la ""Pulp Fiction"" (I count it among my all-time favorite movies); the second, 2015's ""Krampus,"" is a clever and gory tribute to '80s holiday horror flicks. Dougherty has a knack for figuring out exactly what it is that draws fans to specific genres and then making films that work as carefully-crafted Valentines. ""Trick 'r Treat"" was his best film because it played with genre conventions in a way that elevated the material above its B-movie origins (including but not limited to the non-linear storytelling format). ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" isn't quite as transcendent — nor does it aspire to be — but it works because it realizes that Godzilla fans want a mixture of mythology, spectacle and parable. One could say that with a less predictable plot and more original characters, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" would have been a better movie, transcending its genre and breaking new ground. Perhaps it would have been a masterpiece if Dougherty had done for a ""Godzilla"" movie what ""Trick 'r Treat"" did for horror anthologies. Yet what he did instead — make the best possible traditional ""Godzilla"" movie, by tapping into why kaijū movies are appealing in the first place — is quite impressive.

"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," It has a giant lizard and a giant moth and a giant fire bird and a giant three headed snake-dog and it has all of these things punching and biting and stinging and spraying each other and sometimes those things shoot fire at each other and also it has ecoterrorists who want to save the world by destroying it and military jets shooting missiles at some of the aforementioned monster things and a nuclear bomb. Sometimes King of the Monsters feels about as coherent as that run-on sentence and, much like reading that aloud, it will occasionally leave you out of breath as you try to figure out what, exactly, is going on while images assault your eyes and roars blast your eardrums. But this was intentional? Godzilla: King of the Monsters succeeds at what it sets out to do, which is overwhelm and excite. You'll note I'm not bothering with character names, because who cares. All of the human stuff is good enough. Fine, acceptable, pleasantly extraneous glue that holds the script together, more or less. Because we're not here to watch people work through their problems, not really. Emotions are wasted on this audience. We're here for the spectacle of it all. For the giddy thrill of watching impossible beings do impossible things. For the horror of cities reduced to graveyards, immolated wastelands where nothing could survive. For the reminder that there are forces beyond our control, events we cannot stop, tragedies that we cannot curtail—and heroes who can save us, if we let them. And on that front, again, Godzilla: King of the Monsters more or less delivers. I probably could have used somewhat fewer cutaways to O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Aisha Hinds, who play military hands coordinating human efforts to aid civilians and combat the Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms (MUTO) unleashed around the world by the ecoterrorists hoping to restore ecological balance. Then again, this movie gives us more than ten (10) minutes of Godzilla and his famous friends onscreen, so I'm not sure I'm going to get too sniffy about the interruptions of the hot MUTO-on-MUTO action we paid top dollar to watch."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Steady on there, newsreader. It’s not quite that bad, but there is a sense that this franchise – the “MonsterVerse”, since you ask – is already in the throes of a severe identity crisis. Gareth Edwards's Godzilla was too sedate for its own good. Kong: Skull Island was a delightful mash-up of Apocalypse Now and The Three Stooges. Now we descend into mayhem so incoherent one almost (I said ""almost"") longs for the notorious Roland Emmerich incarnation to return. What in heck is going on here? The film does not recapture the knockabout apocalypses of the Toho films that launched the title character so many aeons ago. Nor does it have the cheeky zip of Skull Island. The tone is closer to those low-end 1970s disaster movies that made ill use of the actor they had to settle for because Charlton Heston was otherwise engaged. Here it seems they couldn't get Jon Hamm, so they're settling for Kyle Chandler. Mini-Hamm is upset because Charles Dance's eco-terrorists have captured his wife and daughter (Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown). Meanwhile, various monsters from the deep are threatening to eat each other, non-speaking extras and various bits of the planet. They don't need to eat the scenery, as the main cast have that covered. It’s a long time since so many deadweight cliches have been chewed over in such desperate fashion. “We opened Pandora’s Box and there’s no closing it,” Dance scowls with a sonorous boom that even Heston would have trouble matching. These bits are just fine. Bradley Whitford, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn make the best of random quotes from Airplane! while dangerous hunks of ceiling crash around their ankles (though poor Sally Hawkins seems to have an eye for the exit throughout). Less bearable are the numerous sections where everyone sits down to explain the preposterous plot to one another. Some rubbish about balance in the ecosystem and ancient landings by many-headed lizards. This does, to be fair, lead eventually to partial redemption with a massive closing punch-up between Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah and everyone's favourite nuclear lizard. It's maddeningly confusing, but they have, at least, allowed Godzilla to again move with the teetering gait of a Japanese man in a rubber suit (to clarify, this is a good thing). He’s going to need all the grit he can muster. Glimpses of a computer-generated map confirm that the creatures are closing in on coasts throughout the world. One seems to be moving towards Donegal. Don’t fancy that guy’s chances much."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," EVER since Marvel discovered that the insane level of star power film studios had relied on for so long was pretty much dead (remember when you’d go and see a film purely because Adam Sandler was in it? Seriously, that was a thing once) and people were now more interested in sprawling franchises, each with their own interconnecting storylines and characters - every other studio has been playing catch-up. Whilst none have connected as well as Marvel (DC seem to be finding some solid ground after many false starts, Transformers appears to be trying for a reinvention with Bumblebee and Planet of the Apes is done and dusted) it isn’t for the want of trying. Godzilla King of Monsters is the third in the “Monsterverse” after the first Godzilla and the actually quite good Kong: Skull Island and offers largely the same premise and tone as the first time we met the giant lizard - namely wanton destruction on a global level, ear-shattering set-pieces and not a huge amount of anything else. Monarch, the secret government agency we met in the first Godzilla, are still monitoring a whole bunch of different “titans” around the world, housed in various things such as dormant volcanoes, block of polar cap etc. Something called an Orca (a device that can communicate with the monsters and calm them down) has been developed by Dr Emma Russel (Vera Farmiga), mother to Madison (Stranger Things’ Mille Bobby Brown) and ex-wife to Mark (Kyle Chandler). As a result of a previous rampage, the family have suffered a catastrophic loss and no longer speak. Agreeing with Thanos, he believe the only way of saving the planet is to wipe it out and start again - using the Titans to do his dirty work. After stealing the Orca he manages to set the Titans free, including the legendary Mothra and Alpha Titan - the three-headed King Ghidorah. There’s only one monster who could possibly save earth... guess who. What follows over the next two-plus hours is pretty much a straightforward sequel, with a law of slightly diminishing returns. The original offered us Bryan Cranston, Elisabeth Olsen Aaron Taylor Johnson in the leads - giving the film some real depth and gravitas. Here, despite best efforts, the cast don’t bring much to the table. Kyle Chandler, as ace as he is, resorts to type, Oscar winner Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe collect their cheques and fulfil contractual obligations competently and Mille Bobbie Brown makes sure the marketing department have something other than a load of 50 year olds running around. It’s a satisfactory film, if it does already feel a little dated. I missed the characterisation of the original characters, which seems to have been sacrificed for Universe building. Stylistically it feels like a step back too — the sheer scale of destruction on display becomes impossible to progress (once you’ve seen a giant thing destroy a city in ten seconds, there’s nowhere else to go) and whilst fan-favourite Mothra comes close, none of the titans have anything resembling a personality beside Godzilla. If neither the humans nor monsters give us anything to care much for... what are we watching? I missed Kong’s humanity and his conflict - hopefully that will resolve in the forthcoming Kong vs Godzilla. So it’s a big, EXTREMELY LOUD, bombastic spectacle that is perfectly adequate in the grand scheme of things, but for a franchise looking to settle in for the long haul, it feels like they’ve started treading water already."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Clearly Michael Dougherty, director of this sequel to Gareth Edwards’s 2014 reboot, is more into spectacle than suspense. Our CGI heroes and villains are kaijus (a bit like dinosaurs, prone to squishing cities when riled). While they’re beating the crap out of each other, King of the Monsters is blockbuster heaven. Here’s what you need to know. Andrew’s parents (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) are husband-and-wife scientists who once sought to control the kaijus via a machine known as the Orca, and are now at odds with each other as well as the government/army, the public and sometimes a crazy, rich eco-terrorist (Charles Dance).  The latter believes that rousing the nuclear-energy-guzzling “titans” — and letting them brawl — will save our planet from leaders who are indifferent to overpopulation and climate change. The government wants to exterminate the beasts. And gentle Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) keeps reminding anyone who’ll listen that “we’re meddling with forces beyond our comprehension!” Guess what: the creatures get unleashed, including Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon-ish sort. He acts like he’s the king of the monsters, crushing a character who despite being played by an actress of rare talent is so surplus to requirements that it took me half an hour to notice she’d gone.  Meanwhile, Godzilla starts laying into Ghidorah, only to be brought low by government intervention, causing Serizawa to gush: “He fought for us, he died for us!” Jesus. It’s pretty fascinating that the good guy here was once simply a terrifying marauder. In the original 1954 Japanese Godzilla, the titular beast represented nuclear warfare, the horror that couldn’t be outrun. But then the whole world fell in love with him, and before long he was talking, saving the day and even dancing. The latest incarnation of Godzilla does a lot of roaring but doesn’t talk. In fact, he isn’t what you’d call a good communicator. Is he motivated by love for humankind? Who knows? He’s cute enough in a Fungus the Bogeyman sort of way, but there isn’t much to admire apart from his size and strength. Millie Bobby Brown (of Stranger Things fame) has comic timing and gravitas and is one of the few cast members who manages to make an impression. She’s Madison, the sister of Andrew. Madison is appalled by the behaviour of one of her parents. Thanks to Brown, when Madison lets off steam it feels like an event. That said, the torn teen barely connects with Godzilla. In a recent interview Brown admitted she knew very little about the icon before the shoot began: “[But] he’s a great guy. I swiped right on Godzilla.” In case you’re not familiar with Tinder etiquette, the 15-year-old is implying that she now thinks he’s hot. However, those hoping for a Fay Wray-Kong dynamic in the film will be disappointed. Disruptive, chaotic desire — the great leveller in any Kong movie — is a no-show here. That was true in Edwards’s movie too. In other ways, though, Dougherty’s effort signals a radical change of direction. The film by Edwards was liberal. This feels libertarian. Outsiders are bad (check out Ghidorah’s origin story) and nuking everything in sight makes Mother Nature smile.  The soundtrack is also patchy. Lots of drumming and chanting is supposed to plug us into a lost-world vibe but sounds more like something from a Forties episode of Tarzan.  Like I said though, the monsters deliver. Its fans will be delighted to see bit-players Rodan and Mothra given so much to do. Rodan explodes out of a volcano and later snacks on a pilot, while Mothra flaps her bioluminescent wings and stabs at a foe. At such moments you feel like you’re in the trippiest of David Attenborough docs. It’s not just the colours, it’s the heft of these flying creatures and the angles that juggle a macro and micro sense of scale. As for Godzilla... It’s both stirring and weirdly beautiful to see him with a mouthful of Ghidorah. Dagnabbit: might is right. What with Dougherty’s technical skills and our current penchant for strongman types, the film is unlikely to flop. Like its XL star, it’s just too big to fail."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," Relentlessly, spectacularly, unforgivingly brutal. If that verdict pops up on the sides of buses credited to the Daily Mail’s critic, please be aware that he was only talking about this film’s thunderous, two-hour assault on the eardrums. To say it is loud is to say that Godzilla himself is a biggish lizard. When it was over, I wandered the streets of Central London looking in vain for a Trappist monastery as an antidote. I settled for the National Portrait Gallery, always a treat, but never before a source of aural therapy. I recommend it. Catherine of Braganza, Oliver Cromwell and Dame Judi Dench all gaze back at you in blessed silence. Even John Lennon keeps his trap shut. Of course, nobody goes to see Godzilla: King Of The Monsters expecting to be mollycoddled, sound-wise. The 2014 film to which this is a sort of sequel, Godzilla, was pretty deafening too. But this is different; it feels like being strapped to an amplifier at an AC/DC gig more or less from beginning to merciful end. Director and co-writer Michael Dougherty grants occasional breaks in the stupendous noise and extravagant special effects to allow the human characters to speak, generously enabling us to piece together some kind of narrative. Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a scientist working in China for the ‘secretive monster-hunting coalition’ known as Monarch. Her ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) is in the U.S., researching wolves. They have a spirited teenage daughter called Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Someone says five years have passed since Godzilla was last sighted, which makes it sound like he was tricky to spot, but since he was bringing down San Francisco skyscrapers with maladroit swishes of his enormous scaly tail, he wasn’t. Do bear in mind, though, that Godzilla was on the side of the angels. The real baddies last time were Mutos (massive unidentified terrestrial objects). This time, the thorns in the side of humankind include a kind of evil earwig the size of a battleship, and an even bigger, nastier monster with three heads and a commensurately huge number of teeth. Emma, however, has developed a nifty sonar device which, with a spot of urgent knob-twiddling, can hack into the monsters’ communication channels and turn them into gigantic pussycats. I don’t mean that literally, by the way. For all those old enough to remember the comedy feline colossus which destroyed the Post Office Tower and squashed Michael Aspel, this movie might be at least as daft as The Goodies, but I don’t think it’s intended as a tribute. Inevitably, there’s a human villain eager to get his hands on Emma’s equipment, and almost as inevitably, he’s a former British Army colonel played by Charles Dance. Anyway, if you’re worried about spoilers then look away now, because even though Dance’s ‘eco-terrorist’ and his goons appear to have kidnapped Emma and Madison, the scoundrel turns out to be in league with none other than Emma herself. He’s convinced her to use her knob-twiddling to stir the monsters into dishing up nothing short of Armageddon, on the mildly controversial basis that by slaughtering tens of millions of humans, they will ultimately save the planet from the destruction being wrought by its human population, and indeed save humanity itself, what’s left of it. Maybe, if you search hard enough, this is all a metaphor for something or other. The original 1954 Japanese film used Godzilla to represent nuclear devastation, so that’s probably still it. Whatever, lining up against this dastardly plan is Mark Russell, though his bigger priority is to find young Madison, as evidenced by his repeated shouts of ‘Madisssonnn!’, and a team of scientists played by Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and Bradley Whitford, among others. They spend their time looking at screens and crying things like ‘something’s wrong!’ or ‘something’s not right!’ or ‘what’s happening?’, all of which serve no dramatic purpose except to presage another massive monster attack. Once we’ve seen a statue of American revolutionary hero Paul Revere crashing symbolically to the ground, we arrive at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, where Godzilla lumbers out of left-field just when he’s least (make that most) expected. It’s not quite his first appearance in the movie, but Dougherty certainly holds him back; an alternative title might have been Waiting For Godzilla. Still, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters fairly accurately sums up what unfolds here and raises the question of what on earth is going to happen next? This is the 35th film in the so-called Godzilla franchise, and with a slightly heavy heart it falls to me to inform you that the 36th, scheduled for release as dismayingly soon as next year, will be called Godzilla v Kong. Named after a Bruce Springsteen song, Thunder Road begins in arresting fashion — no pun intended — with a small-town uniformed cop delivering a eulogy at his mother’s funeral. He is Jim Arnaud, and he is played, beautifully, by the movie’s writer-director Jim Cummings, who gives us a ‘tour de force’ of acting, writing and directing all in one, by presenting the eulogy in a single compelling shot lasting more than 11 minutes. It establishes Jim’s character perfectly. As well as grief-stricken, he is vulnerable, hapless, anxious, angry and plainly teetering on the cusp of a nervous breakdown. For the rest of the film, we see him lurching through his life, trying to reconcile the demands of policing with the stresses of bereavement, divorce, dyslexia and single fatherhood, and if not always failing, certainly flailing. It sounds sad, and it is, but it is also extremely funny. In some ways, Jim is a more huggable version of Ricky Gervais’s David Brent. His jokes either misfire or backfire; even his young daughter runs into school just as he’s about to deliver a fatherly homily: ‘Give a mouse a cookie . . . hey, I love you!’ It’s a great snatch of dialogue, typical of a very good picture by a filmmaker himself on the cusp . . . of stardom. Rory's Way is also reliant on a single charismatic performance. Brian Cox plays a crotchety old Scotsman, who leaves his Outer Hebridean island for San Francisco, not so much to see his semi-estranged son, American daughter-in-law and new baby grandson, but to seek urgent medical treatment. Will his mortality teach him how to love in the nick of time? Will a museum curator (Rosanna Arquette) fall for him despite his rudeness? You can guess. Rory’s Way is crammed with cliché, and the narrative is terribly clunky in places; it looks like a novel adapted not very expertly for the screen, which is exactly what it is. Director Tate Taylor’s 2011 film The Help bagged Octavia Spencer an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. He also cast her as Aunt Honey in the 2014 James Brown biopic Get On Up. But this time she’s very much centre-stage as the title character, otherwise known as Sue Ann, a small-town veterinary nurse who doesn’t nurse anything quite as devotedly as she does a decades-old grudge against the high school classmates who once made her life a misery. A series of flashbacks show us that her enduring resentment is well-founded. At one level, Ma — produced by the horror-film specialists Blumhouse, but more a psychological thriller than a horror flick — makes a powerful case against the iniquities of bullying. Not that many victims take their revenge with quite as much calculating and pathological cruelty as Sue Ann. Just to ensure that we don’t feel too sorry for her, Taylor and his co-writer Scotty Landes give her a teenage daughter whom she abuses in a form of Munchausen syndrome by proxy — convincing the child that she is ill. Nonetheless, if this film has an overriding message, it’s that adult flaws and foibles are forged in childhood. Sue Ann’s flaws run deep. We are introduced to her through 16-year-old Maggie (Diana Silvers), newly arrived in town with her single mother, Erica (Juliette Lewis). Erica grew up locally, so Maggie goes to her mother’s old high school, and is quickly befriended by a group of classmates who loiter outside a mini-mart pleading with grown-ups to buy booze for them. When Maggie approaches Sue Ann, she obliges. She seems friendly, mumsy even, and the teens begin to call her ‘Ma’. She lends them the basement of her secluded rural home as a place to gather and get drunk well away from disapproving parents and police, and starts partying with them. Taylor, who gives himself a small part as a cop, keeps all this moving forward very deftly, building the tension and foreboding without sacrificing the story’s credibility. In last month’s release Greta, a strikingly similar film in which Isabelle Huppert played the loopy title character, credibility seeped away until finally there was none left at all. Taylor can also credit his cast for keeping it real. Spencer is terrific in a role for which she’s not the most obvious fit, and even the small parts are filled by class acts such as Luke Evans and Allison Janney, an Oscar winner herself, but taking merely a cameo here as Sue Ann’s grumpy boss."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," The new bio-pic of Elton John, “Rocketman,” is directed by Dexter Fletcher. Last year, he assumed command of the Freddie Mercury film, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and steered it to a safe harbor, after the previous director walked the plank. If you need somebody to recount the rise of a British rock god from pallid suburbia to the baroque extremes of fame, and to create a stir without causing too much of a fuss, Fletcher is your man. He is the helmsman of the acceptably outrageous. David Bowie fans, watch out. “Rocketman” is framed as a therapeutic exercise. We first encounter the adult Elton John (Taron Egerton) as he stomps down a corridor in a tangerine catsuit, tricked out with wings and horns. He looks like Hellboy, only shorter and angrier. Bursting through a door, Elton finds himself in group therapy, and immediately reveals his addictions: sex, drink, and drugs—the usual suspects—plus bags and bags of shopping. “I was actually a very happy child,” he adds, and, with that, we are spirited back to his youth, and thence through his personal past. We get the early gigs in pubs; the meeting with his lifelong lyricist, Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell); the doomy arrival of John Reid (Richard Madden), who became Elton’s lover and manager; the globe-straddling glory; and the statutory crackup, without which no rock fable is complete. The whole thing winds up where it began, with the star, efficiently cured of his miseries, embracing his younger self, and carolling “I’m Still Standing.” Job done. There is a famous boyhood photograph of Elton—or, as he then was, Reggie Dwight—seated at the piano, his hands on the keys, turning to the camera with a smile. His hair is neatly brushed, as befits a polite scion of Pinner, an uneventful town northwest of London. The youngest actor who plays him in “Rocketman,” Matthew Illesley, is a perfect match for that photo, and, when he’s required to belt out “The Bitch Is Back” in a ringing treble, outside the Dwight family home, with local residents pitching in, Illesley gives it everything. He thereby sets a pattern for the movie, in which the songs are delivered not by Elton John but by the actors, with varying degrees of success. Reggie, his mother (Bryce Dallas Howard), his grandmother (Gemma Jones), and even his father (Steven Mackintosh), as stiff as a brush, all contribute to “I Want Love,” for instance, as they wander around the house. Compare this scene with the music video of the same song, from 2001, when it was lip-synched by Robert Downey, Jr., as he wandered around a house. It was eerie to hear the familiar tones of Elton John—the long and winding vowels, the dying falls, the salty Englishness pepped up with a transatlantic twang—emerge from someone else’s mouth, and there are times, during “Rocketman,” when you yearn for a snatch of that unmistakable sound. Egerton is busy and fizzy in the leading role, but there’s a curious blankness in his impersonation, and a shortage of charm. Hard to tell whether viewers will flock to him as they did to Rami Malek, who gave such electric life to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Yet “Rocketman” is the better film. Not by much, but just enough. Fletcher and his screenwriter, Lee Hall (who joined forces with Elton John on “Billy Elliot the Musical”), allow themselves all sorts of latitude. Elton’s bad behavior, for one thing, gets a proper airing; we see him falling into bed with Reid, quenching his thirsty soul with vodka, and surfing atop a mob of orgiasts. (Mind you, as even Stanley Kubrick proved with “Eyes Wide Shut,” in 1999, orgies may be fun to try but they’re grindingly boring to behold.) Then, there are factual tweaks. In 1970, for example, when the singer took his first trip to Los Angeles, he did indeed raise the roof at the Troubadour, as the movie suggests—but not with the song we hear, “Crocodile Rock,” for the simple reason that it was not written until 1972. From that white lie, though, comes the highlight of the film. As the song hits its stride, Elton dispenses with his piano stool and—keeping his hands on the keys, like little Reggie—lofts his legs into the air. And there he stays. So hot is the thrill that the action freezes. And such is the uplift that the revellers at the Troubadour, too, begin to levitate; we watch their feet leave the ground. The joint is jumpin’, and that jump, as every pop star knows, and as all fans feel in their bones, matters more than the life, however staid or fraught, from which the music sprang. Forget therapy. Screw gravity. For a few minutes, exultant and exalted, “Rocketman” takes off. In many respects, Godzilla is hard to distinguish from Elton John. Terrible temper? Check. Professional longevity? Check. Tireless vocal vigor? Check. They even share a fondness for baseball parks as suitable arenas for their skills; “Rocketman” re-creates Elton’s triumphant appearance at Dodger Stadium, in 1975, while “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a new addition to the franchise, shows the title character slugging a rival predator at Fenway Park. For years, it’s true, the singer has beaten the beast in the costume stakes, since Godzilla prefers to function au naturel, with his dark-green skin, all wrinkled and ridged, lending him the look of a furious avocado. For the latest film, however, he grows more fashion-conscious, arranging for his dorsal plates to flash bright blue whenever he’s totally stoked. Once Elton John sees this movie, he will have to get himself a set of those. The film is a sequel to “Godzilla” (2014), and we start with a reminder of the chaos that was wrought therein—“a historic tragedy that changed the world forever as we know it.” I’m embarrassed to admit that I’d forgotten all about it. Odd how often that happens. What we now learn is that Godzilla, far from being a solo act, is the front man for the Titans: supersized creatures, dormant beneath the earth, and half as old as time. They include Rodan, a volcano-based dragonoid whose wings are fretted with fire; Mothra, a flying insect of rare beauty, which, like all moths, should be kept well away from your cashmere sweaters; and a mammoth-flavored enormity whose name I didn’t catch. Also present is King Ghidorah, a real piece of work. Stealing his style from the Hydra of Greek mythology, he has three screeching heads, which occasionally squabble among themselves but, when on form, can trounce the competition. Fighting Ghidorah is like doing battle with the Bee Gees. Stayin’ alive, amidst the chaos, is a handful of negligible humans. The joke is that many of them are played by actors who, given half a chance, can be as wondrous to behold as any monster; what slays the joke is that the movie, directed by Michael Dougherty, gives them, at best, a quarter of a chance, or a sixteenth. Sally Hawkins, whose knack for befriending the bestial was demonstrated in “The Shape of Water” (2017), is wasted here as a scientist. Ditto David Strathairn as an admiral. Vera Farmiga plays Emma Russell, who has invented an acoustic device, the Orca, that can tune in to Titans. (The film probably cost around two hundred million dollars, so it’s touching to note that the Orca seems to be made from an old oscilloscope found on eBay for thirty-five bucks.) Emma’s daughter, Madison, aged fourteen, is played by Millie Bobby Brown, the prodigy from the TV series “Stranger Things,” who has one moment—​enshrined in the trailer—when she turns not to scream but to smile, with a kind of knowing relief, at Godzilla’s approach. That moment makes the movie. It has long been a boast of monster flicks that they glow with metaphorical intent. The original “Godzilla” came out in Japan less than a decade after Hiroshima, and a recent contribution to the legend, “Shin Godzilla” (2016), was received, and praised, as a scalding comment on the Japanese government’s response to real-life calamities—the earthquake and tsunami of 2011, and the subsequent meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. What’s sad about “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is its attempt, both earnest and lily-livered, to maintain that moral tradition; Dougherty isn’t quite sure whether to wow us with the hulking immensity of the action scenes or to wag his finger at us for the environmental hubris of our species. While some of the characters want to live in peace with Godzilla and the gang, others want to kick the bejesus out of them, which is easier said than done.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," My first experience with Godzilla was watching on TV the American, English-dubbed version of the 1954 Japanese film, “Gojira,” released in the United States as “Godzilla, King of the Monsters.” Over the next several decades, many more Godzilla movies —
most from Japan — were released. As the years went by, these movies grew more
inferior, basically becoming kiddie-matinee fodder. In 2014, a new “Godzilla,” directed by Gareth Edwards and
released by Warner Bros., received respectable reviews and — more importantly —
decent box-office earnings. Now comes its sequel, “Godzilla, King of the Monsters,” a
mash-up that features other iconic “kaiju,” such as Rodan, Mothra and Monster
Zero, aka, Ghidorah. This latest release pushes an environmental message in
between sequences of the various beasties battling each other, destroying
cities and people, and, once in a while, munching on an unfortunate supporting
player or extra. The movie’s major drawback is that it takes itself too
seriously. Director Michael Dougherty, who wrote the script with Zach Shields,
strives for the gravitas of the original “Gojira.” Plus, Dougherty is altering the mythos about the kaiju. The
original idea was that — for at least Godzilla and Rodan — atomic testing was
the cause of their resurrections. That basically is still the idea in this newest “Godzilla,”
but now we get some hokum about how these giant creatures lived in harmony with
man thousands of years ago, keeping the planet and its ecosystem in balance. But Dougherty also reinstates Monarch, the secret government
agency that has hidden bases around the world where they keep most of these
titans in check. An ecoterrorist group wants to set these creatures free to
reign death and destruction on mankind and restore balance to Earth — if such
is possible. “Godzilla, King of the Monsters” is mainly CGI eye candy.
Most of the humans in the cast are required to gape in either wide-eyed wonderment
or terror — depending on the situation — as these monsters stomp, swim or fly
around, causing havoc wherever they touch down. To add continuity from the 2014 movie, Ken Watanabe and
Sally Hawkins return as scientists Dr. Ishiro Serizawa and Dr. Vivienne Graham,
who run Monarch and are tasked with keeping the creatures as docile as
possible. Most of the beastie battles are exciting, but they were filmed
against rainy, stormy or dark backgrounds that make them difficult to follow.
It’s almost as if they had taken up residence in Westeros during the Battle of
Winterfell. The movie would have been much more fun if it had simply
concentrated on Godzilla and his playmates. Whenever we hear sequences of
people expounding, the movie just drops dead in its tracks. Dougherty and his collaborators should have given people
more of what they really want — cities toppled, more monsters bashing each
other — and fewer moments of actors spewing inane dialogue. “Godzilla, King of the Monsters” pays homage to its past by
utilizing musical cues from the various Japanese features. And it also looks
ahead for its next heavyweight knockdown-title card between Godzilla and that
big hairy denizen of Skull Island. Lighten up a bit and have some fun with these big fellas.
After all, you now have CGI, not men in rubber suits. The gloves and
constraints are off. So, add a little zest, a wink and a nod here and there.
Liven up the franchise or it may become in danger of extinction."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE,It is a film so soul-crushingly dismissive of its entertainment value that it makes the thought of sitting in a theater anytime soon after sound like a chore.
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Bigger, dumber, and duller than before, Godzilla: King of the Monsters boasts monstrous fun, but it's script is a Kaiju-sized migraine to sit through."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,"Ferocious, action-packed continuation that dials up the noise and the property destruction to give fans the viewing experience they want. And in this feature, titans unleashed is always preferable to humans talking."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,"A fun summer blockbuster, this is like a 2 hour theme park ride! And a kaiju movie deserves a kaiju screen - see it on the biggest screen possible!"
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," Godzilla began his cinematic life as a not-so-subtle metaphor for nuclear weapons, but the pop-cultural endurance of this colossal, city-leveling radioactive reptile – arguably the great post-World War II movie monster – is attributable in part to his flexibility. While the Godzilla novice might be tempted to regard the Japanese kaiju film (and its international cousins) as a monolithic and homogeneous subgenre, the reality is much more complex and, well, pretty damn weird. The 32 official Godzilla films produced by Japanese studio Toho run the gamut, from the overt atomic terror of Ishirō Honda’s groundbreaking original (1954) to psychedelic eco-parable (Godzilla vs. Hedorah, 1971) to kiddie-flick silliness (Godzilla vs. Megalon, 1973) to exhausting sci-fi lunacy (Godzilla: Final Wars, 2004). That said, the Godzilla franchise is currently in the depths of a profoundly pessimistic era, thematically speaking. (The “Reiwa period,” per the Japanese imperial parlance used to categorize the Toho features). The series is as blatantly apocalyptic as it’s been since Honda’s original, or at least since the grim anti-nuclear jeremiad The Return of Godzilla (1985). This shift was purportedly inspired in part by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and resulting Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The tonal change is evident straightaway in 2016’s Shin Godzilla, a “hard reboot” that writer/co-director Hideaki Anno drenches in the paralyzing horror of a massive natural or human-made disaster. (Bizarrely yet compellingly, Anno and co-director Shinji Higuchi also turn the film into a bureaucratic satire-procedural about collective problem-solving.) Toho doubled down on this bleak tone in the Godzilla trilogy it subsequently produced with animation studio Polygon Pictures, films subtitled Planet of the Monsters (2017), City on the Edge of Battle (2018), and The Planet Eater (2018). That trio of features blends Godzilla tropes with the conventions of futurist anime to create a post-apocalyptic sci-fi saga, one in which the titular leviathan and his kaiju nemeses are reimagined in a darker, more desolate context. The handful of American Godzilla films have always been confined to a sort of parallel, semi-embarrassing sideshow, their relationship to the Toho films primarily one of licensing. (The ‘Zilla of TriStar’s notorious 1998 Hollywood film even became a target of outright mockery in the Toho features of the early 2000s.) It’s accordingly surprising that director Gareth Edwards’ remake/reboot Godzilla (2014) has ended up feeling so consistent with the Reiwa-period Japanese features that immediately followed it. Although there is no narrative connection between those films and Edwards’, the 2014 feature captures the same feeling of Lovecraftian cosmic horror, an uncommon tone for the franchise that nonetheless seems like a natural fit. Edwards’ Godzilla has its glaring flaws – a dishwater-dull “hero,” overly dark visuals, and the elimination of its best performers before the second act – but it also has awe-inspiring and frankly terrifying monster action, superbly conveying the sense that humanity is simply beneath the notice of the planet's battling behemoths. Much like Shin Godzilla, the 2014 American feature is the uncommon disaster flick in which toppling skyscrapers, normally a source of cheap Hollywood spectacle, evoke a fitting sensation of horror and powerlessness. The most immediately aggravating thing about the 2014’s film’s direct sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is its tepid interest in revisiting that novel mood of apocalyptic terror. The screenplay from Dougherty and Zach Shields – with an additional story credit to Max Borenstein – is most preoccupied with creating a globe-hopping action epic in the spirit of cheesy 1990s sci-fi blockbusters like Stargate (1994), Independence Day (1996), and Armageddon (1998). KotM isn’t as remotely insipid as those films, but it shares some of their more conspicuous traits: a glossy, faintly laughable futurism; a disconcerting hard-on for the U.S. military; and a script that favors earnest, hokey speeches peppered with tongue-in-cheek one-liners. Even the film’s human antagonists – a cabal of radical, violent ecoterrorists led by an ex-MI6 British mastermind (Charles Dance) – feel like refugees from some lost Arnold Schwarzenegger flick that was plucked from a Blockbuster Video shelf 25 years ago. Dougherty has written superhero films of varying quality (X2: X-Men United, Superman Returns), but his real claim to fame among genre enthusiasts is as a director of cult horror comedies (Trick ‘r Treat, Krampus). It’s difficult to determine whether the distinctly 1990s style of his inaugural Godzilla film constitutes a semi-ironic homage to an earlier, tackier Hollywood era or just standard flattery by mimicry. Regardless, it ensures that KotM has a self-consciously schlocky quality that is at odds with the primeval, god-level horror that the film strains to evoke. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is more of an ensemble effort than its 2014 predecessor, although the heart of the narrative is plainly the Russell family: paleobiologist mom Emma (Vera Farmiga); animal behaviorist dad Mark (Kyle Chandler); and 12-year-old daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Both adult Russells have connections with the secretive cryptozoology agency Monarch, and unfortunately, the whole family was in San Francisco at the time of Godzilla’s climactic 2014 smackdown with the parasitic MUTO super-organisms. Indeed, KotM opens with a flashback: As the victorious Godzilla lurches back into the sea, the Russells desperately search through mountains of rubble for their young son, Andrew. The loss of their oldest child drives a wedge between Emma and Mark, and five years later, they’ve split up to pursue their scientific careers on different sides of the globe. He’s filming wolf behavior in the Colorado wilderness, while she’s working at a clandestine Monarch facility in China, where Madison – in the fine tradition of many a precocious kaiju-film kid – evidently has the run of the place. This facility houses a gestating Titan, one of several gargantuan, god-like prehistoric creatures that Monarch has discovered over the past few decades. The first of these was Godzilla, awakened by the U.S. nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the 1940s and ’50s. The colossal ape depicted in the 1970s-set Kong: Skull Island (2017) is another. Most of the remaining Titans appear to be slumbering, although the giant, glowing egg that houses the Chinese Titan – dubbed Mothra by the Monarch technicians – has just begun to hatch. Fortunately, Emma has recently perfected a portable bioacoustics gadget, codenamed “Orca,” which allows her to capture, remix, and broadcast the peculiar sonic language that the Titans seem to share (despite their morphological diversity). Using the Orca, she manages to calm the enormous silkworm larva that emerges from the egg. However, their human-to-monster tête-à-tête is interrupted by the literally explosive arrival of the nefarious Col. Jonah (Dance) and his militaristic tree-huggers, who are rumored to traffic in black-market Titan DNA. Mothra manages to escape during the chaos and cocoon herself under a waterfall, but Jonah eliminates the Monarch staff, steals the Orca, and abducts both Emma and Madison – the former being one of two people in the world who understands the intricacies of the device. The other would be Mark, who years ago helped Emma design a prototype, which is why the Monarch leadership shortly appears on his doorstep in Colorado. Paleozoologists Dr. Serizawa and Dr. Graham (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins, both reprising their roles from the 2014 feature) and the agency’s unctuous director of technology, Dr. Coleman (Thomas Middleditch), all plead for Mark’s assistance in tracking down the pilfered Orca. However, Mark – who has nothing but contempt for the Titans and Monarch’s benign stance toward them – is primarily concerned for the safety of his daughter and ex-wife. Relenting to Monarch's request, he is whisked away to an undersea research facility, one devoted to sonically tracking Godzilla’s oceanic movements in the wake of his emergence. There Mark meets more agency higher-ups, including acerbic sonographer Dr. Stanton (Bradley Whitford, essentially retreading his 2012 role from The Cabin in the Woods), Titan historian Dr. Chen (Zhang Ziyi), and Col. Foster (Aisha Hinds), a former Army Ranger officer who now leads an American special-forces unit attached to Monarch. It doesn’t take long for this group to puzzle out Jonah’s next destination: Antarctica, where a Monarch outpost stands watch over “Monster Zero,” a three-headed winged reptilian Titan encased in the polar ice. It seems that Jonah and his allies have Thanos-sized apocalyptic ambitions that have nothing to do with filching biological samples. They intend to wake the hibernating Titans one by one, re-balancing the planet’s ecosystem and healing the ravages of humankind’s millennia-long dominance. The likely demise of billions of people in this cleansing process is hand-waved away as a necessary sacrifice. Do the dastardly eco-terrorists manage to awaken all those slumbering monsters? Does Godzilla emerge as the last best hope for humanity? Does Watanabe get to solemnly clean his glasses and speechify vaguely about the power of hope? Does one even have to ask? It’s all somewhat dismally familiar stuff, the polish lent by the 2010s visual effects notwithstanding. Admittedly, there’s a certain cheeky quality to the film’s breathless, scientifically challenged world-building that almost makes it amusing. (There’s eventually a foray into the drowned ruins of a lost, ancient civilization that is only disappointing because no one has the chutzpah to name-drop “Atlantis.”) In this, KotM has some tonal similarity to the 1950s-’70s (Shōwa period) Godzilla films, which tended to treat their science-fiction and fantasy elements with a bewildering glibness. This doesn’t exactly salvage Dougherty’s film from its own hyper-committed silliness, but it’s at least a more charitable explanation for the feature’s eye-rolling story beats than the usual studio-blockbuster stupidity. The cast can’t do much to elevate such a trite screenplay, although they don’t really exert the effort it would take to do so. Dramatic stalwarts like Farmiga, Chandler, and Watanabe are essentially just working in their customary, sweatpants-comfortable modes. (And who can blame them? This is a $200 million Godzilla film, after all.) No one else leaves much of an impression, including Brown, who the screenwriters give zilch to work with beyond, “You’re an angsty, witless, reckless pre-teen; also, you love your mom and dad.” Every little positive morsel the film proffers is seemingly upstaged by a more pervasive negative. As an example, Hinds’ colonel is that vanishingly rare character, a black woman military commander in a Hollywood blockbuster, and almost all the named military characters are people of color. (Spoiler: They even survive to the end!) This welcome gesture of representation is soured by the film’s propagandistic, wall-to-wall obsession with weapons technology and military operations. (Most embarrassingly, the film is practically a 131-minute commercial for the V-22 Osprey aircraft, that poster child for budget-busting Defense Department boondoggles.) None of this may matter to viewers who walk into KotM seeking the spectacle of epic monster-on-monster battles – as opposed to airtight world-building and nuanced character drama. which, if one is being honest, have never exactly been series staples. As a director, Dougherty doesn’t quite have Edwards’ affinity for bigness, a trait the latter director honed with his kaiju-on-a-shoestring 2010 debut feature, Monsters. As a filmmaker whos has previously been besotted with the beauty of autumnal and wintery nightmares, Dougherty is prone to prioritizing gorgeous, screencap-worthy shots over the overwhelming sense of scale that made Godzilla 2014 so exhilarating. This isn’t to say that delectable visuals aren’t a welcome trait in a film like KotM, which possesses two key elements that work in its favor: plenty of monsters and plenty of locations. Long before the gigantic, mutant pterosaur Rodan emerges from a Mexican volcano, annihilating a city merely by flying over it, it’s obvious that the film has poured its passion into art direction and visual effects, with creature design an obvious standout. Godzilla, Mothra, and Rodan are the marquee stars here, along with long-time Godzilla rival King Ghidorah, although KotM also offers up a cavalcade of original supporting Titans, many of whom suggest Toho kaiju like Anguirus (Godzilla Raids Again, 1955) and Kumonga (Son of Godzilla, 1967). The film’s monsters are rendered with phenomenal attention to detail, evincing a mindful effort to visually distinguish them from one another, perhaps in recognition of the way that Godzilla’s early Shōwa-period foes often blended together into one grayish-green reptilian blur. Ghidorah’s design here is more explicitly mythological than in previous iterations, evoking a Chinese dragon rather a than a real-world animal. (There’s also a handmade “offness” to his golden scaly hide and facial features that suggests the stop-motion monsters of Ray Harryhausen.) Mothra has a luminous, almost angelic appearance in this film that sets her apart from the rest of the Titans, who tend toward more bestial or repulsive forms. The film even manages to find a roundabout way to work in the Shobijin, the twin fairies that traditionally serve as Mothra’s heralds and priestesses in the Toho films. This is emblematic of one of the things that King of the Monsters does best: shameless, downright giddy Godzilla fan service. The film’s story lifts elements from several Toho features, most prominently the Godzilla-vs.-Ghidorah showdown Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965). However, the real appeal for kaiju devotees mostly lies in the little details, such as the plot nods to the original Godzilla – an “Oxygen Destroyer” superweapon makes an appearance – and Bear McCreary’s score, which reworks motifs from Akira Ifukube’s thunderous 1954 compositions. More generally, KotM is a film that understands the sheer, visceral thrill of a giant monster fight. The Titans clash in a variety of vivid arenas, from an Antarctic glacier howling with wind and snow to a burning, tornado-wracked Washington, D.C. Although Godzilla 2014 captured the size of its creatures better, KotM’s monster action is superior overall: a succession of vicious, animalistic death matches full of slashing, smashing, and writhing, all lit by crackling energy. Unlike the anonymous, eldritch leviathans in Pacific Rim (2013), the giants of KotM have personality, befitting a roster of movie monsters that have endured for decades. Here and there, Dougherty exhibits an affinity for apocalyptic destruction that can be creative in is jaw-dropping splendor. There’s a moment when the smoldering Rodan obliterates an entire squadron of fighter jets simply by doing a barrel roll, a turn of events that prompts “Did that just happen?” shell shock from characters and audience alike. All this chaos is rendered with an almost painterly loveliness that can be jarring, given the popcorn-flick content on display. Simply put, King of the Monsters is an absurdly gorgeous film, at least at the Titan scale. Many of the film’s wide shots of battling monsters look like nothing so much as Rembrandt landscapes, full of deep shadow, glowing color, and menacing walls of cloud. There’s also more than a little Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Brueghel on display, with their swarming, chiaroscuro visions of Judgment and Hell. For a Godzilla aficionado, these sort of gnarly thrills and aesthetic delights are more than worth the price of some dopey dialogue and an insipid story. For everyone else ... well, there’s always the forthcoming showdown between the King of Monsters and the King of Skull Island. Or perhaps a nuanced character drama would be best instead."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," Picking up five years after its predecessor, KotM follows the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like agency Monarch as it tracks the emergence of new kaiju (“Titans” in these films). Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a scientist who, with her estranged husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler), created the Orca, a device that allows humans to communicate with the Titans. The Orca is stolen by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), a radical climate activist whose goal is to awaken the Titans to cleanse the planet and ‘restore balance.’ Comparisons to Thanos are adequate. But Jonah awakens Monster Zero, aka King Ghidorah, a fierce Alpha Titan whose clarion call starts a chain reaction of destruction that Godzilla (himself) must combat. Unlike Godzilla, Ghidorah’s monster monarchy is wholly malevolent, driven by destruction rather than re-creation of natural habitats. The Russells’ daughter, Madison, (Millie Bobby Brown), is also along for the ride. KotM is more-or-less a remix of the 1962 classic Ghidorah: The Three-Headed Monster, the first movie to combine multiple Toho kaiju into one film. The same assortment is present here: Ghidorah, Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra. The latter three each already had at least one film under their belt before their first encounter; it was a real Infinity War situation. In that telling, aliens were trying to invade Earth, and one girl was psychic and could speak Kaiju. She literally translates Godzilla and Rodan debating whether to defend Earth from Ghidorah. “Godzilla says he has no reason to help humans. Humans always make trouble,” she interprets. That’s more or less the spirit of KotM, too. It’s only dumb if you take the science in a movie about giant monsters punching up seriously. Why would you? As a member of that target audience, I can assure you that KotM lives up to its title, delivering a streamlined and updated version of a classic monster mashup with gorgeous visuals, fun callbacks and decent humor. It doesn’t waste much time on human antics unrelated to the monsters clashing around them. There are occasions where it uses the human perspective as a way of viewing the monster fights. My colleague Nick Rogers termed the 2014 Godzilla as “watching people watch Godzilla,” and that happens here from time to time. On the merits, the previous film captured the scale of its Titans more effectively, being that was the only trick it had up its sleeve. But in this case it works because director Michael Dougherty provides plenty of epic-scale action to balance it out. Thankfully composer Bear McCreary returns to classic themes for Godzilla, Mothra and Ghidorah in his score, and Godzilla’s classic roar is returned to him. Of all the small problems with the last American-produced Godzilla movie, its desire to stray as far as it could from the definitive minutiae of the character was the most disappointing. Hard to argue there’s much thematic depth to KotM, but maybe that’s beside the point. The original Gojira was panned at release by local critics; it found critical loving only as the decades went by and the historical context in which it was made became synonymous with the film in the minds of critics and academics. But few love Godzilla because of that original movie’s depth; they love Godzilla because he’s a character they grew up enjoying with other people. If enjoying these kinds of movies with other people is their definitive value — and those who have built friendships on this particular franchise are satisfied in taking this hit of cup and bread together at the multiplex — perhaps that’s the main success of KotM, a gorgeous and absurdly ridiculous return to form for a franchise. There are many teases in the body of the film and post-credits for what is to come in next year’s Godzilla vs. Kong. I hope it’s just as enjoyable."
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," This Godzilla falls flatter than the buildings he and other monsters crush around Fenway Park. Action fans are the only ones who can rejoice seeing this hyper-active second offering starring the super-size reptile with a cold heart of gold. If you crave good writing and story telling, this isn’t it. The lame dialogue and plot is reduced to filler between the action sequences. The 2014 reboot of the Godzilla origin directed by Gareth Edwards took in over half a billion bucks and was pretty well received. He was criticized at the time for waiting too long to put the lead monster on camera and neglecting the human drama along in favor of special effects. This time, Writer/Director Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields have the legendary monsters, known as Titans, screaming, soaring and battling in the first minutes. The kaiju fight scenes are masterfully CGI choreographed, but it feels like Dougherty inserted this action just for the effect. In each new kaiju encounter, Godzilla and his monster opponents get to show off new weapons and tricks. That plot surmises that Earth has been inhabited for millennia by Titans; skyscraper-sized behemoths of mystical legend of which Godzilla is one. The Titans are entombed far beneath the surface throughout the world. Monarch, a quasi-government agency, has been formed to find, study and determine if humans can co-exist with these creatures. Fermiga gets drawn into an eco-terrorist plot to unleash the Titans on the world. Chandler is enlisted to stop the carnage, rescue his daughter and spout a few wisecracks along the way. Attempts at relevance come and go as the plot weaves in reference to idiotic government interference, climate change and even Eastern Mythology. None of these threads are well developed. Ken Watanabe is the only returning character from the first film. He’s the scientist with the steely eyes, clear vision, and the proper Japanese pronunciation of “Godzilla.” The Titans are the centerpieces of this movie and visually, for the most part, they don’t disappoint. We find Godzilla, on the other hand, lacking in some of the elements that make him both fearsome and “lovable.” In the moments where his face is close-up interacting with a human, we expect to see something, anything, in those eyes or face. After all, Godzilla, as he has in the past,  has gone to war to help humans. Those emotional  nuances from the special effects team never happens. The flying reptile Rodan is a fiery winged killing machine. Mothra, Queen of the Monsters, is beautifully lethal. Godzilla’s major opponent is the three headed dragon Ghidorah. Game of Thrones fans will swear these three remind them of Dany’s children.  The huge climactic battle to determine the alpha among the Titans plays like a night at WWE. It’s Wrestlemania for monsters. You will have your own favorite bad scene from this movie, but look for a totally inept Bradley Whitford encouraging Godzilla to get off the mat and keep fighting. We almost expect him to turn to the camera and beg the kids to clap their hands to bring him back, ala Tinkerbell in Peter Pan. The MonsterVerse is taking a page from Marvel, so stick around to the very end of the credits for a tantalizing clue of what’s to come. Next up, in March 2020, is Godzilla vs. King Kong. Based on the first two entries we know the visuals are going to excite. Hope there’s a human story that can match the monsters next time out. The best we can say is this Godzilla is not totally Godz-awful."
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," As someone who was a fan of Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla reboot, with its gradual build-up approach something of a fresh take on the usual big budget action tentpole standard, it’s a real shame that he wasn’t on board this epic-in-scale-but-limp-in-execution sequel that ignores all traces of subtlety and banks on overt simplicity instead. The idea behind Godzilla II: King of the Monsters lays the foundation for what could be an interesting take on questioning just how much of a threat is the titular creature, and should the US government utilise him as an ally.  Dr Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe, just one of many respected actors who is inexplicably involved here) believes so, advising the powers-that-be that Godzilla is more a benevolent force and is our only likely saviour against the hordes of other over-sized species (dubbed “Titans”) that have started to show their presence in the wake of Godzilla’s attack. Of course, we wouldn’t have much of a movie if the government agreed with the well-meaning Serizawa, so why not throw in a kidnapping subplot and a cartoonish eco-terrorist for good measure; Charles Dance clearly enjoying himself as the aforementioned terrorist Alan Jonah.  A shadowy organisation known as Monarch garners much of Godzilla II‘s traction, with Vera Farmiga as Monarch scientist Emma, who lost her son in the attack from the first film and has dedicated the last 5 years to creating technology that has the ability to both communicate and control the Titans; cue said kidnapping arc when Jonah steals the tech for himself, using Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as collateral. Perhaps feeling that the original Godzilla relied too much on its human characters, King of the Monsters opts for an emphasis on its Monster bi-line, delivering not only a juiced-up Godzilla (which is sadly how he is described by the supposedly amusing Bradley Whitford) but a volcano-birthed winged creature known as Rodan and a three-headed Ghidorah, who can regenerate severed limbs and summon hurricane-like storms.  Now, i’m certainly not opposed to some mindless battle action between outer-worldly creatures, and I imagine that the 12-15 year age market will salivate at some of the imagery director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) has conjured here, but much of what transpires on-screen between Godzilla, Rodan and Ghidorah fails to impress due to each sequence unable to differentiate themselves from one another; extreme close-ups, rapid cuts, and an emphasis on night-time battles mean it’s difficult to even distinguish what’s taking place before you. Whilst the action fails to inspire, and the impressive ensemble cast – which also features O’Shea Jackson Jr, Sally Hawkins, and Zhang Ziyi – are bogged down under ludicrous dialogue, the moments Dougherty decides to pan-out and allow his audience to take in the imagery are truly awe-inspiring; some of the wide shots of Godzilla and Ghidorah charging towards each other are oddly beautiful in how they are sculpted.  But sporadic moments of beauty and grandeur aren’t enough to overshadow what is ultimately an unintelligible actioner that’s components are ironically both bloated and shallow. The new story follows the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species—thought to be mere myths—rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity’s very existence hanging in the balance."
"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE," All of that is on display in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” an Avengers-style roundup of the classic kaiju (“strange beast”) monsters from post-WWII movies about enormous creatures who cause massive destruction as white-coated scientists make frantic calculations, the military deploys its most powerful weapons, skyscrapers are knocked down, politicians debate, and ordinary people run and scream. And so we have our title character, Godzilla, who has been a, well, monster hit at the box office, with the longest continuously running movie franchise, from 1954 to the present day, 35 films so far. Then there are the flying reptile Rodan, the gigantic insect-like Mothra, and the three-headed, dragon-like King Ghidorah.  And then there are the people. It would be a stretch to call them “characters” because they mostly exist to represent different sides in the movie’s key divide, metaphor for metaphor for a range of geopolitical issues ranging from refugees and immigration to environmental destruction to the role of public and private entities in national security and that oldest of themes, hubris, as reflected by the age of atomic weapons.  These issues are literally brought home in the way that a formerly married couple, Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler) Russell, and their daughter Madison (“Stranger Things'” Millie Bobbie Brown). They were so traumatized by the death of their son in the last monster attack that they split up. Mark is now off in the wilderness studying wolves. Emma is still studying kaiju and working on a special thingamagig that can be used to control the monsters and prevent further destruction.  Only Madison knows about how Emma plans to use it. And when the monsters who had been dormant re-appear Emma brings Madison along in what appears to be a very poorly timed take your daughter to work day. As Emma’s colleagues are mowed down by an “eco-terrorist” (Charles Dance) Emma and Madison are captured. Meanwhile, there is a debate in the outside world about how to deal with monsters. Should we kill them all? Should we acknowledge that they are the next stage of evolution and live with them? As one character says, when asked if they could just be our skyscraper-sized pets, “No, we would be theirs.”  And the question of who really are the monsters is raised with just enough heft to add some interest without ever getting in the way of the reason for the movie, which is big things fighting with other big things. I know, I know, you want me to get to the good stuff. And you can relax; I just spent more time on exposition than the film does. Co-writer/director Michael Dougherty knows why we’re here and boy, does he deliver, with the help of outstanding special effects and design crew. It is possible, I suppose, that you may have a chance to catch your breath at some point, in which case you might consider what the people behind that first Godzilla movie 65 years ago, with production values that might have seemed a bit crude even then, might think if they saw these never-less-than-spectacular kaiju, never less than majestic, every battle powerfully staged. Even if they had worked on the characters and dialogue with as much imagination as they did with the creatures, it would just be a distraction. The international cast gives it what they can, but the only use for lines like “It’s an existential challenge to our world!” and “The earth unleashed a fever to fight the infection,” “You are messing with forces beyond your comprehension!” plus references to “playing God” and saving the world is to stay out of the way of the action. Happy summer — the popcorn pleasures have arrived. Parents should know that this is a monster movie with extended sci-fi/fantasy peril, action, violence, mayhem, and destruction. Characters use strong language and there are issues of betrayal and family tensions.  Family discussion: What is the significance of the comment about the difference between the way Eastern and Western cultures see the stories about dragons? How would humans find a way to co-exist with monsters?  Which humans behave like monsters?"
"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," I have lost count of how many Godzilla movies exist in the universe, but it is probably safe to say none of the several dozen reaches quite the scale and size of Warner Bros and Legendary’s latest, Godzilla King of the Monsters. That actually was the title of the first movie out of Japan in the mid-1950s, a quaint black-and-white production badly dubbed in its English version but lots of fun to watch, if completely primitive to what is possible these days. This one is Warners’ latest attempt to craft a summer blockbuster that can revive the big radioactive scaly fella in order to compete with all the superhero flicks on tap. It is the follow-up to 2014’s Godzilla, in which he stomped all over San Francisco, among other places. In this outing Godzilla has brought along a few friends including Mothra, Rodan and the truly frightening three-headed King Ghidora. Now safely in the hands of director Michael Dougherty, who also wrote the by-the-book script with Zach Shields, no time is wasted in getting to the action — lots of it — as we enter Monarch, a scientific organization housing various examples of these “titans,” whose fate is in the hands of humans with varying agendas. Serizama (Ken Watanabe) mutters the unseen (for the past five years) Godzilla’s name a lot and is the key researcher who believes there is much to be learned from these behemoths. He is fighting a losing battle as some elements, notably the eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), come in to take over and use the monsters for their own evil purposes. Along the way they kidnap another scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) in order to get the Orca, the key invention of Emma’s that uses sounds that either engage or enrage the big guys. In other words, she can control them, if others will let her. Thrust into the bad side in many ways is Emma’s estranged husband and Madison’s father Mark (Kyle Chandler ), who is after Godzilla, blaming him for stomping on their only son in San Francisco five years earlier. Sally Hawkins, Zhang Ziyi, Thomas Middleditch and O’Shea Jackson Jr. are others at Monarch, who weave in and out of all the various destructive set pieces and battles that feel like they never end. Dougherty has packed this thing with all kinds of fire and fury and darkness — actually too much of it as he rarely lets the audience sit back and take a breather. This is Godzilla for the attention-deficit crowd, which is exactly why it probably will do just fine. The action is plentiful and extremely loud, but the sound designers and visual effects artists deliver exactly what they are asked — and in the case of the realization of the monsters on tap, they succeed admirably. These CGI creations are impressive and foreboding, particularly the star supporting player this time, King Ghidora, a triplet you don’t want to anger. These monsters do the heavy lifting as Godzilla himself is saved as a closing act, but when he gets to do his 11 o’clock number, he kills. As for the humans, Chandler and Farmiga really throw their all into this and try to remain calm and alive as whole cities including Boston are being crushed in their midst. Watanabe always is a welcome presence, as is Brown, who convinces us she hasn’t seen “stranger things” than what is going on here. This is the ultimate Imax movie, so check it out on the largest screen possible. Producers are Alex Garcia, Jon Jashni, Mary Parent, Brian Rogers and Thomas Tull. Warners turns it loose in previews tonight before beginning the regular run Friday. Check out my video review above, which includes scenes from the film.

"May 31, 2019",NEUTRAL," The history of Western Godzilla movies is spotty at best. The less that is said about Roland Emmerich’s 1998 take on the character the better, and while there was quite a bit to like about Gareth Edwards’ 2014 reboot, the characters weren’t one of them. Indeed, you could argue that the best Godzilla movie made outside of Japan was “Cloverfield,” which isn’t a Godzilla movie at all but captures the scale and chaos that such a being would inflict on a modern day metropolis. For all its flaws, Edwards’ “Godzilla” had a huge opening weekend and a successful run out at the box office, making a continuation inevitable. But just making a sequel in the era of Marvel isn’t enough, and Universal has since tied the franchise in with “Kong: Skull Island” to create the MonsterVerse, which will see the two behemoths clash in an upcoming movie. But first, the Godzilla tale must continue. Edwards has moved on to greener pastures, replaced by Michael Dougherty of “Trick ‘r Treat” and “Krampus” fame. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” opens in the middle of the destruction of San Francisco from the last film, with the HALO jump sequence playing out from a distance while Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma (Vera Farmiga) search in vain for their son amidst the wreckage. When the film catches up with them five years later, it’s clear that the trauma of that attack has taken its toll, with Emma now estranged from Mark and working for Monarch, the shadowy agency at the center of all this cryptozoological activity. They’ve discovered the sleeping titan Mothra and are using it to test a device that uses sound to control them when an ecoterrorist outfit led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) breaks in and kidnaps Emma and her daughter Madison (Mille Bobbie Brown) along with the device. Their plan is to unleash the titans upon Earth to cleanse it of humanity and allow the environment to repair itself, but when they release the terrifying three-headed Hydra monster Ghidora, it becomes evident that they’ve bitten off far more than they can chew. It’s up to Mark and a ragtag group of Monarch scientists (including Ken Watanabe, reprising his role from the first film) as well as a certain giant lizard to fight back and restore balance to the world. Much like Edwards’ film, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is at its best when it embraces the scale and awe-inspiring splendor of these giant monsters. Their battles are a series of epic clashes played out like the paintings of Frank Frazetta – otherworldly, majestic and metal as all hell. Dougherty knows what he needs to get right, and all the care and attention is rightly focused on how cool it is when Godzilla and Ghidora clash. But those transcendent moments don’t take up enough of the real estate. The color palette is dark and drab, with fights among the rubble of cities coated in a perpetual layer of dirt and ash. There is something a little off about some of the monster designs, though; they can feel almost a bit too expressive in the way they move and interact (especially compared to the stiffer Godzilla design) that almost makes them look like Muppets more than monsters. It speaks to the idea that the best images are presented from afar. It can feel more effective as an art book than a movie. It’s the human characters, though, that really let the whole film down. Let’s be honest: people don’t buy a ticket to a Godzilla movie in search of an incisive character drama. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean they should put as little effort into those characters as we see here. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” has employed some pretty great actors, but beyond Dance and Watanabe (who are expected to just chew all the scenery they can get their teeth on), no one really comes out of it looking rosy. Farmiga is saddled with an all-time terrible arc, pinballing from concept to concept as the plot requires and getting lost in muddled motivations and nonsensical responses to situations. Chandler doesn’t fare much better as a sort of everyman outsider who incredulously bosses around all the scientists and military types while essentially acting as a Godzilla whisperer. Good actors like O’Shea Jackson Jr. and Anthony Ramos are reduced to barking instructions at evacuating civilians, while Brown, in her first big role since breaking out on “Stranger Things,” simply doesn’t engage. She’s the child in peril, the motivation for her estranged parents to reconcile, but it fails to move the needle. Indeed, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is neither a step forward nor a step backward from the movie that preceded it. And it excels and stumbles in the exact same ways, offering some great visuals during the fights and completely failing to give the audience a compelling human character to act as their surrogate into the world. That may not be the point of movies like this, but the film spends plenty of time with those characters, so it shouldn’t be too much to expect those scenes to actually be enjoyable to watch. Still, there’s something to be said for these movies’ understanding of the awe and terror that comes from watching giant creatures turn your city into their own personal wrestling ring, and that in itself is likely enough to keep the Universal MonsterVerse afloat for some time, even if the films that comprise them aren’t narratively satisfying. Maybe someday they’ll crack the code and manage to deliver both a fun kaiju movie and a compelling story, but they haven’t gotten there yet. You can find our full content archive

"May 31, 2019",POSITIVE,"Michael Dougherty's Godzilla 2 swells with too many boring human characters, competently sets up some sequels, thrives solely on its (sometimes awe-inspiring) monster fights and makes no sense. So basically: pretty good Godzilla movie!"
"May 31, 2019",NEGATIVE," We're sorry, but we can't find the page you were looking for. It's probably some thing we've done wrong but now we know about it and we'll try to fix it."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Budget is not normally the sort of thing you mention in a review, but when you see a film that is almost entirely driven by spectacle and you keep marveling at how slapdash and/or unreal everything looks, you do start to wonder where all the money went."

"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The big guy comes into his own in the climax, but mostly he looks bored with this whole enterprise, and I am much of his opinion."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," Godzilla, that tall, irradiated, irritable frenemy of humankind, has starred in more films over the last 60 years than James Bond. The latest, subtitled King of the Monsters, is a sequel to 2014's punctuation-free reboot Godzilla, a city-block-buster that conjured tension and a gathering sense of dread—enough, at least, to give its dynamic correction of San Francisco real estate prices some emotional heft. It was thoughtful and somber about its high, mostly offscreen body count in ways films of this sort frequently are not. That emotional intelligence is not a virtue shared by its dull, chaotic follow-up, a parade of painterly beauty shots of its various creatures—just enough to cut a few good trailers, and this movie's trailers have been fantastic—with a whole lot of nothing in between.  Director and co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty hopscotches between scenes of Emmy nominees (Kyle Friday Night Lights Chandler, Vera Bates Motel Farmiga, Bradley The West Wing Whitford, Millie Stranger Things Bobby Brown, Thomas Silicon Valley Middleditch, Charles Game of Thrones Dance) gnawing their way through exposition, and animated fisticuffs (and clawifcuffs) among various match-ups of ""Titans,"" as the movie calls its plus-sized wildlife. Many of the beasts have some sort of projectile weapon at their disposal: Godzilla and his three-headed nemesis Ghidorah both belch radioactive flames, while friend-of-the-lizard Mothra can spit strong, fast-drying resin, as befits her seemingly more protective nature.  Lots of other familiar faces pop up: Sally Hawkins, whose prior creature feature, 2017 Best Picture winner The Shape of Water, was about an encounter much closer than any seen in this PG-13 movie. Ken Watanabe (who issued the Michael Buffer-esque dictum ""Let. Them. FIGHT!"" in Godzilla '14) and Zhang Ziyi as a pair of scientists. O'Shea Jackson, Aisha Hinds, Anthony Ramos, and David Straitharn as soldiers. They're all very good, making their undigestibly fibrous dialogue (""The human infection will only continue to spread,"" ""You are gambling with the lives of millions!"", etc., etc.) seem like stuff humans might say, and reacting convincingly to digitally animated calamities that, save for a few money shots of the creatures, generally have a weightless, screensavery quality. (A shot of the U.S Capitol in flames looks reassuringly phony — far less persuasive than the miniature White House that blew up in Independence Day 23 years ago.) I am required by law to tell you that 2017's Kong: Skull Island, though set in the 1970s, was also a canonical entry in this series. Is this information in any way useful to you? The makers of King of the Monsters sure hope so, even including a post-credits scene to tide you over until Godzilla vs. Kong arrives in 10 months' time. Forget the Universal Monsters. Smell you later, Monsters University. This is the Monsters Universe, Baby! The nominal leads of this time-marking entry are Farmiga and Chandler, as a pair of scientists whose marriage could not survive the death of their young son, one of the many thousands who perished in Godzilla's 2014 rampage. Their surviving daughter, played by Brown, lives with Farmiga's character, who's been working on a sonic device designed to communicate with the Titans, or at least calm them down when they're getting violent. No sooner has Farmiga's character witnessed the birth of Mothra, a peaceful winged beast, than her secret base is raided by commandos who kill her colleagues and take mother and daughter hostage, along with Farmiga's dino-phone. (It's called the Orca.) That sends Farmiga's fellows in the ""crypto-zoological agency"" Monarch off to fetch Chandler, whom they believe can help them retrieve his ex-wife along with her potentially lifesaving invention. Nearly all the scenes involving the humans take place on the bridge of Monarch's Argo—a flying aircraft carrier that looks like a stealth bomber—or else inside a submarine or in various control rooms. Despite the frequent appearance of teletype datelines on the bottom left of the frame, exactly where G: KotM's humans are in relation to G and the Ms is often murky. Sometimes the interjection of a line like ""We land in 10 minutes!"" will be the only indication that the entire preceding scene has been taking place inside the belly of a massive airplane instead of, say, an underground bunker. But most of the exterior shots have the same dark, dull, two dimensional quality as the monster-mash footage. And it all takes place at night, presumably to save on animation costs. The big scaly guy gets more screen time than in the prior outing, but is less expressive than before. The best Godzilla movies have let him speak eloquently (albeit in subtext), but ""I don't DO Mondays"" is all he ever seems to say this time. Like so many of the actors who've played Bond, he's had time to grow bored in the role. "
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,"This monster-sized, expensive-looking ""B"" popcorn movie delivers exactly what the trailers promise."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE,"These fights, splayed across ravished urban landscapes, aren't especially distinguished, but they're really all this Michael Dougherty-directed movie has to offer."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Murky creature feature seems an apt way to describe Godzilla King of the Monsters – a not at all scary monsterfest. All the monsters we remember from Saturday morning Godzilla movies are here. This film is filled with references to other films, in creature design and even something as random as the fact that Kyle Chandler (who plays Mark Russell) was also in Peter Jackson’s King Kong (2005). Of course this one is supposed to be a follow-up to Godzilla (2014) and Kong Skull Island (2017) is also referenced. All the references as background though is as much as you are going to get for context, and you had better be good with huge info-dumps because that is how the scientists in this one talk. Mark Russell (Chandler) is approached by crypto-zoological agency Monarch to help figure out just what has triggered a huge wave of monsters appearing from the depths. As Mark, Dr Serizawa (Watanabe) and Dr Graham (Hawkins) from Godzilla fly around the world trying to catch up to Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah, various monsters destroy cities and chase each other. The wind blows, the rain falls, monsters roar and people scream but monsters fighting each other in sun-less conditions makes it a tad difficult to really parse what is going on. Even when the monsters are several stories high, no amount of people swearing when they see them is going to make you scared, because for a monster movie this is a surprisingly un-tense, limp affair. While we do see Mark interact with his family and we certainly hear the scientists try to figure out what is happening, the audience never connects with anyone because there is just no story here. Things happen, people shoot guns and argue some more, and eventually you end up rooting for Godzilla or any kaijū to wipe everyone out so the plants can grow again."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," Godzilla is back for “King of the Monsters,” a follow up to his 2014 U.S. appearance, and now he’s joined by Mothra, Rodan and Ghidorah. First of all, let me just say I love monster movies. Ever since my dad showed me ""King Kong"" when I was a pre-schooler I have loved monsters and sympathized with them far more than with human characters. There are few things more spectacular on screen than a massive beast but they need to be given personality to fully win me over. That's why I also I fell in love with Godzilla at an early age. The suit actors playing him endowed him with such a vivid personality that I couldn't resist him. So I have followed his evolution closely and been cautiously hopeful as he has begun a franchise in America with a third film promising a showdown between Big G and King Kong. Godzilla or Gojira as he is known in Japan, first appeared in a 1954 film created by producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, director Ishirō Honda and special effects master Eiji Tsubaraya. Gojira is a giant monster, or kaiju, awakened by nuclear radiation. His debut came in close proximity to the atomic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Lucky Dragon 5 boat incident in which the crew was contaminated by the nuclear fallout from U.S. nuclear weapons tests.  “Gojira” was a horror film that allowed Japan to deal with the trauma of having had two atomic bombs dropped on its soil. When the film was imported to the U.S. in 1956 it was rechristened “Godzilla, King of the Monsters” (watch the trailer here) and had new scenes shot with American actor Raymond Burr and the film was heavily re-edited for U.S. distributor. So began Godzilla’s westernization.  Godzilla’s American films have been improving with each installment but then there was nowhere to go but up after the atrocious Roland Emmerich “Godzilla” in 1998. In 2014 Gareth Edwards raised the bar on the quality but left Godzilla a supporting player in his own movie. Now Michael Dougherty takes over directing duties and expands the monsterverse by bringing in some familiar faces from Godzilla’s past films. This new ""King of the Monsters"" picks up pretty much where the 2014 film left off. Godzilla is off the grid and the government and the crypto-zoological agency Monarch are all looking for him. But Godzilla now appears to be just one of what are being referred to as Titans, an ancient super-species once thought to be just myths. Now a scientist and some eco-terrorists are trying to raise these sleeping beasts as a means of ""curing"" the ""infection"" humankind has wrought on the earth. Mothra, Rodan and the nasty three-headed Ghidorah are awakened and, as you might expect, quickly go out of control. The only hope for humanity is finding the ultimate alpha monster, Godzilla, to put all the other creatures in their place. With “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” director/co-writer Michael Dougherty (“Krampus,” “Trick ‘r Treat”) improves on the previous U.S. Godzilla in terms of the number of cool monsters and screen time for the monsters and then allowing them to fight. It never quite attains a battle royale status, but there are some intense moments as these behemoths vie for dominance.  The press notes for the film state that these monsters are “realized without limits for the first time in the modern age.” I don’t think that’s intended as a slight to the Japanese films that displayed so much creativity, imagination, inventiveness and brilliance even within the limitations of budget and technology. But Hollywood likes to boast and CGI certainly allows for anything that can be imagined.  The American films have big budgets and extravagant CGI but the result looks more like an impressive video game. So the monsters may be gigantic and able to move with speed and dexterity but they don’t have the physical weight to be totally convincing. Perhaps this reaction is a generational thing. If you grow up with video games and CGI maybe that feels more real than the old school suit actors or stop motion animation. Since I grew up with the Japanese films and with an appreciation for the artistry of suit actors — yes, that's those men in rubber suits — but they endowed Godzilla and many other kaiju with a personality that these CGI and mo-cap creations can’t seem to get in this film. CGI has worked brilliantly in films like the recent “Planet of the Apes” or with Rocket Raccoon in the Marvel films. But in ""King of the Monsters"" the CGI looks beautiful but not fully fleshed out. “King of the Monsters” does create some impressive effects but they simply don’t engage me the same way that those suit actors stomping on meticulously rendered miniature sets did. There are some moments that raised my hopes as when the three heads of Ghidorah began fighting with each other, or Mothra’s birth or the particular viciousness of the fighting between Ghidorah and Godzilla. But too often I felt like I was watching someone play a video game and I wanted to grab the controller to make the monsters fight according to my desires. Dougherty has claimed to be a lifelong fan of Godzilla and his comments in the press notes seem to support that. He is quoted as saying: “Godzilla has always had a sense of mythic purpose. Godzilla movies are big, they’re fun, but underneath all the monster mayhem and apocalyptic destruction, these movies are allegories. That's how the Japanese initially invented and portrayed the character, and I think it’s one of the reasons Godzilla has endured for as long as he has. These are popcorn movies but they are filled with metaphor. And though the themes have changed over the years, they all leave you with the same warning: that if you push too hard against nature, nature’s going to push back.” And he’s right on all those points but they don’t exactly come through in his film. As a fan of the Japanese Godzilla I realize that I need to let go of what those films are in order to let these U.S. films create their own monster. But Hollywood films and this one is no exception, seem plagued by a desire to over-explain and to serve up too much exposition. This is a monster movie. You don’t need a complicated plot just a lot of monster time. Plus the humans in this film have too much control over the story and over the monsters because Americans seems unable to imagine anything they cannot defeat or control.  There are humans in this film but I found them mostly annoying and an interruption to the monster action. There is a lot of silliness with an Orca machine to control the monsters and weapons of mass destruction casually employed and to mostly not very credible effect. I would have been happy to lose a few human scenes in exchange for more time to develop Big G's personality or more screen time to the epic battles. Mothra and Rodan deserved a little more time in their tense encounter. “Godzilla, King of the Monsters” is probably more fun for people who did not grow up with the Japanese Godzilla movies. I enjoyed this film and found some of the monsters impressive in scale but I just haven’t quite fallen in love with this American cousin of my beloved Japanese kaiju. I do recommend seeing this in IMAX so you can appreciate the epic scale of some of the monster scenes. Since each film has improved on the previous, maybe Godzilla taking on King Kong in the next film will be when everything comes together perfectly. I remain cautiously optimistic and will savor the increased monster moments on display in ""King of the Monsters."""
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," When ‘Godzilla’ was rebooted in 2014 for modern audiences by Legendary Pictures, one of the major talking points surrounding the movie was the lack of monster action and too much human interaction. Fast forward five years, and we’ve arrived at a sequel literally nobody asked for, but at least the makers have managed to fix that one gaping issue: ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ is chock full of your favourite Toho kaiju, and they look like they’ve been plucked from your favourite fever dream, but jacked up on super steroids. But while Gareth Edwards’ 2014 ‘Godzilla’ at least offered a quiet introspection on the more serious aspects of the scowling, radiation-oozing, giant lizard-dinosaur, director Michael Dougherty (‘Trick ‘r Treat’, ‘Krampus’) settles for camp and pulpy, and not the good kind. The central allegory of the first movie, for those of you who don’t remember, rested firmly in the dangers of war and militarised technology, highlighted through the story of one single family who are dealing with the fallout of a nuclear disaster. ‘King of the Monsters’ now shifts the metaphor to over-population, climate change and the need to “return balance”, a la Thanos from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. All of this could have made for a relevant narrative, if only the plot, script, dialogue and acting didn’t fall apart all at once, which it sadly did. ‘King of the Monsters’ focuses on a new family. Vera Farmiga is Dr Emma Russell, a scientist coming to terms with the loss of her son during the events of the Godzilla rampage from the first movie. She’s busied herself with developing a device called the Orca, which will help her communicate with the kaiju (monsters called Titans), who are being protected by Monarch, a scientific organisation guarding Titans across the globe. Her ex-husband Mark is dealing with the disaster by running as far away as possible from all things monsters but finds himself being recruited by Monarch when Emma and their surviving daughter Madison (‘Stranger Things’’ Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by eco-terrorists, led by Jonah Alan (‘Game of Thrones’’ Charles Dance). Monarch, as in the first movie, is led by Dr Ishiro Serizawa (trusty ol’ Ken Watanabe) and Dr Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), and they are now on a mission to stop the terrorists from unleashing all the sleeping monsters on an unsuspecting world. So while the Monarch guys go from base to base all over the world — offering up some pretty scenery along the way — trying to put out big monster fires, there’s also a painfully cliched family drama unfolding in the centre of the storm, which more often than not throws off the pacing of an already dumb narrative. A scene in the beginning of the second act sees Farmiga’s character talk through a high-stakes moment with the help of a video montage, and you could hear the entire theatre groaning at the ridiculousness of it all. Hammy dialogues and punchlines (‘Long live the king’) don’t help either, and capable actors like O’Shea Jackson Jr and Zhang Ziyi have little to do. Where the movie really manages to leave a mark is in the larger-than-life monsters. Other-worldly and wholly real at the same time, the creatures will surpass anything you could conjure up in your imagination, and they truly make you want to cheer at the screen. Rodan, Mothra and Godzilla’s archenemy, the three-headed Ghidorah, all make extended appearances, and they’re an absolute treat. From high-speed air chases to city-flattening face-offs, the scale of it is quite unprecedented, and we wish the makers could have focussed on working on the monsters’ backstories and mythologies, rather than relying on incompetent humans to take the story forward. Godzilla himself looks chunkier and broodier (he could give Jon Snow a run for his money) than we’ve seen in a while, but he’s also more expressive somehow. Perhaps it’s also the fact that he gets some screen time with his girlfriend (an angelic-looking winged Mothra), which by the way could have been pulled off with a lighter touch. A headline-littered end credits scene sets up Legendary Pictures’ next ‘Monsterverse’ film, ‘Godzilla vs Kong’, and while we know we’ll line up to watch the wretched thing come 2020, you can be sure we’re going to be less (much less) than enthused. So that’s full points for spectacle and pizzazz, zero for everything else. If you’re looking to open your summer box office account with a monster feature but don’t particularly care for plot, ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ is for you. Otherwise, there’s ‘John Wick 3’ waiting next weekend."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," As we plunge into summer blockbuster season, deciding whether or not to shell out for another huge screen spectacle can be a challenge. In the case of “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” perhaps a questionnaire can help. If you answered “yes” or “positive” to most of these questions, the monster mash splash “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” could be the blockbuster for you. “King of the Monsters” might not be for you if kaiju battles are the main appeal of Godzilla movies. The last 30 minutes of this two-hour, 11-minute film have plenty of giant lizards noisily throwing themselves through skyscrapers (shrieking all the way). But the film prioritizes the human-scale stuff as a war of wills breaks out in the wake of the 2014 attacks (and film). Directed by Michael Dougherty and written by Dougherty, Zach Shields and Max Borenstein, the film introduces us to a family who lost a son in the previous calamity and has since splintered along ideological lines. Mark (Kyle Chandler) has a “nuke ’em all” approach, while his estranged wife, Emma (Vera Farmiga), wants to use an audio wave device called Orca to control the Titans (as they are called). Their daughter, Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown), is caught in the middle. Emma might preach coexistence and compassion, but no one realizes how extreme her beliefs have become until she teams with an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) to restore “natural balance” to the earth via monster rampage. Speaking of Dance, “King of the Monsters” is rife with lovable character actors, such as the aforementioned Whitford, as well as David Strathairn and even some of the younger generation including O’Shea Jackson Jr., Thomas Middleditch and Anthony Ramos. The film is absolutely stuffed with characters, monsters and locations, locations, locations. As kaiju bubble up from their hiding places below the Earth’s crush, summoned by the recently released three-headed hydra Monster Zero, we hop, skip and jump from China to Colorado to Bermuda, Antarctica, Mexico, Boston, Washington, D.C., Munich, Arizona and more. Not that any of the locations are even remotely distinguishable, visually. Yes, “King of the Monsters” could well be called “Godzillas in the Mist” for its brownish musty aesthetic and also for all the humans who desperately want to protect what they consider to be misunderstood creatures. Are they pestilence or prophets? Gods or germs? The humans can’t come to a consensus. Meanwhile, Gojira, Monster Zero, Rodan, Mothra, Kong and their pals are doing what Emma planned all along: thinning the human pack and destroying civilization to make room for nature to grow back. For all the human drama that “King of the Monsters” presents, it’s emotionally flat. The dialogue is exceedingly generic, except for a few Whitford zingers, and though the film conveys the dramatic importance onto a few key exterminations of human characters, it’s the drama of the monsters that’s the most compelling. Amazingly, somehow, an overstuffed Godzilla movie feels scant."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Seeing the fury of Godzilla unleashed should be a rush. Thrilling and scary all at once. If, instead, it feels repetitive and your pulse barely quickens? Something is off in the mix. In KING OF MONSTERS, sadly, something is definitely off in the mix."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,"On the rare occasion the camera pans out enough to showcase its creatures, they're truly awe-inspiring. But these moments of gratification are unable to counterbalance the film's laundry list of defects and misfires."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," Humans must look like pathetic insects to Godzilla and other gigantic monsters. As they fight each other and ravage our cities, we scurry around the ground like ants who just discovered a discarded ice cream cone. Godzilla: King of the Monsters deepens this idea with a key observation: We are not insects, but parasites who are killing the planet and draining its resources. That cynicism does not translate to the script, unfortunately, since King of the Monsters turns its attention to lazy melodrama and too much exposition. When a monster movie presents the monster action as an afterthought, it is time for the filmmakers to rethink their priorities. The Godzilla film from 2014 exceeded audience expectations because director Gareth Edwards took his time with the creature, hinting at its size and awesome power, so there was a real payoff when we finally saw him lay waste to San Francisco. Now, King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty, has little of that pacing or anticipation. A shadowy corporation named Monarch monitors the monsters, with its lead scientist Emma (Vera Farmiga) using a strange machine to control them. The exact function of this machine is never quite clear, since the script by Dougherty and Zach Shields shifts its purpose based on whatever the scene requires. Either way, Emma goes rogue after an eco-terrorist organization takes her hostage, so she unleashes long-dormant monsters at a breakneck pace. Aside from Godzilla, Dougherty also introduces Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. Of these three new monsters, only Mothra makes a strong impression because, as the queen to Godzilla’s king, she makes feminine movements and screeches that are in stark contrast to the rugged roars of everyone else. If you’re a fan of the classic films from Toho, these creatures will be exciting and instantly familiar. If you’re new to these creatures, then do not worry because the characters will explain them at length, repeatedly. There is an interesting strategy at play: The cast is stacked with dependable character actors who have imperfect information, so the exposition dump has a natural feel to it. Once the film settles into its groove and Monarch chases the monsters all over the planet, it becomes clear these characters do not have names or personalities. The actors are useful as recognizable faces that can sometimes sell ridiculous dialogue. It does not help that Monarch’s jet somehow traverses the globe at lightning speed, always popping up at the most dramatic moment possible. Only Ken Watanabe makes an impression as a high-ranking Monarch scientist. His respect for Godzilla borders on affection, and he is the only character who truly regards the monsters with a sense of wonder. The Toho Godzilla films may have rudimentary special effects, but they have the advantage of being filmed with abundant light and unobstructed views. Snow, rain, and smoke obscure the action in King of the Monsters. In fact, Dougherty does not present a clear view of Godzilla until the film’s final minutes. Until then, the audience must squint to make any sense of how the monsters are fighting each other, or what city is under siege. We watch a key character get killed midway through the film, but we are not certain until the next scene, where we see their face on a monitor along with the word “DECEASED.” Dougherty hides his murky visuals with attacks on submarines, airplanes, and other vehicles. The actors jostle around the frame like they’re in classic episodes of Star Trek, and each moment with them means another away from the monsters, so the film fails to meet the basic appeal of its genre. Thanks to 2014’s Godzilla and Watanabe’s performance, the giant lizard is an oddly comforting screen presence. He is not cuddly, but he moves with dogged determination and causes minimal collateral damage. His dad bod figure is also a welcome contrast to the sinewy, strange shape of his adversary King Ghidorah, who has three heads that can regenerate at will. But King of the Monsters keeps Godzilla out of the film for long stretches, focusing instead on who has the Monarch machine or whatever. The phrase “Let them fight” became instantly iconic when Ken Watanabe uttered it five years ago. Maybe he should have added “in a visually comprehensible way” to the end of his command.  We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read. If you think that it's important to have high quality local reporting we hope you'll support our work with a monthly contribution."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Thunder Road opens with a man falling apart. At his mother’s funeral, despairing police officer Jim Arnaud (played by the film’s writer/director Jim Cummings) fails to keep it together as he attempts to deliver a eulogy involving the titular Bruce Springsteen song, a malfunctioning boom-box and an excruciating dance routine. The camera doesn’t really cut away until this squirming ordeal is over, and it’s hard not to be transfixed by the emotional car crash playing out in slow motion as Jim, blindsided by feelings he’s clearly never confronted, suddenly finds himself veering down different avenues of his complex family history as he tries to get back on track. It’s an unusual way to start a movie, but the risk pays off by foreshadowing the way this funny, heartfelt, unsentimental exploration of grief and parenthood ends up reflecting the absurd ways in which real life frequently collapses the distance between the tragic and the comic. Returning to work straight after the funeral, for instance, Jim is served with divorce papers from his estranged wife who wants sole custody of his beloved daughter (Kendal Farr) – a calamity that pushes him closer to breaking point as he attempts to settle his mother’s estate while dealing with the stresses of a job that would test the mettle of even the most zen-like person. Reminiscent of John C Reilly’s sad-sack cop in Magnolia, Cummings’ protagonist is an empathetic marvel, a decent guy trying to hold it together as the world kicks him repeatedly in the groin. A belated sequel to Gareth Edwards’ sombre 2014 reboot of the famed Japanese monster movie franchise, Godzilla: King of the Monsters suffers from Marvel-inspired attempts create a monster-themed cinematic universe incorporating 2017’s woefully inept Kong: Skull Island and from the more pressing, though not unrelated, issue of being unforgivably dull. You’ll be thrilled to learn this is a film that requires us to remember plot details of a monster movie that didn’t exactly capture the public imagination and is now desperately trying to build on the wacky mythology introduced in the aforementioned King Kong reboot. But the film’s dullness is also down to how uninspired the action is, with co-writer/director Michael Dougherty struggling to convey the requisite sense of scale as Godzilla and Mothra go on the rampage against a host of winged and mammoth-like creatures while the human cast – Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown and Sally Hawkins among them – try not to get squished. Having directed Octavia Spencer to an Oscar in the horribly dated racial drama The Help, director Tate Taylor re-teams with her for Ma, an enjoyably trashy exploitation shocker about a lonely middle-aged woman (Spencer) who befriends local teens and lets them party in her basement away from the prying eyes of parents and cops. Why is best not divulged in a review, but the film – the latest from Blumhouse Productions (Get Out, The Purge) – does an effective job layering in enough mystery to facilitate some unexpected jump scares and some blunt social commentary for the #MeToo age. The overblown ending lets it down, but Spencer is great as the titular matriarch gone wrong and fellow Oscar-winner Allison Janney (another alumnus from The Help) has a delicious cameo as her officious boss. There’s more Oscar talent in Sunset, Hungarian director László Nemes’ first film since his debut, the holocaust drama Son of Saul, won the Academy Award for best foreign language feature in 2016. Though stylistically similar, it’s a very different beast, exploring as it does the last days of the Austro-Hungarian empire as experienced by a young woman hunting for clues to her family history. This is Irisz (Juli Jakab), who has returned to Budapest in 1913 to work in the hat emporium founded by the parents she lost in a fire when she was two. Learning that she has an older brother who’s gone into hiding after murdering an aristocrat five years earlier, she sets out to find him amid the chaos of Budapest as the anarchists with whom her sibling is affiliated start laying siege to the old order that Irisz’s employers and their clientele represent. Never leaving Irisz side, Nemes’ camera moves with her through the city, plunging us into the turbulence of the times, often in long single takes with no historical context and scant expository dialogue. That makes for a disorientating experience, but the cumulative effect is mesmerising, as vivid as a nightmarish dream that’s too slippery to fully comprehend but too haunting to forget.  As a curmudgeonly, Gaelic-speaking Hebridean native who travels to San Francisco to visit his estranged son (JJ Feild) and new grandson, Brian Cox makes the otherwise hokey Rory’s Way a more entertaining prospect than its groaning fish-out-of-water premise initially promises. Early scenes of the title character’s island life leave us in little doubt about the culture-and-generation-clashing jokes that will follow – and, sure enough, when he turns up at the lavish apartment of his son (a chef specialising in molecular gastronomy) and his son’s doctor wife (played by Thora Birch), it’s not long before he’s winding them up about their over-attentive parenting style. But as Rory starts bonding with his grandson and befriending locals – among them Rosanna Arquette’s museum curator and Peter Coyote’s linguist – the film settles down into a less egregiously quirky exploration of the value of making up for lost time before it’s too late.

"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It's the kind of movie that has military strike teams and secret monster bases and a team of wisecracking scientists... but it's also undeniably fun in its silly, oversized mayhem. And the monsters are spectacular."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Not to rain on Godzilla's parade ­­- which constantly happens in this insanely rainy movie ­- but isn't crowning Japan's radioactive, fire-breathing dinosaur ""King of the Monsters"" a bit premature when the supreme heavyweight title monster match won't take place until March 13, 2020, when ""Godzilla Vs. Kong"" opens? Meanwhile, Michael Dougherty's loud, busy and confusing ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" puts humanity to the test, specifically actors required to emote as they deliver inane and cheesy dialogue with an Oscar-level sense of serious purpose. Polar fracking has knocked the Earth off its axis just enough to wreak havoc with Mother Nature, causing the awakening of 17 ""titans,"" giant critters really miffed by having their centuries-old underground slumber disrupted. Emma has developed a sonic device that can shut down the aggressive tendencies of titans, if she can locate the corresponding frequency of a creature, such as Mothra, still in a cocoon inside a secret underground Monarch lab. A group of eco-terrorists led by the villainous Jonah Alan (former ""Game of Thrones"" king Charles Dance) raids the lab and kills everyone except Emma and Madison, deemed ""too essential to the plot"" to be knocked off so early. Alan abducts Emma and Madison. Mark joins up with fellow Monarch employees to save them, plus the rest of the planet, as 17 unhappy titans bring down property values around the globe. As silly and cartoony as this disaster movie gets ­- it's a war allegory without the gory - Dougherty's movie can't match the dumbfounding idiocy of Roland Emmerick's 1998 ""Godzilla."" In that inept epic (also shot with lots of rain, presumably to camouflage poor-quality special effects), Godzilla hides in the tunnels under Manhattan, despite being as tall as the Empire State Building. As much as people in ""King of the Monsters"" talk about Godzilla being on their ""side,"" the irradiated beastie remains a grim, fire-breathing stick figure, lacking the emotive nuances of Daenerys Targaryen's dragon pets in HBO's ""Game of Thrones."" Not even the acting talents of venerable Japanese actor Ken Watanabe and ""Shape of Water"" Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (both reprising characters from Gareth Edwards' 2014 ""Godzilla"") can breathe fire into this monster mash-up sequel."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," Technically,
there are human beings in Godzilla: King
of the Monsters, but they certainly don't provide the movie with a single
bit of humanity. They exist to explain, to theorize, to cause or hopelessly try
to fix problems involving giant monsters, and to run, drive, and fly away from
said monsters. The
argument could be made that the human characters in monster movies have always
and primarily existed to do such things, so this movie is simply following,
perhaps even honoring, that old tradition. There's an easy counter-point to
that: Should we really set the bar that low in order to hand-wave away the fact
that the representatives of our species are so dull, dim, and pointless? If this
movie's predecessor hadn't shown us an acceptable, working formula for combining
the human side of a monster movie with the monsters themselves, maybe this
complete diminishment of the human characters in this one wouldn't seem like
such a big deal. Godzilla
(the 2014 rebootnot the 1954 Japanese original or the 1998 American reboot)
did show us, though, in terms of giving us characters whose lives seemed to have
more to them than giant monsters causing destruction. That
film also gave us a sense of scale and perspective that were entirely human. The
monsters, the devastation, and the fighting were all seen from a viewpoint of
horrifying awe, because we would be as hopeless as ants against such titanic
forces of nature. This
sequel (not to be confused with the original film's 1956 American
bastardization, from which this movie gets its title) ignores all of that in
favor of a dunderheaded plot, featuring a bunch of hollow characters, that's
only an excuse to show Godzilla taking on or teaming up with three other
colossal monsters. In theory, such brawling is what we're here to see, and maybe
we could forgive the vapidity of the plot, the human characters, and the long
stretches of absent monsters if we could, you know, actually see the fighting
monsters. Co-writer/director
Michael Dougherty basically has given us the worst of both worldsthe human
and the monsterwith this movie. We don't care about the people surrounding
Godzilla and his ally/foes as characters or even in broader termsas just
people. As for the monsters, the movie cuts plenty of corners in filmmaking
terms, making all of the fights senseless, muddied sound and light shows. Five
years after the events of the first film, the Godzilla has disappeared. Monarch,
the agency that studies titans like the fire-breathing lizard, is under
government and public scrutiny. None of
that matters, because Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has built a device that
can communicate with the massive creatures. Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), an
eco-terrorist, abducts the doctor and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown),
seeking to use the device to unleash all sorts of gigantic terrors upon the
world. It's up to Emma's ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) and a group of Monarch
agents, including Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), to find Godzilla and let
it tackle the threat. We
could talk about these and the other characters, all of whom basically spout
exposition with whatever single tone Dougherty and co-screenwriter Zach Shields
have allowed them (Mark is concerned, Ishiro is stern, Emma is upset, etc.), but
the previous half of this sentence has practically exhausted the extent of their
role in this story. The main point is that the villains, looking to bring
balance to nature (for reasons that, like the movie's stances on the environment
and weapons of mass destruction, are confused at best), eventually awaken a
bunch of hibernating titans, which cause a lot of destruction. The
major ones are Mothra (a big moth, obviously), Rodan (a great, scaly vulture),
and Ghidorah (a three-headed, two-tailed, and lightning-spitting dragon from
outer space). While the humans chase after and run from the monsters, the big
guys destroy cities, secret facilities, and whatnot, while occasionallyand
ultimatelybattling each other. Aside
from a few wide shots, though, most of the destruction and fighting is seen in
shaky close-ups and with rapid edits that essentially turn the potential
spectacle into much visual and aural noise. Add to that the fact that most of
these sequences occur in the dark or under adverse weather conditions, and it
becomes obvious that the filmmakers are attempting to minimize the still clearly
underwhelming visual effects (Ghidorah conveniently brings a hurricane wherever
it goes, which just seems like a tacit admission of cutting corners on the
filmmakers' part). It's
Godzilla, so we don't exactly expect technical perfection from a series that
started with actors in rubber suits. That doesn't mean we should so readily
accept something as messy, dumb, and empty as Godzilla:
King of the
Monsters."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE,"Every time the film critic in me wants to point out its flaws, my inner 10-year-old keeps telling him to shut up."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," In the previous installment, Godzilla saved the world from a couple of MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms).  The new film brings a rematch, indeed a championship bout for the title of king, but a very unequal one, since he’ll have to face off against three so-called Titans (ancient monsters) simultaneously.  They’re the regulars from the old Toho creature-feature stable: the hydra-like Ghidorah, the pterodactyl-like Rodan, and the butterfly-esque Mothra. Setting the stage for the combat, the script posits that in the five intervening years since Godzilla’s recent reappearance, the Monarch organization has expanded enormously under Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his aide Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins)—holdovers from the first movie—to keep track of all oversized beasties; they’re joined by a newcomer, klutzy executive Sam Coleman (Thomas Middleditch).  They favor developing a rapprochement with the huge critters, while the military, led by Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn), another returnee, seems to favor eliminating them if possible. The remaining humans are newcomers.  Chief among them are the Russells, Mark (Kyle Chandler), his wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) and their spunky teen daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown).  Mark and Russell were caught up in Godzilla’s big battle in San Francisco in 2014, and their son was killed in the process.  The two responded to the tragedy differently. Emma is head of one of Monarch’s outposts, responsible with her husband for having invented a device called ORCA, which allows rudimentary communication with the beasts.  By contrast Mark has retreated to the wilderness, apparently to study the behavior of wolf packs.  Poor Madison is caught in the middle. Emma joins in Alan’s effort—though whether because she was in league with him all along or has fallen in with him recently is unclear.  They believe, in effect, that letting the creatures run amuck will somehow restore biological balance on the earth and be to the good of everyone (except the millions of people that might be killed, apparently). In any event, their plan to do this all methodically collapses when Ghidorah emerges.  The script presumes that viewers will know that in one version of this creature’s story, he’s an extraterrestrial dragon that kills planets, and in that capacity he begins instructing the liberated Rodan and Mothra to do their destructive worst.  That forces humanity to depend on the intervention of Godzilla on the one hand and Madison on the other; she carries the ORCA to Fenway Park and uses it to bring all the beasties to Boston for a big face-off. The humans here are secondary, of course, but it has to be said that the huffing, puffing Chandler and weepy, drooping Farmiga make a very tiresome pair; when Jackson remarks toward the close that he can understand why their kid would flee parents like them, you might not in agreement.  Brown isn’t as irritating, but she comes perilously close.  Watanabe exudes wisdom once more, and Middleditch does his goofy shtick fairly effectively, but the others surrounding them are mostly nondescript.  The exceptions are Whitford, who snarls out his observations in what appears to be acute discomfort (understandably, given the quality of writing) and Hinds, whose spit-and-polish delivery grows irksome. But the real absurdity in all the monster mayhem is that Dougherty turns Godzilla, who looks a good deal chunkier this time around (he appears to have overindulged during five years of inactivity), into a sort of great big E.T., whom the humans have to resurrect not once but twice in order for him to defeat Ghidorah (no spoiler here, given the movie’s very title).  This plot twist has one benefit: it allows for a sort of reverse repeat of the famous conclusion of the original 1954 movie, when the scientist goes underwater and sacrifices himself to destroy the Tokyo-stomping dinosaur.  This time Serizawa takes the plunge, not to kill Godzilla but resuscitate him with a blast of nuclear energy.  The sequence, which takes us into Godzilla’s deep-sea digs, is overall goofy, but the addition of an angelic choir to Bear McCreary’s otherwise generic score at this point is especially hilarious.  One might make a case that “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is intended to be a goofy send-up of the entire franchise series that Toho created, but apart from the stumblebum business provided by Middleditch and a few throwaway lines from Watanabe, it’s all played with an earnestness it doesn’t deserve.  The final credits offer a brief visual allusion to what’s promised (or threatened) as the next installment in the series—“Godzilla vs. Kong”—but before that match the makers might consider an intervening picture, “Godzilla Goes on a Diet.”"
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," There’s a scene in Godzilla: King of the Monsters where the titular beast ramps up his laser breath and lets loose an explosion that spreads in every direction. A few moments later, he does it again. And yet again. Much like this moment, Dougherty’s follow-up to 2014’s Godzilla will build a scene quickly as a vehicle of getting to what many audience members are in theaters for: glorious devastation. The film certainly delivers on that front, although an overabundance of kaiju action does become exhausting during the film’s 131-minute runtime. The film follows the Russell family (Chandler, Farmiga, Brown) who, after the devastation of San Francisco and the loss of one of their own, must deal with the kaiju threat to the planet in their own ways. Mother Emma (Farmiga) has taken daughter Madison (Brown) to a Monarch outpost to conduct research on a new technology that has the power to control the titanic beasts that threaten humanity while husband Mark (Chandler) is off photographing wolves after leaving the shadowy institute due to, well…let’s call them “creative differences”. All of this is to build a backstory for the Russell family that feels unnecessary, as if their fragmentation somehow injects emotion when, in reality, it is never explored enough to elicit any actual emotion. Furthermore, the ensemble cast feels unrealistic, cracking one quip after another while the world, quite literally, crumbles around them. Their flippancy feels hollow, sabotaging the melodramatic moments, of which there are a few too many.  Still, one must recognize that this is a Godzilla film and the human aspect as almost always been heavily laden with melodrama. It serves as a vehicle for the cataclysmic devastation of Godzilla and his fellow titans, which has become the real and expected star of the franchise. In that regard, the film is certainly not lacking but that doesn’t mean it’s not without issues on that front as well. Two words that sum up my frustration with Godzilla: King of the Monsters‘ action sequences: shaky cam. While a useful technique that can be utilized in clever ways, it’s become a crutch to try and make the viewer feel like the world is unsafe and that each hit has colossal weight behind it. In here, however, it feels like a distraction from the copious amounts of CGI necessary to make these fights. The problem here is that the illusion is already shattered. We viewers know that this is fantasy, so instead of trying to hide it, embrace it! Give me long shots that display these titans raging through Boston, knocking building after building over, demolishing streets en masse. I’m here for the spectacle of it all, not to feel like I’m in a food processor anytime there’s so much as a roar. A not-so-subtle commentary on global warming, climate change, and humanity’s impact on our place in the world, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is undoubtedly exciting and badass with plenty of nods to the original films – hi Mothra twins and Akira Ifukube score – but the balance between monster and human is uneven, to put it mildly.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the definition of a summer blockbuster. With enough giant monsters and catastrophic damage to make even Michael Bay jealous, you’ll relish this popcorn feature. Just don’t expect to care much along the way and maybe have some Dramamine ready."

I detect a lack of enthusiasm — if not by the showboating humans dealing with a global monster mash, then by the title star himself. Having reached the momentous age of 65 (the first Godzilla flick came out in 1954), he must be seriously thinking of retirement. Big G is marginally more involved in the fray here then he was in Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla in 2014, where he stomped San Francisco while saving the planet. But he’s still not fully engaged, it seems to me, even with attention-hogging fellow kaiju critters Mothra, Rodan and three-headed Ghidorah calling him out for most of this 132-minute monstrosity. It takes forever for Godzilla to really get his burn on; he generally seems more peeved than angry. He’s the Robert Mueller of movie behemoths. And it’s hard to tell exactly who’s munching who, since the film is so murky, it looks as though it was put through a dark blue Instagram filter. This much we know for sure: the story sucks, the direction by Michael Dougherty is strictly by the numbers and the cast members all look as if they’ve been advised by their accountants to do more paycheque gigs. There are some talented actors in this film — Sally Hawkins, Vera Farmiga, Ziyi Zhang, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn among them — but it’s hard a pull a convincing performance out of an assignment that mostly involves staring in horror at a green screen meant to represent a giant threatening bug, bat or lizard. Chandler’s animal scientist Mark Russell is the most frantic of the lot, shouting things like “We’ve gotta work fast!” as he rushes to save his preteen daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), who is actually pretty good at looking after herself. Originally used to track whales, it has unwisely been MacGyvered by Emma into a monster-summoning gadget that catches the eye of Dance’s Alan Jonah, an eco-terrorist for the hell of it. At least Jonah’s not trying to be funny, unlike Whitford’s wiseacre sonographer Dr. Rick Stanton. Various competing factions, including the U.S. military, zip around the planet — from Mexico to Antarctica, Boston to China — awakening slumbering slitherers as they tediously debate the merits of conservation vs. kaboom! in order to deal with an environmental problem more urgent than global warming. Meanwhile, Big G takes his sweet time letting everybody know who the king of the title is. He’s possibly even beefier than he was in Edwards’ Godzilla, the lead film in the current “Monsterverse” franchise, which now looks some kind of a masterpiece next to this disaster. Maybe he’s been working with the same personal trainer who bulked up Ben Affleck to play Batman. It’s unfortunate that we can’t really see Big G’s eyes beneath his ugly scaly mug and the movie’s general murk. If we could, I suspect we’d detect a certain sadness in them. He knows the fickle public has recently shifted its affection, regarding mythical creatures who belch blue flames. Yes, I’m talking about Viserion, one of the dragon pets of Daenerys Targaryen on Game of Thrones, who was killed and then revived by the Night King and turned to the cold, dark side. Even as a zombie, Viserion has more acting chops than Godzilla. That’s gotta hurt, even if your hide is tough enough to withstand an atom-bomb blast.

"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The constant shifts in pace, tone and location undermine any tension or emotional investment long before it can accumulate."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE,"I spent the entirety of King of the Monsters experiencing ASMR whenever Godzilla's signature RAWR was emitted, kicking my feet in excitement, and clapping while cackling maniacally whenever my fave monsters showed up."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," The path towards Godzilla: King of the Monsters has been, for lack of a better word, pornographic. The first all-timer trailer particularly, a blend of spellbinding monster splendour and a goosebump-boosted mix of Claire De Lune, is worthy of wet dreams. When the film opens with the titular monster’s apocalyptic roar, an aural straight-jacket of sorts, you can hear arses collapsing around you. Cherish that tingling awe; it’ll soon be replaced by (several) yawns. Michael Dougherty’s sequel and Gareth Edwards’ 2014 movie, Godzilla, are very different. The latter is an admirably restrained look at society’s mistreatment of animals and, as goes the theme of the franchise, a condemnation of nuclear warfare (the monster is the punishment we deserve). The HALO jump scene is one of the decade’s most chilling, quietly enthralling big-budget moments. But, some feel (myself included), that the lack of Godzilla himself (its gender is up-for-debate but in this universe he’s a man), cheapens the experience, shortchanged and offered MUTOs in exchange. That gripe would be inconsequential if the human drama was engaging; alas, the tragedy of killing off Bryan Cranston’s character still stings, leaving us with rudimentary puppets in a film desperately needing some grip in the big boy’s absence. The former feels like a direct response to the polarising reception over the years; a much straighter, monster-packed beat-em-up, starring a roster of Toho’s most famous Kaiju, including Mothra, Rhodan and the Dark Souls boss of this world, King Ghidora. The film takes place five years after the events in San Francisco; the story initially honing in on a family after “the day Earth discovered monsters were real”. Mark (Kyle Russell) is separated from Emma (Vera Farmiga), who lives with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). The pair work with crypto-zoological organisation Monarch in their efforts to track down Titans – giant creatures that once roamed and ruled the Earth (funnily enough, the MUTOs are now reclassified to fit in that category). When their experimental Orca device, which emits frequencies the monsters can respond to, gets into the wrong hands, all hell breaks loose. Quick run-through of other big cast members: Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins return, although one is grossly mishandled and the other sort of muddles along; Bradley Whitford as a cheeky, wise-cracking guy (if I could tell you his actual job I would) and Silicon Valley‘s Thomas Middleditch as a fumbling, squirming reactor to all things scary; Charles Dance as an eco-terrorist spun from the same yarn as Tywin Lannister; and O’Shea Jackson as a soldier with a higher survival rate than superheroes (the amount of carnage he emerges from apparently unscathed is beyond belief). What do the two Godzilla films of this decade have in common? The inability to have believable, tangible human stakes, with strongly-written characters. Penned by Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields, the decrepit script veers between the tedium of family fall-outs, banal attempts at humour that often stem from monster sex jokes (Whitford particularly suffers at the hands of this), and a pillow-smothering swath of exposition. Sentences are punctuated with a silent clunk, each and every dose of dialogue failing to evoke any emotional impact. Brown, in her first feature film outing, fares best of all. As a twitching moral compass, we can find solitude in her wavering fear as Titans clash and crash. But, like many others, there’s character flaws for days: Farmiga goes through a soporific arc that’s forecasted a mile off, and Chandler’s initial trauma is quickly forgotten in aid of him being a constant pot of answers. So, there’s not much to care for at ground-level. But hey, there’s lots of monsters this time, so it’s okay, right? Not really. Dougherty’s direction is restless; shaky cam pervades conflicts, epic scenes butchered in a smattering of cuts, mercifully stopping occasionally for one of Lawrence Sher’s wondrous shots that seem to stop time (two words: Ghidora and cross). There’s more fighting than you could ever reasonably ask for, and you may find yourself nodding in childlike-excitement at the perceptible blows, but the tussling can sometimes drown in a sea of darkness, individual textures struggling to emerge from the frustratingly-envisioned battlegrounds. Dougherty has created a colossal spectacle; yet one that feels a bit superficial and empty. Bear McCreary’s chanty score certainly instils a real sense of occasion in each bout or rise from the ocean, but the lack of real depth in the storytelling is even more pungent with the ramshackle choreography on display. There’s an amusingly-daft, pseudo-religious detour that feels closer to Kong: Skull Island‘s nuttiness; only a brief light in a tired tale. Kudos to the monster-makers: Godzilla is as imposing as he’s ever been; King Ghidorah is a paralysing, unfathomable beast (and the coolest representation of climate change you’ll see in a movie; Rhodan is a fiery, demonic nightmare; and Mothra is perhaps the most unlikely success of King of the Monsters – the Queen of the movie, entrancing in her Elysian, peaceful scale. There’s certainly entertainment to be found in this sequel, but it’s primitive; unlike the game-changing, orgasmic event the marketing had us believe (that said, it does confirm the Loch Ness Monster, which is cool)."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla: King of Monsters is a sequel to 2014’s Godzilla and a franchise continuation of Kong: Skull Island and Legendary’s MonsterVerse. Following the events in Los Angeles five years ago, the government is trying to figure out what to do about Godzilla and other Titans (kaiju), and whether the military would be a better overseer than the organization Monarch. In China, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are part of a group that witnesses the birth of a new incarnation of Mothra at a Monarch research site. Russell, after the death of her son Andrew in 2014, co-created device called Orca, which would allow Monarch to control the creatures. During Mothra’s awakening, the site is attacked by an eco-terrorist group lead by Colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), who are looking to release all the kaiju so that they can restore balance to nature. He takes Emma and Madison, which leads Monarch to bring in Emma’s ex-husband, and other co-creator of Orca, Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler). As the kaiju are released, it becomes clear that balance may not happen, and those that would be the alpha must battle it out. So it becomes a battle for dominance between home team Godzilla vs the three-headed King Ghidorah. Like the previous Godzilla movie from 2014, what makes this movie drag at parts is the emphasis on the human characters. Why these movies think we need some family reunion drama to be grounding as Godzilla fights monsters is beyond me. Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) has always stood out as the person who should have been the lead human in these movies, along with his team, which is made up of Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), Sam Coleman (Thomas Middleditch), and Dr. Ilene Chen (Zhang Ziyi). Instead, we get to watch Coach Taylor, Eleven, and Lorraine Warren keep running after each other. The Russell family drama comes across as tedious and boring in a movie that has some much more interesting stuff going on. Why can’t we just focus on the scientists and mythologist? In fact, the human element is so irrelevant that the terrorist group that started this whole movie off doesn’t even play a role in the last act. Probably because they are going to reoccur in the sequel to this sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong, which is due next year—but it still feels like a forced dynamic to make Emma’s storyline more interesting. Which it doesn’t do because again, her Thanos speech about overpopulation is just redundant at this point. The other weird thing about this movie and honestly all other Godzilla movies made in the States is just how pro-U.S. military it is. A lot of movies these days are made with military help, but there is something very strange about watching the American military being the people who help Godzilla when Godzilla is a metaphor for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I wish the film had taken a bit more from Shin Godzilla in that regard and made more of an effort to incorporate additional Japanese characters into the movie besides the one. I also wish the film didn’t feel the need to put in the clunky humor that it does; I get that this is a “PG-13” movie but it felt cheap when we’re supposed to believe that the person saying it is a respected scientist. Also, it could have done a lot better by Sally Hawkins’ character. Still, I had a lot of fun watching Godzilla: King of the Monsters: all the kaiju looked great, but especially Queen Mothra, first of her name. Thankfully, unlike the 2014 movie, we get to see much more of the kaiju fighting each other and Godzilla using more of his iconic blue lightning. King Ghidorah looked amazing, and I appreciated how they had a lot of fun giving the heads personalities of their own. If you are a fan of monster movies, this is one of the best I’ve seen in recent years. It leaves us with a great set up for 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong, the real election we need to worry about."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," The latest installment of the Godzilla franchise, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, has roared into cinemas as summer blockbuster season has gotten into full swing and it’s an action movie of epic proportions.  But then again, if you’re here to see Godzilla clashing with some classic monsters, that probably won’t hinder your enjoyment of the at-times spectacular visuals. As implied at by the title, there’s a whole line-up of impressive titans taking up screen-time. In addition to the eponymous movie monster, we’ve got the horrifying three-headed dragon King Ghidorah, the winged atomic-breather Rodan and the heroic, psychedelically-coloured Mothra. Picking up five years after the events of the last film, where the Russell family tragically lost their son Andrew, parents Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler) are estranged. While Mark is off in the wilderness, Emma has dedicated her life to Monarch, the shadowy organization tasked with protecting Godzilla and other titans around the world. She is also teaching their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) the ropes and giving her the lowdown on a secret device she has created, the Orca, to try and communicate with the monsters, and maybe even bring them to heel. Unfortunately, and somewhat predictably, some bad guys get wind of her machine, and it’s not long before they break into Monarch’s top-secret facility and steal it, while taking Emma and Madison hostage. Led by eco-terrorist Jonah, played with relish by Game of Thrones’ Charles Dance, these baddies are intent on awakening dormant titans around the globe to trigger catastrophic events that will wipe out humankind and…save the world from ourselves? Let’s be honest, the plot development solely exists as an excuse to see Godzilla face off against the other titans and fans are likely to be blown away by the ambitious action set-pieces. The human members of the cast are less well served by a script that feels wholly made up of clunky one-liners or deadened exposition. However, the impressively assembled actors gamely soldier on. There's no dearth of acting talent on display - from Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown making her film debut, to Wolf of Wall Street's Kyle Chandler, beloved West Wing alum Bradley Whitford, The Shape of Water's Oscar-nominee Sally Hawkins, Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch and Straight Outta Compton's O'Shea Jackson Jr. © RTÉ 2024.

"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It probably won't be the worst blockbuster you see this summer, but considering how well the previous film worked in the face of expectations, it will probably go down as one of the more disappointing."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," No podemos negar que uno de los monstruos y personajes mÃ¡s famosos en la historia del cine es Godzilla. La criatura ha protagonizado mÃ¡s de 30 pelÃ­culas desde 1954 y ahora llega una nueva entrega. Pero, Â¿la pelÃ­cula Godzilla 2 estÃ¡ realmente a la altura del rey de los monstruos? La apariciÃ³n de este ser solo hizo que la agencia criptozoolÃ³gica Monarch buscara otros titanes mÃ­ticos alrededor del mundo. Y bien dicen que la curiosidad matÃ³ al gato, porque con todas las investigaciones, ahora tres nuevos gigantes han despertado: Mothra, Rodan y Rey Ghidorah. Estos seres atraerÃ¡n a Godzilla y ahora todos pelearÃ¡n por la supremacÃ­a, dejando la existencia de la especie humana al borde de la extinciÃ³n. Si en 2014 estuvieron decepcionados porque casi no saliÃ³ este titÃ¡n colosal, entonces la pelÃ­cula Godzilla 2 los harÃ¡ gritar de la emociÃ³n pies podemos verlo en todo su esplendor. Pero hay que ser honestos, esta secuela no serÃ­a la misma sin los otros tres grandes monstruos. Es por eso que la pelÃ­cula Godzilla 2 es un impactante despliegue de los antagonistas mÃ¡s icÃ³nicos que ha tenido el rey de los monstruos en su historia. Los efectos especiales son sorprendentes, pues las peleas (las cuales son acompaÃ±adas con un increÃ­ble soundtrack) entre estas bestias son algo digno de ver en pantalla grande. Sin embargo, no todo es monstruos gigantes luchando hasta la muerte. La pelÃ­cula Godzilla 2 tambiÃ©n tiene una historia enfocada en humanos. VerÃ¡s todo un drama que gira entorno a la doctora Emma Russel (Vera Farmiga), su hija Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) y su esposo Mark (Kyle Chandler). Su participaciÃ³n pasa a un segundo plano y son solo un mero pretexto para explicar por quÃ© Godzilla es el gran salvador de la Tierra. Esto es lamentable, pues es bastante desperdicio de talento. La pelÃ­cula Godzilla 2 cumple por completo en cuanto a los monstruos; de hecho, los mejores momentos de la cinta son cuando ellos salen en pantalla. Pero la verdad es que Hollywood deberÃ­a meterle un poco mÃ¡s de ganas. Sobre todo, si tomamos en cuenta que se trata de un nuevo universo que se extenderÃ¡ con varias secuelas y un proyecto tan grande no puede solo sostenerse de grandes efectos. AsÃ­ que si no eres fan de esta criatura o de los kaijus, o tus exigencias en cine son muy altas, entonces la pelÃ­cula Godzilla 2 no es para ti. Esta pelÃ­cula estÃ¡ dedicada a los fanÃ¡ticos del monstruo y a todos aquellos que amen ver grandes peleas con efectos especiales."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," Michael Bay, director de la saga Transformers, recibió un neologismo en honor a su estilo: bayhem, un juego de palabras con mayhem (caos). Se define como “el concepto cinemático de explotar cosas por los aires a gran escala, en cámara lenta y (generalmente) en el ocaso”, y también como “una palabra compuesta que describe el inevitable caos incendiario usado por Michael Bay en lugar de personajes y guión”. Godzilla II: El rey de los monstruos es una muestra de que Bay hizo escuela. A grandes rasgos, aquí se alternan dos tipos de escenas. Por un lado, las que transcurren en interiores de bunkers, aviones y submarinos, protagonizadas por científicos y militares intentando explicarnos lo que ocurrió o lo que va a ocurrir. Por otro, las de “exteriores”, con gigantescos monstruos destruyendo a mansalva, masacrando humanos y peleándose entre sí. Gracias a sus diálogos reiterativos, las primeras marcan una tregua en el aturdimiento sonoro y visual que imponen las segundas. Hay una mínima historia que justifica la acción. Cinco años después de los hechos ocurridos en Godzilla (2014), la empresa Monarch está estudiando la presencia de unas dos decenas de “titanes” distribuidos en estado de hibernación por todo el mundo. A contramano de lo que suele ocurrir en la ficción (y la realidad), se trata de una corporación todopoderosa pero de naturaleza noble: protege a las criaturas cuando el gobierno estadounidense quiere aniquilarlas. En ese debate están cuando un terrorista ecológico se las ingenia para empezar a liberar a los monstruos, con la idea de barajar y dar de nuevo: el caos y la matanza producidos por los gigantes restablecería el equilibrio al planeta. Los humanos (entre ellos, Millie Bobby Brown, la estrella de Stranger Things, en su debut cinematográfico) son casi impotentes ante el poderío de los bichos, pero Godzilla está ahí para defenderlos. Así, se reiteran las situaciones en que todo parece a punto de terminar cuando, zas, aparece Godzilla al rescate. También se repiten las tomas de humanos mirando hacia arriba, boquiabiertos de asombro. Es cierto que los monstruos -extraídos de algunos de los 32 filmes de la saga japonesa- son impactantes, y en especial Ghidorah, el dragón de tres cabezas. Pero el recuerdo de los dragones de Game of Thrones está demasiado fresco: la comparación de escenas de acción de la serie con algunas de esta película es inevitable, y no favorece a Godzilla II. Acción. EE.UU.-Japón, 2019. 132’, SAM 13. De: Michael Dougherty. Con: Vera Farmiga, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Millie Bobby Brown. Salas: Atlas Flores, Cinemark Caballito, Hoyts Dot."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Warts and all, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the biggest movie of the summer. That's not a box office prediction or quality judgment, merely an acknowledgment that it has a sense of scale and scope likely to be unsurpassed by anything else opening this season. To be fair, Avengers: Endgame was (save for its final battle) an intentionally and knowingly smaller-scaled affair compared to Avengers: Infinity War, Aquaman or Transformers: Age of Extinction. Second, while I have serious issues with Michael Dougherty's $170 million-budgeted monster mash, issues which I will detail in this exact review you're reading right now, my eight-year-old son exclaimed, more than once, that it was the best movie he'd ever seen. What did I think of it? Well... For what it's worth, it's a more surface-level entertaining movie than Gareth Edwards' Godzilla, but you'll miss the sense of scale and Spielberg-ian awe of that 2014 flick. King of the Monsters is a little more focused on more conventional plotting and character arcs. It plays more like a rock-n-roll monster movie than a quasi-religious end-of-times myth. I liked the characters not because the script was exceptionally well-written (it's a lot more complicated than it needs to be), but because I liked the actors. Since we have the likes of (among others) Ken Watanabe, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Aisha Hinds, Thomas Middlemarch, Sally Hawkins and O'Shea Jackson Jr. working us through the plot and character beats, you won't be bored in between monster fights. The plot involves an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) kidnapping Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) in order to procure a device that can essentially talk to the various ""titans"" that are either still in hiding or being kept at bay in government facilities. After the initial kidnapping/heist (one of two unnecessary machine gun massacres in this otherwise kid-friendly flick), Monarch calls in Emma's estranged Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) to help with the search, and the chase is on. Can Monarch track down the bad guys before they use Emma's ""Echo"" device to unleash the titans in a skewed plot to save the world by dooming humanity? And just who would win in a fight between Godzilla (playing himself) and King Ghidorah (ditto)? No fault to Chandler, who is perfectly fine, but Mark Russell is a literal walking/talking embodiment of the whole Mary Sue/Gary Stu phenomenon. His character has all the answers, all the right ideas, all the right questions and every single moment of revelation, discovery and intuitive thinking. He talks over everyone else, offers contradictory opinions to every single government agent and scientific expert and is never wrong. Putting aside the issues with a rough-and-tumble white guy overruling and lording over a bunch of ""not a white guy"" characters, it's comical to the point where it dilutes the drama. Otherwise, the human folks (especially Watanabe and Whitford) are pleasant and entertaining, even if one of my favorites dies really early. Now that the pesky human drama/plot stuff is out of the way, how is the film as a spectacle? Well, yeah, it pretty much works on that level. Aside from a prologue which shows off the title character right away, the film takes its time revealing its monsters and letting them get down to business. But the whole film has a sense of scale and scope that brings to mind Independence Day (a blockbuster disaster flick with unusually well-sketched characters which is why we still talk about it 23-years later). Alas, aside from a few early beats, the film is mostly from the point-of-view of our protagonists, so in its own way it's as narratively claustrophobic as Avengers: Endgame. But the sights and sounds are a wonder to behold. Yes, the monster fights are mostly in rainstorms, blizzards and fiery wreckage, but you can still make out the beats and choreography. This isn't quite Kong: Skull Island (still the best of these Legendary/WB monster-verse movies) with big fights in broad daylight, but the visual style (not unlike Batman Begins) makes the fights seem more mythic and majestic compared to Pacific Rim: Uprising or Rampage (both of which I enjoy on their own terms). There is a certain restraint to the action, at least until the third act when we get a couple reels of ""trailer shots"" in one super-smack down. And, yes, we do cut away maybe too frequently to the human drama, but at least there is human drama worth cutting to. It's not apples-to-apples, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters makes a Faustian bargain not unlike what we saw with Justice League, The Incredible Hulk and Man of Steel, offering more crowd-pleasing and general audience-pleasing action movies while losing some of the ""nothing else like this"" distinctiveness and mythic awe of the less well-received (by consumers) incarnations. King of the Monsters will please those who thought Godzilla was lacking in monster action and conventional characters, but by default it's also a more conventional movie. I still think Kong: Skull Island is the best ""have your cake and eat it too"" movie of the trilogy thus far, but it's to Warner Bros. and Legendary's credit that this Godzilla sequel feels different from the Kong Kong prequel and the previous Godzilla movie. All of that aside, it looks great, it sounds great, I wish I had seen it in IMAX, and it's my son's new favorite movie of all time."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," 
Officially the longest-running film franchise in history, Toho Studiosâ gargantuan, Atomic Age metaphor-on-steroids has become a global pop culture staple. Thirty-four movies, Saturday morning cartoons, sugary breakfast cereals, memorably comic cameos in One Crazy Summer and Pee-weeâs Big Adventure, and even a late-Seventies stint as a member of the Marvel Comics Universe have ensured the big galoot a permanent place in the pantheon of sine qua non monsterdom. As they say, itâs Godzillaâs world, we just live in it.
 
Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the third entry into Legendary Picturesâ MonsterVerse brand â following 2014's Godzilla and 2017's Kong: Skull Island â and while lifelong fans of âZilla will be rightfully impressed by the epic kaiju smackdowns on CGI display here, much of the filmâs fun is overrun by a combination of overlong exposition, ham-fisted dialogue, and some genuinely confusing editing. Youâre never quite sure at any given point where, exactly, the human characters are, what exactly theyâre doing, or what the fuck that sudden, off-putting plot twist that just happened means. That actually makes this one of the more faithful homages to Tohoâs âHeisei eraâ Godzilla movies, particularly Godzilla vs. Destoroyah and Godzilla vs. Biollante, which â while enormously entertaining â  still suffered from the same sense of perplexing plotting.
 
Recounting the tortuous mash-up of the filmâs human characters doing inane things ineptly that serves as the movie's plot is almost beside the point, but here goes. In the cataclysmic aftermath of the clash between Godzilla and the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) in director Gareth Edwardsâ initial 2014 reboot, the secretive cryptozoological Monarch organization under heroic scientist and occasional Zen poet Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Watanabe) has located and locked down more âTitansâ across the globe. Monarch member Dr. Emma Russell (Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Stranger Things' Brown) are estranged from dad Mark (Chandler) after the death of their son in the previous film. Dr. Russell has developed ORCA, a method of communicating with the Titans (the pupal Mothra, initially) but is interrupted by the arrival of nihilist-cum-ecoterrorist and Snidely Whiplash tribute act Jonah Alan (Dance) who plans to awaken all of the Titans to ârestore balance to the Earth.â Meanwhile, the military plans to harness the Titans for, yâknow, warfare purposes, but are readying the monster-slaying oxygen destroyer (first deployed in the 1954 original, Gojira). As the Titans are unleashed and head by air, land, and sea to new alpha-God King Ghidorah, humanity scrambles and chaos reigns while Madison embarks on her own mission, sans Mom and Dad. Itâs a mess of a storyline. Characters with only the vaguest of backstories come and go and yell and die noble deaths.
 
But letâs be honest: Unless youâre a grad student writing your thesis on the geopolitical and environmental thematics spread throughout Godzillaâs extensive oeuvre, youâre here to see giant monsters knock the stuffing out of each other while laying waste to mankindâs manifold metropolises. In this regard, Godzilla: King of the Monsters does not disappoint. Director Dougherty (Krampus, Trick âr Treat) corrals a menagerie of series regulars: the Pteranodon-esque, volcano-born Rodan; psychedelically luminous Mothra as the Big Green Guyâs natural ally; and perpetual nemesis King Ghidorah, a triple-headed, lightning-spitting dragon with a wingspan of what looks to be a quarter-mile or more. Thereâs also brief appearances from the MUTOs, a mutated woolly mammoth-thing, and what looks suspiciously like creepy-crawly, 1960s-era arachnid Kumonga. All-out kaiju brawls ensue, and they are unsurprisingly awesome and the real reason to catch this movie on an IMAX if you can.
 
Bear McCrearyâs bombastic score occasionally riffs on composer Akira Ifukubeâs haunting, martial music from the classic Godzilla films of the 1950s and 1960s, but it, like the entirety of Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels overburdened and unsure of itself. Hereâs hoping Legendaryâs 2020 release of Godzilla vs. King Kong will improve on â or at least approach â the formula IshirÅ Honda and Toho Studios mastered over half a century ago.

"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Despite featuring two of cinema’s biggest stars (literally), Warner Bros.’ budding MonsterVerse — a franchise built around the characters of Godzilla and King Kong — inexplicably hasn’t gotten a lot of fanfare. This, despite the fact that 2014’s “Godzilla,” a reboot of the classic monster story, earned nearly $530 million at the box office and was generally well-received, save for some quibbles about the human story. Five years later, you might expect the sequel, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” to have addressed those concerns. Does it come out roaring — a balanced mix of fire-breathing action and story that moves you, efficiently, from one kaiju bout to the next? Unfortunately, “Monsters” tries a little too hard to correct course from what some saw as its predecessor’s flaws. The movie does not roar, but rather emits only a serviceable yelp. Gareth Edwards, who directed the 2014 “Godzilla,” was criticized for waiting too long to reveal the titular Japanese movie monster in that film. In contrast, the new film’s director, Michael Dougherty (“Krampus”), seems to revel in wreaking havoc in the kaiju sandbox, showing off every last trick and ability possessed by Godzilla and the other classic movie monsters that are reintroduced here. But instead of figuring out a compelling story for the non-skyscraper-sized characters, Dougherty and co-screenwriter Zach Shields seem to be counting on the fact that you’ll take a bathroom break during the exposition and return in time for the next battle. The premise is this: Monarch, a shadowy cryptozoological agency that studies such ancient, ­physics-defying monsters as Godzilla, has discovered that more and more of these creatures, known as titans, exist, and that they are entombed in some of Earth’s farthest reaches. As a former Monarch scientist — and the estranged husband of a current one (Vera Farmiga) — Kyle Chandler brings his signature gruff wit and divorced-dad energy to the job of co-parenting a daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) and mourning the loss of a son (whose death is shown in flashback). Chandler and Farmiga’s inane actions, contrived in service of the plot and nothing else, fall apart under close scrutiny. And Brown is underused — delivering shrieks in the face of the story’s twists and turns, but not much more. There are also haphazard attempts to weave in the themes of government interference, climate change and East Asian mythology as motivation for some of the characters. Ken Watanabe, reprising his role as a scientist, is the only returning character who is given anything to chew on here. But any fresh emotional weight that his character carries is undercut by the memory of his comically underwritten role in the 2014 film, in which the actor had little to do except pronounce the name “Godzilla” in a Japanese accent. As the film’s subtitle hints, several of these titans — who include such favorites as the flying reptile Rodan and the queen of the monsters, Mothra — emerge ready to square off in a frenzied free-for-all to crown an alpha. The movie establishes its visual tone early with the awakening of Godzilla’s archenemy Ghidorah, a three headed dragon-like creature who rises from the Antarctic ice. The two kaiju duke it out in a visually rich fight that maintains the pleasingly old-school aesthetic of the original Godzilla’s man-in-a-rubber-suit costuming, giving this CGI beast a very humanlike nature. For a popcorn movie, all of this might be enough. Despite its plot holes, the film delivers thrilling action in spades. But hardcore devotees of the Godzilla mythology might prefer Japan’s most recent live-action spin on the monster: “Shin Godzilla,” a 2016 film that balanced a laser-focused “Veep”-esque story of government buffoonery with jaw-dropping destruction. Stay tuned for the next entry in the Warner Bros. MonsterVerse: “Godzilla vs. King Kong” (scheduled for release in March 2020). You can put money on this: The showdown between two figures of movie lore will deliver the visual goods. As to whether the next installment also manages to remind us why those creatures matter in the first place, cross your fingers, but maybe don’t hold your breath."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," It’s been a bit since moviegoers had the chance to catch up with Godzilla, five years in fact, which in cinematic franchise time feels like at least a few decades. In other words, it’s understandable if you go into “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” a little rusty on just what went down in Tokyo and San Francisco back in 2014. But “Godzilla: King of the Monsters "" is a sequel in the loosest possible sense that requires minimal recall from the audience, which is likely a good thing for those whose brains have been overloaded with “Game of Thrones,” ’'Avengers” and “Star Wars” minutiae and mythology. Worry not, Godzilla is here to provide some old-fashioned summer spectacle, no CliffsNotes required. The filmmakers have even helpfully shifted the focus to another family entirely for this installment, from the inert Brodys (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen) to the Russells, a now-broken family of scientists who lived in San Francisco during the 2014 attack. There are a few holdovers though, mostly employees of Monarch, the secret multinational organization that studies the titans, like Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins), who are being accused of hiding Godzilla from world governments who’d rather just destroy them all. As far as the newcomers go, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) also works for Monarch and has developed a machine called the Orca, which simulates the sounds of the various titans. She believes this can be used to help manage them. Emma lives with her 14-year-old daughter, Madison (“Stranger Things’” Millie Bobby Brown in her first major film role), who is precociously enchanted by her mother’s work and admires the primordial creatures. Madison’s father Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler, whose intensity is at level 10 for most of the movie) is not really in the picture, having left after the San Francisco incident, but is drawn back in when Emma and Madison (and the Orca) are kidnapped by some militant eco-terrorists led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance). This group wants to use the titans, of which there are now “17 and counting” including a pretty dazzling Mothra and a less-enchanting three-headed “Monster Zero,” to help reset the planet and reverse climate change and overpopulation. There’s some convenient explanation of why the radiation from the titans actually helps revitalize vegetation, which, like many of the silly plot devices in this movie, you kind of just let slide. That said, anyone currently watching “Chernobyl” on HBO will likely be very stressed out about the amount of radiation all the humans are likely absorbing just by being in proximity to all these creatures. Michael Dougherty has taken the directing reins this time, from Gareth Edwards, and has done a fine job capturing the grandness of the titans, keeping the action coherent and balancing the human element thanks to a terrific cast that also includes O’Shea Jackson Jr. and Thomas Middleditch. His script is also pleasingly light and often funny, although Bradley Whitford’s Dr. Stanton goes a little overboard trying to be the comic relief. But even that is easy to give a pass to. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is turn-your-brain-off summer fun, and doesn’t need to be anything more than that. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a Warner Bros. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for “sequences of monster action violence and destruction, and for some language.” Running time: 131 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," Very few franchises in the world have had the kind of staying power that Godzilla has. Rebooted, reimagined, reinterpreted on different continents and in different languages, Godzilla has long been one of Japan's most recognizable cultural exports over the course of sixty-five years and thirty-five films. The vast bulk of those films have been Japanese language films, but over the last twenty years, Hollywood has taken a couple of stabs at recreating Big G's impact to varying degrees of success. In 1998, disaster specialist Roland Emmerich took the first stab at designing a Godzilla feature for American audiences. That film famously flopped after rejiggering a lot of the series' original ideas and making some crucial thematic mistakes. A lot of monster movie fans figured that was it, no more Big G in the U.S. of A., but then in 2014, we got another look at what an American Godzilla film could be with Gareth Edwards' (Monsters) Godzilla. A significantly more accomplished feature, Edwards' vision of the monster film took the basics from Toho's original – ancient beast awakened by nuclear testing destroys major city – and created a big budget spectacle that, while not exactly a huge success, at least showed that an American Godzilla film wasn't a non-starter. It could be done. The major issue many fans had with that version was that the Big Guy seemed like he was playing second fiddle in his own movie. Rather than focusing on giant monster action, the film played around with the characters back stories and seemed to spend more time with Godzilla's adversaries, the newly introduced MUTOs, than with our titular kaiju. As a result, the film wasn't exactly panned, but it was roundly criticized for misinterpreting what audiences look for in a Godzilla film. Producers Legendary Entertainment took note, and made sure that they'd not make that mistake again. And now we have Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It is now five years after Godzilla and the MUTOs destroyed San Francisco and he's gone back into hiding, but the world's eyes are now open, and these monsters – referred to as Titans – are a reality that the new world must face. An organization called Monarch, introduced in the 2014 film, has taken on the job of monitoring and securing these seventeen Titans, all of whom are currently either in deep hibernation or, like Godzilla, in hiding. But not for long. Led by Dr. Serizawa (Watanabe Ken), Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), Monarch is determined to keep tabs on these beasts, while the government fights to take control of the organization so they can have them destroyed. While this debate rages behind closed legislative doors, a new face appears, Col. Jonah Alan, a retired military officer turned eco-terrorist who traffics in Titan DNA to fund his army of mercenaries. He kidnaps Dr. Russell and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and Russell's device, the Orca, designed to communicate with the Titans, and the soon the beasts begin to awaken with cataclysmic consequences. First to awaken is the larval Titan, Mothra, an enormous moth-like creature, who escapes her hibernation spot and immediately cocoons beneath a waterfall in China. While Mothra does her thing, the mercenaries decide to head to Monarch's Antarctic Outpost 32 – shout out to horror nerds who oughta recognize that number from John Carpenter's The Thing – where one of the biggest, baddest Titans sleeps, the three-headed dragon known here as Monster Zero (and eventually called by his more recognizable honorific, King Ghidorah). Once Ghidorah awakens, all hell breaks loose, as Godzilla resurfaces to battle the King for dominance and to attempt to take back his place as the king of the monsters. From there on out it's pretty much non-stop Titan-on-Titan mayhem as Godzilla, Ghidorah, and eventually the fire god Rodan, and Mothra battle it out for the survival of the world and every living organism on it. I mentioned earlier that Legendary Entertainment must have taken noted after their first attempt received a lukewarm reception, and game plan for part two was to give the people what they want, and they do that in spades. Brought on to helm King of the Monsters is writer/director Mike Dougherty who directed both 2015's Krampus and 2007's Trick R' Treat, and also wrote big budget actioners like Superman Returns, and X2: X-Men United (the best of the original X-Men trilogy). With this sequel, Dougherty has made one of the most exciting, and strangely unique Godzilla features in many years. By focusing on the action, he gives the audience what they want, eschewing the traditional Japanese Godzilla structure, which has in recent years trended more toward satirizing bureaucracy. In fact, it's almost a direct slam against Toho's most recent live action Shin Godzilla, which was about eighty percent boardroom meetings and twenty percent kaiju action. Even the recent anime feature trilogy focused far more on the strategy of defeating Godzilla that it did on action, which baffled me as it seems that if there's any go-for-broke medium for kaiju, it should be animation where budget is less of a constraint. Godzilla: King of the Monsters still features strategy sessions, and plenty of brainstorming, but never at the expense of inventive, massive action sequences. While much of the principal cast of the first film is gone, it was nice to see Watanabe and Hawkins return for this second stab at a crowd pleaser. In addition to the above mentioned additions, King of the Monsters also brings on Kyle Chandler as Mark Russell, Emma's estranged husband and Madison's father, who is still reeling from the San Francisco attack that claimed their son, Zhang Ziyi and Bradley Whitford as Monarch team members, along with smaller parts for O'Shea Jackson and a badass Aisha Hinds as military officers determined to save the world. What Dougherty does to change direction of the franchise is exactly the shot in the arm Godzilla needed after the unnecessarily dull first film. Having seen the relative success of Kong: Skull Island, which takes place in the same universe four decades earlier, and its big action set pieces, Dougherty and his co-writer Zach Shields (Krampus), managed to create a story that delivers some intense emotional beats among the Russell family, but also knows what put the butts in seats. Big freakin' monsters beating each other to a pulp. There isn't a ton of plot to speak of once the above-mentioned developments take place, and all of the synopsized elements I mention take place within the first thirty minutes or so. For the last hour and a half we are either watching these glorious Titans fight, chasing them with the Monarch team, or devising ways to help and/or destroy them. There are several plot elements that appear that will be surprises to casual fans, but will definitely delight the kaiju aficionados in the audience. Lots of nods to the rich history of Godzilla and the other titans in the film, let us know that someone did their homework, and those touches will make old school fans smile. Everything from reimagined music cues to hints at Titan origin stories that aren't fully explored are neat little Easter Eggs for those in the know. With a third film pitting Godzilla and Kong against one another already in post-production, Legendary took a huge gamble on this franchise, and they really hit the nail on the head with this one. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the all out action bash of the summer, and it's going to be a tough one to beat for this kaiju fan. If this is the future of American Monster-verse movies, I say, let them fight!"
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," One of the various ways that “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” director Michael Dougherty establishes his bona fides as a card-carrying creature-feature geek is with his soundtrack picks. Not only does Dougherty strategically employ snippets of the original Japanese “Gojira” theme, he also sets the movie’s credit sequence to a cover of Blue Oyster Cult’s hard-rocking ’70s novelty “Godzilla.” If only the BOC refrain of “Oh, no, there goes Tokyo!” could have been updated to include a Boston shout-out. Apologies for the spoiler, but you heard right: Among the film’s great, kidult-enabling highlights are scenes of the Hub — and Fenway in particular — hosting a spectacularly destructive multi-behemoth showdown. (And here we thought downhill skating was a nutty sight at the ballpark.) It’s one more viscerally charged thrill in an already stacked beastie-palooza, as Godzilla’s current Hollywood handlers work to outdo their 2014 franchise launch by populating the sequel with classic sparring partners: Mothra, Rodan, and hydra-headed King Ghidorah. Diehards will recognize elements of the quaint 1968 Toho studios import “Destroy All Monsters” underneath the digitized flash. Cynics, meanwhile, will rightly peg this as another imitator of Marvel’s cross-pollination template, especially in its recurring teases for “Godzilla vs. Kong,” coming next March. Whichever, the seat-rattling, super-size mayhem in this latest “Godzilla” is fantastic — emphasis on “fan.” Regrettably, though, the human-scale action featuring Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown (“Stranger Things”) borders on inane. And to those who shrug that they wouldn’t have expected otherwise, we say: You should have. The franchise’s first installment got strong dramatic contributions from such supporting players as Bryan Cranston, even if it couldn’t sustain that tone throughout. Here, fallout from that story tangles Chandler and Farmiga’s estranged zoologist couple and their daughter (Brown) in a mad eco-terrorist plot to revive dormant titans around the globe, a development that’s simultaneously overthought and undercooked. We get it — the filmmakers are looking to legitimize their high-concept monster mash with weighty character motivation. But not only does the scheme feel awkwardly cribbed from the ecological-reboot threat just chronicled in “Avengers” — couldn’t they have come up with a simpler, less contrived story trigger? — the thinly scripted mastermind barely evinces a screw loose. By the way, who’s supposed to be baby-sitting Brown’s spunky kid-tagonist while she’s pilfering classified gadgets and playing creature whisperer? The ludicrous ’tween escape artists of “Jurassic Park” and “Jurassic World” have never been half this resourceful. It’s disappointing that Brown gets such distractingly silly material to play, given our eagerness to see her branch out from her terrific work on Netflix. You’ll just have to look to your own effects-jazzed inner child to find a kid who’s relatable here. Fingers crossed that “Godzilla vs. Kong” finds a way to deliver dramatic impact equal to its nostalgic punch. Directed by Michael Dougherty. Written by Max Borenstein, Dougherty, and Zach Shields. Starring Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe. Boston theaters, suburbs, Jordan’s IMAX Reading and Natick. 131 minutes. PG-13 (sequences of monster action violence and destruction, some language)."

"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Director and co-writer Michael Dougherty gathers an impressive cast — it includes Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Bradley Whitford and, perhaps most impressively, Millie Bobby Brown. And all of them, to their credit, seem like they're trying to take the whole thing seriously. The film is a sequel to the 2014 ""Godzilla,"" and a MonsterVerse cousin of ""Kong: Skull Island."" It begins with a look back to action surrounding the 2014 movie, in which Godzilla, on his way to saving the world, trashes San Francisco. Killed in the action was a small boy — the son of Dr. Emma Russell (Farmiga) and her husband, Mark (Chandler). They had invented a gizmo that allows for communication among the monsters, but now, five years later, they've split up; their daughter, Madison (Brown), lives with her mother. (The parents reacted differently to their loss: She dove headlong into learning more about monsters and their behavior, while he drank too much.) Emma is successfully testing the machine, called the Orca, on a larval Mothra when Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), a former military man, bursts in with a crew and takes Emma and Madison hostage. After what he's seen in war, he's pretty much done with humanity and is happy to let the monsters wipe out the world to initiate a massive do-over. Meanwhile Monarch, the group that has secretly been keeping tabs on monsters for years (we learned this in the 2014 film), and knows where Godzilla is, despite his seeming to have retired and disappeared, learns of Alan's plan and swoops in to grab Mark to help find Orca and presumably save the day. A battle is brewing, you see — there are 17 creatures lurking around the world. Emma and Mark have different ideas about the monsters and what their place in the world is, if any, which further complicates things. There are some shifting allegiances, and the next thing you know Monster Zero, better known as King Ghidorah, is awakened. This is a bad thing — it has three heads, which grow back if they're chopped off, and evidently in ancient times it was Godzilla's rival. Oh yeah, him. Dougherty doesn't wait as long as the last film to show Godzilla (that took an hour; here we get a murky look about a half-hour in), but once again Earth's favorite monster spends an awful lot of time off-camera. And what about when he's on? Godzilla is sort of the Incredible Hulk of the monster world — he seems like he's on our side, but his brand of salvation is so random and flailing that at times you wonder if it's worth the trouble. There are some good ideas here, including the family drama. But they're muddled and messy, often either fizzling out or just leading nowhere. Brown is quite good as Madison, a confused kid who isn't sure which parent to side with. That confusion is understandable, but Dougherty makes the adults' motivations so hard to follow that Madison's actions are at times also somewhat inexplicable. But enough of the actual acting and plot and such. You come to a Godzilla movie for the epic fights, and on that front, Dougherty delivers. The battles arent as incoherent as an “Avengers” movie, though at times it's a little hard to follow what's going on. King Ghidorah is an impressively menacing creature, and Mothra is an unexpected, if lethal, charmer. Lots and lots of stuff gets destroyed. At one point a television reporter refers to the mayhem unfolding as the greatest disaster in history. While it's taking place, that’s probably true. But if one thing is clear — and ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is already on the books for March 13, 2020 — it's that in these movies, there's always more to come."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE,"  Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla was divisive, but I liked that it made strong choices. Yes, the characters and plotting were secondary to Godzilla, but the film was very focused on holding the tension and making the payoff worth the wait. But some audiences weren’t too crazy about the whole waiting thing, and you can see how Kong: Skull Island, the next movie in Legendary’s “monsterverse”, is a bit of a course correction as it doesn’t shy away from showing the monsters and piling on the mayhem. Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters, tries to split the difference, giving Godzilla the reverence he deserves while also filling up his movie with a lot of extraneous material. Unfortunately, the result is a flabby, bloated picture where the only thing that kind of works are the kaiju fights.   Picking up five years after the events of Edwards’ movie, the world has seen the rise of “titans”, monsters like Godzilla who are being tracked by the organization Monarch, which is currently in conflict with the military that wants to eradicate the titans rather than co-exist with them. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is working on a device, the ORCA, to communicate and control the titans, but she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), who wants to use the ORCA to wake up the dormant titans and cleanse the planet. Monarch, now a bigger organization with more supporting characters, brings in Emma’s estranged husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), who worked on the ORCA with her, to track the device and get it back. Mark agrees so he can rescue their daughter, but it becomes a worldwide chase as King Ghidorah, a three-headed beast, awakens and begins summoning the other titans to him. Humanity’s only hope becomes the big guy, Godzilla.   When the movie is all about Godzilla it seems like Dougherty is at his most comfortable. Although there’s far too many supporting weather effects like snow and rain that kind of obscure the action, you can still get a great picture in the wide shots of the kaiju doing battle. If you’re a fan of Godzilla, Ghidorah, Rodan, and Mothra, then it’s a thrill to see them rendered as blockbuster creatures rather than B-movie monsters. However, when Dougherty goes in for closer shots, he loses not only his geography but also his pacing. There’s this weird need to keep cutting back to the humans (none of whom we care about), and while the humans help provide a sense of scale, they also break the tension of the brawl. Additionally, the fight choreography isn’t all that impressive. There’s no unforgettable shot like Godzilla breathing atomic breath down a monster’s throat.   The pacing is a problem throughout the film. Even though King of the Monsters is only eight minutes longer than 2014’s Godzilla, it feels much longer because Dougherty doesn’t have Edwards’ knack for pacing and building tension on this scale. Again, perhaps that’s a reaction to the backlash to Edwards’ movie, but King of the Monsters vindicates Edwards’ decision to methodically ramp up the pressure. The sequel just piles on lots of stuff, and even though this is a great cast, they don’t really get to build characters or have relationships. They just get shuttled from one Monarch site to the next (it always has to be a Monarch site so that we can avoid Internet thinkpieces about how the monsters killed innocent civilians), they witness some kind of monster battle, and then they move on.   Because there have been so many different iterations of Godzilla throughout the decades, it’s hard to say what the character’s movies are or aren’t. I accept that most people don’t go to a Godzilla movie for rich narratives or interesting characters, but if the majority of your movie is going to be spent with the people, you may want to make them people worth caring about. The characters can’t be at the forefront of your movie and be an afterthought. The film could have greatly benefitted from slimming down the cast of characters, giving real development to just a few, and cutting the runtime by at least half an hour so that the immediacy of the problem matches the stakes of stopping Ghidorah before he destroys the world.   King of the Monsters has one goal in mind, which is to up the count of iconic monsters and “let them fight.” By this modest and singular goal, the movie kind of succeeds even if the battles themselves could stand to be a little stronger rather than just being more expensive than the typical fights between these monsters. But the stuff that surrounds those fights is kind of a drag. You may get a bright spot like Bradley Whitford as a surly scientist or Ken Watanabe adding a bit of gravitas, but then you also have some really idiotic twists to move the plot along and it makes the whole enterprise feel like a cynical attempt to keep the Godzilla franchise going without any real care or attention to anything beyond kaiju fights. Some may argue you don’t need more than that, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters proves that you do.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007. As the site's Chief Film Critic, he has authored hundreds of reviews and covered major film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival and the Sundance Film Festival. He resides in Atlanta with his wife and their dog Jack."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Nope, this is not the plot of the last two Avengers movies. Well, I mean, it is, but it’s also the basic underpinning of the monster movie that has always had societal anxieties on its mind. Born in 1954 of a society reeling from nuclear annihilation, Godzilla was a parable of a world in need of a new god to save it from war and science. Sixty five years later, Godzilla: King of the Monsters recognizes that it’s not just the military and scientists who are destroying us. It’s all of us. Columbus, Ohio’s own Michael Dougherty (Trick r’ Treat) takes the reins of the king of all kaiju franchises, grounding tensions in family drama and bombarding the audience with monsters, explosions, nuclear monsters, nuclear explosions, good-sized leaps of logic and so much nonsensical dialog. Kyle Chandler is the handsome, damaged, underwhelming white
guy at the center of things. Lucky, because the rest of the cast—primarily
women and people of color—can’t quite figure out how to move forward without
him to articulate the plan for them. They talk about it a lot, though. Even when machines are in the midst of exploding, someone has the good sense to tell us, “Something’s wrong!” When people aren’t droning on with exposition and explanation, we’re treated to plenty monster on monster action—exactly what Gareth Edwards’s 2014 Godzilla did so well. Unfortunately, for all the very cool Titans that director/co-writer Dougherty has to work with, he can’t create a thrilling fight sequence. There are lots of loud noises, plenty of toothy close ups and bright lights galore, but as for distinguishable monster bodies following a logical battle trajectory – nope.  In fact, repeated mentions of activity on “Skull Island” only remind you of the tonal and visual bullseye of Kong: Skull Island, a comparison that does not work in this Godzilla‘s favor. Longtime kaiju aficionados should appreciate Dougherty’s clear respect for genre history – as well as Bear McCreary’s wonderfully retro score –  but this new King is just treading water."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," The ultimate Godzilla movie would have giant monsters smacking each other around and causing wanton destruction for two hours. Perhaps a wrestling match of sorts, with no holds barred and an announcer screaming at the top of his lungs when Ghidorah nails Mothra in the back with half a skyscraper. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” (★★ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters nationwide Friday) is a movie and not a sporting event, though, and while it delivers on the sheer brutal beauty of a beast-on-beast tussle, it’s a colossal misstep in several ways, from ludicrous dialogue to thin characters to ridiculous plot turns. Godzilla demands a certain level of absurdity to be fun, but even this is a stretch. The sequel to Gareth Edwards’ superior “Godzilla” (2014) actually follows up on the consequences of its predecessor pretty well. The humongous lizard helped save San Francisco in that one, though left it a complete mess. In the ensuing five years, the secretive monster hunters of the cryptozoological agency Monarch have been keeping tabs on sites around the world where Godzilla and other enormous “Titans” lie dormant eons after they, not humans, ruled. The government would prefer to take them out permanently, a sentiment that isn't shared by Monarch scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga). She’s figured out a way to communicate with Mothra and these other super species, making monsters her life’s work even after they caused the family tragedy that created a rift with her animal behaviorist ex-husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler). An ecoterrorist (Charles Dance) takes Emma and daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) hostage for Mom’s technology, Mark joins up with a Monarch crew to find them, and Emma makes man-monster relations dicier by awakening the massive three-headed dragon Ghidorah. He’s the alpha dog who all the other Titans listen to, though that puts Ghidorah in the sights of a certain well-known rival with potent radioactive breath and an iconic roar. If you’re just here for the monster action, hold on to your butts. The foes from Godzilla’s past have received amazing computer-generated makeovers, especially Mothra and Rodan. And if you’re missing “Game of Thrones” big time, Ghidorah hits the spot: His constantly moving snake-y noggins are an imposing sight, for humans in his flight path as well as Godzilla. Perhaps we’re supposed be rooting for mankind, but those guys just seem to be getting in the creatures’ way with nonsensical plotlines and character motivations – Farmiga’s role, as well as that of the bad guys, is particularly all over the place. A wealth of acting talent get saddled with forgettable archetypes: Thomas Middleditch is the jittery nerd, Ken Watanabe is the wise scientist with the frequently cryptic bon mots, O’Shea Jackson Jr. is the soldier just there to sling one-liners, and Bradley Whitford is the snarky engineer who’d rather be anywhere else. God bless Chandler, that national treasure of manly heroic earnestness, for keeping this thing watchable when Rodan’s not raining fire on Mexico and Ghidorah’s not wreaking havoc on Washington. He’s all of us looking befuddled as the monster-fueled situation goes from somewhat crazy to way bonkers. Chandler has definite chemistry with Farmiga and Brown, even though they don’t get much time together, and he's the one dude who believably stares down Godzilla in a “game recognizes game” moment. Too bad he’s stuck in a mishmash of a tale that fails to meld ancient mythology, modern science and rock-'em, sock-'em monster matchups. It all crumbles like a building getting the business end of a G-man body slam."
"May 30, 2019",POSITIVE," With the world-conquering, surprise hit Queen tribute Bohemian Rhapsody now fully digested by the Earth’s population of Freddie Mercury fans – who propelled the film to a staggering better-than-best-case scenario gross of $US903.6 million – comes Rocketman, a tightly packed, superbly mounted, decidedly barbed valentine to pop music icon Elton John. Adrenalised by great lead performances by Taron Egerton as John, Jamie Bell as lyricist Bernie Taupin and Bryce Dallas Howard as John’s mum, the film establishes right from the get-go that even though Elton John produced this musical biopic, it’s going to show all the warts involving drugs, sex, money, anger and John’s apparently inexhaustible ability to imbibe vodka by the quart. An Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is used as the framing device for the story-telling in which John reflects on his early life, his rise to fame and riches, his parental issues, his sexuality and his self-destructive spiral. Rocketman is a wildly busy, hugely entertaining film that consciously shifts tone from scene to scene. One minute you’re in a subdued dramatic moment about song writing, contract negotiation or domestic discord, the next you’re in the middle of an elaborate musical number. In keeping with the tradition of the best musicals, the song-and-dance scenes form an intrinsic part of the story, transitioning from one chapter to another and visually illustrating the state of John’s life and mental health. To the great credit of director Dexter Fletcher and his crew, these numbers positively brim with creativity, energy and deliciously indulgent camera work, complete with long single takes, swirling tracking shots and all sorts of arresting imagery. One key sequence, for instance, takes place at the bottom of Elton John’s swimming pool during a party that he refuses to attend. Yet for all its shifts in tempo, Fletcher and his screenwriter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) worked hard to give the ferocious swirl of Elton John’s life a coherent through line. There are a few flashbacks, but the narrative is essentially chronological. And though Bernie Taupin’s story is equally worthy of a biopic – his importance to Elton John is not understated – the film keeps to its first-person perspective, the result being a clear tracking of John’s psychological journey as fame, fortune and the need for love mess with his mind. It was always going to be tough cramming so much life into a single film and the film has its flaws, with stretches that are too jerky and episodic. Also, some of the dialogue where characters suddenly spout out statistics about Elton John’s career signals that ever-present danger of biopics where the filmmakers fall into the trap of writing the research. (We saw that syndrome in the Australian TV biopics of Olivia Newton-John, Paul Hogan and Molly Meldrum.) But this is essentially nitpicking at a film that is gloriously engaging, loud, fun, sad and ultimately uplifting. It remains to be seen – though it seems somewhat doubtful – whether Rocketman can replicate the phenomenon that Bohemian Rhapsody was. Though director Dexter Fletcher has made a fistful of good films – Wild Bill; the musical Sunshine on Leith; and the aspirational sports dramedy Eddie the Eagle (with Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman) – he is best-known as the ‘saviour’ director of Bohemian Rhapsody who stepped in and completed the film (30% of it, at Fletcher’s estimate) after director Bryan Singer was fired over allegations of sexual misconduct. Fletcher began as a child actor, starring in the films Bugsy Malone, The Bounty and The Elephant Man. He appeared in the TV series Press Gang and, later, in the films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Layer Cake as well as the major TV mini-series Band of Brothers. As a young actor, Fletcher was graced with  rapid success and sudden wealth, which lead to problems with drugs and money, at one point forcing him to sleep in his car. The parallels between Fletcher’s personal experiences in show business and Elton John’s were not lost on him when he was offered the job to steer Rocketman. Not that we were exactly holding our collective breath over it, but our favourite Japanese big-screen monster and good close personal friend Godzilla has returned in what is thankfully a much better throwaway, FX-driven epic than that 2014 mess directed by Gareth Edwards (Star Wars: Rogue One). This one is helmed by Michael Dougherty (he  co-wrote Superman Returns and X-Men 2) who really keeps things moving as Godzilla finds some new competition to deal with. The set-up proposes that Godzilla is part of a prehistoric super-species designed by nature or God (whose presence features heavily in this film) to maintain balance on earth. Trouble is, some monsters want to co-exist with humans while others want to destroy humans. Godzilla, luckily, is on our side. Not so luckily, the giant three-headed flying dragon called King Ghidorah isn’t. Eager to see the monsters face-off against each other is snarling eco-terrorist Colonel Alan Jonah (veteran Charles Dance hamming it up for all he is worth) who has co-opted the slightly more sensible Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) to help him by kidnapping her and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things). Emma invented a sonic device that can rouse these monsters and sort of control their moods. In the mix is Dr Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma’s estranged husband and who daughter Madison desperately wants back in their lives, despite her mother’s warnings that he is best left out of the family. Now, what is surprisingly terrific about Godzilla II is not so much the balletic clashes of the monsters – which include a bunch of other over-sized critters including Mothra, the giant moth – but the way the storylines blend without any clash at all. On the one hand you’ve got the spectacular monster smackdowns, and entwined in all that is the rather touching story of parental tension and competing affections between the parents and their adventurous daughter. Admittedly it happens amidst epic scenes of destruction, still kudos to Dougherty (who co-wrote the screenplay with Zach Shields) for actually making us care about this family unit amidst all the expensive demolition of cities and landscape (not even volcanos are safe in this one.) The fact that we feel anything is also a huge credit to the actors who perform with straight-faced conviction. Even the great Sally Hawkins reprises her role to give the drama a bit of body. Performances like these in popcorn films like this never get the respect they deserve. There is some pretty obvious religious imagery at work in Godzilla II, the idea being that this confrontation sees Ghidorah as an agent of Satan and Godzilla as a soldier of God. Also, there seems to some surprisingly articulate back-handed commentary about environmental extremist and the righteousness of the Green movement. This is given voice by the conflict between mother and daughter, with Madison identifying her mum as one of the film’s humanity-hating monsters. Also, note how Godzilla and Ghidorah each have indicator lights to show when they are powering up, just like a battery charger. It’s a nice design touch. Oh, and be sure to hang out until the very end of the credits for the payoff to all the sequel hints embedded throughout the film."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Effects guys have repeatedly explained to me about the “cheat” that’s been used for generations, setting scenes in the pouring rain, or at night, or both, to hide FX imperfections. You can see it all the way back to the original 1954 Godzilla. But when Godzilla: King of the Monsters has you squinting at a dark IMAX screen for more than two hours like a Battle of Winterfell with behemoths, I’m thinking, “It’s 2019, folks. Can we lighten up?” Godzilla: King of the Monsters – part of the MonsterVerse series whose last instalment was the King Kong film Kong: Skull Island - has plenty of plenty of opportunities for fun audience turns. There’s a mad (or at least delusional) scientist, who creates a device that can “talk” to monsters. There’s the cutest monster of all, Mothra, the Jigglypuff of the monster world. There are glimpses of Kong, the monster with the most personality. And through it all, in Hollywood’s decades-long insistence on remaking the Japanese Toho Godzilla films while seemingly rejecting their spirit, Godzilla: King of the Monsters seems bogged down in its own seriousness, awash in expositional dialogue before ever getting down to business (not counting a scene with a just-hatched caterpillar Mothra, it is 45 minutes before we see some real action with Godzilla’s woken nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah breaking through the Antarctic ice). Set five years after the previous Godzilla, when, a TV reporter helpfully informs us, “the world learned monsters are real,” we play catch-up with Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), who are no longer a couple since the altruistic death of their son. Dad’s photographing wolves in the wild as therapy for having hit the bottle. Meanwhile, she’s begun tinkering with a long-ago project of theirs, a talk-to-the-animals machine called the Orca. Overshadowing everything is the Monarch Project, which, as we’ve learned in the previous films, is a generations-old extra-governmental group created to keep tabs on prehistoric monsters called “Titans”. In modern times, they have facilities near the dormant Titans around the world (Antarctica for Ghidorah, a Mexican resort town for Rodan, China for Mothra, etc.). Except a new group enters the picture in the opening act, a shadowy group of killers led by a paramilitary man named Col. Jonah (Charles Dance), who slaughter Monarch staff and kidnap Dr. Emma and her daughter AND the Orca. Their motives are murky, but it soon becomes clear Dr. Emma’s intentions for the Orca are, well, deranged. She gives speech after speech (have I mentioned this is a very talky monster movie?) about why she thinks Titans should be released. None makes sense. And though Farmiga has proven herself to be an actress capable of great restraint and subtlety, the one chance she gets to chew scenery proves this is the one arrow she doesn’t possess in her acting quiver. Mostly, she just looks confused. So, there are shadowy groups killing shadowy groups, the U.S. military wasting bombs and missiles on monsters they know from experience will simply shrug them off – all by way of distraction when what we want to see is what the title promises, monsters fighting each other, in daylight preferably.  It’s a pretty solid cast – including David Strathairn, Sally Hawkins, and Ken Watanabe (as the main let-monsters-live voice) - the kind you hire to bring subtle gravitas. Though why an over-the-top end-of-the-world scenario needs extra gravitas is baffling.  I will give props to the last-act smackdown between Godzilla and Ghidorah, (though the smiles on the faces of characters when Godzilla arrives to save the day seem inappropriate, since the collateral carnage is as likely to kill them as a direct attack by a Titan). In one of the funnier “sh—people say” spinoffs from this movie, blogger Jeffrey Wells opined that this Godzilla is too fat, prompting cries on social media of “body-shaming.” Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Directed and co-written by Michael Dougherty. Starring Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown. Opens wide Friday, May 31."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," “Big monsters smash!” Whenever “our” favourite nuclear-infused lizard lumbers across the screen, with his high pitch screech, the primordial forces of our brains arise. Cities must be demolished, while fearful citizens pause to look up at the sky in terror. However, 2014’s previous installment of Godzilla lore didn’t resemble the classic format. Instead, the film was a psychological drama focusing on a family unit with few appearances from the main attraction. Director Michael Dougherty returns with the sequel: Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which unbearably retains the family unit, in a disappointingly dull monster flick.  The film opens in 2014 in San Francisco, Godzilla’s previous attack. Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga, who especially delivers a disappointing performance) seek shelter with their son and their daughter: Madison and Andrew while destruction around them ensues. However, during Godzilla’s decimation of the city, a travesty befalls the family. The film later jumps to the present day: The parents are estranged, Mark photographs packs of wolves in the wild while Emma and Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) work at Monarch (a super secretive scientific and militaristic organization).  Monarch’s leaders: Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), Dr. Ling (Ziyi Zhang), and Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins), tirelessly work to protect the mythological beasts at various bases around the world. For the most part, these near-prehistoric creatures (17 of them) remain in hibernation. However, Monarch soon comes under attack by the ecoterrorist Jonah Allan (Charles Dance) and his hoard of mercenaries, kidnapping Emma and Madison and their recently developed invention the Orca. The film spans several continents as Mothra, Gidorah, Rodan, and a slew of other beasts wake from their slumber. The film sells itself as the biggest royal rumble of 17 monsters in franchise history, but in actuality, it’s just the aforementioned four and Godzilla.  Another flaw comes in the form of the humans. No, no one goes to a Godzilla film for the humans. And if the humans were some stand-ins for a grander metaphor then fine, like the larger mirroring of humanity with nuclear proliferation in the 1954 Godzilla, but they aren’t. Instead, Dougherty and Zach Shields wants the audience to care about the central family conflict. Over half the film plays to this narrative, sinking a hair-brain commentary on the environment wrapped in a Thanos 2.0 plan. In fact, viewers spend so much time with the humans, and their narratives are so painstakingly bad, that it’s nearly impossible to ignore such idiotic trappings.  Nevertheless, audiences are coming to Godzilla: King of the Monsters for Godzilla and the monsters. But Dougherty and co. even bungle this simple charge. There are 4 massive fights throughout the film, spanning several continents. Two of them, especially the first, are poorly shot. The first occurs in the tundras of Antarctica, in heavy snow and murky darkness. The camera wildly pans and cuts to indistinguishably images. The battle might be amazing, if audiences could see anything. I screened the film in IMAX and fought to keep pace, as Doughtery and co. spend too much time cutting back to the humans struggling on the ground while not maintaining the action led by their monsters.  The only unimpeachable portion of the monster flick comes with the sound and scale. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is meant to be seen on the biggest screen possible with the best sound, even if the CGI leans too heavily on the aforementioned murky cinematography to create some its iconic fights.  But mostly, once again, at 135 minutes Godzilla: King of the Monsters is dull. By mid-film, no one cares about this family and it becomes infuriating whenever we’re thrown back into their orbit by the screenplay. An amazing cast, which also includes a severely under-utilized David Strathairn, are left with nothing to do and terrible dialogue, even for a Godzilla film. "
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Despite jaw-dropping and entertaining visuals, the film's script and plot is, by its own admission, drawn from fortune cookie aphorisms. Being crushed by Godzilla is probably less painful."
"May 30, 2019",NEGATIVE," I’m having a hard time saying that Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the worst film ever spun off from the titular giant monster, but in my heart I want to call it that. Granted, this is a character that has weathered such duds as Godzilla 1985, Son of Godzilla, All Monsters Attack, and that eminently regrettable American remake from 1998, which are films so thunderously inept that there’s nowhere to go but up from such low points. Those were also films where people struggled mightily to figure out what to do with the radioactive titan during periods of stagnancy, so the dire, hollow, empty, and soulless nature of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which comes hot on the heels of a spectacular American reboot in 2014 and the rich and ridiculously fun Shin Godzilla, all the more crushingly disappointing. Less of a Godzilla movie and more of a Transformers styled mashing together of blurry action sequences and an overabundance of uninteresting, painfully boring story and characters, Godzilla: King of the Monsters might not the the worst on screen appearance for the big guy, but I can’t think of one of his films that left me feeling more deflated and depressed the longer it droned on. Godzilla: King of the Monsters takes place several years after the events of the 2014 film among a bunch of characters that mostly weren’t in the previous entry. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) – who’s a scientist and researcher of some sort, but I can’t explain his actual job title and the movie doesn’t care in the slightest – is called away from researching wolves in the wild by the independent monster tracking agency, Monarch. His wife, Emma (Vera Farmiga, also playing a doctor of indeterminate specificity), and daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), have been kidnapped by a British ecoterrorist (Charles Dance) who wants to use one of the Russells’ inventions – a contraption that can sonically recreate the call of an alpha titan – to wake up all the monsters hiding in the earth from their slumber to wreak havoc and hit the reset button on the environment. The main goal of the villains is to wake up “Monster Zero,” better known as the three-headed Ghidorah, located in Antarctica, who’s a bigger alpha than the currently dormant and resting Godzilla. Mark initially thinks that the best course of action to save his family and the rest of the world would be to destroy all the remaining titans, but he quickly realizes that humanity doesn’t stand a chance against Ghidorah and the newly risen monsters (including Mothra and Rodan) without the help of Godzilla. Directed and co-written by Mike Dougherty (Trick ‘r Treat, Krampus), Godzilla: King of the Monsters launches into a new direction for the franchise with almost exclusively new characters so quickly, recklessly, and with little explanation or justification that one could be forgiven for thinking that they somehow missed an entry into the franchise that should’ve come between Gareth Edwards 2014 effort and this (and, no, I’m not talking about Kong: Skull Island, which is brought up in passing since it’s now part of this franchise, but it has little to no bearing on anything happening here). It’s a decision that dooms the film from the start because it strands viewers with a whole mess of unlikable, stock characters that range from negative one dimensions to a single dimension at best. But shouldn’t that be a good thing, you might ask? Can’t we just have fun watching Godzilla and his friends and enemies smash up cities and revel in the carnage? Well, it could be if Godzilla: King of the Monsters didn’t find Dougherty and co-writer/frequent collaborator Zach Shields so weirdly enamoured with their ineffective, needlessly overqualified human cast and creating a story that doesn’t make a lick of emotional or logical sense. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the kind of film where actors are just parts of the set dressing that provide exposition, which in a fun B-movie could probably be forgiven. Here, in a bloated 132 Hollywood cash grab, their endless prattling on comprises three-quarters of the film. Anyone looking for some kaiju smashing catharsis will get a couple of scenes here and there – all of them marred by murky cinematography and Michael Bay level editing, although, on a positive note, there are more close-ups of the monsters this time out and the detailing is nice – but they’ll mostly be waiting for the final showdown, which isn’t good, silly, or badass enough to justify sitting through a butt-numbing running time spent watching uninteresting people shout and glare at each other. Most of Godzilla: King of the Monsters revolves around watching Kyle Chandler angrily telling everyone around him that they don’t know what they’re doing, and frequently looking off in the distance while standing into the pouring rain. While I’ve wanted to see Chandler sink his teeth into a role exactly like this one for quite some time, it’s just a shame that Godzilla: King of the Monsters gives him room to ham it up to the high heavens, but gives the audience nothing in return. Farmiga seems checked out, and Brown looks like she can barely make it through a single scene without wanting to crack up laughing (even when she’s given the film’s token scene of someone eliciting a single, rolling teardrop). Dance is such an underused and undeveloped villain that I kept forgetting he was even in the movie whenever he’s not on screen, and every time he resurfaces he adds precisely nothing interesting. The actors all hang out in secret labs, bunkers, submersibles, and aircraft, surrounded by screens and various technical doo-dads and thingamabobs, that are virtually indistinguishable from any other major blockbuster, and their characters are either cannon fodder or comedic relief. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are the only returning human cast members from the original, and only the former has anything at all to do. Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford, and O’Shea Jackson Jr. – as a Monarch tech guy, some other tech guy, and a random soldier, respectively – seem locked in a race to the bottom to see who can tell the most annoying jokes and mug the hardest in the process. Other than Chandler, who’s at least trying (albeit way too hard) to turn Godzilla: King of the Monsters into something watchable, the only actor who escapes this thing unscathed is Ziyi Zhang, who plays yet another indeterminable scientist, but at least she’s a bit of a smartass who gets in a couple of good jabs at the more annoying characters on hand. The biggest problem with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, other than its complete and utter contempt for wonderment or originality, is the ridiculous belief that the viewer should care about a bunch of characters that are so poorly written that they barely qualify as archetypes. I believe that if a film is genuinely entertaining, a viewer can suspend their disbelief to any degree known to man. If a film is really swinging for the fences with spectacle in a bid to put butts in the seats, writers and directors can paper over any number of narrative shortcomings or ridiculous plot points with a laugh and a shrug. Godzilla: King of the Monsters, however, is a blockbuster that can’t decide if it wants to throw up its hands in utter creative defeat or if it wants to take itself way too seriously. From scene to scene, Godzilla: King of the Monsters bounces between laughable silliness and unearned and even sillier dramatic beats. Forget about the fact that all of the actors all seem to be inhabiting different movies in their minds already. Every scene of Godzilla: King of the Monsters seems to be written as if they’re from different movies; only linked together by the painfully forgettable story. That resolute focus to turn this story and a larger and already far too cumbersome franchise into “a thing,” means that there’s nothing to focus on while waiting impatiently for the action to arrive but how idiotic and unfun this whole enterprise is. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is built around an early twist so perfunctory and nonsensical (but at least it’s telegraphed early on) that the film never recovers because it has no idea what to do with it. That kills any good will that the story can turn itself around, and it just keeps adding things that will make viewers scratch their heads. It’s the kind of film where Mark will loudly proclaim that people shouldn’t do something, and the very next scene that action is being done – FOR NO GOOD OR LOGICAL REASON – by one of the other dumb-dumbs on this mission because there wouldn’t be a movie without it.  No one outside of Mark and Emma (and the villain, I guess) can justify their reasons for being in the film or why they do the things they do. There are secret government weapons that are explained in lugubrious, unnecessary detail, but once they’re employed the completely ignore all of the science they wasted time spelling out. There are noble sacrifices that are made, but they don’t have to be, since there are other more obvious and interesting solutions staring the viewer in the face. The storytelling is so self-serious, contradictory, and shoddy that I refuse to believe that Godzilla: King of the Monsters started filming with anything close to a usable script. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a perfect example of what Roger Ebert used to call, “The Idiot Plot;” a story so moronic and nonsensical that the only way to suspend one’s disbelief and buy into it is to realize that every character in the film is a massive idiot. Not having characters worth following, a story that can be followed at all, or more fun than exposition is an invitation to make sure viewers focus on all the things wrong with the picture. But those kinds of movies can be fun and somewhat charming at times. I like stupid fun. I just want the stupidity to actually be fun and not soulless and exhausting. Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn’t hold any fun until it’s Boston smashing finale, and even then it’s not worth sitting through the rest of the movie to get there. Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla held a lot of promise and delivered on every possible level. That was a fun motion picture that was actually about something greater than smashing up a bunch of buildings. Kong: Skull Island was well liked by many, but also an overstuffed step in the wrong direction for the budding franchise. Godzilla: King of the Monsters – a film that I was honestly looking forward to – is so awful that it makes me fearful that the forthcoming Kong vs. Godzilla picture (which is already well into production) will be similarly hobbled by too many poor storytelling choices. Next to a Transformers sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is as awful as major studio tentpole production gets, and it breaks my heart to say that. Andrew Parker fell in love with film growing up across the street from a movie theatre. He began writing professionally about film at the age of fourteen, and has been following his passions ever since. His writing has been showcased at various online outlets, as well as in The Globe and Mail, BeatRoute, and NOW Magazine. If he's not watching something or reading something, he's probably sleeping. So I saw a screening Of “Godzilla: KOTM” last night that I was really genuinely looking forward to. This morning I’m still reeling from how disappointingly god awful this movie was and started googling reviews to see if I wasn’t alone. Thank you for this review and not pulling any punches, I couldn’t have said it better myself. It really is that bad!!!"
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla: King Of The Monsters improves on its predecessor in terms of the kaiju carnage, but still can’t quite make you care about the humans underfoot. Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Nothing really sums up the mission statement of this sequel to 2014’s Godzilla reboot better than its theme song. Composer Bear McCreary and System Of A Down singer Serj Tankian have covered Blue Öyster Cult’s ‘Godzilla’, incorporating guitar riffs, traditional Japanese chanting, and lyrics that should be annotating the pages of a comic book – “Oh no, there goes Tokyo/Go go Godzilla!” – and the end result feels like a triumphant salute to Toho Studios’ favourite scaly son. 

Director Michael Dougherty (Trick ’R Treat, Krampus) wears his love of the monsters on his sleeve. And while this film exists in the same world as Gareth Edwards’ reality-grounded ‘Godzilla Begins’ take on the character, King Of The Monsters ups the monster head-count and collateral damage considerably, relishing the excesses of an oversized kaiju movie.  While Edwards’ film took a more reverent approach than Roland Emmerich’s 1997 abomination, its biggest flaw was how little the titular Titan appeared on screen. After a slooow-burn build-up, too many of the big guy’s appearances were cut short. It didn’t help that Godzilla’s screentime- hogging foes, the MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms), were uninspired Starship Troopers knock-offs.  Not only does King Of The Monsters carve out more time for its title star (you see him in all his glory in the first scene), but it gives him a trio of iconic Titans to contend with. It’s tonally closer to the oversized antics of Kong: Skull Island than Godzilla 2014: together, the films form the extended MonsterVerse, leading to 2020’s Godzilla Vs Kong. But it’s to KOTM’s credit that it focuses on its own adversaries rather than simply serving as a stepping stone.  If you’re familiar with the original Toho films, you’ll recognise the three additional creatures spreading their wings here as fan favourites Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah. While they’re a far cry from their rubber-suit origins, they stay true to their iconic designs, and provide a much more colourful counterpoint to Godzilla than the aforementioned MUTOs.  There is a semblance of a story that brings all of these beasts together. In the aftermath of the events of the last film, the Russell family face a devastating loss. Skip forward a few years, and estranged father Mark (Kyle Chandler) is photographing wolves in the wild, while mother Emma (Vera Farmiga) has been developing a piece of tech – the Orca – that can communicate with Titans, and caring for teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). There’s a sprawling human ensemble, especially when you factor in returnees (and new faces) from secretive agency Monarch.  Casting dependable character actors like Farmiga and Chandler helps to create some stakes, but the Russells’ story is never so compelling that you’d rather watch them than Godzilla, even though they’re an improvement on Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s bland military lunk from the first film.  Many supporting players get short shrift. Bradley Whitford’s wisecracks make a refreshing change from the usual monitor-commentary, but Zhang Ziyi and O’Shea Jackson Jr. barely get a look in. Charles Dance’s eco-terrorist’s motives aren’t so much unclear as nonsensical, and another character’s Thanos-esque masterplan doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny. Farmiga, Chandler and Brown put in a worthy effort to give the human aspect some heft, but for this film’s audience they can’t quite compete with the monsters. Happily, KOTM does offer more on that front, and director Mike Dougherty is clearly a Godzilla fanboy, reintroducing the new creatures with infectious relish.  The introductions to the monsters are where KOTM is most successful. When supersized lepidopteran Mothra is coaxed out of her cocoon, there’s a sense of wonder twinned with danger. Three-headed dragon King Ghidorah feels eerily threatening even when he’s preserved in ice in Antartica. And pterosaur-like Rodan makes a dramatic entrance from the mouth of a volcano. Dougherty has a good eye for a set-piece, and doesn’t hold back on the destruction. As Rodan swoops over a Mexican city, terrified bystanders are swept away in the backdraft caused by his wings. And even though Godzilla is once again invested with the pathos, an impressive intimidation display proves that he’s not to be bossed around. "
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL," Midway into this sequel, a sweaty and flustered Kyle Chandler, far from the “clear eyes, full hearts” of Friday Night Lights, uses his character’s expertise to remark on a penetrating sound coming from one of the tentpole’s mega monsters. He indicates the audible shriek declares a want for one of three things that start with F: food, fight, or, as he censors, “something more intimate.” Fill in the blank as you will. You’re going to groan a few grunts of your own too during Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and they won’t be matching of those three particular F words. Instead, they will be flummox, frenzy, and frustration. After Gareth Edwards rebooted the legendary Japanese sea monster for a modern audience with a stern seriousness and hefty scope that destroyed all previous campiness connected to the character, this Michael Dougherty-helmed follow-up burns up all of that renewed credibility right away within the first half-hour on through to the exhausting end. Where’s the blame? That would be the humans because the behemoths really come out to play. Bad quippy comedy, nonsensical plot trappings, and unimportant character inclusions are the true weaknesses that defeat these monsters. Chandler’s central hero is Dr. Mark Russell, a former Monarch specialist who has not handled the familial loss that came to him during the San Francisco destruction of the 2014 film. His now-divorced wife, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), and daughter Madison (Stranger Things starlet Millie Bobby Brown) have remained with the clandestine scientific organization studying the other “titans” that have been discovered since the shocking public disaster five years ago. Emma has continued the work of her spouse to develop the Orca, the key MacGuffin of the movie that can tuned to emulate the bio-sonar signals of these beasts. LESSON #1: GET YOUR FREQUENCIES STRAIGHT — Much like those F-word signals mentioned earlier, the exactitude of the Orca is paramount to human chances of success. Watch that digital dial. You don’t want to mix up your battle cries with your mating calls. The intelligence of this movie’s fictional science ends there when Emma sides with eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (played by professional movie villain Charles Dance) a former military colonel who’s out for the big business of kaiju DNA. All the Monarch good guy spooks and scientists can do, led by the returning experts Serizawa and Graham (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) and flanked by newcomers Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, Zhang Ziyi, is recruit Mark with a classic “there’s no one better than you” arm-twist to chase his wife around the globe as Jonah’s team breaks into Monarch outposts and releases new gestating and dormant nightmares. Reading all those human details, whatever happened to “let them fight?” LESSON #2: STOP FORCING CHARACTERS NO ONE CARES ABOUT — Each time, the human narrative seems to run its course and the action can commence between Godzilla, the multi-headed Ghidorah, the fiery-winged Rodan, and the luminous Mothra, the people and their flimsy motives of environmental cleansing, radiation, gambling, balance, and what not keep getting in the way. The entire big-bomb-centered military element with David Strathairn, O’Shea Jackson, Aisha Hinds, and Anthony Ramos are as random and underwritten as the scientists. When a blunt “you’re a monster” is the sad peak of the burn level of human care and intensity, it’s time to aim higher. Stop cutting to the humans. We came for the monsters. LESSON #3: DON’T STAND THERE AND STARE — And while we’re on this topic, cinematographer Lawrence Sher’s unpinned camera catches more gawking than an audience at an opera concert in a movie that should churn like a meat grinder. Take a cue from the original Japanese targets and run! If you’re going to include and put this much attention on the people, please have them doing something more interesting than all this. While the portly and performance-captured Godzilla (stuntman extraordinaire T.J. Storm) and his opponents of immense and insane cinematic scale lack feral gracefulness and lumber little better than when they used to be portrayed by actors in rubber suits, the throwdowns of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, when not interrupted by Lessons #2 and #3, are toy-smashing wish fulfillment for raucous fans. The promise of a larger world of threats from the MonsterVerse of Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island is sizably answered. Composer Bear McCreary’s filler-ish score is a minor improvement to orchestrate this reptilian rumba stomping on cities. There is awesomeness to be found, if you can see or hear it clearly. The final bit of trouble with Godzilla: King of the Monsters is its scrambled layers of noise. Godzilla’s trademark roar, as imposing and cool as it is when loosed, barely stands out in a messy sound mix of indeterminable clutter elsewhere. With enough precipitation haze and colored cumulonimbus clouds to make even The Weather Channel give up and wish for a clearer day of textures, the fight scenes are often shrouded, dark, and very difficult to follow. Even with the heavyweight sights present, the dimming effect of 3D on this dingy palette cannot be recommended. The three-man editing team macheted the satiating slugfest we wanted with the bumbling calamities and preposterous survival saves of the people we don’t care about. This movie will have its loyal audience, but it is a creative step back for the MonsterVerse."
"May 30, 2019",NEUTRAL,All the character actors in the world can't save Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters from calamity.
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," The story: The sequel picks up a few years after the events in Gareth Edwards' Godzilla (2014). Haunted by the death of their son, animal behaviour expert Mark (Kyle Chandler) has separated from paleobiologist Emma (Vera Farmiga), who is raising their daughter Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown). Emma is still working for Monarch, an agency tasked with studying Godzilla and other monsters, and she finds a way to control them using sound waves. But when the three-headed Ghidorah and a slew of other Titans are awakened, humanity's existence is imperilled. In addition to Godzilla, this sequel packs in a whole menagerie of kaiju giant monsters. Those who have seen the Japanese movies would be familiar with the likes of moth-like Mothra, fire demon Rodan and the three-headed dragon Ghidorah. There are no surprises in how it all plays out and one is barely invested in the story. When a character volunteers to go on a suicide mission, what should have been a moving moment feels flat. Rising teen star Brown (Stranger Things, 2016 to present) does her best to emote, but can do only so much with none-too-subtle lines like, ""You're a monster"", an accusation thrown at her mother. Elsewhere, there are unintended moments of silliness. The device Emma comes up with to emit the frequencies looks like a DJ console, while Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi shows up in a why-bother role as a scientist whose specialities seem to be Internet research and looking chic."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," In his latest starring role, Godzilla squares off against three-headed adversary Monster Zero, but in a sense his real opponent remains unchanged: Godzilla vs. Redundancy. In some ways, the challenge is made easy by the fact that audiences don’t really want a new Godzilla, they want the durable pleasure (with some gussied up effects) of seeing him topple a city, or stomp any rival monster posing a threat to that durability. So the title of the new film, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is a bit of a spoiler. It’s also a little bit of a misnomer — in this new incarnation of the franchise, the title characters aren’t monsters at all, but “titans” who predated man on the planet, and reappear to “restore balance,” acting as environmental stewards to correct or prevent the damage we’re doing to Eden. The plot in King of the Monsters revolves around a group of ecoterrorists who think too much damage has been done already. They hope to activate the creatures so they can stomp mankind back to the stone age. To accomplish this, they need the sound-wave technology developed by scientist Emma (Vera Farmiga), who lost a son in the last Godzilla movie and then a grieving husband Mack (Kyle Chandler) to alcoholism, depression, and divorce. Terror commandos (led by the ever-evil Charles Dance, aka Game of Thrones’ Tywin Lannister) kidnap Emma and her daughter (Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown), using the stolen device to blast out a sonic wake-up call, agitating several titans, including Monster Zero, and all CGI hell breaks loose. This chaos also engulfs the narrative, which has a sobered-up Mack advising a military strike force (featuring the talents of O’Shea Jackson Jr.) and an intercontinental group of scientists (Sally Hawkins, Zhang Ziyi, Ken Watanabe, Bradley Whitford) on how to contend with this titan uprising. They fly around playing Whac-a-mole with the rogue titans (Rodan et al.) popping up all over the world — Antarctica, Mexico and for some reason Fenway Park. The creatures are all doing the bidding of Monster Zero, and Watanabe’s character concludes that Godzilla must be recruited to reassert his authority. Director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) is working with leftover bits of Gareth Edwards’ sloggy 2015 reboot (this one’s slightly shorter), and though his approach has more wit, he’s working with clashing swatches of plot. The terrorists say they want to reduce civilization to rubble so that the natural world can regenerate — as is already happening, we see, in the rubble of vice-covered San Francisco. So if it’s already happening, why the monster apocalypse? Watanabe at least has more to do here than he did in Pokemon: Detective Pikachu. The rest of the cast is called up on to crane their necks, and look with awestruck faces at the titan fights going on above them. Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Directed by Michael Dougherty. With Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Bradley Whitford. Distributed by Warner Bros."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,Godzilla: King of the Monsters is bad. It is just incredibly hard to enjoy.
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," The crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. During Godzilla’s first battle of three to be found in this Michael Dougherty directed sequel entitled King of the Monsters (five years following the release of the reboot I should add, which is an anomaly considering the frequency at which Hollywood cranks franchise installments out) it brings me great pain and frustration to say that instead of sticking with the monster mayhem, the action keeps cutting away to the somewhat bland humans. Admittedly, they are a step up from the human characters of similar Kaiju movies or disaster spectacles, but that doesn’t make it any less disheartening to see a helicopter carrying a bunch of crucial scientists, military types, and tracking experts rolling around across the ice sheets of Antarctica, as if the movie is speaking directly to the audience saying “we know those beloved towering behemoths are ripping each other apart, but don’t forget about these super important characters over here that might not make it out alive!” This happens again and again, and by the end of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, there might not even be 10 straight seconds of monsters locking up in a brawl, constantly undercut by the goals and missions of the people, whether they be personal rescue missions or assisting in the battle at large. Quite frankly, I’m somewhat terrified to go watch all of the theatrical trailers and television spots, as there is a fairly realistic chance that they spoil the majority of the monster-related action outside of maybe the final battle. To be fair to the filmmakers (the story is a collaborative effort between aforementioned director Michael Dougherty, Zach Shields, and Max Borenstein, with the former two also penning the script), I realize there needs to be some kind of narrative to connect the plot threads of why these monsters are fighting and to give viewers something to relate to. However, the solution is not having Kyle Chandler globetrotting around the world to save his daughter (played by Millie Bobby Brown of Stranger Things fame) and reconnect with his ex-wife (played by Vera Farmiga) while Charles Dance twirls his metaphorical mustache like a super generic villain. The tone doesn’t even work; Kyle Chandler is deathly serious and overacting his ass off in a movie where his ex-wife has altered technology to be able to sonically communicate with the Titans. It only gets worse, with one character making some outrageously stupid decisions, only to receive a redemption arc in the final act that means nothing, and then somehow less than nothing when it becomes evident the movie will throw this character into the fire and into situations that would kill anyone but is too afraid to pull the trigger on actually killing them. Thankfully, the supporting characters fare better. Ken Watanabe returns as the intelligent, sage-like scientist that generally has the best course of action for this shifting landscape now dominated by Titans. Bradley Whitford provides some comedic relief as a gum-chewing, wisecracking doctor. Ziyi Zhang is a multi-generational employee of Monarch and gets a few memorable lines of her own. Aisha Hinds shines as a no-nonsense colonel. And Thomas Middleditch also provides some laughs by serving as the butt of nearly every joke from all of the other characters. Noticeably, the minor players appear to be in a much different movie, one far more relaxed and free to have fun with the surrounding chaos rather than a lifeless dysfunctional family that grows increasingly stupid from one character essentially becoming Thanos. Yes, it’s as stupid as it sounds, and if you are one of the people that for some ungodly preposterous reason thought that Avengers: Infinity War should conclude with that madman aligning with Earth’s mightiest heroes to take down another threat, well, you kind of get your wish here and can see for yourself how stupid that would have been. No one comes to Godzilla for the story, but have some decency and allow things to make sense featuring humans that contain brains. Whether you can get past the abundance of human peril or not, it would be unfair to say that Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn’t make the most of these unfortunate ingredients. They’re all putting themselves in danger in ways that are everything from admirable and scary while adding to the sense of scale these Titans yield in stature. The photography here is outstanding as are the updated designs of the monsters; they truly do carry a graceful beauty (especially Mothra) when the shot is pulled far back and juxtaposing them against the environment. Not to mention, they all boast a wide variety of attacks that light up the visuals contrasted against the mostly gloomy color palette. The musical compositions only enhance this big-fight atmosphere. Essentially, there is no room to complain about how the film looks or sounds, it’s just a damn shame that humans are always taking center stage. It’s also got breakneck pacing on its side, only stopping to explain the motivations of being previously talked about maddeningly dumb character’s thought process on the Titans (I’m being as vague as possible so not to spoil). There is also a ludicrous but clever stretch involving a nuke. Not to mention, the brief instances we do get to see of these monsters duking it out is a visual treat of the highest order, complete with stunning special-effects. Those that have an affinity for Roland Emmerich -sized annihilation will likely come away satisfied. It’s just very difficult to forgive Godzilla: King of the Monsters for dedicating excess time to its human characters, and then not being able to create emotion when a certain character dies. Sure, the sequence is visually stunning, and so is the rest of the movie, but it all feels artificial and meaningless with no weight. There are also some teases to the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong movie, but if anything watching this will finish killing your excitement for that movie."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," If Michael Bay had directed a “Godzilla” movie, it would be “Godzilla: King of the Monsters.”  And while another Michael, Michael Doughtery, the one that directed 2015’s “Krampus,” is at the helm of “King of the Monsters,” he can’t shake the Bay style, the same style that gave us the diminishing returns and bonkers nonsense of the “Transformers” franchise.  And toeing the Bay line, in Doughtery’s monster movie, skyscrapers topple, nameless and faceless innocents are crushed to paste, and entire communities are extinguished in bursts of atomic dragon fire.  Oh, and there are jokes.To be fair, “King of the Monsters” is meant to be ridiculous.  The inventive kaiju films were launched back in 1954 and then “Americanized” in 1956, adding Canadian actor Raymond Burr to essentially narrate the story for US audiences. That 1956 movie was similarly titled “Godzilla, King of the Monsters!.”  Although I’ve not seen the original Japanese 1954 cut, I’ve read that it took a much more anti-nuclear position.  Of course, given the events in Japan that resulted in their exit from WWII, such a position was understandable. Preserved in this 2019 update is the idea that Godzilla, and other monsters, were awakened by nuclear testing. Emma is a scientist specializing in the study of bioacoustics.  Like Mark, she uses sound to understand the behavior of animals.  But Emma’s work offers a chance to control the kaiju, and she’s built a device to isolate their bioacoustic signatures.  That device, called the ORCA, resembles a portable DJ mixing system complete with XLR outputs.  And, as there always are in the movies, there’s only one of them.When an evil eco-terrorist group, led by mercenary Jonah Alan (the always villainous Charles Dance), gets control of the OCRA, the Monarch team has to stop them.  Meanwhile, some 17 kaijus are released including the three-headed King Ghidorah.  And as the various monsters emerge from centuries of peaceful slumber, they come under the Ghidorah spell.  It’s hell on earth in no time.As it should be, the best thing about “King of the Monsters” is the monsters.  The human story is weak and distracting.  As the Russells and the eclectic Monarch crew race to recapture the ORCA, any logic is thrown to the winds.  Monarch is like a low-rent version of Marvel’s S.H.I.E.L.D., that has, it seems, unlimited resources to draw upon.  Monarch employees (played by returning Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins, along with newcomers Ziyi Zhang, Thomas Middleditch and Bradley Whitford) zip around the world in a massive flying wing.  And, when needed, they explore the ocean depths in a military submarine.  This happens, I think, without as much as a wardrobe change. Characters pop up, in and out, all over the globe, traveling thousands of miles in what seems like minutes.  It’s almost too much to take. Don’t get me wrong; I know this is a monster movie, and we aren’t supposed to think too hard about anything.  But this film barely gets by on spectacle, making it the least intelligent and least entertaining entry to date.  It’s sporadically fun, sure, to see the beasts clash, but we’ve seen this kind of thing so many times before, that by the third confrontation, you get a little exhausted.  After the umpteenth building crumbles, you might even get a little bored.  And since the human characters aren’t engaging, you might even start looking at your watch. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is good enough to whet fan appetite for the inevitable blending of this story with that of King Kong.  It’s a franchise episode that’s surprisingly not as good as 2017’s “Kong: Skull Island,” which featured better looking creatures and a campy Vietnam war tinged mystique. When the next MonsterVerse film hits theaters, let’s hope that as much effort is put into crafting the human story as they do in creating the monster one.  Maybe the problem is that Godzilla is such a big presence that there’s no room for anyone or anything else.  Maybe it will take Kong to make us care again."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," Tengo una fuerte relación afectiva con el último reboot de Godzilla en el híbrido japonés americano de la unión entre Toho y Legendary. No nada más fue un bello momento laboral en el que empezaba a hacer reseñas en este, su sitio de confianza, sino que nacía una nueva esperanza. Los remakes de Godzilla, desde la gloriosa cinta de Ishiro Honda de 1954, se quedaban aislados en el culto japonés o pasaban el charco con terribles, perversas alteraciones. Roland Emmerich, tan insigne director de catástrofes sin sentido, no supo entender el peso emocional de Godzilla y no le importó reflexionar sobre sus orígenes. Así, en la película de 1998, hizo un reboot espantoso en el que transformó a un dios en no más que una bestia hambrienta. Este bodrio de realismo obtuso y confundido dio lugar, casi veinte años después, al regreso de Toho a las pantallas americanas con una película que, por fin, valoraba los orígenes de Godzilla. Pueden decir lo que quieran de la película de Gareth Edwards, pueden hablar de lo derivativa que fue la primera hora o del desperdicio de actores de la talla de Bryan Cranston y Juliette Binoche a favor de otros, menos interesantes, como Aaron Taylor-Johnson y Elizabeth Olsen, pero no pueden negar la emoción que causaron las peleas con los M.U.T.O y la enorme, enorme, sorpresa que fue ver, por fin, el rayo azul atómico de Godzilla en una película americana. Fueron momentos hermosos que dialogaban con cintas como Gamera vs. Gyaos (1966) y Godzilla 2000: Millennium (1999) de manera absolutamente inesperada. Por todo esto, esperaba ansiosamente Godzilla II: King of the Monsters. Los posters y los avances, rápidamente, prometieron una película que juntaría al menos a cuatro grandes monstruos clásicos, como en aquel lejano 1964, cuando batallaron King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan y Godzilla en Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964). Todo parecía continuar la premisa de Edwards de respeto a la tradición de Toho y al diseño original de los monstruos. Pero todo también parecía inclinarse hacia el lado más vendible de una franquicia que quiere incluir con calzador, en este universo, al King Kong de Skull Island. Entre la necesidad obtusa de vender, el drama humano mal acabado y el enorme espectáculo visual de sus monstruos, Godzilla II: King of the Monsters es una cinta que da certeros placeres y que, también, resulta terriblemente frustrante. Es difícil enojarse con una película de Kaijus que se centra en mostrarlos, en mostrar sus épicas batallas, y en delinearlos con hermosas telas de fondo. Sin embargo, al igual que con la cinta de Edwards, el protagonismo de los Kaijus nunca coincide con un apelativo lado humano. Y, ahí en donde debería conectarnos con ese universo imposible, esta cinta se queda miserablemente corta. Para no arruinarles nada, aquí les voy a dejar, sin spoilers, algunos comentarios generales sobre lo que me gustó y sobre lo que me disgustó en esta película. Ojalá logre transmitirles la frustración real de un fanático feliz de ver a sus ídolos gigantes, nuevamente, en pantalla, pero triste de encontrarlos en medio de tanta maldita paja. Cinco años después de los sucesos que devastaron Las Vegas y San Francisco, los militares estadounidenses intentan prever futuras apariciones de monstruos gigantes. Su siempre intransigente lógica los lleva a pensar planes de exterminio con una nueva carrera armamentística. Del otro lado, los científicos del Project Monarch, encabezados por Ishiro Serizawa (cuyo nombre, como bien sabemos, hace homenaje al creador de Godzilla y al primer científico que lo defendió), intentan negociar por la supervivencia de estos organismos masivos. Mientras unos argumentan el peligro latente, los otros tratan de mostrar las bondades de la devastación. Al parecer, a través de la radiactividad que emanaban, los M.U.T.Os y Godzilla, crearon un renacimiento natural en las ciudades devastadas: nuevamente fértiles y libradas de la presencia humana, San Francisco y Las Vegas reverdecen. Monarch argumenta, entonces, que los Kaijus pueden ser una influencia benéfica para el equilibrio natural de la tierra. Al mismo tiempo, Project Monarch se ha dedicado a encontrar otros gigantes dormidos, dioses de antaño que, como Godzilla, caminaron en una tierra que nunca fue nuestra. Por supuesto, en el curso de estas investigaciones, encuentran a más de uno. En medio de los proyectos secretos de Monarch encontramos a la Dra. Emma Russell, una paleobióloga que perdió a un hijo en los incidentes de San Francisco y que, ahora, como Sarah Connor, enseña supervivencia dura a su joven hija (Millie Bobby Brown). La doctora Russell también investiga una nueva forma de comunicarse con los monstruos gigantes que creó, años atrás, con su ex esposo, utilizando las frecuencias vitales de estas bestias para emitir sonidos que los tranquilizan o los alebrestan. Esta investigación parece interesar a más de una personas, y no todos tienen las mejores intenciones. Ahora Monarch tendrá que lidiar con nuevas amenazas y la insistencia destructiva del ejército para darle a Godzilla, una vez más, la oportunidad de defendernos frente a fuerzas titánicas que amenazan nuestra existencia compartida. Como dije anteriormente, uno de los grandes hitos de la reimaginación de Gareth Edwards en Godzilla (2014) fue respetar el diseño original y el espíritu original del personaje. A pesar de haber hecho suficiente énfasis (fuera de las constantes referencias de Serizawa) en el peligro de la proliferación nuclear y la brutalidad de los ataques americanos a Japón durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Edwards entendió muy bien la primera cinta de Ishiro Honda y el mito que dio vida, durante tantos años, a Godzilla. Aquí el dios antiguo no aparece como un dinosaurio hambriento, estúpido y enfadado, sino como un verdadero titán, padre de la humanidad. La relación con el personaje de Aaron Taylor-Johnson es, justamente, la de una simbiosis entre hombre y deidad, entre hijo arrepentido y padre regañón, entre un joven rebelde y un manto protector. Por suerte, uno de los aspectos más memorables de Godzilla II es que el director que remplazó a Edwards, Michael Dougherty, respetó sus decisiones de apego al material original. Aquí, no nada más seguimos viendo el hermoso diseño de un Godzilla apegado a las ideas de Toho, sino que volvemos a adentrarnos en la exploración del personaje como un ser antiguo. Incluso, llegamos a entender algo más de su relación milenaria con la humanidad y la ternura compartida de una relación simbiótica. Finalmente, por si fuera poco, volvemos a ver un majestuoso uso de su rayo atómico… y algunas otras fuerzas más. También, es hermoso ver que el respeto por Godzilla se desborda también hacia otros Kaijus menos famosos, pero tan importantes como él. Nos referimos, claro, a la aparición conjunta de Rodan, Mothra y King Ghidorah. Entre muchos otros kaijus antiguos, estos tres personajes, antagonistas y aliados de Godzilla, fueron los precursores del universo tokusatsu de Toho en los años cincuenta y sesenta. Tanto Mothra, en 1961, como Rodan, en 1956, tuvieron historias de origen propias, ambas dirigidas por Ishiro Honda, creador de Godzilla, para Toho. Luego, Ghidorah hizo su aparición en la primera película de conjunto en la que peleaban diversos Kaijus para proteger o destruir nuestro mundo: Sandai Kaijū: Chikyū Saidai no Kessen (Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster), de 1964. Dentro de estos complejos orígenes, la historia de estos tres monstruos es muy diferente. Rodan, es un monstruo antiguo que despierta, dentro del volcán activo más grande de Japón, el Monte Aso. Sus larvas aterrorizan a mineros y su presencia mítica habita pesadilla. Una vez liberado, Rodan muestra el enorme poder destructivo de unas alas que crean un golpe sónico cuando emprende el vuelo. Todo bajo su andar termina destruido y los ingenieros deben unirse con el ejército para, finalmente, con un derrumbe provocado, lograr ahogarlo en la lava de un volcán. Mothra es también un monstruo antiguo, pero que, a diferencia del primer Godzilla y de Rodan, no tiene ninguna intención de destrucción. Mothra es muy feliz en el ecosistema alterado de la isla ficticia de Infant. Gracias a pruebas nucleares de la nación de Roliscia (una versión ficticia de Rusia), un nuevo mundo se ha creado en la isla; un mundo en donde los humanos han mutado y en donde reina, como diosa, Mothra. Cuando un magnate rapta a una de sus pequeñas servidoras para exhibirlas en un circo, Mothra se revela a la humanidad atacando Tokio. Pero este kaiju nunca fue mal intencionado y, cuando rescata a sus adeptas, regresa felizmente a casa. Mothra es la ternura de una tierra rica y vasta. Ghidorah, finalmente, es un personaje interesantísimo. En cierto sentido, es el kaiju responsable de un giro en la comprensión del personaje de Godzilla. Él es el máximo némesis, la fuerza invasora que destruyó a pasadas civilizaciones en Venus, un dragón malintencionado que viaja a través del espacio para acabar con todo. En Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, Ghidorah muestra su maldad y empuja, a través del sacrificio de Mothra, a que Rodan y Godzilla se unan en una lucha contra el invasor para salvaguardar la tierra. Al crear esta extraña unión, encontramos las primeras muestras de comprensión entre la humanidad y Godzilla y, de paso, vemos los primeros esfuerzos colaborativos entre kaijus terrestres para repeler invasiones alienígenas de monstruos gigantescos. Godzilla II: King of the Monsters tiene suficiente respeto por el material original para conservar la importancia de estas viejas uniones. Esta nueva cinta hace un homenaje certero a los poderes y a los orígenes de estas criaturas majestuosas y se da el tiempo de mostrarlas en todos su esplendor. La historia puede no tener mucho sentido, pero acomoda suficiente tiempo en pantalla para entregarnos las más finas imágenes de kaijus desde el impresionante salto HALO de Edwards en Godzilla de 2014. Al igual que las imágenes que tanto cultivó el gran fotógrafo Seamus McGarvey en la cinta anterior; en esta película, Lawrence Sher (el cinefotógrafo de Todd Phillips que ahora hará Joker) intenta los mismos contrastes espectaculares de cielo y claroscuros con los colores típicos de cada personaje (rojo para Rodan, azul para Godzilla, amarillo para Ghidorah y un hermoso multicolor para Mothra). En ese sentido, Godzilla II: King of the Monsters mantiene el mismo esplendor visual de la primera cinta y lo expande con sorpresa y amor por los enormes monstruos. Ese aspecto, solamente, mantiene a flote la cinta porque, como su antecesora, desgraciadamente, la parte humana es su terrible flaqueza. El drama, aquí, está solamente entre los dioses. Godzilla II sabe cómo mostrar la belleza de sus kaijus; sabe cómo respetar sus historias de origen en una traducción occidental que no es traidora; sabe, incluso, con un trabajo bien organizado de edición, crear intensas secuencias de batalla titánica. Lo que nunca sabe hacer es enmarcar toda esta destrucción en algún sentido humano. El enorme legado de Ishiro Honda no está, nada más, en la espléndida mancuerna que hizo con Eiji Tsuburaya (que luego crearía la serie de Ultraman) para darle vida a tantos monstruos con efectos especiales prácticos, sino en dotarlos de carácter, importancia y corazón. Las historias de kaijus de Toho en los años cincuenta y sesenta son siempre historias profundamente humanas. En Godzilla de 1954, el director toma tiempo para mostrar los efectos de la devastación en un niño que llora la muerte de sus padres, desgarrado, entre la lluvia y los truenos; se da tiempo de pasear por un hospital con los heridos de Tokio para dar relieve a la destrucción masiva en escala humana; se da tiempo, finalmente, de mostrar la tristeza recordada, una y otra vez en Japón, de coros infantiles cantando por los caídos. De la misma forma, en Rodan, entendemos el compañerismo de los mineros y, en Mothra, la empatía de un ser vivo con su hábitat. El aspecto humano de estas cintas es algo que entendió muy bien Guillermo del Toro en Pacific Rim y el recién laureado en Cannes Bong Joon-Ho en The Host: de nada sirve crear historias de monstruos fantásticos si no empatizamos con los humanos que se enfrentan a ellos. Esa misma comprensión de la relación empática en la escala humana la vemos en Cloverfield de Matt Reeves, con una historia de amor frustrada; la vemos, finalmente, en el trágico final de un Godzilla en Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995) (cinta que tiene algunos guiños aquí) y en el reboot de Shin Godzilla (2016) con todas las toscas peleas gubernamentales. Para bien o para mal, continuando su espectacular labor en Monster, Edwards trató de hacer lo mismo en Godzilla. Todo este aspecto humano, que quiso construir una historia familiar en medio de una imposible situación fantástica, fue muy criticado en su momento. Ahora, creo que merece revalorarse a la luz de lo que hizo Michael Dougherty en esta cinta. Porque todo el esplendor visual, todas las referencias hermosas, no pueden recatar el drama mediocre que subyace en esta cinta. El problema con Godzilla II está, creo, en la necesidad de crear una escala humana con un nuevo drama familiar, con conspiraciones y con la implementación forzada de una vieja idea de este mitos: la posibilidad de comunicación entre hombres y kaijus. Todo el marco dramático creado por estas intrigas, estos pequeños dramas y estas relaciones entre hombre y bestias falla miserablemente en cualquier aspecto. Con un guión simplemente flojo que arregla huecos argumentales con líneas de pseudociencia, Godzilla II desperdicia a grandes actores en demostraciones patéticas de sacrificio banal. Y, encima de todo, falla en demostrar la escala humana de la devastación; esa escala que, después de Hiroshima y Nagasaki, los japoneses sabían mostrar tan bien. En esta cinta, por el contrario, estamos al mismo nivel despreocupado de Zach Snyder en Man of Steel: los héroes y los enemigos importan, la destrucción que dejan es puro daño colateral. Así, con un hermoso espectáculo visual que rinde homenaje, en diseño, a las glorias de Toho, esta película se siente como una serie de postales vacías. Postales que son hermosas para rellenar trailers y llevar a viejos fanáticos a las salas; postales que sirven para darnos momentos de gloria fugaz, pero que dejan, después de su paso imponente, solamente ruinas, construcciones vacías, y imágenes sin nada que buscar detrás. Michael Dougherty había hecho películas interesantes tratando de jugar con los límites del terror en Trick ‘r Treat (2007) y Krampus (2015). La herencia de Edwards era un certero homenaje a Ishiro Honda y Toho en los cincuenta y sesenta. El elenco y el presupuesto daban para mucho. Pero nada puede salvar a una película de un meollo dramático mediocre y de un guión terriblemente escrito. El espectáculo de los kaijus, el hermoso diseño, la fotografía en claroscuros de CGI pletórico, el hermoso soundtrack de Bear McCreary, nada puede reparar por la construcción mediocre de esta película. Y eso me llena de tristeza. En realidad disfruté ver a Mothra esparcir sus alas y a Rodan hacer el sonic boom; amé ver que respetaban el origen de Ghidorah y a Godzilla más allá de sus primeros poderes. Quería amar esta película, pero es simplemente imposible. Los productores desecharon lo que hizo Edwards para hacer franquicia. Y lograron destruir, de nuevo, bajo el peso necio del dinero, algo que pudo ser hermoso."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," Even with all its pyrotechnics, and even with arguably the finest and deepest team of actors ever to appear in any of the three dozen movies about the big guy, “King of the Monsters” careens about all over the place in search of an identity, never really finding its footing as a campy treat, an exciting popcorn adventure or a monster movie with humans we actually care about. It’s loud and muddled and overlong, and it spends too much time focusing on the too-many characters as they exchange ridiculous dialogue and stare up in wide-eyed wonder at the madness in the skies and in the seas and right in front of them. When the monsters DO butt heads, the battle sequences are often maddeningly dark, and jam-packed with too many quick-cut closeups, making it difficult to keep track of the cage-match type confrontations. “King of the Monsters” is most entertaining when the camera lingers on Godzilla’s big, goofy, 1950s-looking face, or when we see Zilla et al., facing off from a bit of a distance, so we can appreciate the sheer silly fun of it all. Ah, but that’s the biggest problem here: the overall dearth of a sense of fun. As we get mired in storylines about a squabbling divorced couple and a Bond-like villain’s truly ill-conceived plan to create chaos, and we get heavy-handed lectures about how humans are the REAL monsters destroying the planet, it’s all so … serious. (I mean, the action takes us to Fenway Park and nobody even makes a bad Green Monster joke!) “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” (a continuation of the “MonsterVerse” that includes 2017’s “Kong: Skull Island”) takes place in present day, five years after the world (and San Francisco in particular) learned the hard way ancient, supposedly mythic creatures were in fact real. Now everyone is trying to figure out how to deal with these “titans,” as they’re called. Do we blow ‘em all up, or try to co-exist with them, because after all, they were here first, and maybe they’ll let us hang around as pets once they regain power. (No really, that’s essentially one of the arguments presented.) We’re told there are some 17 gigantic beasts, all in dormant states (for now), in secret outposts in China and Mexico and Arizona and Antarctica, and that’s a lot of secret outposts to keep secret. Of course, in the grand tradition of monster movies, these outposts are staffed by scientists and support personnel and heavily armed security forces, all of whom are shocked beyond belief and pretty much helpless to defend themselves when the creatures come to life and get cranky and start roaring and stomping and chomping. Vera Farmiga’s Dr. Emma Russell and Kyle Chandler’s Dr. Mark Russell were torn apart when they lost their son in the madness of “Godzilla” (2014) and are now divorced, with Emma having custody of their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown from “Stranger Things.”) While the embittered Mark drowned his sorrows in a bottle and went off to study wolves (remember how I told you there’s too much serious stuff?), Emma spent years perfecting a device known as the Orca, which is kind of like a super-duper Alexa enabling humans to communicate with Godzilla and other creatures on a high level. Charles Dance hams it up like a summer-stock Shakespearean player as Col. Alan Jonah, the ol’ reliable character of the decorated military man turned “eco-terrorist” who will stop at nothing to gain control of the Orca. Meanwhile, an all-star roster of supporting players including Sally Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson Jr., David Straitharn, Ziyi Zhang, Aisha Hinds, Ken Watanabe and Bradley Whitford pop in from time to time to deliver lines such as, “Something’s wrong!” and “That’s not possible!” and “Get out of there, NOW!” and “YOU’RE a monster!” (You might get a scene in which a monster approaches you and leans in REAL CLOSE and seems to look you in the eye before deciding whether to tear you apart or spare you. Or you might get a noble death, in which you sacrifice yourself to save the world. Or you might just get the ax off-screen.) We get shot after shot after shot after shot of various characters doing the green-screen reaction thing, often while getting soaked by the rain and somehow avoiding getting killed by fireballs and flying debris and monster stomps. As for the monsters: Godzilla and the three-headed monster King Ghidorah are the Rocky and Ivan Drago of the movie and get plenty of attention, but the likes of Mothra and Rodan should be complaining to their agents about lack of playing time. Just last month, legions of “Game of Thrones” fans were crying foul over the now-infamous “Battle of Winterfell” episode for being so under-lit, so dark and murky, it was virtually impossible to keep up with the action."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," Godzilla's been stomping cities and battling beasties for 65 years across more than 30 Japanese films and countless other media. You'd think this cinematic behemoth would be tried and tested, yet Hollywood still can't get it right. Godzilla: King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty and in theaters worldwide now, is the third American movie featuring the legendary Titan, after attempts in 1998 and 2014 disappointed audiences. The new flick even implies a link to the vintage version of the iconic creature by borrowing the US title of the very first Godzilla movie back in the 1950s.  In terms of direct links, King of the Monsters is a sequel to the dour 2014 Godzilla, and also draws on elements of 2017's delirious Kong: Skull Island. Five years after this new version of the atomic lizard stomped San Francisco, clandestine agency Monarch has tracked down assorted other giant monsters, called Titans, in hidden hibernation around the world. Luckily, Monarch has also created a device called the Orca to wake and placate the Titans. With the movie's McGuffin established, an eco-terrorist (played by Charles Dance from Game of Thrones) kidnaps a Monarch scientist (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter (Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown) so he can use the Orca to motivate the Titans to trash the planet. Sound complicated? That's just the first 20 minutes. From here, King of the Monsters rushes to introduce various characters, human and Titan, as we build to the first big fight sequence between Godzilla and his three-headed rival, King Ghidora. This first battle perfectly showcases all the film's problems. There's too much shaky camera work and too many quick cuts, making the action unclear. And unconvincing CGI gives the Titans, and the locations in which they roam, an odd crystalline quality. The set pieces are tied together by a bunch of talky scenes filmed with rapid camera movement to inject a sense of urgency and raise the stakes. Instead, it distances us from the characters. When the rampaging Titans cause the worst disasters in human history, we learn about it through impersonal news footage of ruined cities, failing to give us any sense of the human cost. The fast pace also leaves little breathing space for the human characters, who are poorly developed, with unclear objectives. It's hard to care about their fate or even what they're doing while the giant beasties duke it out. Which is unfortunate when you consider the stellar cast of Bradley Whitford, CCH Pounder, Ken Watanabe, Kyle Chandler, Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch and Ziyi Zhang. This talented crew does what they can with their underwritten characters, but it's just not enough -- you won't care when they're killed off, whether it's sudden or with a choking amount of melodrama. And that's if you can even see their demise through the CGI haze. As the bad guy plans to balance humanity and nature by inciting nature to crush humanity beneath its giant scaly foot, there's a hint of an intriguing moral question in there somewhere about ends justifying means. But this isn't explored in any depth. It doesn't bode well for the promised crossover Godzilla vs King Kong, coming in 2020. King of the Monsters isn't all bad though. The monster designs are striking and memorable despite the iffy CGI, and the final battle is cool to look at as long as you don't think about it too much. There are also moments when light and color give this mindless blockbuster a distinct palette, while Bear McCreary's score is appropriately grandiose and gives us a sense of the Titans' magnificence. Unfortunately, those elements don't make up for a poorly laid-out narrative, predictable climax or joyless ensemble of human characters, several of whom utter the Godzilla catchphrase ""Long live the king."""
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," You’d think making a Godzilla movie that stands up better against a series of bonkers monster movies starring guys in rubber suits blindly thrashing at each other would be easy, right? Sadly, the world doesn’t work that way. Whilst the 2014 Gareth Edwards film did give us a fresh perspective on the pop culture icon and was above and beyond Roland Emmerich’s disastrous 1998 attempt, it featured a very camera-shy titular monster and instead focused on unengaging human characters with barely a character trait to share between them. Fans have been clamouring for a modernized all-out brawl featuring their favourite Godzilla creatures in the vein of Destroy All Monsters for years, and with King of the Monsters that is certainly what they’ve been promising. The final result is a gonzo B movie spectacle that lacks much substance but is instead packed to the brim with action spectacle. Whilst it respects much of the mythology set up by its predecessor, this sequel tonally shifts away from the dour grounded approach of Edwards’ film and takes on a style closer in spirit to its sister production Kong: Skull Island. Whilst there is some build-up of tension before proceedings really kick into high gear, the film embraces showing the monsters right off the bat and relies much more on intensity rather than mystery to keep up the suspense. The plot is a fairly standard sci-fi adventure with very few surprises, and much of the narrative is conveyed through the cast barking exposition at each other between action set pieces. Whilst this approach is somewhat regressive and has definite room for improvement in areas like character motivation and world building, the new direction not only feels like a call-back to the similarly ludicrous plots of the old Toho productions but also just feels more honest. When you look at them on paper, both this and its predecessor have about the same amount of depth. However, whereas the prior film cloaked itself in an austere mood in a shallow claim at artistry, this one embraces its narrative simplicity and is unashamed of being a big dumb summer blockbuster. The film is not without some depth, coating its MacGuffin-led save-the-world plotline with environmental messages and mythological allegories that give proceedings an appropriate level of gravitas, whilst there are also plenty of nods to the classic films in both plot and design that’ll give hardcore Godzilla fans something to feel smug about. The previous film often attempted to compare itself to Jaws, focusing on the human protagonists and eschewing showing the monster until necessary, but forgot the reason it worked in Jaws was that the characters were vibrant and interesting apart from the whole shark business. Like with the plot, King of the Monsters eschews such pretentions and packs the cast full of stock genre characters bolstered by the natural personalities of the actors playing them. Kyle Chandler is the nominal lead as Dr. Mark Russell, and though he brings a lot of energy and charm to his performance the character is somewhat thinly developed with a standard “dead child has given me a pessimistic view of the world” backstory. Vera Farmiga has a lot more to play with as his estranged wife Emma and presents a fascinating moral conundrum, but the plot moves far too quickly for her motivations to get the fleshing out they desperately require; as is, her character’s decisions lack impact when we don’t have proper context. Millie Bobby Brown is also engaging as their daughter Madison but her impact in the plot is relegated only to the final act, leaving her character rendered to a mere plot device until then. Much of the supporting cast is made up of great character actors clearly having a good time, but there’s so many of them vying for attention that the aforementioned exposition scenes often feel crowded. Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch add some fun comic relief but one of them could have easily been dropped, the returning Sally Hawkins feels frankly superfluous when her plot roles could have been carried out by any number of other characters and, despite giving a magnetic sarcasm-filled performance as usual, Charles Dance’s antagonistic Colonel Jonah is never given an opportunity to truly shine. Once again, Ken Watanabe easily steals the film as Dr. Serizawa, adding much needed gravitas and pathos to even the most ridiculous situations; if only he could be in every monster movie. When the action in 2014’s Godzilla actually occurred, it was a glorious display of modern special effects that gave fans exactly what they’d been asking for. It was just a shame that it was a very short-lived joy. With King of the Monsters, they’ve not only upped the number of monsters on display but also greatly increased their screen presence. There are multiple incredible action sequences featuring these phenomenally-realised creatures threatening humanity and battling it out with each other, and most of the time it is an awesome spectacle that indulges in the sugar-addled childlike joy these movies should inspire; no movie has done it quite this well since Pacific Rim. Unfortunately, low lighting and obscuring elements like rain or fog sometimes obscure the action, along with some occasional claustrophobic cinematography and choppy editing. However, for every moment that is incomprehensible, there are at least five that are gorgeous and will inspire copious amounts of fan art. The CGI is impeccable and the creature design work is phenomenal, giving even the most ridiculous monster designs a tactile sense of verisimilitude. The film’s ultimate secret weapon is composer Bear McCreary, who not only orchestrates some fantastic original music utilising Japanese taiko music as inspiration, but also finally incorporates cues from the classic Godzilla theme into the score for an extra boost of fan service. Plus, his and Serj Tankian’s cover of Blue Oyster Cult’s “Godzilla” over the credits is, for lack of a more polite expression, f*cking badass. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is not going win over everyone. It’s an inherently preposterous movie that makes no apologies for itself, and yet that lack of guilt is exactly what makes it so fun. Whilst it could stand to develop its characters better and not so heavily rely on genre tropes, it understands the Godzilla mythos better than any prior version made outside of Japan. Whilst the 2014 film was merely a tribute to the 1954 original, King of the Monsters celebrates every incarnation of the monster in a haphazard but awe-inspiring way. Legendary’s Monsterverse may have been cooking on a slow burn until now, but with this film it finally feels like they’ve nailed down the approach for future efforts, and hopefully they continue to improve and top themselves with next year’s long-awaited rematch between Godzilla and King Kong."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," In 2014, Godzilla returned to the big screen in a fairly successful, well-reviewed revival directed by Gareth Edwards. However, two complaints dominated the conversation about Godzilla – the human characters were completely uninteresting and there just wasn’t enough monster-on-monster fighting. The validity of those complaints are still the subject of debate, after all nobody enters a Godzilla movie with expectations of nuanced human character and the choice to obscure the big beast for most of the movie was a deliberate choice in the vein of, say, Jaws. Five years later and Godzilla returns to the big screen in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and it would seem the makers of this gigantic sequel heeded every complaint levied at the 2014 film. The result is a sequel that’s overpacked and underwhelming, featuring plenty of monster-on-monster action but often in conditions that make it nearly impossible to follow the action which is the key selling point of this sequel. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is simply a monstrous disappointment. The sequel opens in San Francisco amidst the rubble of the first film’s climactic fight as Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), both scientists who work for the secret government agency Monarch, look for their missing son. In the big battle between Godzilla and the MUTOs, their young son was killed in the mayhem. Five years later, the wounds of the past have still left scars on the Russell family. Mark is estranged from his wife and has left Monarch to study wolves in the wild. Emma, on the other hand, continues to work with Monarch in studying the gigantic monsters known as Titans often with her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) by her side. Emma has developed a device called Orca which communicates with the gigantic beasts using some kind of sonic frequency that can make them docile. It’s very obviously the MacGuffin for the film. The first time we see the Orca in use is to awaken Mothra. But if everything worked out perfectly there wouldn’t be much of a movie. After Mothra is awakened, an ecoterrorist group led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) captures both Emma and Madison as well as the Orca with the plan to unleash all of the world’s hidden monsters to bring about a new kind of balance to the world, basically wiping out a sizable portion of the population and allowing nature to reclaim the Earth. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), each returning from the first film, track down Mark in order to utilize his expertise in tracking down the Orca as well as his ex-wife and daughter. Monarch assembles a team of scientists and soldiers for a globetrotting adventure to prevent the latest batch of monsters from being unleashed, but when the three-headed monster King Gidorah is set loose humanity’s only hope comes in the form of Godzilla, whom the title reminds us is king of the monsters. The first big monster fight in Godzilla: King of the Monsters takes place at a Monarch base in Antarctica amidst a blizzard. The sequence is absolutely chaotic in its construction and the elements chose for this fight ensure that most of what unfolds is absolutely unintelligible. I suspect that director Michael Dougherty realized just how incomprehensible everything was in this battle as he made sure to use the next scene to show a picture of significant character with “DECEASED” written beneath their picture. The subsequent fights also suffer from the same chaotic construction amplified by inclement weather conditions that it’s nigh impossible to follow the monsters attacking each other and the expansive roster of human characters. The entire roster of human characters, although incredibly well-cast, are just uninteresting and completely lacking in any depth. As the film gets to its monsters fighting, Dougherty often pulls back on the action to follow the humans scrambling through the chaos but there’s never any reason to care about any of these characters. They’re paper cutouts of characters mostly lacking in personality. The presence of Thomas Middleditch as a Monarch scientist, O’Shea Jackson Jr. as a solider, and Ziyi Zhang as another scientist are completely wasted. The only supporting character that seems to understand just what kind of schlock he’s in is Bradley Whitford who is a rather spirited cynic trapped in an absurd monster movie. Combined with the underwhelming main characters, there is a complete void of humanity at the heart of the Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which wouldn’t be a problem if we weren’t forced to spend so much time with these nothing characters. I’d be willing to give Godzilla: King of the Monsters a pass on its horrendous human characters if it delivered on its promise of crazed kaiju action, but the action is so incomprehensible and underwhelming that it fails on its most basic level. There are nods to the expansive lore of Godzilla and his titanic compatriots, but they’re minor moments of fan service for the most dedicated fans or little teases for next year’s impending Godzilla vs. Kong. The destruction of King of the Monsters levels metropolitan cities in a matter of moments but it left me more bored than anything. All the advanced computer effects in the world can’t make this sequel any more thrilling than a man in a rubber suit laying waste to cardboard cities. In trying to please those who didn’t care much for the first film, the brains behind Godzilla: King of the Monsters threw so much at the screen they overwhelm you with inanity to the point of numbness. Sometimes a lot less is a whole lot more. Simultaneously overstuffed and underwhelming, Godzilla: King of the Monsters features plenty of kaiju fights but no reason to care what happens to anyone or anything in this monstrously disappointing sequel. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," 
Emerging from the loud, overlong spectacle that is Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I was
struck by the disheartening realization that what I had just seen owed more to Transformers than kaiju. Although the
movie takes great pains to pay homage to 65 years of Godzilla history (even going so far as to appropriate music from
the original Toho classics), the relentless manner in which it pummels the
audience is so like what Michael Bay perfected in his soulless robo-movies as
to be almost indistinguishable. Scenes of devastation – admittedly necessary to
any Godzilla film – are lovingly
presented in all their detail, ignoring the vast human cost. Evacuations are briefly
mentioned but there’s no escaping that the death toll in this movie must be
over 1,000,000 – perhaps by an order of magnitude. The problem with Transformers has always been related to
the fetishization of destruction – and that’s exactly what happens here. One of knocks on Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla (of which I am a fan, although I acknowledge some shortcomings)
was “too little Godzilla.” I thought the long buildup was appropriate and
generated anticipation for the big reveal. This time around, there’s more
Godzilla and he’s joined by three other classic Toho monsters: Rodan, Mothra,
and King Ghidorah. Missing in action, because he’s being held back for the next
movie, is King Kong. This creates a problem for the filmmakers that they’re never
able to solve. Kong is mentioned on several occasions but (save for a short clip
from Skull Island) never shown. It’s
a little like the tap-dancing done by Iron Man 3 to justify the absence of the other Avengers.  The obvious reason why anyone would see Godzilla: King of the Monsters is to watch skyscraper-sized
creatures beat each other up. That’s been the appeal of kaiju since the ‘60s
and ‘70s when every new Godzilla movie featured him taking on some new opponent.
Later on, the movies turned into campy monster-fests and Godzilla even got a
son! King of the Monsters takes these
WWE-style smackdowns more seriously than Toho ever did; this is a somber film
that touches on themes of eco-terrorism and genocide. The undercard (Rodan vs.
Mothra) is underwhelming, but the headline bout (Godzilla vs. Ghidorah) lives
up to its billing. It goes three rounds, although only the final fight is shown
in its full glory. For reasons known only to him, director Michael Dougherty
elects to present parts of the kaiju death-match literally in the background. There’s
also a lot of rain and/or snow, which makes me wonder whether there was
sufficient concern about the special effects that some degree of obfuscation
was deemed prudent. The success of any monster movie is in large part dependent
on what happens during the breaks and downtime between the red meat battles. No
one expects great plotting or strong character development in theses productions
but there are ways to keep viewers engaged when the focus isn’t on Godzilla or the
other Titans. Whatever those may be, they have eluded Daughtry. He gives us
flat characters traipsing through a dumb narrative. Okay – even those sins might
be forgiven (or at least forgiveable) if he didn’t spend so damn much time on
them. I recognize the need to have human beings in a movie like this and it
helps if the actors are at least moderately recognizable. But too much screen time
is devoted to the trite, lackluster family drama of Dr. Emma Russell (Vera
Farmiga), Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), and their daughter, Madison (Millie
Bobby Brown). And rarely has such a stable of Oscar/BAFTA/Golden Globe nominees
– Ken Watanabe, Zhang Ziyi, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, and Charles Dance –
been so utterly and completely wasted. (I’m still confused by why Zhang played
two roles but I guess I may not have been paying close enough attention.) There is, by the way, no reason to give a synopsis of the
film because the bones of the story are unnecessary. All you need to know is that
when the big boys come out to play, things get destroyed. They blow up. People
die in large numbers. The monsters fight each other. They go nuclear. What more
do you need to know? Who cares whether a young girl is caught between her mad
scientist mother and Godzilla-hating father? Who cares whether an eco-terrorist
looking like Tywin Lannister is out to reboot the homo sapiens species?  Transformers isn’t
the only dumbed-down Hollywood spectacle that came to mind watching King of the Monsters. I was also
reminded of Twister. Many of the film’s
beats involved the implacability of fighting a force of nature. Before the Godzilla
franchise turned into a kid-friendly cash cow for Toho, it was intended to be a
serious, adult-oriented metaphor for what happens when human beings tamper with
forces beyond their wisdom (thematically similar to Frankenstein). Gareth Edwards brought back a little of that five
years ago. In King of the Monsters, however,
we’re given a full-blown sermon about the relationship between the awakening of
the Titans and Climate Change. I guess we’re in an era when the concept of subtlety no longer exists. Metaphors are
most effective when no one pauses, erects a neon sign, and provides a long-winded
explanation.  I desperately
wanted to like this movie because, as a kid, Godzilla was a part of my pre-teen
years. There were things about King of
the Monsters that I enjoyed, most of which had to do with the battles.
Those are well-executed and it’s impossible to deny the frisson I felt during
the first Godzilla/Ghidorah clash. For kaiju fans, the movie offers its share
of goosebumps moments. Overall, however, there’s too much clutter – most involving
human “drama,” inane politics, and lunatics who believe the solution to the
world’s problems is to wipe out most of the people. Watching King of the Monsters involves enduring
less-than-interesting stuff while waiting for the good scenes. (For those who
are wondering a about a post-credits scene, there is one. It’s short and surprisingly
does not involve King Kong. It’s also
completely unnecessary and probably not worth sitting through ten minutes of names unless you like
Bear McCreary’s score.) The nostalgia factor associated with Godzilla: King of the Monsters is arguably higher than that of Aladdin, at least among men of a certain
age. The film will also be popular with kids. But there are too many gaps in
the cross-generational/cross-gender appeal for the movie to emerge as one of the
2019 summer movie season’s big winners. Some will argue this is all set-up for
next year’s Kong/Godzilla rematch. After watching King of the Monsters, however, I sadly find myself less excited
about that outing. "
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," One of the keys to the success of Gareth Edwards' 2014 ""Godzilla"" is restraint. The first half of the film is spent building up the big guy's first appearance onscreen — and the spectacular visual effects ensure the moment isn't a letdown. Five years later, Michael Dougherty's ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" takes the opposite approach to diminishing results. The movie's opening minutes take us back to Godzilla's battle against the MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms) in San Francisco, where husband-and-wife scientists Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma (Vera Farmiga) Russell save their young daughter Madison but lose their son. Skipping ahead to the present, we learn Monarch, the secret scientific organization devoted to studying the MUTOs, has spent the intervening years discovering more of the massive beasts — they call them ""titans"" — around the world, 17 and counting. Following a divorce, Mark has retreated from it all, living alone in the Colorado wilderness. Emma, along with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), is stationed at a Monarch outpost in China, where she's developed a device to communicate with the titans via sonar. Naturally, that's a valuable piece of equipment, and Emma and Madison quickly are taken hostage by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), a former British Army officer turned ecoterrorist. To be fair, ""King of the Monsters"" features superb creature design — its roster of kaiju includes old favorites Mothra, Rodan and the three-headed, dragon-like King Ghidora — and gorgeous, even painterly images. Mothra's bright, glowing appearance is particularly striking in a film dominated by grays and browns, and Rodan emerging from a long dormant Mexican volcano is simultaneously beautiful and terrible. Even amid the constant storms that follow them around, the kaiju throwdowns — during which cities all over the world are reduced to rubble — are easy enough to follow. Dougherty, who directs and co-wrote the screenplay with Zach Shields, has obvious affection for these titans — perhaps too much. He gives them so much attention — not to mention screen time — that it quickly becomes numbing; what begins as awe-inspiring spectacle becomes routine. Underwritten human roles further dull the movie's impact. This is the kind of film that virtually cries out for an actor who oozes charisma simply by appearing — someone of the Dwayne Johnson mold. Lacking that, at least give it some of the devious humor that played such a big role in Dougherty's holiday horror cult classics ""Trick 'r Treat"" (2007) and ""Krampus"" (2015). The cast — which includes Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Ziyi Zhang and O'Shea Jackson Jr. — certainly is capable, but they're hamstrung by having to play everything deadly serious instead of acknowledging the total lunacy around them. Only Bradley Whitford, as a scientist who insists Godzilla travels so quickly by traversing giant subterranean tunnels, provides any real comic relief. Frequent references to Kong and Skull Island are setting up next year's ""Godzilla vs. Kong,"" which will be a sequel to both ""King of the Monsters"" and 2017's ""Kong: Skull Island."" Based on the three previous films, it's sure to look fantastic, but let's hope it adopts more of the offbeat, character-centric approach of the latter than the unrelenting grim tone of the former.

"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," Technically, of course, Godzilla has come a long way since the guy-in-the-rubber-suit days of the 1950s, when he first saw the light of a projector bulb. With Hollywood taking the reins from his originator, Tokyo’s Toho company, and throwing multimillions of the latest CG technology at him, he’s now one impressive sight. Massive, scaly, weighty: tons of reptilian menace on big clawed feet. And his Toho cohorts have gotten similar upgrades this time as well: Rodan, Mothra and, biggest and baddest of all, Ghirdorah, the three-headed, fire-breathing flying dragon. “Monster Zero,” the humans in the picture dub him. The alpha-est of alpha creatures. And boy, does he hate Godzilla. Around the globe these two go, from Antarctica to the U.S. and stops in between, grappling, biting, crushing and whaling the living bejesus out of each other. Puny humans stampede in terror. As an undercard, Mothra and Rodan battle and batter. Curiously though, director Michael Dougherty and his filmmaking team obscure the battle footage in darkness, smoke and downpours, making murky much of the imagery. This was also a problem with 2014’s “Godzilla,” from director Gareth Edwards, the opening salvo in what’s being called Monsterverse, a joint franchise effort from Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment. King Kong is part of that -verse, and the end of this movie unmistakably teases to a sequel in which the two big guys square off on Skull Island. The picture elaborates on a theme that’s been central to the series since the 1954 original movie in which Godzilla, or Gojira in Japanese, was brought to life by atom-bomb tests. This “Godzilla” puts forth the proposition that mankind is the real monster. A scientist (played by Vera Farmiga) calls humankind — polluter, overpopulator, warmonger — an “infection.” She, along with an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance), believe the megamonsters are nature’s way of controlling the infection by killing off troublesome human beings. In order to save the planet, humanity has got to go. Opposing that point of view is a scientist (Ken Watanabe, back from seeing service in the 2014 movie) who argues for coexisting with the monsters, Godzilla, especially. Meanwhile, Kyle Chandler, playing the Farmiga character’s ex-husband, keeps popping up at many key junctures frantically and ineffectively searching for his ex-wife and their daughter (Millie Bobby Brown), who’s being dragged along by Mom in her save-the-planet efforts. Dad is underfoot of the military’s Godzilla-fighting efforts more often than not. As usual, the military is useless against the monsters. Only a monster can defeat a monster, and for a while Godzilla gets the worst of it from Ghidorah. At one point, he’s down for the count. ★★ “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” with Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance. Directed by Michael Dougherty, from a screenplay by Dougherty and Zach Shields. 132 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action, violence and destruction and some language. Opens May 31 at multiple theaters."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," Despite its impersonal character work, Gareth Edwards’s Godzilla shrewdly used its humans to help ground the film in a recognizable reality. Its images of creatures towering over and smashing through skyscrapers emphasized their godlike nature. That film’s haunting majesty is evident in spots throughout Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but Michael Dougherty’s sequel is closer in spirit to the films in the Godzilla series that immediately followed Ishiro Honda’s original. Here, the atmosphere of existential terror that pervaded Edwards’s film is largely replaced by a more crowd-pleasing emphasis on action as a smorgasbord of monsters collide with the giant lizard in a series of epic battles. For a time, King of the Monsters is in lockstep with many of its predecessors for wearing its allegorical heart on its sleeve, understanding these monsters to bring a reckoning for so much devastation caused by humans. Monarch, the clandestine organization devoted to studying and preserving the “titans” discovered in increasing numbers around the world, sees a creature like Godzilla as a natural component of the Earth’s immune system, capable of restoring balance to the planet’s ecosystems. It’s an idea that Monarch scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) takes to extreme lengths when, armed with a titan-summoning sonar device, she sets about waking the dormant monsters in order to bring about a great cleansing. The film, then, is part of a growing trend of blockbusters to embrace absolution for the human race, and the primitive, bestial carnage of the titans makes them well suited to embody the unpremeditated, unfeeling nature with which the planet might rid itself of us. Unfortunately, it isn’t long before the film gets fatally bogged down in thin character drama, emphasizing the conflict between Emma and her ex-husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler), over their shared grief over losing a child in Godzilla and of Emma kidnapping their surviving daughter, Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown). Scenes of Mark talking about finding Maddie are redundant to the point of parody, and Emma doesn’t exactly make for an effective villain, as she blanches at her own plan almost immediately after setting it into motion. The film also leans into the idea propagated by many of the older Godzilla sequels: that the monster is inherently benevolent. That was an impression that was compellingly muddied by Edwards’s film, which suggested that any salvation Godzilla brought to humans was the incidental result of the beast’s biological imperative to enforce its alpha status over its rivals. When King of the Monsters arrives at its moments of pure spectacle, however, it’s as though the visuals are directly countering the deficiencies and questionable thematic turns of Dougherty and Zach Shields’s screenplay. When Monarch scientists aren’t debating Godzilla’s benevolence, we see the monster simply asserting itself against the titans that Emma frees, particularly King Ghidorah, a three-headed alien dragon freed from a glacier in Antarctica. The film takes pains to suggest that Godzilla is a force of good, only to then casually dispel that notion as the monster moves through human terrain, bringing down skyscrapers with spectacular ease and blasting apart entire blocks with his atomic fire breath. The clashes between Godzilla and Ghidorah are hellish conflagrations of lightning and fire. Elsewhere, such details as the gales of superheated wind and volcanic ash emitted by the flying monster Rodan as it soars over cities and swats fighter jets speak to the futility of human intervention against such gigantic creatures. The action sequences are never incomprehensible, but the sight of beasts fighting each other as cities collapse around them is certainly overwhelming. There’s a nightmarish beauty to these battles that epitomizes a nihilism buried under the more sentimental heroics with which Godzilla has been saddled. Dougherty lacks Edwards’s painterly skill but retains that filmmaker’s sense of scale. Even the film’s perfunctory incorporation of a self-contained mythology—about ancient death cults devoted to city-leveling eldritch creatures—brings a pulpy Lovecraftian edge to the story. At its best, the film is a rare American blockbuster that paints a wide-ranging picture of humans robbed of agency, reminding us that we’re scarcely masters of our own fate. Which makes it all the more frustrating when King of the Monsters sets about undermining the bleakness of that message by reaffirming the traditional blockbuster’s allegiance to human perseverance. The film’s inability to decide whether Godzilla is a guardian angel or an uncaring, almost deist supreme being zaps the franchise of its captivating, humbling depiction of humans being insignificant compared to the powerful might of Earth’s self-persevering whims.

"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," Despite a colossal budget and a hefty 130-minute running time, it still feels like Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is stretched a little thin. We’re not just talking about the plot here, which sends the Titan-hunting Monarch team and always-at-11 angry dad Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) racing around the globe to get his kidnapped family back and, arguably more importantly, stop Charles Dance’s villain from unleashing a legion of slumbering monsters. No, one of the biggest issues is that it seems to be serving too many masters, racing to satisfy too many needs. On a superficial level, this seems to be a direct response to the “not enough monsters” criticism of Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla (a film this reviewer loved). Much like Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ Kong: Skull Island, KOTM delivers massive action sequences, kaiju battles and endless glorying in the sheer gigantic majesty of these creatures. With Dougherty’s love of all things with sharp teeth firmly established in Trick R Treat and Krampus it’s not surprising that the film soars when the beasts are unleashed. Each glorious silhouette, each thundering arrival out of the storm, each seat-rattling roar…if you’re a monster movie fan these moments should put a grin on your face. However, while the filmmakers don’t completely abandon Edwards’ shoot-from-the-street visual style and there is a real effort made to include the core environmental message of the Toho originals, the human element is muddled by another over-packed cast which doesn’t have Skull Island’s ‘Nam movie aesthetic to disappear into and a script that seems to, if not resent its human characters, then at least behave like their neglectful babysitter. You could pick pretty much any actor out of the ensemble and correctly describe them as under-utilised: O’Shea Jackson Jr,  Zhang Ziyi, Dance, Thomas Middleditch, and especially Sally Hawkins, who has more screen-time this time around but is somehow harder done by. Bradley Whitford is too much of a pro to allow all his crackpot scientist’s comedy moments to miss the mark and Ken Watanabe’s tireless work lending gravitas is essential, but the splintered Russell family is supposed to be the film’s anchor. Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown are capable of working with limited materials but they are actively undermined by woeful dialogue and dull characterisation. When Brown gets a chance to shine in the final act you can’t help but wonder what the point of Chandler’s character was in the first place. With the human element so lacking, many viewers may find the actively daft plot something of an uphill struggle. It’s all too spoilery to go into too much detail here but it’s worth noting that many of the more ludicrous ideas come directly from previous Toho movies and some are so fantastically left-field that they’re just as likely to prompt a delighted giggle as they are an exhausted eye-roll. And when it comes down to it, the script is a delivery system for the set-pieces which, as previously mentioned, are mostly pretty great. As much as Dougherty enjoys showing off the size of these creatures, he can also make them scary up close. Rodan’s big attack is genuinely intense, Ghidorah is both nightmarish and the subject of a Three Stooges reference, Mothra is beautiful and deadly, and although Gojira himself is kept on the bench for surprisingly long stretches of the film, there’s nothing quite like the way he makes an entrance. This isn’t the sequel we were hoping for but King Of The Monsters delivers where it absolutely needs to. It certainly is stupid and yes, the characters are far less interesting than the monsters, but it’s also giant escapist fun and a gleeful showcase for some wonderful monsters. It’s hard to judge the film too harshly when the kaiju gave us so much joy.

"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," Central theme -- that giant monsters may represent a way to halt humanity's destruction due to climate change -- is a powerful one, particularly when characters talk about ecological balance. But what movie doesn't say is that the balance would come about by wiping out a significant part of the world's population, which is hardly a positive message. Emma and Mark Russell are brilliant scientists hoping to prevent war and destruction, but they go about their aims in different ways. Emma is the most complicated character; she's willing to sacrifice many people for greater good of humankind, but wants to keep her own family members safe. Madison is an ethical young person who sees the flaws in her mom's logic (but doesn't have a better humanity-saving idea to offer). Extensive racial and ethnic diversity within supporting cast; main characters are all white. Extensive, near-constant violent scenes, generally involving giant monsters battling each other or humans running in terror (and often not making it). Giant monster battles are bloodless, even when one monster's head is lopped off. People are crushed, eaten, set on fire, hurled through the air, dropped into vast pits, etc., though often faceless, far away. Countless people are killed in giant accidents, but camera doesn't linger on dead bodies, and viewers don't see blood or gore. Parents need to know that Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the sequel to 2014's Godzilla; it features the same giant lizard, as well as a host of other massive monsters. Expect destruction on a massive scale: Giant swathes of land and cities full of people are wiped out by monsters who stomp through civilization heedlessly. Scores of people are killed -- crushed, eaten, dropped from great heights, hurled against walls, imprisoned in giant webs, etc. -- but there's no blood or gore, and the deaths are usually pictured from a distance. That lessens the impact, but young/sensitive viewers might still be scared. A couple of deaths are scarier, including ones in which characters sacrifice their own lives to save others. Romance/sex is almost nonexistent, save for a few references to mating monsters, and there's no drinking (one character does have a beer on his desk and refers to inviting a monster over for a beer). Cursing is infrequent, but characters do say ""f--k,"" ""s--t, ""goddamn,"" ""ass,"" and ""bitch,"" generally in reference to the monsters. The movie's central theme, in which humans wish to find ways to reverse the damage we've done to our planet, is a positive one, but the method one particular scientist is working toward will only succeed if huge numbers of people die. The supporting cast has extensive diversity, but the main characters are all white, and none of them are given particularly meaty arcs. Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, and Kyle Chandler co-star. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Five years after the giant lizard ran amuck in San Francisco, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS begins as more than a dozen more of the monsters that humans call ""Titans"" are waking up all over the world. The U.S. government is eager to wipe them all out, but secretive monster-hunting organization Monarch believes that the ancient creatures are a crucial element of the earth's natural balance. When a new ""alpha"" rival to Godzilla, King Ghidorah, rises from the earth, humanity is in danger of being wiped out altogether. The only hope is Orca, the machine invented by scientists Emma and Mark Russell (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler), which can communicate with the monsters. Will Godzilla be humankind's savior -- or its doom?  Thunderously loud and overly long, this continuation in the Godzilla franchise does have some rousing monster fights, but it's marred by a muddled storyline and blah visuals. Which is a pity, because there are some interesting ideas at work in this particular kaiju outing. While most American Godzilla takes have flattened his story into a ""big lizard arises, town goes squish"" framework, King of the Monsters pulls in some of the nuance of the Japanese original, in which Godzilla's destructive force represented the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nature gone terribly wild due to human intervention. As Emma explains in one of King's long, tedious expository scenes, our earth is soon to be uninhabitable -- but maybe, just maybe, the monsters waking up all over the world aren't meant to pound the last nail in our coffin, but instead to bring about the earth's rebirth. It's a powerful idea for our times of climate change terror, but it doesn't land, because King ultimately is more interested in monster battles than the humans who are running away from them. Kaiju fans may get a few thrills from seeing retakes on old friends like Mothra and Rodan, but none of the monsters is pretty to look at, and they're so similar in design (save for Mothra, who occasionally unveils her shimmering wings to lovely effect) that it can be hard to tell exactly which monster is fighting which. And the human part of the plot makes it difficult to care about why. King is stuffed with absolutely top-notch actors, but they're not given much to do besides react to the battling giants. We're expected to understand that Emma has a master plan with her monster-speak McGuffin and to care about her relationship with Mark and her daughter, Madison (a wasted Millie Bobby Brown), but the emotional beats aren't there. It's just one thudding, confusing, numbing monster battle after another. And that big lug of a lizard deserves better. Families can talk about how this film differs from the original 1956 Godzilla movie -- or from the versions made in 1998 and 2014. What's most compelling in each of these movies: the story or the nonstop action? Why? Japanese Godzilla filmmakers used monster suits and miniatures to create their special effects, not CGI or stop-motion. If you've seen the original (or its imitators), which do you prefer: low-tech ""practical"" effects or something more realistic and high-tech? Which usually works better in movies?  Talk about Godzilla's violence and destruction. How does the impact of the massive-scale devastation seen in this type of a movie compare to more realistic violence? Do you think these kinds of movies can desensitize viewers to violence? Why do you think Godzilla has been remade so many times? What do you think filmmakers hope to achieve by remaking a classic? How often do you prefer remakes to the original?

"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," The tagline is the same as in 1956, when American actor Raymond Burr (“Ironside”) lent his American mug to an early Japanese MIRS entry. Here, the film picks up five years from when “Godzilla” (2014) left off, namely the leveling of San Francisco, with all “titans” now neatly in hibernation. Some players from that chapter (Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe) reprise their roles as scientists, appearing before congress to try to derail plans to exterminate Godzilla and the other titans – while in hibernation, a cryptozoological agency known as Monarch has pretty much put all the beasts in an electronic lockdown. We also meet the Russells, a family of Monarch scientists fractured by the loss of their son in the stomping of San Fran. The father, Mark (Kyle Chandler, so good in “Manchester by the Sea” and “Zero Dark Thirty”), unable to cope with the grief, has gone off to film wolves in the wilds, while wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) and daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown, from “Stranger Things”) are nestled in a forest abode near one such titan bunker where they witness the larval birth of Mothra.  Before the flaming pterodactyl Rodan and three-header King Ghidorah – aka Monster Zero – make it into the mix, of course we need some zany zealot to bring down the boom. In this case that’s a former British special ops officer played with charm and menace by Charles Dance, who has had an awakening of his own and sees the only way to right humankind’s environmental wrongs being to raise the titans and let them cull the population. Much philosophical talk is made early on about man being an infection, and the titans something like white blood cells to take care of it. Sure, okay, nothing new: The original Godzilla was an incarnation raised by man’s use of nukes and nuclear energy, so the themes imbued here by writer/director Michael Dougherty seem in line. And a little biorhythm device Emma has made (the thing everybody wants) has the monster-whispering effect that the two thumb-sized Japanese twins had in the old MIRS flicks.  But this is a big CGI flick, seen to good effect as Brazil gets bowled over by Rodan and Ghidorah (which, given all the talk of infections and viruses, sounds even more like an STD) gets awakened from his icy crib. Boston, home of the Russells, hosts a Godzilla-Ghidorah smackdown – and if some of those new high rises in the Seaport irk your aesthetic eye, here’s a shot at some virtual schadenfreude.  The film does what it needs to. The trio of lead actors manage to elicit enough emotion and Godzilla, a hero whose mission and morals are as straightforward as Clint Eastwood’s indelible “Man with No Name,” gets to don the superhero cape, if just for a small while. It’s bang-bang fun that clicks by with smart, rapid pacing, all the while reminding us of just how much a mess we’ve made of this planet. Tom Meek is a writer living in Cambridge.

"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,"This film hasn't met a scene that it couldn't grind into agonising tedium by staging an expository group discussion about how monsters use sonar, how they travel underground or how they exhibit pack behaviour."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," The monsters are on the loose again but this time all of mankind is in danger of domination or, worse, extermination. It is up to the cryptozoology Monarch agency to put a stop to the terror of “Godzilla: King of the Monsters.”"
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,"I think this movie has a bit of an identity crisis... You don't know if they're trying to be a cheesy, 1990s action movie or if they're trying to elevate the genre and take it more seriously."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Heck, maybe it was appropriate to show us so many monsters, what with the next hurricane, flood and tornado right around the corner, ready to remind us we are all at nature's mercy. But that doesn't make it good storytelling."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," The Pitch: It’s been more than five years since humanity became aware of Godzilla, one of several ancient monsters known as Titans — older than time and larger than skyscrapers — who are beginning a conspicuous resurgence on the world stage. While governments and militaries contemplate the destruction left by these creatures, high-tech cryptozoology outfit Monarch is fighting to preserve, study, and find a way to co-exist with them. The key to that might well be the “Orca”, a communications device created by Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) that can tap into the Titans’ bio-acoustics and send friendly signals. But when she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by a group of eco-terrorists (led by Charles Dance), Monarch brings in former Titan scientist — and Emma’s ex-husband — Mark (Kyle Chandler) to get them back. These events also coincide with the rise of several new Titans, including the three-headed Ghidorah, the flying fire demon Rodan, and the insect-like god Mothra, all of whom pose new threats to the future of humanity. Luckily, mankind has a big, green, scaly friend on their side, who might just need to take over the planet for good. Go, Go Godzilla: Right off the bat, Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels like a deliberate course correction from 2014’s Godzilla. Where the latter was dark, cerebral, and apocalyptic, King of the Monsters is schlocky and desperately crowd-pleasing. The human-to-kaiju balance is decidedly flipped, with Godzilla and his pals taking up a great deal of cinematic real estate (and destroying most of the physical kind), all while the puny humans dash about underfoot. Zilla himself is back, though a bit bigger, dumber, and chonkier than his previous incarnation. He’s a thicc boi, to be sure, and it’s always a joy to see him get down to work smashing Ghidorah’s face in or giving arch dramatic-hamster looks at the camera. The rest of the Titans fare little better — Rodan seems to be the only other one who gets to express a discernible personality (he’s a delicious bastard), while Ghidorah spends too much time as a bland baddie and Mothra gets too little to do altogether. Most of the creatures invariably take a nap in the middle of the movie, whether through the exhaustion of battle or sheer boredom, and it’s tempting to not want to do the same in the film’s more languid second act. Nights in Rodan: In theory, that sounds like a good thing, and in fairness, the kaiju fights don’t disappoint. In terms of sheer, chaotic spectacle, King of the Monsters is the closest an American Godzilla film has come to the campy fun of Toho’s ’70s output. Titans slap each other around like they’re in a WWE Inferno match, exchange energy blasts, and gleefully engage in an entire GDP’s worth of property damage. It’s still a little ugly, and more than a little hard to see (DP Lawrence Sher bathes the frame in neon blue lights and hellish smoke), but there’s an attempt to strike a balance between Edwards’ sense of terrifying scale and the joy of smashing action figures together. Director Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘r Treat, Krampus) practically has a master’s degree in schlock, and he’s designed King of the Monsters in a manner not unlike a Saturday morning cartoon. There’s also clearly a reverence for the kaiju, as Godzilla’s cinematic origins are revisited through the original Toho themes by composer Bear McCreary, in addition to a number of callbacks to plot points and elements from the ’54 Godzilla. For instance, the Oxygen Destroyer makes a comeback, and one scene deliberately echoes the sacrificial scene at the climax of that original film. The Folly of Man: It’s a great shame, then, that King of the Monsters still has to worry about these pesky humans. Gareth Edwards’ solution in the 2014 Godzilla was to deliberately underplay them, making them barely present in a film more about mankind’s collective reckoning with its own insignificance. In King of the Monsters, the characters are more defined, but when they’re this one-dimensional, is that really an improvement? Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields attempt to center the story around the Spielbergian angle of a broken family on each side of the conflict — Mark wants to kill the things, Emma wants to set them free to reclaim the Earth, with Madison stuck in the middle — but they’re all given so little to do amongst the kaiju chaos. Early trailers indicated that Brown’s Maddie would be more of a central character, but she’s largely sidelined until the final act. This isn’t to say that summer monster movies should also be trenchant family melodramas, but King of the Monsters really drops the ball with its potentially intriguing central dynamic. The rest of Monarch fares little better. While some cast members stand out such as Dr. Chen (Ziyi Zhang), who may have a mysterious connection to Mothra’s past, or the reprise of Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), the rest are stuck grunting out Emmerich-level wisecracks and shouting out hull integrity percentages. Most of Monarch’s action takes place on a giant, Helicarrier-like stealth ship called the Argo, which makes the whole thing feel like one big A-list anime cosplay (not that that’s a bad thing in concept). Bradley Whitford gets the worst of it as a droll Rick Sanchez type who feels like he belongs in an entirely different movie. And then there’s Dance’s sniveling villain, who barely gets anything to say and disappears from the rest of the film after a certain point, sure to crop up in a sequel. The Verdict: Long story short, Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels a lot like GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and you’re either on board with that or you’re not. With its deliberately brain-dead presentation and screeching howls of fan service, King of the Monsters was never going to pretend to be anything more than a $200 million monster smackdown. It’s then a shame that it still feels like it’s trying to do too much, rushing some plot points and dragging others out while mishandling its human characters in an overstuffed narrative. There are moments in King of the Monsters where one would feel right at home sitting in front of the TV in their pajamas, shoving down spoonfuls of Sugar Smacks and cackling with glee. But Doughtery and co. overplay their hand just a little bit too much, whether through its Amblin focus on family or its eco-nihilism about mankind forfeiting its stewardship of the planet. In the end, King of the Monsters is too philosophical to be a good dumb movie, and too dumb to be all that much fun. Where’s It Playing?: Godzilla: King of the Monsters picks up a bus and throws it back down on Friday, May 31st. Duck and grab your tickets now!"
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"A sequel beckons even as we file out, fatigued, from the end credits."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," This is the first Godzilla film Hollywood has given us in five years, and I confess to having little memory of what happened in the last one – especially where the human cast is concerned. Did Bryan Cranston live or die? Who did Elizabeth Olsen play? I had to look this stuff up, although none of it much matters. Godzilla, King of the Monsters features a largely new set of characters – and anyway the monsters are the stars of the show. Appearing alongside the reptilian Godzilla on this occasion are several of his long-term associates, including the pterosaur Rodin, the giant moth Mothra, and the three-headed dragon King Ghidorah. All of these originated in the productions of Japan's Toho studio, doing battle across the decades in varying combinations in an example of a shared “cinematic universe” long before it became a stock Hollywood marketing ploy. Even now the rights have been signed over, the question persists of whether Hollywood ought to be making Godzilla films at all. This is not solely a matter of tut-tutting about “cultural appropriation”, a phenomenon that flows both ways, as you might glean from the fact that Godzilla (or Gojira, as he's known at home) began as Japan's answer to King Kong. The problem is that Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn't seem to know what to do with its monsters other than show them off. Gareth Edwards, who directed the 2014 Godzilla, has been replaced here by horror and superhero specialist Michael Dougherty (Trick 'r Treat) but Dougherty sticks with the techno-thriller mode established by Edwards, aiming as far as possible to bring the fantasy down to earth. In this timeline, the existence of Godzilla and his kind (referred to as “titans”) has become just another fact of life. Even when large-scale destruction is unleashed across the planet, there's little sense of visceral horror: most of the action takes place in confined spaces – a secret base, a submarine – where the catastrophe is monitored from afar by the members of Monarch, the international organisation set up to study the titans and vanquish them if need be. Needless to say, the days are long gone when such creatures could be embodied by men in latex suits. Here, vast amounts of knowledge, expense and labour have been poured into reimagining the look of these digitally animated titans, and into sophisticated sound design centred on their shrieks and roars. Casting appears to have been left in the hands of accountants who've run the numbers and come up with a list of names to entice every possible demographic. Kyle Chandler is a credible but not too pricey leading man, Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things appeals to the kids, Thomas Middleditch from Silicon Valley provides some hip comedy stylings, Zhang Ziyi is there for the Chinese market, and so on down the line. The job of providing some dramatic heft is assigned to Vera Farmiga, as a Monarch scientist who concludes that the destruction of large portions of humanity might not be a bad thing. The film stops in its tracks long enough to let her make a plausible case, but it's soon clear that her argument isn't going to fly – especially once we meet her mentor, played by Charles Dance in the manner of an especially rigid Marxist academic. The intended message isn't entirely clear. In his original incarnation, Gojira was a potent symbol for the ongoing threat of nuclear war, and for the destruction already carried out on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Here, the allegory is much looser and vaguer: do the titans stand for terrorist groups, or the prospect of ecological collapse, or ... what? The current Godzilla films can't even be seen as expressing the ideology of a particular nation, given that the MonsterVerse – the mega-franchise they belong to – is jointly bankrolled by Warner Bros and the Chinese-owned Legendary Entertainment. True, we're left with the idea that a distinction exists between decent monsters and purely destructive ones, but not with much sense of how we, as civilians, can be expected to tell one from the other."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"  Godzilla: King of the Monsters had a difficult task, to expand Legendary Pictures' fledgling MonsterVerse to pave the way for the anticipated Godzilla vs. Kong crossover in 2020 while delivering all of the action, visuals and storytelling we've come to expect from more than 30 franchise films, stretching back to 1954. And, for the most part, director Michael Dougherty's sequel meets the lofty expectations of fans.   One of the criticisms of its predecessor, 2014's Godzilla, is that the film took too long to introduce the title character, and therefore delayed the action audiences were there to see. King of the Monsters remedies that. Not only do we follow Godzilla for most of the film, but there are also the other kaiju, referred to as Titans, revealed in rapid succession — Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah. Dougherty, a Godzilla super-fan, knew what people wanted to see: epic fights between equally epic monsters.   The are thoughtfully designed; they're larger and more stunning than previous iterations. We have certainly come a long way from the special effects of the 1950s, but there is great care taken in the development of these Titans and their personalities. It may seem weird to call them cute or gorgeous, but they are, indisputably.   With those Titans comes the baggage of previous films. King of the Monsters has no trouble in honoring the legacy of Godzilla, with numerous reference to earlier installments of the 65-year-old franchise. Although a Godzilla devotee could no doubt watch King of the Monsters over and over, and come away with new Easter eggs each time, the film is also easily accessible for the casual viewer.   The only problem is that, despite the immense care devoted to the Titans, there’s something lacking in the human characters. The scientists, particularly those portrayed by Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch, are two-dimensional, and serve no other purpose that to provide humor and exposition. By contrast, Ken Watanabe's Dr. Ishirō Serizawa, introduced in the 2014 film, undergoes a moving character arc.   The heart of the film is supposed to be the Russell family: Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) have split after experiencing a traumatic event in 2014, with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) now raised by her mother. The parents are at odds with one another, but the motivations of the family get lost in the spectacle; a critical viewer will question their actions and allegiances.   Indeed, there's an element of poor timing when it comes to the characterization of Emma. We live in a time when female characters who “go crazy” are scrutinized more than ever, particularly in the aftermath of Game of Thrones' divisive finale. Therefore, Mark referring to his ex-wife as insane isn't a good look. The family relationships are traditional yet somehow not entirely believable. However, Millie Bobby Brown steals every scene she's in, just as she does on Stranger Things. This movie further proves she could become her generation's scream queen, if that's what she desires.   Luckily, the Titans move the story along, so audiences don’t dwell too much on why the family relationships ring hollow. Despite the star power on display in King of the Monsters, the real draws are obviously Godzilla and his fellow kaiju. What’s set up in King of the Monsters will make viewers eager to see what will happen next in Legendary's MonsterVerse, which was one of the film's goals.   On its own, King of the Monsters honors the Godzilla legacy witha fast-paced story in which audiences can marvel at the Titans. As long as fans focus on the monsters more than the humans, they will undoubtedly have an (atomic) blast.   Directed by Michael Dougherty, Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Vera Farmiga, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Kyle Chandler, Millie Bobby Brown, Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, Charles Dance, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Aisha Hinds and Zhang Ziyi. The film opens Friday nationwide. "
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"  After a five year absence, the MonsterVerse's Godzilla has finally returned for Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Gareth Edwards' Godzilla reboot launched the kaiju franchise in 2014, and embraced a fairly serious tone reminiscent of Ishirō Honda's original 1954 classic. By comparison, 2017's Kong: Skull Island moved away from Edwards' restrained direction in favor of a far more colorful and rip-roaring MonsterVerse adventure set in the 1970s. This brings us to the property's third installment, which aspires to be even goofier and more action-packed than either of its predecessors, in ways both good and bad. King of the Monsters offers the campy pleasures of an old-school Godzilla sequel, despite going overboard with its relentless kaiju battles.   The film takes place in the present-day MonsterVerse, where people are still adjusting to the reality that god-like creatures exist. In the wake of Godzilla's San Francisco battle with the MUTOs, Monarch paleobiologist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has developed ""The Orca"": a machine that allows for auditory communication with these Titans, and could be the key to humanity's survival. However, when she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are taken by ex-colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) and his eco-terrorist group, it falls to Monarch and Emma's erstwhile husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), who helped design The Orca, to rescue them. Before long, though, they realize Alan and his organization have a bigger goal in mind - one that involves awakening King Ghidorah, an apex predator and Godzilla's ancient nemesis.   In a way, King of the Monsters hews closer to the Japanese Godzilla sequels of the 20th century than either of the previous MonsterVerse films. The movie benefits from having Michael Dougherty onboard in this regard, as the writer-director (who also helmed Trick 'r Treat and Krampus) brings a horror-comedy touch that compliments the heavy-handed environmental themes and human melodrama here. At the same time, the narrative by Dougherty and his writing partner Zach Shields leaves something to be desired, even by the standards of the larger Godzilla franchise (where plot has traditionally been a secondary concern to spectacle). The resulting film is one that's already dividing people over whether its strengths in other departments make up for its shortcomings in this area.   Following a quick prologue (which establishes the Russells' backstory), King of the Monsters wastes little time getting to the thing Godzilla fans love most: the Titans wreaking havoc on the planet and/or fighting one another. These brawls are typically impressive in their staging, as Dougherty and DP Lawrence Sher (The Hangover trilogy, War Dogs) bring them to life in a way that combines the realism of Edwards' Godzilla with the expressiveness of Jordan Vogt-Roberts' Kong: Skull Island. In doing so, the film draws from a vivid color palette (arctic blue, desert orange, rainy grey) that serves to distinguish these various throw-downs visually. The sequences are further energized by Bear McCreary's bold score, which uses an eclectic mix of instrumentation (including, taiko chanting and drumming) and re-imagines both Godzilla and Mothra's iconic themes to positive effect. Problem is, because King of the Monsters never stops upping the ante when it comes to spectacle, it starts to become more exhausting than exhilarating by the time the third act rolls around.   As mentioned, though, the main flaws lie with King of the Monsters' thinly-drawn humans and storylines. The broken family plot at the heart of the film is cheesy at best and laughably flat at worst, even with people as talented as Brown, Farmiga, and Chandler trying their hardest to elevate the drama into something poignant. Fortunately, the movie is even more of a true ensemble piece than MonsterVerse entries past, and the other members of Monarch are far more entertaining than the Russells. King of the Monsters' heroes are all fairly archetypical (there's the awkward nerd, the sardonic tech specialist, the no-nonsense military leader, and so on), but are buoyed on the big screen by a distinguished cast that includes Bradley Whitford, Zhang Ziyi, Aisha Hinds, and O'Shea Jackson Jr., along with returning Godzilla costars Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. Nevertheless, it's Ken Watanabe who once again steals the show as Godzilla's number one fanboy, Dr. Ishirō Serizawa, and reveals there's nary a silly line of dialogue he can't deliver with gravitas.   Overall, King of the Monsters delivers on its promise of spectacular kaiju skirmishes and paves the way for even more to come in next year's crossover event, Godzilla vs. Kong. At the same time, the film is arguably messier than MonsterVerse movies past and struggles to balance competent human drama with satisfyingly destructive mayhem. This accounts for the sequel's polarizing reception so far; depending on how one looks at it, King of the Monsters either compensates for its storytelling problems by offering extra helpings of monster fights, or knows exactly what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else. Still, whichever way you cut it, there's enough that works here to please most kaiju fanatics or anyone in the mood for a big, ridiculous, blockbuster thrill ride that's worth checking out on the largest screen available.   Godzilla: King of the Monsters is now playing in U.S. theaters. It is 134 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction, and for some language.  Matt Damon has a tendency to appear in minor, often comedic, cameo roles in various film projects, from Thor: Ragnarok to EuroTrip to Deadpool 2. The Bikeriders is already similar to a 16-year-old TV show, but after a new trailer, this TV show might have already spoiled the movie's ending. Tyler Perry's latest movie, Mea Culpa, was a Rotten Tomatoes disaster, but his next movie is on its way to being much better received by critics. The Matrix is rightly considered one of the most influential sci-fi action movies of all time, but some aspects of the film haven't held up."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," Damn straight you  want to go to the movies, shove popcorn in your face and watch giant creatures  from a digital lagoon kick each other’s ass.  The title alone means most of us are in the tank for Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Besides the jolly green giant lizard, we get Mothra, Rodan, the three-headed Ghidorah,  a.k.a. Monster Zero and the barest hint of King Kong (we have to wait till next March to see Kong and Godzilla go head to head as part of Legendry studio’s MonsterVerse). What does arrive in the sequel to the latest of countless, pointless reboots of the Godzilla franchise is a bloated and humorless script, lazy-ass directing from Michael Dougherty (who co-wrote the alleged dialogue with Zach Shields) and slumming actors who are forced to scream in terror when they’re not shoveling tons of mind-numbing exposition.  It’s weird that a series that began in 1954 with a low-budget Japanese quickie featuring a dude in a rubber suit came still survives as primo kaiju escapism. The monsters — called Titans — eventually show up, and when they do they’re a fun crowd. Scary? Not really. But they’re still technical marvels. It’s a shame the plot mechanics don’t have a whit of the  imagination the FX team brings to the party. And the titans don’t have any lines. How lucky can a monster get! The story, such as it is: Dr. Emma Russell, a scientist played by Vera Farmiga as if what she’s saying actually makes sense (that’s acting!), has an invention called the Orca. It makes sounds that can communicate with monsters and hopefully control their behavior. Emma has less luck communicating with her teen daughter Madison (the wonderful Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things), who correctly thinks that her mom has gone bonkers. Madison is equally sad to have lost her brother in the battle that ended the last movie. But Mark (Kyle Chandler), her divorced dad, has it worse. He’s been drowning his sorrows in booze, but now returns to restore sense to the universe. In short, the war comes down to those who believe humans should live in peace with the monsters (Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins), and those, represented by the villainous  eco-terrorist Colonel Jonah Alan (Charles Dance),  who want to blow the creatures off the face of the earth. For fun and profit, of course. The movie globetrots from Antarctica to Boston — see: Ghidorah’s destruction of Fenway Park — but rarely gets anywhere. Do you care? Probably not. The chance to see giant monsters go apeshit — a few more are added near the end — is almost worth the price of admission. Seeing, however, is part of the problem. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is often so lost in the shadows of digital muck that it makes the squinting chaos of the Battle of Winterfell in Game of Thrones look like a lightshow. Still, when the Titans emerge from the sludge and go at it full tilt you may give in just to watch them let it rip. All that’s required is a mandatory suspension of critical judgment."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"  Godzilla: King of the Monsters hearkens back to the Kaiju beatdowns of the classic Japanese Toho films. Gone are the fleeting glimpses of the radioactive reptile that puzzled everyone in the 2014 version. The sequel turbocharges the action on all fronts. It's civilization crushing savagery as Godzilla and his adversaries pummel humanity on a global scale. The faults lie in the cardboard characters and their weak subplots. Thankfully they don't yap enough to ruin the monster buzz. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a summer popcorn spectacle that's red meat to the diehard fanbase.   Five years after the destruction of San Francisco, Godzilla has disappeared. The U.S. government has had enough of Monarch and its secrets. An oversight committee wants to put the military in charge of finding and killing the prehistoric monsters; now deemed Titans. Monarch lead scientist Dr. Ishirō Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) warns that's a huge mistake. The Titans are part of the world's natural order. Humanity is responsible for waking them up.   Meanwhile at a secret Monarch base, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has made a critical breakthrough. She has discovered a way to communicate directly with the Titans. It's the culmination of heartbreaking research. The San Francisco attack devastated her family. The breakthrough isn't a secret for long. Emma and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), are kidnapped by shadowy mercenaries with apocalyptic intentions. Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) must overcome his hatred of Monarch to save his ex-wife and daughter.   Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty (Krampus) wastes no time getting started. Godzilla's presence is felt in the opening minute. A few scenes later, the luminous Mothra and terrifying King Ghidorah have joined the Kaiju party. The monster carnage starts off strong and is pretty much nonstop. Their ferocious land, sea, and underwater battles dominate the film's runtime. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a big-budget, special effects onslaught that will have you doing a CGI duck and cover. The Titans lay waste to anything and anyone in their paths.   I enjoyed the visual effects, but understand those that have minor complaints. Most of the climactic showdown scenes take place at night during some kind of wet weather. Those conditions obscure minute details and are often used as a crutch for shoddy CGI. Godzilla: King of the Monsters could have lightened up for deeper inspection, but the Kaiju battles do not remotely disappoint. There's a plethora of monster ass-kicking in the rain and snow.   The ensemble characters add unnecessary drama beyond the requisite running and screaming for their lives. The Russell family wallows in tragedy and divorce. Some of this is pertinent to the story, but mostly it feels like filler. Then you have another smarmy character (Bradley Whitford) whose entire job is counting down various timers for Kaiju attacks and imminent explosions. Godzilla: King of the Monsters could have dialed back the melodrama and subplots without missing a beat.   Michael Dougherty's greatest success is the scale of the film. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and especially King Ghidorah fill the screen with epic destruction. Godzilla: King of the Monsters lives up to its Kaiju premise. Every belly will feel monster full walking out of the theater. Stick around for the first part of the credits. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"A film that features all of the smash 'em up Godzilla action one could hope for, while toning down all of that human drama stuff that bogged down the first movie."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," Five years after the attack on San Francisco, the world is still coming to terms with the news that we are not alone on this planet any more and that monsters live amongst us. The Russells are but one of many families who felt the devastating brunt of San Fran in 2014, but a much larger scale event is on the horizon that will test the will of man in Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters. After the ultimately lukewarm Godzilla (2014) and the mildly successful Kong: Skull Island in 2017, Warner Bros and Legendary’s MonsterVerse needed to knock this out of the (Fenway) park and they absolutely did that thanks to director Michael Doughtery’s extra special touch. One of the major criticisms with the previous instalment centering on the kaiju God was that he didn’t receive enough screen time – but Doughtery, in his wisdom, has corrected that particular balance whilst also ticking a lot of the boxes that Gareth Edward’s attempt, unfortunately, failed to. In this pure summer blockbuster event, the stakes have been raised in more ways than one – Godzilla himself has a much more prominent role while also sharing the giant screen with other beloved Toho kaiju including Mothra, Rodan and the One Who Is Many, King Ghidorah, and a wonderful balance of a much more compelling human than its predecessor, with giant monsters beating the unholy hell out of each other. On top of that, Doughtery’s attention to detail from being a lifelong Godzilla fan is in full effect throughout the entire film. The human story follows the Russell family – a broken mother, Emma (Farmiga), a damaged father Mark (Chandler) and their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). After losing a member of their family during the MUTO attack in 2014, the family has been torn apart, but their connection to Monarch and the Titans is much deeper than first imagined. When the sinister and mysterious Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) takes Emma and Madison hostage in order to use Emma’s crucial scientific creation that could help humans and titans live in harmony for his own nefarious means, they end up unleashing the Titans, causing a global apocalypse that could end humanity as we know it… But, of course, it’s up to Godzilla to save the day by restoring balance and confirming himself as the true King of the Monsters. This time around, the human cast is much more likeable and, although the dialogue is most definitely not the strongest part of the narrative (let’s be honest, we are here for the fights!), they are a welcome addition to the pure animalistic carnage of kaiju war and never feel like they overstep their boundaries. Each of the main characters has an interesting story arc that is much more captivating than Brody in2014’s Godzilla. Couple that with Doughtery’s (who also served as co-writer with Zach Shields) slapstick quips that try to add light to a terrifying situation, and you have some real feeling characters. Of course, the centrepiece of the film is the kaiju themselves – the mighty Godzilla, the three-headed dragon King Ghidorah, the adorable yet feisty Mothra and the fire demon Rodan. Each member of this iconic quartet gets multiple moments to truly shine. As each one is introduced to the audience they all encapsulate the grand nature of the situation at hand – from Mothra’s hatching in its blue luminescent glory to Rodan bursting from a volcano, every one feels important and massive. There are so many breathtaking shots placed throughout that you could easily take a screenshot of and proudly frame it on any wall too – especially that one shot of Ghidorah. This is only heightened by some honestly spectacular creature design and state of the art visual effects that, although they are giant monsters, give each kaiju a personality. Not only that, but Bear McCreary’s incredible score is certainly one of the most staggering and jaw-dropping elements of the film. The filmmakers were given the rights to Akira Ifukabe’s original score from the classic Godzilla, and McCreary has crafted a mind-blowingly gorgeous score that uses elements of the classics while also giving it a stunning 21st-century makeover. Our personal favourite track is the remastered Mothra theme, made even more special in the context of the movie. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is hands down the greatest multi-monster movie of the modern era. The astonishing special effects and edge-of-your-seat thrilling battle scenes expertly paper over the minute nitpicks that one may have but, ultimately, this is one hell of a kaiju rollercoaster ride that you do not want to miss. McCreary’s score elevates the rip-roaring action, and it is absolutely apparent that this is a movie made by a fan, for the fans."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," One of the chief complaints regarding the 2014 Gareth Evans-directed Godzilla reboot was the lack of screen time for the titular monster. The character for which the film was named famously only appeared on screen for about 8 minutes and some fans felt they got the short end of the stick when they plopped in their theater seats expecting all-out-monster mayhem. In the timeless tradition of cinematic call and response, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as directed by Michael Dougherty of Trick ‘r Treat and Krampus fame, takes that complaint baton and sprints blindly the other direction, delivering a movie that is packed to the gills with fussy monsters and cityscape destruction porn but remains an exhausting and brain-numbing eyesore nonetheless.  Written by Dougherty and Zach Shields, both of whom are teed up as screenwriters for 2020’s Adam Wingard-directed sequel Godzilla vs. Kong, opt for the path of least resistance, taking the Godzilla character in a decidedly un-cerebral direction, trimming any semblance of suspense or intelligence while glibly paying half-assed lip-service to underlying commentary on global climate change. In its promising beginning segment, Godzilla: King of the Monsters begins in 2014 where the Russell family experiences the carnage of Evans’ titans firsthand, losing their son in the destruction of San Francisco and forever altering the course of their lives. Five years later, Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a bio-sound engineer working for Monarch, the shadowy global-threat organization introduced in the mid-credits sequence from Kong: Skull Island, (an infinitely more fun block-busting diversion) and her and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) employ an experimental bio-acoustic device code-name Echo to communicate with Earth’s original Gods, including a hatchling Mothra. Yada, yada, yada, in storm ecoterrorists to take control of the Echo, convinced that unleashing the kaijus of the world will restore natural order and so begins a mindless cacophony of slamming digital monsters together with stubborn, silly, and annoying human characters prattle on in the background that’ll continue for the next 120 minutes.  Which, for what it’s worth, is a premise I’m not against in principle. The problem lies in the fact that Godzilla: King of the Monsters fail to motivate any feeling behind the carnage, fails to give us anything resembling human characters worth caring for or investing in, and generally bumbles from one plot beat to another without any care for logic or even a shred of intelligence.  This on top of the fact that the digital team at times really screws the proverbial pooch in the visual effects department. The CGI is inconsistent at best, and downright awful at times (with so much monster mayhem, it simply seems like the budget ran out to get everything up to par), though it does remain consistent in regard to its lacking a higher sense of wonder. Few were the moments were I gawked, jaw-hanging, enrapt at the screen; entirely absent was a set-piece that even got close to capturing the awesome majesty of Gareth Evan’s H.A.L.O. jump sequence.  The CG-heavy spectacle lacks the operatic set pieces and fixed scale of its predecessor. When everything feels giant, nothing does. Dougherty’s film is all giant, all the time. His camera pulled back in such a way that minimizes the scale. In a movie whose key ingredient is spectacle, the spectacle better slap. Here, it just lacks punch, a bland monster mash dance off that just didn’t quite get me going. Godzilla decidedly lacks imagination from a visual set-piece standpoint, despite benefitting from a vivid color palette that gives the spectacle some much-needed candy-colored pop. The assembled cast is a rogue’s gallery of “that guy/gal” talent with little interesting in the way of script or dialogue to offer. Kyle Chandler shuffles along as the film’s stony and uninteresting leading man; Vera Farmiga proffers a performance between hammy and lifeless, phoning it in as a scientist revolutionary whose character arc is dumber than most; Ken Watanbe offers his signature staccato Japanese-speak and little more; Bradley Whitford sneaks some snide comments in with some expository heavy-lifting;  Millie Bobby Brown runs from here to there and then here and then there. And they’re not even the half of it. Thomas Middleditch shows up, Charles Dance gets a thankless bit part, and two-time Oscar-nominee Sally Hawkins has a tiny role for reasons I cannot explain. It’s O’Shea Jackson who walks away in the best position, getting the few laughs from a film that’s both trying too hard and not trying nearly hard enough.  And that really is the problem isn’t it? Godzilla: King of the Monsters wants to have its cake and stomp on it too. It’s a movie that wants you to point and laugh at how silly it all is but also one that casts Captain Serious Kyle Chandler in the leading role. It’s a movie internally at odds; a three-headed King Ghidorah fighting amongst itself. And if that’s going to be the case, you have to at the very least make that fight look cool as hell.

"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," With Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen unable to return due to scheduling conficts, a new family takes over.  Monarch scientists Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) split up as a result of the San Francisco incident.  However, the 2014 incident inspired Emma to revisit the bio-sonar prototype that they previously destroyed.  Emma’s plan is to find a frequency to where humans are in control of the monsters.  Things go haywire when eco-terrorist and former British army colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) takes Emma and daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) hostage.  Leave it to Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) to get Mark back in the picture.  You can tell that Mark doesn’t want to be there but finding his family takes priority. The Titans start waking up thanks to a Thanos-esque hope in restoring the balance.  Monarch did a really good job at hiding them from the world but HOW DID THEY KEEP THEM HIDDEN FOR SO LONG?!?  At first, the humans are in control but disaster strikes when King Ghidorah makes known that he’s the alpha.  The only one who can really save the day here is Godzilla.   Helping our favorite anti-hero is Mothra while Rodan is no ally whatsoever.  The trio were teased in cave drawings during the Kong: Skull Island credits.  It’s great to see these creatures roaming the screen with some updates for the 21st century.  With the addition of the trio and then some, it gives the filmmakers a reason to utilize Godzilla even more.  In 2014, we barely even saw the guy.  For all of those who complained, the filmmakers have rectified the situation. The film does have a lot to say when it comes to our planet’s environment.  Environments have a way of rebuilding after the Titans and life also follows.  Is it possible for humans to co-exist with the Titans?  Or is it next to impossible?  It really depends on who you choose to believe here.  One thing for sure is that the metaphors are stronger in this film.  After all, the Godzilla films tend to be about what happens when nature fights back against humanity.  There’s a lot more to be said here but then you get into spoiler territory. Other positives are learning more about the Monarch operation.  Godzilla offered a little taste of this while Kong: Skull Island really expanded on it.  The third Monsterverse film really dives into the ins and out of Monarch.  I just wish the files would stay on the screen long enough for me to read them!  Meanwhile, Monarch scientist Dr. Houston Brooks (Joe Morton) returns in a blink-and-miss it cameo.  Morton replaces Corey Hawkins as it’s been 47 years since the 1973-set film.  It’s a fun way to tie in Godzilla with Kong: Skull Island outside of Monarch itself.  The other tie-in comes during the end credits, setting up Godzilla vs. Kong.  The latter of which is due out next year. Among the things I didn’t want to see happen: a storyline that literally draws itself from Armageddon.  The whole someone-must-stay-behind-and-die plot point.  Never in a million years did I think a Michael Bay film would influence a studio tentpole but here we are!  With one character already ripping of Thanos in hoping to restore the balance, I suppose anything is possible.

"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," After 2014’s Godzilla played it cagey in unleashing the beast, the third in Legendary Picture’s Monsterverse goes all in, assembling the cream of the Kaiju superstars for the behemoth of battle royals. By rights, it should be great popcorn entertainment. Unfortunately, it’s a bit of a lumbering mess. The story dovetails with the conclusion of Gareth Edwards’s earlier film, introducing Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) as they search in vain for their son amid the devastation of San Francisco. Both try to make sense of the tragedy by working for Monarch, the organisation in charge of monitoring monster activity, only for grief to drive them apart. Five years on, and Emma is now living with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown, of Stranger Things fame) in a secret facility in China, while Mark is out researching animal behaviour in the wilds of the US. However, events conspire to bring the fractured family back together when Emma and Maddie are taken captive by eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance). Jonah is convinced that Earth’s natural order must be restored, and wishes to release each of the monsters, or Titans, and let them walk the planet once more. However, rather than humans and monsters living in semi-peaceful co-existence, it’s pretty obvious that some of the beasts have other ideas. Cue some hard-learned lessons about nature refusing to be contained. Chief antagonist in the ensuing contest for king of the monsters is the mighty, three-headed Ghidorah (aka Monster Zero), who is unleashed from his icy slumber in Antarctica. Ghidorah has long been a fan favourite, and just like in his 1964 series debut, he’s joined here by Mothra (the benevolent queen of the monsters) and Rodan (a less-than-friendly fire demon), who each enjoy impressive CGI upgrades. It’s their battles against – and alongside – Godzilla that make this film such a tantalising proposition. How could it fail? Sadly, what we get instead is not enough monster action, but plenty of pointless peril involving the members of Monarch, as they desperately try to sort out the mess caused by their tech falling into the wrong hands. They also seem to succeed in wrecking a lot of expensive military hardware in the process. No wonder the US government wants them to see them disbanded. Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe are among the cast reprising their roles from the 2014 film, and once again play boffins trying to calm the wayward beasts. David Strathairn is back, too, as the naval commander who likes following orders and blowing stuff up. Of the new faces, only Millie Bobby Brown really invites any sympathy as a girl caught between warring parents, who takes the survival of mankind into her own hands. Meanwhile, Ziyi Zhang's appearance in dual roles is completely sketched over, and will only serve to confuse those unfamiliar with Mothra lore. With this sequel, director Michael Dougherty clearly understands the beats of a blockbuster movie, and some of his monster brawls are an improvement on the murky set-tos from the 2014 film. However, the man who brought us the 2015 Christmas creepshow Krampus seems to have forgotten that you need a coherent story to draw the audience in. The script he’s produced with Zach Shields is often toe-curlingly clunky, with dialogue that sounds like it's been lifted from a badly dubbed Godzilla movie from the 1960s. And even those without any scientific sense may well ask how many face-melting nuclear blasts one cast can subject itself to without being irrevocably irradiated. The scenario of a world ruled over by monsters might be unlikely, but it would help to make at least some of the elements slightly believable. As for the big guy himself, Godzilla has suffered plenty of highs and lows over his 65 years on the screen. But don’t worry, even this disappointing entry won’t stop him, as he has an appointment with Kong in 2020. Hopefully, that encounter will give him – and us – a bit more to chew on."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," Somewhere in the ugly morass that is Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the most overqualified supporting cast in recent memory are trapped expectantly on sound stages, hoping they might be the next to go. Incineration or giant lizard foot? Mothra’s latest snack? Who cares? Charles Dance, Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, David Strathairn and Bradley Whitford could have formed a support group, but it’s every thesp for himself in this shambles. Not only is any notion of surviving it together quickly abandoned, but for the audience, even remembering who’s alive is a needlessly tough job. Yes, the continuity in this flick is abominable, and the original director, Gareth Edwards, is long gone, but at least it starts out with some cursory idea of where the 2014 reboot left off. San Francisco: it was here that Godzilla helped humanity destroy a nest of winged beasts called Mutos, while also comprehensively trashing the Bay Area and achieving his main goal, a $530m worldwide gross before merchandising. Lost in the crunchy fracas was a kid called Andrew, whose surviving family members, played by Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown, are the main three… I mean, “characters”? “Humans who are new to the franchise”. Let’s not go overboard. This deserves to be infamous, exemplifying a sequel that “inflates” the stakes while also rendering them so generalised that they feel like waffly pretexts at best. Rest assured that Godzilla, dormant somewhere in the ocean depths, will rise again, while his ancient rivals in the kaijū genre (Japanese for “strange beast”) will also roll out of bed, because they might as well. There’s a Pteranodon thing called Rodan, there’s Mothra, and there’s King Ghidorah, a three-headed, hydra-like contender set on delivering triple-threat destruction, while also vogueing and flaunting its dragon wings, in the film’s only fun shots, against the flaming volcanic backdrops it calls home. What response from homo sapiens could possibly greet this WWF rampage? Gawping and pretend science, that’s what. Chandler and Farmiga’s characters, now estranged, used to work together for Monarch, the secret, government-sponsored organisation that considers these massive creatures, collectively known as Titans, to be part of Earth’s survival system. The death of their son has jolted Dr. Mark (Chandler) out of this wacky ideological belief, but not Dr. Emma (Farmiga), who has Mothra under containment, and ten minutes into the film is practically stroking its furry, mewling muzzle after finding the right frequency to make mummy noises in its language. The film could get away with this kind of silliness – plenty of overscaled effects showdowns have in the past – if it only knew how to give us a good time. Hope remains alive in the occasional exchange of dialogue, or might, were the depressed-looking actors to notice the opportunities they’re missing. “Scanning the entire southern hemisphere – so far, nothing?” reports a tech guy to some army colonel (Aisha Hinds) after the beasts have gone Awol. “Then scan the northern!”, she peremptorily barks. Watanabe, giving it a bit of extra welly, gets to pronounce Godzilla the Japanese way, complete with audible italics – “Gojira!!” – and to exclaim “this is a dangerous path!!!” when Dr. Emma earnestly suggests letting enraged prehistoric monsters, earthquakes, wildfires and tsunamis batter the planet, uncontested, for all species’ future good. Her mad plan is to restore harmony to the ecosystem, amid overpopulation, pollution and war, but you’d much rather they’d started small, and simply restored balance to the actual film. It’s relentlessly sludgy and subterranean. Untold millions of man-hours went into all this writhing reptilian combat, and that’s just watching it. Incoming director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) is the one in this unenviable hot-seat, but he can’t competently handle a budget this huge when it’s being poured over an assignment this vague. The film makes you beg for the frisky B-movie shamelessness of its stable-mate in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, 2017’s Kong: Skull Island, which had heaps of ideas for how to pull off a monster mash and keep actual peril in play. You never had any doubt, in that one, which bit of a person had just been gnashed in something’s teeth, or why everyone was screaming, or why a giant spider’s leg down your throat might be unappealing. Next year, the two beasts meet head-to-head in Godzilla vs Kong. Godzilla, without a shadow of a doubt, needs to up his game. This one’s so boring you’d barely even cross the street to avoid him."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Loses its way by trying to do too much and, consequently, not doing enough, gravely assuming loud noises, freneticism, and lots of crashing and bashing is all audiences need to get their money's worth."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It's fitting that a film that is so unapologetically conventional and predictable (even by the standards of the genre) ends with the song ""Godzilla,"" a cover of a Blue Oyster Cult track...As with so much of the movie, it has been done before and better."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," The beloved movie monster Godzilla both goes big and goes home in this sequel to the 2014 “Godzilla.” For those of you who haven’t been keeping your scorecards updated, that movie was a reboot of a reboot, the uninspiring “Godzilla” of 1998.  “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is franchise fodder, however. The series is being steered to encompass a battle between Godzilla and King Kong, like the one the Japanese Big G films from the ’60s once enacted. The sort-of sideways tie-in here is with “Kong: Skull Island” from 2017. While Kong himself appears here in but a glimpse, his home gets a lot of mentions. In this incarnation, a family torn apart by Godzilla takes the foreground. Science people Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga use their daughter Millie Bobby Brown as an emotional Ping-Pong ball while government agencies and eco-terrorists contend with the awakening of a fearsome three-headed beast named Monster Zero. It’s rather beside the point to note plot goofiness in a Godzilla picture, but this one does push its luck now and then. At one point it seems the film could go full “Kramer vs. Kramer” with Godzilla and Monster Zero (a.k.a. Ghidorah) as attorneys for the parental plaintiffs. This movie is often pretty slack in matters of story construction and direction. (The responsibility for the latter lies with Michael Dougherty.) Spatial relations are superlax, with characters and heavily armed forces showing up here, there and everywhere from out of nowhere. As in the 2014 film, this Godzilla is a stouter fellow than we have seen in previous incarnations. While underwater, he resembles a giant electric eel with bourbon bloat. But he gets the wreaking-international-havoc job done, as do the many other monsters, including a Mothra almost as delightfully psychedelic as the old Toho version."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," Michael Dougherty is best known for directing and writing Trick ’r Treat and Krampus – both horror features coming with a good deal of festive black humour – but he also helped write the big-budget blockbusters Superman Returns and X-Men Apocalypse. So he is especially well placed to be helming (and writing, with Zach Shields) Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a creature feature on a massive scale, peppered with the odd blackly funny line. This is in fact the third instalment in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, following Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ prequel Kong: Skull Island. It’s a mega-franchise which not only models itself on Disney’s MCU and Warner Brothers’ rival DCEU, but which similarly figures its creatures as superheroes and supervillains slugging it out in a world where humans are for the most part helpless bystanders or collateral damage. Edwards’ 2014 Hollywood reboot of Godzilla (who first appeared in Ishiro Honda’s 1954 film, and has since been in 34 features) played out like a long, slow reveal of the monster. Dougherty’s sequel opens with a flashback to that film’s climactic mayhem and its harrowing ground-level effects on a family, and then unfolds, like Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, in the aftermath of this hidden monster’s first very public appearance. Ever since, the cryptozoological research group Monarch (the MonsterVerse equivalent of MCU’s S.H.I.E.L.D.) has ever since been tracking Godzilla and monitoring many other ‘Titans’ found dormant beneath the Earth’s surface. The theory, already proffered in the franchise’s earlier entries, that these behemoths have long existed to bring balance to the world, is here more fully explored, as their epic battles are made to allegorise and embody the cataclysmic upheavals of nature that manmade climate change is bringing to us all. Conflict lies at the heart of Godzilla: King of the Monsters. If the great technological MacGuffin here is an acoustic device named ‘Orca’ that echoes the characteristic sounds of the monsters to summon or repel, anger or calm them, then the film’s central conflict is also echoed, at micro- and macrocosmic levels which resonate with each other so that the human and Titanic struggles always seem interrelated. Godzilla’s big fight against two ‘Mutos’ in 2014 tore apart not just San Francisco, but also Doctors Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), the husband-and-wife team who had developed Orca together, but whose young son was killed in Godzilla’s devastating onslaught. Now divorced, they are driven by divergent ideologies: Mark wishes to destroy all monsters, while Emma sees them – or at least some of them – as a force for global good. This same division can be seen between Monarch and the military, ever disputing whether to preserve or pulverise the Titans. Meanwhile ex-military renegade ecoterrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) has stolen the Orca device – along with Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) – and plans to introduce colossal chaos to the current, terminal world order. Once reawakened, lepidopteran Mothra, three-headed King Ghidorah (John Carpenter’s The Thing meets the mythological Hydra) and winged Rodan – regulars of the Godzilla franchise’s Japanese strand who all, according to the closing credits, appear as themselves here – will fight their own battles in an attempt to destroy or perhaps to renew life’s hopes on Earth. So this is a power struggle that reechoes at the domestic, the urban and the global level, as our environmental anxieties, and the different approaches to tackling them, all assume monstrous form and are resolved – at least until Adam Wingard’s forthcoming sequel Godzilla vs Kong – in outsized combats where coexistence, collaboration and a respect for nature’s might are key to the continued survival of our species. Godzilla may be a monster, but he is much less of a threat to the planet than several of his fellow monsters, or indeed than the more monstrous of the human players. He is massive and relentless, constantly adapting and evolving, but also a conservative guardian of the ecosystemic status quo. He is also our monster – in a surreal xenophobic touch, it turns out that local leviathans are more welcome than alien abominations (even when the latter migrated here multiple millennia ago). In the parallel rush by Jonah and Ghidorah to topple incumbent hierarchies, to kill the king and to set an unruly replacement on the throne, the fate of dangerous, destructive Godzilla proves intimately intertwined with that of the entire human race. In all these dramas, there is plenty of room for human heroism, sacrifice and redemption to keep viewers emotionally engaged, while the spectacular city-levelling fights mounted by Dougherty and his vast crew of SFX and CGI wranglers bring the shock and awe, showing in concrete – and concrete-smashing – form the dire, unpredictable consequences of messing with nature or with our world’s delicate equilibrium. Godzilla: King of the Monsters rattles and races along through a variety of set-pieces to a literally explosive finish, while leaving the impression that a Pandora’s box, once opened, may unleash a perpetual pandemonium of sequels. The sheer scale of these humongous creatures’ sizing off is such that it may in the end seem like an abstract pissing contest to determine whose irradiated emissions create the greatest damage – but fans of kick-ass kaiju are going to have a blast.

"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,"  Offset this against the assault of military protocols, the avalanche of disaster movie tropes and the shallow tapestry of man-God-worship stuff that really doesn't deserve further thought, and there is just too much nonsense happening at all times. It's amazing to think how long director Michael Dougherty must have stared at Godzilla's reptilian hide during production and at no point did it occur to him to 'scale back'. The one thing that the film does a decent job of delivering is a sense of veneration for its subjects, and there are more than a handful of truly iconic shots of the monsters in all their braying glory, back-lit against plumes of fiery smoke. Which is great if you just want some posters to hang in your room, but those wanting their giant monster stories to contain actual stories are just going to be left feeling utterly crushed. "
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," The battle royale at the end of Godzilla: King of Monsters takes place at Fenway Park. Home, of course, of the Boston Red Sox. Fittingly, King of Monsters spends its bloated run time relentlessly swinging for the fences. Though the occasional ball may sail out of the park, the vast majority of its swings never threaten to make contact. In spite of this, and indeed, in spite of almost all logical rhyme or reason, there’s something captivating about waiting for the next narrative ball to be pitched. Describing the plot of KOM is easier said than done. For more than two hours, the plot spins in seemingly random directions. Slightly easier is giving an impression of its characters. Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) is a plucky teenager. Her mum, Emma (Vera Farmiga), has one of the most incomprehensible plots to save the world in history.  Jonah Allan (Charles Dance) is an eco-terrorist. Mark (Kyle Chandler) likes wolves. Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) loves Godzilla. This frankly bizarre selection of characters are there to coax (or stop? This changes more than once) Godzilla into fighting a three headed dragon hydra named Ghidorah. Any other details are superfluous. Straight off the bat, KOM’s storytelling is completely garbled. The whole film chews through scenery across the globe. We zoom from a Chinese jungle to Antarctica, Mexico and more within minutes. This broad brush approach, taken to impress upon the viewer the sheer enormity of the canvass, has the opposite effect. Godzilla’s world feels so easily navigated and restrictive that you don’t for a moment see the re-awoken monsters as a global threat. Similarly frustrating are the attempts to throw mythology into the narrative blender, something which feels haphazard and half-hearted. The film’s nominal big bad, Ghidorah, is said not to be present in any mythology because it is so terrifying that it ought to be forgotten. But then it’s also suggested it was a magic dragon which fell from the stars. Your guess is as good as mine, or indeed the screenwriter’s. A detour to an underwater, Atlantean world is itching to be better explored. This ancient temple throws up some of the film’s most arresting, mythical visuals, but the story is desperate to get back above water. Elsewhere, a street level sequence in Mexico looks superb, but is dispatched with all too quickly. KOM wants to be a big, dumb monster movie and it ticks every box. The scale is undeniable, the stupidity patently obvious, and the roster of monsters overflowing. As the film’s marketing attests too, KOM is all about the monsters, and they do largely deliver. There are times when the visuals line up superbly with a thumping, portentous score – one which leans into the music from Skyrim, or is that just me? It’s in these big, grandstanding moments when the film feels at its most comfortable. There’s even something deeply fun about meandering through the frankly hysterical dialogue because you know it’s going to lead into yet another barnstorming battle. There is an almost impressive lack of nuance to the storytelling and the most plausibly ‘human’ moment is reserved for a Boeing-sized moth. Kyle Chandler, dependable as ever, tries valiantly to impart a human sense of yonder and heart, but he’s left a bit stranded. His familial bond with the intrepid Madison (Brown) feels genuine, but the film isn’t overly fussed about its human elements. Indeed, Bradley Whitford’s character, Dr Rick Stanton, isn’t so much comic relief as the audience’s surrogate. He stands there, in a role which is largely confined to him counting up (or down), and quips about the absurdity of it all. In the middle of all this carnage, he’s having a whale of a time, and there’s a high chance that you will too. If Godzilla, as a character, spawned a sub-culture of monster B-movies, then this relentlessly stupid and smile-inducing spectacle can undoubtedly lay claim to being king of them all."
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," Going into the latest CGI Monsterverse film Godzilla: King of the Monsters I knew I was fighting an uphill battle. Monster movies are generally not my favorite movies, and I haven’t enjoyed either of the last 2 in this franchise. However, I assumed at least the visuals would look good so it would be entertaining on the IMAX. Sadly I was mistaken. It looks like the response is quite divisive on the film but I thought it was awful. You may love it but it was not for me. That’s for sure. There are so many problems with Godzilla: King of the Monsters but let me go over a few that especially stuck out. The first and least important problem is the asinine script with characters making nonsensical choices. Yes it’s a dumb monster movie, but we spend a lot of time with these people, so it would be nice if it was at least semi-coherent and logical. Especially Vera Farmiga’s character was a giant continual face palm. Second, I’ve long complained that action movies have become one long set of sequences of characters staring at screens. This is no exception. Almost every scene with the humans they are either looking at a glass encasement or staring at a screen. This is not interesting or exciting. Towards the end we have some emotional scenes with characters but they feel under-served because we haven’t gotten to know them beyond seeing them stare at screens. Finally, and most surprising, is the disappointing visuals. I think you can see from this gif how cloudy and murky the cinematography is. Every scene is raining and dark so you can’t see what is happening. To make matters worse the point of view is often from the ground up which is difficult when trying to see the action of these big creatures. The editing is also absolutely awful. The fight scenes are constantly cutting away into extreme closeups and mid-shots. Very rarely do you get a good wide shot to really see the fights or the full creatures. Isn’t that why we are there to see monsters fighting? It wasn’t a big surprise to me when I found out one of the 3 co-editors is the editor for Transformers: the Last Night and Transformers: Age of Extinction- two of the worst edited films I’ve ever seen. And then the cinematographer usually does comedies like The Hangover. It was truly baffling. Another annoying aspect is millions of people are dying in scenes in Mexico, San Francisco and Boston, and yet we only seem to care about a handful of humans. It reminded me of San Andreas where the only person the screenplay cares about is The Rock’s daughter and everyone else can die. I think most people would be a little upset if the world was being annihilated and there was mass carnage? Call me crazy. Like I said Vera Farmiga (and Charles Dance) characters were especially bad in this regard. The only comparison I can make is with 2017’s Geostorm but that film had more of a spirit of fun about it than Godzilla: King of the Monsters and the visuals were fine. This was just a badly made film. You might enjoy it and I hope you do but it’s definitely not for me, and I think I’m done with this Monsterverse for the foreseeable future. I mean have you ever seen an original Japanese Godzilla film? Godzilla movies should be pre-requisites to even commenting on this. If you have then sure I understand the criticisms but if you haven’t go watch them then we will see what you think. I’m exploring other Rachels’ blogs and yours is a treat. Love that you turn your beady eye on Netflix items. Hm, do you also review Netflix TV shows?  Why even bother reviewing movies you already know you dislike going in, when there are others to review more up your alley? Do you really think you can give it a fair review with that mindset? The reasons for the fog & storms & darkness is because some of the monsters, especially Ghidora & Rodan in this film, naturally generate those storms, & in turn darkness, since their beginnings in 60’s Toho films. As for the closeups & tight shots, for me it felt like I was in the movie, right there in a helicopter, watching as teeth sink in & tear & exactly where each monster is sustaining their damage. I as much as any TRUE GODZILLA FAN understands this, as well as your other dislikes. We like what you dislike. We enjoy what frustrates you about the editing, plot, acting-everything. This is the dream film we Godzilla purists have long awaited. I’ve seen it twice already, & a 3rd time is coming very soon. “Different strokes for different folks,” as the saying goes. Or are you going to critique me for using a cliche? In contrast to Rachel I actually like many monster movies. I love Peter Jackson’s King Kong. I think that the original 1954 “Gojira”  movie is great. I enjoyed the 2014 reboot although it had flaws, and I thought, that Kong – Skull Island wasn’t bad. Therefore I gave the new Godzilla movie a chance. But I have to say that it is the most boring movie I saw in a long  time. Rachel’s review is spot on. There is no coherent narrative to speak of. But the worst thing is that the movie is visually extremely annoying. It’s hard to make out any details, the 3D effect doesn’t add anything, there is no sense of scale and the CGI work is pretty lousy. I really cannot say anything positive about the movie. Rachel, you don’t have to apologize for anything. You admitted freely that watching monster movies isn’t your favorite pastime, but you managed nevertheless to sum up the flaws of the movie pretty accurately😉
 As I said above, I do like some monster movies – if they have a heart, a soul and most of all a sense of awe. My all time favorite is Peter Jackson’s somewhat underappreciated King Kong.,  Yes, it’s too long and the treatment of the natives would be handled differently today. But the movie tells a wonderful story and you become really invested in the characters – especially in Kong himself, who comes to life magnificently through Andy Serkis’ Oscar-worthy motion capture performance. The visuals are (mostly) great, although some fighting sequences are drawn out for too long. But people left the theater with tears in their eyes after Kong’s death. I also like the first Pacific Rim movie. Guillermo del Toro created a delirious and awe inspiring phantasy. Gareth Edwards’ version of  Godzilla didn’t get a lot of screen time but we got at least a clear idea of his magnificent looks and awe inspiring proportions. And while the sheer scale of the monsters prevents any meaningful interaction between puny humans and mighty beasts, Edwards actually managed to inject a semblance of soul into his monsters and their plights. I could even muster some sympathy for the female MUTO, when she discovered that all her eggs had been destroyed. The new Godzilla movie has none of it. I left the movie theater with a serious headache because of the confusing camera angles and no clear idea what some of the monsters actually looked like, since they were never shown to us properly. I had been looking forward specifically to Mothra since in the original Japanese versions this monster are actually kind of – cute and a fan favorite. But the new movie never gave us a clear image of the giant moth and the connection to Godzilla was never fleshed out. Or I forgot about it immediately. After a night’s sleep nothing remained in my memory banks. And that’s probably the worst thing one could say about a monster movie. I don’t understand how this mess could’ve ever left the editing room. I completely agree with you. I also enjoy Peter Jackson’s King Kong especially once they get to the island. I love the original 1933 King Kong. This film felt like a Transformers movie in every way. All I really wanted was to be able to see what was happening and not have jarring action with terrible editing. I dont think I need to be a Godzilla expert for that LOL. I do appreciate when those who disagree with me can state their case in a concise way without resorting to name calling. Believe me that’s not always the case with these franchise films! In that sense I felt it was a fair comment. "
"May 29, 2019",NEGATIVE," The “Godzilla” franchise has an inherent flaw in its DNA. It’s just really difficult to build a film around a skyscraper-sized lizard that can’t speak and destroys everything in its path. Therefore, filmmakers feel like they have to include human characters to give the film a basic plot, and hopefully, if done right, provide some much needed emotional stakes so that there’s more on the line when you watch the lizard inevitably destroy a city. It’s a balance that has yet to be mastered by Hollywood in its various attempts over the years. And in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” it’s clear that Legendary Entertainment still hasn’t figured it out. In 2014, Legendary decided to reboot the “Godzilla” franchise, and build out a new cinematic universe called the Monsterverse. Mostly known for its man-in-rubber-suit charm and unique (some might say ridiculous) monsters, the franchise has survived for decades based on a dedicated cult following. The problem is cult followings don’t pay the bills. So, the Gareth Edwards-directed “Godzilla” reboot ditched the goofy charm, and replaced it with grim seriousness and CGI. 2014’s film hid the titular character, “Jaws“-like until the third act, and relied on the charisma of Aaron Taylor-Johnson to carry the load. No offense to the “Kick-Ass” star, but Mr. Taylor-Johnson is no Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, despite the similar surnames. ‘King of the Monsters’ decides to right the wrongs of the last film, replacing the primary cast and the director, with Michael Dougherty taking the helm, in an attempt to make a “Godzilla” film that can convince audiences this whole Monsterverse is worth their time. The problem with the sequel, however, is that aforementioned balance. By switching from human drama with a monster fight at the end to a series of monster battles peppered with only a bit of human drama throws the pendulum completely in the other direction, leading to one of the most bonkers, ludicrously over-the-top action films you’ll see all year. This is normally the point in a review where the plot of the film is dissected and critiqued. Sadly, the plot in ‘King of the Monsters’ is so convoluted and ridiculous, it’s almost not even worth mentioning. Monarch is the secret government-funded corporation that studies Godzilla and other Titans in hidden bunkers all around the world. Well, through some shenanigans that don’t entirely make sense, and will leave your brain the moment you walk out of the theater, Godzilla is here to save the world from the three-headed dragon, King Ghidorah, an apex predator that threatens to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth. All this, while characters you won’t remember try to locate some soundwave machine and talk about things like “oxygen killer” missiles, hollow Earth tunnels, and ancient mythology. Directed by Dougherty (“Krampus” and “Trick ‘r Treat“), ‘King of the Monsters’ goes all-in on the monster action, ensuring that this sequel is bigger in scale, more action-packed, and most definitely sillier than the previous film. Non-stop action and fun aren’t bad attributes for a film about fighting monsters, but the folks behind ‘King of the Monsters’ forgot that there has to be likable, relatable, and interesting characters to keep audiences invested while you gear up for the next action set piece. And when you have actors like Kyle Chandler, Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga, O’Shea Jackson, Jr, Charles Dance, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, and Ken Watanabe, it’s a shame that the film doesn’t even bother to use most of them in any meaningful way. Characters exist. They have clear motivations. Some live. Some die. You won’t remember who’s who and you definitely won’t care what happens. Most of the actors listed above turn into exposition machines that yell out facts about monsters at crucial moments. The closest attempt at any sort of emotional arc is with a half-baked family drama that, through the actions of the characters involved, leaves you wishing that they’d all die in the end. Of course, when the film ditches the pretense of a story, and sidelines the all-star cast in favor of the CGI lizard, Dougherty does a great job of making the fighting feel epic. When the Titans show up and battle each other, you never lose grasp of just how much of a destructive force they truly are. The action scenes are beautifully shot. There’s no doubt that Dougherty was born to do this sort of film. But after the fourth or fifth Titan action scene, you’ll likely feel exhausted from the explosions, screeching, screaming, and constant scientific nonsense being yelled by humans. It’s just...a lot. So, do you choose to make ‘Godzilla’ a human story, using the monsters sparingly, and perhaps, boring the target audience in the process, such as the 2014 reboot? Or do you focus on the screeching, personality-less, massive lizard in the title, forgoing the human element in favor of loud explosions and immense destruction? For “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” the answer is clearly the latter. And believe it or not, the end result might make you pine for the days of Aaron Taylor-Johnson."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," Stars: Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Charles Dance, Sally Hawkins, Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Thomas Middleditch, Anthony Ramos, CCH Pounder, Joe Morton and David Straithairn.Writers: Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields.Director: Michael Dougherty. In 2014, director Gareth Edwards endeavoured to take schlockbuster icon Godzilla down the same credibility path that Marvel guided their goofy comic-book properties; the resulting film was beautiful and earnest and a bit dull. Five years later, new-kid-on-the-studio-tentpole-block Michael Dougherty punches up the action (and the decibels) while dumbing down the dialogue in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. If the look of the big lizard and his fellow fantasy titans owes much to Edwards’ eye, the script harkens back to Roland Emmerich’s ear, it being attached to the writer/director of Sony's much-maligned 1998 incarnation. The sequel picks up four years after the destruction of San Francisco by Godzilla’s wrath. The government agency Monarch is getting drilled by the U.S. Senate for not having found and offered up the head of the big lizard for the damage it had done. What the Senate committee members don’t know is that the Monarch team are not only tracking Godzilla, but have several other ‘titans’ in lockdown at key sites around the world. Scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) lords over one such site, in China; she lost her son in the 2014 San Fran attacks, her husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) to booze in the wake of their tragedy, and clings to strong-willed teen daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Emma is overseer of an audio-pulse generator called The Orca, which streams a frequency that controls her titan, the larval stage behemoth that will ultimately take flight as Mothra. Just as it begins to stir, a mercenary outfit led by the ruthless Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) storms her outpost, stealing Orca, Mothra, Emma and Maddy. With a surly Mark now back on board, the Monarch team – stern lead scientist Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe); offsider Dr. Chen (Ziyi Zhang); wisecracker Dr Stanton (Bradley Whitford); and, nerdy bureaucrat Coleman (Thomas Middleditch) – need to retrieve The Orca and save mankind from Emma, who has gone full-Thanos with a plan to wipe the planet of the virus that is mankind and restore the human/titan balance. The whip-smart mind behind cult items Trick ’r Treat (2007) and Krampus (2015), Dougherty works hard to give all these cast members something to do and say. He has them address each other in a combination of mostly single-line observations or exclamations that largely serve to move the plot from one kaiju-related predicament to the next. There is no character depth or dimension – so cornball is some of the dialogue it recalls the Irwin Allen disaster epics of the 1970s – but it does ensure the real stars of the film are not offscreen for too long. Most dominant amongst the mythological beasties is the three-headed King Ghidorah, a dragon-like lightning-breather who has it in for our leading man-monster from the get-go; barely freed from his icy tomb, Ghidorah battles it out with Godzilla in one of the loudest and most visually stunning/confusing action sequences in recent memory. We are soon introduced to Rodan, a pterodactyl/hawk crossover-creature who lays waste to a Mexican town when it emerges from its dormant volcano tomb, and the ethereal shimmering wingspan and deadly spikes of the aforementioned Mothra. Each has their own moment in the spotlight, with their human co-stars largely reduced to looking upwards and dodging debris; perhaps best served is Stranger Things’ breakout star Brown (pictured, above), who earns her ‘real world emoting’ badge when given the screen time to do so. Of course, it’s all about the beast that is Godzilla in any Godzilla movie, and Dougherty and his effects team have conjured a titan who balances a screen persona that is equal part ‘rampant destroyer of cities’, ‘noble ally of the righteous’ and ‘scaly, snarling action hero’. If you’re paying for a ticket to a Godzilla movie, what needs to work most of all is your anti-hero’s rock ‘em/sock ‘em presence, and King of the Monsters gets that right. If Edwards’ big lizard was a bit too precious with the property, and Emmerich’s a bit too flippant, Dougherty respects both the B-movie beats of the big guy’s film history as well as the environmental subtext that Godzilla has always represented."
"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," “Long live the king,” mutters Vera Farmiga’s scientist Dr Emma Russell as she comes face-to-face with Godzilla in Michael Dougherty’s gloomy, rain-sodden and, frankly, impenetrable action-adventure. On this evidence, it might be better if the giant lizard expired; this latest incarnation is a flop almost as gargantuan as the creatures that populate it. Part of Legendary’s ‘MonsterVerse’ that has already brought us Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla (2014) and Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ Kong: Skull Island (2017), Godzilla: King of the Monsters promises more monsters for your eyes to feast on – as long as you’ve got X-ray vision, that is. The film is so dark and foggy, it makes that Game of Thrones episode everyone complained about look like a ray of sunshine. It’s the sort of film where the humans – military, scientists – spend the entire duration gathered around monitors, their faces lit up by LED displays. When the film opens, Farmiga’s Emma and her daughter Madison (Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown) are ensconced in China, in an outpost belonging to Monarch, the shady organisation that runs across this loose-fitting franchise. We soon learn that Emma has reconstructed a gizmo called the Orca, developed by her husband (Kyle Chandler), which can lure these monsters from the deep with its sonar signal. Enter Charles Dance’s ex-British colonel-turned-“eco terrorist”, who marches off with mother, daughter and device; there’s a plot afoot to use these creatures to restore the natural order of the planet. Sally Hawkins and Ken Watanabe reprise their roles as the gallant scientists from the first film, there’s also an appearance by Chinese star Zhang Ziyi as a fellow Monarch employee; her cropped hair more distinct than the lines she’s forced to spout. Really, though, the humans are onlookers to the monster smackdowns that await. Here, Godzilla comes up against other fabled beasts, including Rodan, Mothra and the three-headed King Ghidora, as the plot leaps around the globe from Mexico to London like the most expensive B-movie you’ve ever seen. Largely, though, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is only of interest when it focuses on Millie Bobby Brown. The 15-year-old English actress is a magnetic presence, even in a throwaway big-budget monster film. She’s the one who you root for amid all the terrible CGI, rotten dialogue and city-stomping carnage."

"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," Godzilla goes up against Mothra, Rodan and the three-headed King Ghidorah in this blockbuster action sequel with an ensemble cast including Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson and more. Godzilla II: King of the Monsters is the darkest film I’ve seen for a while. No, not thematically, but in a Pacific Rim “let’s shoot everything gloomily so you can’t bloody see it” kind of way. Static images and production design sketches may look cool and moody and stuff when they’re ominously lit, but I expect most people like to be able to actually see the movies they watch. As Godzilla II ushers the viewer through night-time set-pieces, underground bases, underwater adventures, and gloomy super-storms, the net result is a film that’s frequently difficult to follow, bordering on the incoherent—not exactly what one might be after in a giant monster action spectacular. Well, at least it’s consistent. The narrative is also all over the place, with half-arsed characters brought to life by actors given the hospital pass of trying to add a human dimension to proceedings. It’s a valiant but largely impossible struggle, whether we’re talking the fractured family at the film’s core (Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga), an exposition-spouting scientist frequently required to dramatically exclaim “Godzilla!” (Ken Watanabe), or a quipping fellow scientist  (Bradley Whitford), whose gags achieved about a 0% laugh rate from the audience when I saw this. “Who cares,” you might say, “what about the monsters?” Thankfully, they look cool, their scale is well-captured, and the devastation they bring is phenomenal. Frequently throughout the film the sheer terror and incomprehension of their presence is captured—and then the spell will be broken by more human-level dullness or plot machinations. But there’s nothing dull about watching Rodan’s atomic bomb-level impact on a city from the air, the multi-headed monster King Ghidorah, or the tussles Godzilla has with his super-sized enemies. There are some thrills and spectacle here, but they either don’t come often enough, or neglect how our senses have been dulled by loud and often confusing action. The concept of titanic entities scattered all over the world and waiting to emerge from caverns, temples or under mountain ranges is suitably buzzy, and there’s some interesting world-building and historical mythology that sadly struggles to make its way to the viewer. There are thrills to be had in the film’s final mega-battle, and some awe-inspiring moments scattered throughout—not least of which is the destination of a submarine mission. But there aren’t nearly enough in 132 minutes of movie though, and following the pretty damn fun Kong: Skull Island (which evaded most of the above issues), this is a disappointing development along the way to seeing Kong and Godzilla share the screen next year, more of an endurance test than something to get excited about."

"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," If you’re a monster movie fan, you’re probably used to the story getting a bit dull when the creatures exit the frame. Lucky for us, kaiju fan or not, Godzilla: King of the Monsters manages to keep a large ensemble of human characters fun and engaging, while using visual effects to characterize Godzilla and the other monsters. After years of fans watching men flail around in rubber suits, Hollywood has realized the appeal of giant monsters having personalities and becoming their own characters too. Action movies are often seen differently because there is so much more to balance. These ambitious cinematic projects all owe a great deal to the historic Ishiro Honda film, Gojira (1954) as a genre of effects and spectacle was born out of tragic metaphor, and a giant lizard of all things would become one of the most iconic characters in the world alongside Mickey Mouse. But in the years since, filmmakers realized action and effects films have so much more to accomplish that sacrifices have to be made, and that is usually the narrative quality, most exemplified in films like Independence Day, Transformers and Avatar. However, viewers perception of what an effects-driven genre film should be has fundamentally changed. Sci-Fi soaps have captured the zeitgeist of the 2010s, not just for how they look, but how they make people feel. This evolution has changed everything about the standards of action and effects films. We look to recent game changers like Avengers and the Planet of the Apes remakes as films with strong characters and themes in their core, but enveloped by marvelous effects. King Cesar and the Hulk come to mind when comparing the visual presence of the creatures of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, where the awe-inspiring scale and effects have found a place for marriage with characterization in a legacy franchise that so often struggled to do so, at least in whatever way it can. While it isn’t a revolutionary film, it finds some otherworldly balance to these modern tools of moviemaking. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a culmination of the decade’s best sci fi action films. It’s the Godzilla franchise, evolved into something new.  Horror filmmaker Michael Dougherty (Trick R Treat, Krampus) takes up the mantle to direct the sequel to Warner’s Monsterverse films (Godzilla and Kong Skull Island) and he had his work cut out for him. The franchise has been in a dire need of this evolution, not just from a very clear audience demand for action, but in competent storytelling. Godzilla: King of the Monsters follow a small family drama enveloped by the new age of monsters. Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga are  Mark and Emma Russell, who suffered great losses once Godzilla returned to the world. As time passes, these characters grieve in different ways as Mark allows his anger to fester and Emma obsesses over her work with Monarch, the monster analyzing organization introduced in the previous film, leaving their daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) caught in limbo between the two.  The story that carries the audience through the plot is Mark on a world trotting rescue mission, and despite a couple of convoluted twists that may be a bit jarring for some, they’re played in a way that allows Farmiga and Brown to demonstrate more range with a family drama instead of simply being held hostage. It does this without making the story too complex or detached from emotional stakes for the audience to care in between action scenes.  The ensemble cast of Monarch newcomers keep the pace brisk through the story and science jargon. Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford, Ziyi Zhang, Aisha Hinds and O’shea Jackson Jr. bring comic relief in a genuine way that keeps them all likable. Whitford in particular embraces with full force that he’s in a Godzilla movie and chews scenery in a way that does not feel obligatory or over edited. While these characters haven’t been completely fleshed out, it’s a far cry from the paper thin caricatures 20 years ago in Roland Emmerich’s Godzilla with Sony, and the time spent with them and the creatures is more valuable to the film than the gritty details of the plot. It’s the somber family that carries us from set piece to set piece, but these supporting characters keep things fun until we get to the films main characters: the monsters. Godzilla fans can relax, the monsters don’t get cut away from this time. The animation is creative and colorful like a comic book splash page with close ups and wide shots to make them more lively than just effects achievements. Additionally, the monsters don’t disappear when the action is over, as they sort of have character moments of their own as Ghidorah’s threat grows larger, and Godzilla has to put the hustle in to achieve his victory. Fans will also appreciate the experience in sound mixing, with classic musical cues and creature sound designs throwing back to the old films of the franchise, bringing them to life ever so slightly more than they would be with the visuals alone. Following the first act, the film’s pace is too quick to concern itself with giving more exposition than necessary. Unfortunately this too is true in sequences where the film would have benefitted from stopping the breathless pace to slow for a moment, and hang on a shot before moving on to the next thing. This could have created a bit of emotional tension that was instead passed by. This results in a couple character moments that were too quick to realize before they were over that could have given the audience some pause for drama. While the monsters are framed in a computer with glorious IMAX wide shots, a lot of camerawork on the ground with human characters was too handheld to the degree that it began to show some flashbacks to Bourne Identity in brief instances, and the dissonance between camera styles is glaring when it cuts back to the stable and clean digital shots of Godzilla and friends. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an action film with the satisfaction of knowing exactly what its creators and its fans want it to be. Dougherty makes a Godzilla film that the fans always wanted: it keeps things moving, keeping the characters fun with approachable story, and monster filled spectacle is always around the corner.

"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," Godzilla: King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty, is the latest installment in the extended world and history of the Godzilla films. For a great article on facts about Godzilla, please check out a piece by fellow We Live Entertainment writer, Aaron Neuwirth. After the 2014 Godzilla film, in which we saw the destruction of San Francisco, we meet the Russell family. Daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and mother, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) are living together in China while they research the Titans and Emma works with Monarch to develop a new device to help with the Titans. Their estranged father and husband, Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) has secluded himself following the tragic loss of their son in 2014 San Francisco. The two parents had very different reactions to the loss of their son and are handling it in very different ways, putting Madison in the middle of it. While monitoring the actions of a dormant titan, Mothra, an evil eco-terrorist group headed by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) comes and kidnaps Emma and Madison to control the Titans and reset the natural balance and order of the world. However, things are not quite as they seem as the world turns to chaos, and as the Titans battle it out, we are not quite sure for whom we should be cheering. What Michael Dougherty has done with this Godzilla: King of the Monsters is nothing short of spectacular. He has elevated the monster movie game to a whole new level. Every single frame of the film is beautifully shot. The way that he handles and frames each shot with the monsters shows he has a genuine love and appreciation for the characters and the world in which he is playing. He has an eye for the epic monster scenes and creates something incredible to see. I know everyone says, “see it on the biggest screen,” but this is one of those situations where you’re going to get the best out of the film that way. Seeing it in IMAX brings the whole thing to life. The visuals are epic and enchant the audience from the first battle until the end. While the monsters were spectacularly done, the human characters ended up being my least favorite part of the film. While the actors are all incredible in their own right, it felt like perhaps there were too many characters and too many storylines that we were supposed to care about, but in the end, didn’t. The standout performances of the film were from Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler as well as a few excellent scenes from Ken Watanabe. Millie, as the youngest actor on screen, gives an outstanding performance as Madison that required a lot of varied emotions and she rose to the occasion. Kyle Chandler, while some lines were a little off, held a lot of the story and kept audiences engaged. The rest of the cast, while they did serve a purpose, it felt like there were too many characters with great actors that we didn’t get to see what they all can do in the short runtime. Written by Michael Dougherty, Zach Shield, and Max Borenstein, the story shows the in-depth knowledge and admiration they have for the history of Godzilla and all the characters attached to him. The real stars of the film are the Titans, and the writing shows that. While it does take a bit of time to get to the real action of the film, extended scenes of serious battles are sure to reward the audience for its patience. Godzilla: King of the Monsters ups the ante for monster films. It has set a whole new standard and reminds us that Godzilla is the true king."
"May 29, 2019",POSITIVE," The lumbering radioactive mutant dinosaur who trashed Tokyo in Toho’s Gojira in 1954 has undergone more reinventions than Spider-Man. Historically, it has proven easier to rethink the franchise from the irradiated ground up than to develop a storyline over a series of films. Godzilla King Of The Monsters takes its title from the 1956 American release version of the first film, and picks up from the ending of Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla. Elements tipped in from Kong Skull Island flesh out Warner Bros/Legendary Entertainment’s ongoing Monsterverse project, drawing battle lines for the already-in-the-can Godzilla Vs Kong. Given the mythic resonance of that conflict, this instalment risks seeming like a mere preliminary bout before the title fight to determine which movie monster more deserves the title King. As is customary in giant monster movies, human stories that take place in the wreckage-strewn wake of the titanic battles offer considerably less entertainment value than the sheer spectacle of creatures causing large-scale devastation. Director Michael Dougherty has worked in the big budget arena as screenwriter on instalments of the X-Men and Superman franchises, but has mostly directed small-scale horror films (Trick ‘r’ Treat, Krampus). Like many creatives, he struggles to bring his own personality and interests to a lumbering behemoth that keeps tripping over its own tail. The shadowy Monarch Organisation has penned a number of giant monsters – called ‘titans’, presumably because the semi-rival Pacific Rim franchise copped the traditional term kaiju – in sites around the world. Defecting Monarch scientist Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) teams with ‘British army colonel turned eco-terrorist’ Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) to use a laptop-sized gadget she has invented to awaken the fearsome three-headed ‘Monster Zero’ and assorted lesser giants to trample the world in order to save the planet from humanity. Another Monarch faction, run by Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and including Emma’s grumpy ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), backs rival alpha beast Godzilla in a fight with Monster Zero. Caught in the middle of a potential apocalypse that boils down to a family squabble is Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), daughter of the feuding Russells. The film too often loses faith in its true stars – the Toho staple of giant monsters, which extends beyond Godzilla and Monster Zero (aka Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster) to include the magic giant moth Mothra and the vicious pterodactyl Rodan. Moments of awe as these titans clash in storm-wracked skies or unleash vast primal forces are too often curtailed so the film can cut away to trite family arguments or concerned scientists and military folk looking at screens. A few players – Watanabe, Farmiga, Dance – actually have the presence to go eye-to-eye with Godzilla and not seem intimidated, but an extraordinary amount of time is spent on finding things for the top-billed Chandler to do in a dull role as fed-up Dad. After limiting the action in Godzilla to the Pacific and Kong to one island, this raises the stakes by presenting a global crisis – with barely-glimpsed supporting titans laying waste to cities around the world in a riff on Toho’s Destroy All Monsters (1967) - and staging major set-pieces in China, Antarctica, Mexico and Atlantis before settling on Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, as location for the final free-for-all. Dialogue exchanges consistently land with a thud and we get too many moments of self-sacrifice for any of them to count – one major player dies without even a close-up – but King of the Monsters delivers what its genre requires. Truly awesome monster scenes fill the screen, often imbued with emotional resonance by music cues. This not only reprises the memorable Godzilla and Mothra themes from earlier films but uses a Serj Tanakian cover of Blue Oyster Cult’s ‘Godzilla’ over the end credits – which, of course, set up a post-titles sting to prove that we’ve not seen the last of any of these creatures.

"May 29, 2019",NEUTRAL," There are four monsters in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” but one of them has three heads, so that’s almost like there are six monsters. Clearly, this is the movie for people who really, really like monsters, specifically the Japanese movie monsters of the mid-20th century. There’s Godzilla, rebranded here as a good guy. There’s Mothra, who is a giant, disgusting moth. There’s Ghidorah, with the three heads. And then there’s Rodan, not to be confused with Rodin, the sculptor. All of them are fit into a single 131-minute film, and there’s not much room for anything else. Just offhand, it’s hard to see why Mothra and Rodan are even presented here, except maybe for old times’ sake as a nod to the earlier film iterations of these popular beasts. “King of the Monsters” has the feeling of a boy’s fantasy made real or perhaps a filmmaker’s midlife crisis being expressed through monster archetypes. It’s not a good movie, or a bad one, but a decidedly peculiar one, in which every landscape looks like a 1970s album cover. Or to put it another way, if Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidorah and Rodan formed a monster-rock band in 1978, the cover of their first album would look a lot like “King of the Monsters” — with the strenuous physicality and lit-up skies straight out of a Frank Frazetta painting. The film takes place in 2019, five years after the last big monster attack, which leveled San Francisco. The world has responded with methods of suppressing the monsters (or “titans,” as they are relentlessly referred to here), but the big guys are stirring, and soon the world is on the brink of a full-blown crisis. If there’s one thing interesting about “King of the Monsters” — and one would be a stretch — it’s in the way the various human entities react to the monster attack. The military just wants to blow everything up, while the environmentalists are crazy in the opposite direction. Ken Watanabe plays a scientist who suggests that the solution might be for all humanity to become Godzilla’s pets. He says, “Emma and I believe some of them are benevolent.” Emma, in this case, is another environmental scientist, played by Vera Farmiga, who thinks it would be best to let all the “titans” escape from under the sea, because it would benefit the planet. It doesn’t quite occur to her that what’s good for the planet might not be all that great for human survival. After all, the planet will be just fine. The planet will adjust. The future of the planet is not at issue, but rather the future of the human species. At first, it seems that “King of the Monsters” might be playing a slick game, using a monster movie as the means of satirizing how people, in the current political era, react to a crisis — not by practically examining the problems at hand, but by falling back on ideology, even when ideology leads them down some demented side streets. In such a satire, the consensus that forms around Godzilla as a possible savior could be interpreted as the movie’s warning against investing hope in some totalitarian strongman. But no. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” isn’t presenting Godzilla as a symbol of incipient American fascism, but rather as a very big, green monster, who is there because filmmaker Michael Dougherty thinks Godzilla is kind of cool. And so we get scenes and scenes of monsters fighting, while people fret and monitor the proceedings on a screen. They care a lot, apparently. But for us there’s not much of a rooting interest because the monsters seem interchangeably bad and life seems utterly destroyed already. Best-case scenario is a world without cities, without jobs, without medicine, without infrastructure and without much food, in which everyone spends the whole day looking up, for obvious reasons. What little pleasures the movie offers are small and intermittent. Kyle Chandler gets to unleash his inner Shatner by acting intense every moment that he’s onscreen. And then there’s Bradley Whitford, as another scientist, who gets the movie’s one good line, when he has to break the news that a thermonuclear device is about to go off in Boston. “In 12 minutes,” he says, “it’s going to be a bad day to be a Red Sox fan.”"
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," While I may not be the most well-versed Godzilla fan out there (I saw a ton of the Godzilla films as a kid, but the version of O.G. Godzilla I knew the best was the 1956 Americanized iteration with Raymond Burr that seemed to play once a month on a Saturday afternoon on Channel 66 in Chicago), there is always an excitement I feel whenever Big G comes stomping his way onto the big screen—so much so that I even saw Godzilla (1998) on the big screen three times despite my deep-seated loathing of Matthew Broderick. In recent years, we’ve had both Shin Godzilla and Godzilla (2014) to keep monster fans satiated, but with this week’s release of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Michael Dougherty has crafted one of the greatest love letters to Kaiju cinema ever, giving Godzilla aficionados everything they could want from a ginormous battle of the first gods, and so much more. KOTM picks up in real time, five years after the events of Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, as the world has had to come to terms with the existence of creatures that have long been a part of this world much longer than humanity has been around mucking things up. At the center of the story is the Russell family, who suffered a great tragedy in the wake of the events of the 2014 film, with Mark (Kyle Chandler) off studying nature as his means of coping while his ex-wife, Emma (Vera Farmiga), still works for Monarch while caring for their daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Despite Godzilla going off the grid, Emma and Monarch have still been hard at work at developing a device meant to help keep these natural monstrosities under control, but a madman named Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) wants to get his hands on the mechanism as a means to bring balance back to the planet. Chaos ensues as Dougherty and fellow screenwriter Zach Shields take us globe-trotting around the world in search of the dormant Kaiju. Not to take anything away from Godzilla (2014), because it is a film I do enjoy and I don’t want to play an unnecessary game of compare and contrast, but I will say that the way King of the Monsters builds upon the ideas and themes of that story is just flat-out remarkable, and we get a better sense of both the human characters driving this narrative as well as Godzilla and his God-like beastly brethren in the sequel. And while the human stories in KOTM are entertaining and we get characters that we want to invest in as audience members, the real highlight of Dougherty’s sequel is the way the four main Kaiju are treated with a palpable sense of reverence (as they should be), and become the big draw in all of King of the Monsters’ key moments, especially during the breathtaking monster battles that left with me goosebumps on multiple occasions. These scene-stealing creatures also have a bit of personality to them in KOTM, and I’m not sure which one of the main four Kaiju I loved the most, just because they all enjoy some really great moments onscreen (my brain says Godzilla because, DUH, but my heart says Mothra, and then there’s my more mischievous side that really wants to go with Rodan, because I got a kick out of his scrappy and nasty attitude, so maybe I’m just not meant to choose). But between the design elements of the monsters and how well the film’s aesthetics lean into different aspects of these oversized characters, there’s no doubt that Dougherty knew exactly why these creatures have endured with generations of fans for over six decades now, and finds some very clever ways of hearkening back to several different Godzilla films with his efforts in KOTM, too. On a visual level, nearly every single frame of Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels like a work of art, with many moments evoking the spirit of Frank Frazetta’s artistic creations (especially during the scenes with King Ghidorah). The way that cinematographer Lawrence Sher captured a sense of scale while shooting imaginary creatures is pretty damn incredible, too, and anyone who worked on KOTM as a visual artist should be commended, because they’ve conjured up some truly magical monster-fied moments in this latest Godzilla adventure that left me with a big smile on my face. Oh, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the positively gorgeous score for Godzilla: King of the Monsters from Bear McCreary, who has done some genius musical work before, but his efforts on KOTM could very well be his greatest compositional creation to date. I’m still not sure how folks who aren’t into Godzilla movies will feel about King of the Monsters, but for me, the sheer spectacle and sense of wonder that is at the center of this film was something I completely fell in love with, and what Dougherty has achieved here is truly a remarkable feat, and it makes me even more excited about what’s to come from this Monsterverse in the future.

"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," King of The Monsters is the third film in a good-standing franchise of monster films. I am very fond of Kong: Skull Island, to which gets referenced but is barely connected. That sense of disconnection allows it to focus on Godzilla, but painstakingly bright is its errors in all the brilliant monster action. King of The Monsters is told mainly through the perspective of the humans, which lies the film’s clear problem, they are all shallow and lifeless. Barring Millie Bobby Brown’s few scenes, she is really underused. However, the poor is overweighed by the brilliance and sheer epic-feel of the kaiju battles that ensue. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are stationed in a forest facility, home to a Titan waiting to be hatched. Madison’s father (Kyle Chandler) is still shaken and remains isolated after the loss of his son. The Titans are monitored and kept by Monarch, they have 17 cocooned and plan to keep them that way. Meanwhile, the Orca device is introduced, a technology capable of communicating with the Titans. Radical environmentalist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) abducts Madison, Emma and ‘steals’ the Orca. The kaiju battles between Godzilla and the Titans are grand, with a stylish look that is refreshingly ravishing to peer at, compared to the ever-shaking incoherent focus on the humans. Godzilla’s fights with King Ghidorah are explosively exciting, with the two opposing forces representing a clash of the ages. A battle that was always meant to be. Shot in a loose manner, the use of zooms heighten the sense of fiery destruction and pure hatred between the ‘alien’ dragon and Earth’s rightful king of the monsters. There are some strikingly beautiful shots that shine light on the outstanding VFX work, creating monsters so real – you can’t help but desire more. The use of colour symbolises the opposing forces, with yellow being representive of Ghidorah and blue being the newly-friendly Godzilla. Michael Dougherty’s direction is fine, the kaiju fights is clear evidence that he can direct. However, he fails to excel on the human side. Showing a completely separate side, a side that is incoherent and bland. Almost like dolls, the humans are uninteresting archetypal figures with no real relivence. All the cliche lines in the book are delivered, creating a strong disconnect between the magnificence of the action and staleness of the interactions. Chandler does the same shocked reaction face throughout the entirety of the run time, whilst the ensemble is just as irrelevant. They are literal toys, saying stock lines and doing the upmost stupid actions waiting for death. The humans literally die and fight for nothing, they are consistently smacked around and are near-death, yet the film insists they stick around. The only saving grace of the human’s is Millie Bobby Brown’s Madison, who is critically underused and Ken Watanabe’s final scene. The mythology is fascinating, the reasons link to ancient myths and legends that mesmorise. ‘Godzilla vs Kong’ is one to look forward to, hopefully focusing on what works and getting rid of what clearly doesn’t. The franchise started strong with ‘Godzilla’, followed by ‘Kong: Skull Island’, a mesmorising gem. The latest, ‘Godzilla: King of The Monsters’ holds up for the most part, but not as well as the others. Godzilla: King of The Monsters serves the pure monster extravaganza promised, whilst failing on the human side. The greatness does make mostly up for the poor."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," Before we go into this, you should know something very important: I LOVE GODZILLA. I’m not talking about a casual “Yeah, I’ve seen a few movies on TV…” I was obsessed as kid. To the point where somewhere, possibly in my storage space somewhere, is a model sculpture I made of Godzilla in elementary school that probably looks more like the cartoon character Godzuki. Many had problems with the 2014 Godzilla, Legendary Pictures’ first foray into giant monsters, mainly due to the lack of Godzilla, but I loved it. I also loved that they were bringing the King of Monsters back, as well as introducing Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidora into that world, and I have a feeling few real Godzilla fans will have problem with that. That’s because you can’t have Godzilla without having other monsters for him to fight, and those three have always been the best (even getting movies named after them). It opens with Kyle Chandler stumbling around in the debris of Godzilla’s San Francisco attack in which he loses his son Andrew.  Five years later, he’s divorced from his wife, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who is now working at MONARCH, the corporation that has taken the role of protector (and collector) of the giant monsters or Titans that have appeared on earth in the last five years.  Russell is there with her teen daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), having invented a device that can communicate with monsters, something we see in an encounter with Mothra in her pupa stage. Soon, Charles Dance shows up and kidnaps both Emma and Madison with hopes of using her device for his master plan, something I won’t divulge too much of, as that would get into spoiler territory. In fact, much of the plot of Godzilla: King of the Monsters has that problem, since there’s aspects to it I liked but others I didn’t, and getting too much into detail about what parts worked or didn’t work could potentially spoil some of the twists. There are quite a lot of them, some more surprising than others. Directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus, Trick ‘r Treat), Godzilla: King of Monsters has the onus of having to win over any of the fans who were upset by the lack of Godzilla in Godzilla.  There are certainly enough monsters and monster fights to keep the fans of that sort of thing enthused, and I wish I liked the family story more than I did. Chandler, Farmiga and Brown do eventually grow on you, although the family drama aspect of the movie is one of the things that didn’t work quite as well for me.  On the other hand,  Ken Watanabe continues to be the heart and soul of this series where everything he says carries a great weight to it.  Dougherty successfully populates his film with a fun group of characters including Bradley Whitford, who you almost immediately think is going to be monster fodder since he is there mainly for comic relief. The film also marks the return of Zhang Zhiyi as a nice tribute to the Mothra girls.  But let’s face it. You’re going to see  Godzilla: King of the Monsters for the monsters and that aspect of the movie generally works as Dougherty and his team create lovingly faithful CG creatures that show off a depth of emotions rarely seen from the men in costumes. Ghidorah is particularly menacing, while Rodan still looks about as dopey as he should to capture part of what fans loved about the giant bird in the first place. And then there’s Mothra, a creature who is so awesome, in both her forms, that you’ll flip out when the four monsters come together. I’m not sure what else I can say about the movie without giving away major spoilers – some that are good for the movie, some not so much – but I like where things are going with this franchise, especially the prospects of Kong vs. Godzilla.  Ultimately, I liked Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and I’m sure I’ll like it more once I get a chance to see it on the largest IMAX screen possible – which is how it should be seen. Dougherty does a decent job with what ends up being a very complex film, both technically and trying to keep the humans as interesting as the monsters."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," Directed by Michael Dougherty.
Starring Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Ken Watanabe and Zhang Ziyi. Sometimes, cinema is about high art. Sometimes, it’s about intellectual appreciation of intricate storytelling. Sometimes, it’s about the emotional highs and lows of a character’s journey. Sometimes, though, it’s just about a big lizard roasting a three-headed dragon with its atomic breath. Godzilla: King of the Monsters certainly never hid its radioactive light under a bushel. We all know what we’re getting. And that makes it even more disappointing to report that this one is a toothless trudge of a movie. The shadowy organisation Monarch is still carrying out experiments on kaiju, having isolated more than a dozen of them all over the world – including a certain angry ape on a skeleton-themed land mass. Scientist Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has created a device that allows her to mimic the speech patterns of some of these creatures, exercising some form of control. Her obsession with beasties has driven away her husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), but he finds himself back in her life when eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) kidnaps Emma and daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Jonah wants the device in order to awaken a new alpha to challenge Godzilla’s dominance. It’s difficult to pinpoint the narrative thrust of King of the Monsters because the script, from director Michael Dougherty and his co-writer Zach Shields, zigzags wildly all over the map and in between tones and ideologies. Characters change their stances on a whim and with scant regard for logical follow-through, with one Farmiga monologue laughable in its nonsensical simplicity. Meanwhile, an overwrought descent into evil from one character prompts Godzilla sympathiser Dr Serizawa – a returning Ken Watanabe – to tell them, quite simply, that “this is a dangerous path”. It’s an understatement akin to saying that walking with bare feet across a bouncy castle covered in broken glass is slightly cavalier. The script here is an Achilles heel the size of whatever Godzilla leaves in the toilet bowl after kaiju curry night. Characters communicate solely in overwrought, grandiose proclamations that would never cross the mouth of a human being, while the plot is driven almost entirely by beeping warning signals interrupting conversations. As a result, these characters crumble at the slightest examination, with Charles Dance yelling his way to a pay cheque while Sally Hawkins is treated so poorly by the story that only a third Paddington movie will be able to console her. I certainly need it. Meanwhile, the central family trio of Farmiga, Brown and Chandler never get to spend more than a couple of seconds on screen together and, as such, are almost impossible to believe as a unit. A subplot about their specific connection to the events of the first film is under-served and ultimately weightless, with Brown – the most bankable star name on the cast list – given more of a focus in the trailers than she is in the finished product. Much like the divisive 2014 take on Godzilla from Gareth Edwards, King of the Monsters suffers greatly from its bizarre devotion to cutting away from exciting monster scuffles to focus on what is presumably intended to be genuine human stakes. In practice, though, it’s just a selection of characters with names you can’t remember running around in circles while the camera shakes like it’s in the hands of a nervous alcoholic. In stark contrast to the elegantly constructed kaiju battles of both Pacific Rim movies, there’s no following the action here, which largely unfolds in sludgy, generic CGI landscapes and never seems to pack the hardcore punch that fans of these films will expect. Dougherty is able to conjure individual images that stick in the mind – Mothra spreading her luminescent wings for the first time; King Ghidorah standing triumphant atop a volcano – but these are merely frames within a collage of computer-generated naffness that’s often like a painter working only with one square of the Dulux colour chart. The monster battles – absolutely the major selling point here – are entirely lacking in palpable jeopardy. It’s like a WrestleMania match in which everyone is Hulk Hogan – so invincible that even defeat is merely temporary. From the moment this film was announced, it seemed likely to occupy an odd spot in the landscape of this burgeoning franchise, with Adam Wingard’s upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong the true main event. Dougherty’s movie, though, has a hearty spin of the kaiju roulette wheel and spits out some of the most iconic monsters in this decades-old cinematic universe. The problem is that all of the handsome pixels in the world aren’t enough to prevent this particular adventure from emerging as an outright monstrosity."

Hollywood’s Godzilla movies (multiplex-dwelling beasts driven mainly by commerce) have been forgettable affairs. But the fans still come in two species: those in the sandbox who thirst for some serious stompage, and those who’d prefer a little irresponsible-science subtext, the vibe that made the Japanese 1954 original so ominous. ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’, a sequel to 2014’s cloudy, occasionally grand-feeling ‘Godzilla’, skews toward the first camp. It brings back all the beaky, shrieky supporting creatures—squawking Rodan, buzzy Mothra, Toho’s still-riotous triple-headed dragon King Ghidorah—that we wanted last time but didn’t get. If you go to these things to see cities flambéed and flattened, you won’t leave disappointed. At the same time—almost impressively—director and co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty is savvy enough to make the human drama monster-shaped. (The 2014 outing cast Juliette Binoche, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen yet still managed to make them all intensely boring.) Essentially, ‘King of the Monsters’ stars a dysfunctional clan of misunderstood beasts, and that’s not counting the fire-breathing ones: Divorced couple Emma and Mark (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) still grieve over the loss of their son during the last big Godzilla attack. Both are hot-tempered advisors to military types with differing strategies. Their eco-minded teenage daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown of ‘Stranger Things’), hates life, listens to the Pixies and unleashes waves of melodramatic rage. You won’t mind any of their overheated scenes, even if sometimes these characters feel about as detachable as Raymond Burr did in the Americanized ‘Gojira’. Mostly, audiences will be waiting for the moment when a jet pilot heroically ejects from his cockpit, only to disappear like an hors-d'oeuvre popped straight into the big guy’s mouth. Connoisseurs will thrill to hints of composer Akira Ifukube’s original orchestra motifs or the passing mention of an “oxygen destroyer,” but mourn the lack of political stakes. It’s big dumb fun (a smackdown with King Kong is on the horizon), and maybe that’s all these sequels ever were.

"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," Hollywood finally gets kaiju big battles right in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a film whose approach is part 21st-century action franchise (kick in the action early, then keep one-upping it until the big finale) and part 1970s Irwin Allen disaster saga (fill the cast with prestigious actors and give them just enough to do so they can elevate the goofy material). Whereas 2014’s “Godzilla” made us wait too long for the monster-movie money shots – vamping instead with uninteresting human characters – this one offers a family story made all the more heartfelt thanks to committed performances by Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler, not to mention a constant stream of the kind of rock-em-sock-em action that makes you want to see a film like this in the first place. And that action, unlike in “Pacific Rim,” isn’t constantly hidden by murk and rain and night and fog. Finally, here’s an American monster movie that understands that one positive effect of CG technology is to give us giant monsters that don’t rely on wires, miniatures or zipper-backed suits, something that the Japanese figured out ages ago. We open with the mysterious Monarch company continuing its research into the recently-surfaced giant monsters, or “titans,” as it calls them. Scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Farmiga) is in China, developing a doohickey that will take a monster’s language patterns and translate them into a dominant alpha signal. She’s finally gotten the thing to work on a larval Mothra when, wouldn’t you know it, a private army led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) shows up to steal the machine and kidnap Emma and her daughter Madison (Brown). Monarch and the U.S. Army swing by a Colorado wolf reserve to pick up Emma’s estranged husband Mark (Chandler) to help them find his wife and daughter. The family broke apart when their son was killed during Godzilla’s San Francisco rampage in the earlier film, leading Emma to dig deeper into her research and Mark to pull away. But while all that’s unfolding, Jonah and his team head to Antarctica to unleash the three-headed Ghidorah, and his re-emergence on the planet brings other monsters out of hiding while challenging Godzilla’s supremacy. Fans of the original 1954 Japanese “Gojira” (re-edited and released in the United States in 1956 as “Godzilla: King of the Monsters!”) will feel seen, not just by the title, but by the use of an “oxygen destroyer” (the old film’s secret weapon of choice) at one point and by the political underpinnings, a staple of the Japanese franchise from its origin to the recent “Shin Godzilla.” This is a big-budget movie that slips in messaging about biodiversity and waging war on the wrong targets, but never in a way that interrupts the excitement. Director Michael Dougherty (who co-wrote with his “Krampus” collaborator, Zach Shields) assembles an impressive ensemble of returning actors (Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins) and new additions (Zhang Ziyi, Bradley Whitford, O’Shea Jackson Jr.) and finds a way for them to spout technobabble and look at green screens in a way that gives the film real heft, even as it manically hops around the globe from one hot-spot to another. When Watanabe’s Dr. Serizawa notes, “Sometimes, the only way to heal a wound is to make peace with the demon who caused it,” it lands with real meaning and underscores the film’s ideas about geopolitics. And whenever Brown is on screen, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” does, for a moment, become a film about a family in crisis. The effects team gives the film’s various creatures real heft and substance, and the battle scenes are edited by Roger Barton (“World War Z”), Richard Pearson (“Kong: Skull Island”) and Bob Ducsay (“Star Wars: The Last Jedi”) in a way that’s breathlessly exciting without ever being too choppy. Unlike other CG-fests, this “Godzilla” gives us a good look at these iconic monsters and shows us what they’re capable of in battle. (If you think the delicately-winged Mothra can’t hold its own against the deadly Ghidorah, think again.) Yes, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is ultimately a Saturday matinee writ large, but that’s nothing to sneeze fire at; countless big, expensive action movies fail at making their way into a viewer’s pleasure center, but this one knows exactly how to be, in the truest sense of the word, sensational."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"A transcendent, elevating, purely cinematic experience. It's 'The Avengers' of giant monster movies."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," If you’re looking for monster fights, you’ll find monster fights aplenty in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The new film from director Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘r Treat, Krampus) picks up after the events of 2014’s Godzilla, in a world where giant “titans” have been popping up like acne. It’s only a matter of time before Earth’s mightiest protector, Godzilla, shows up to pop them all, and Dougherty doesn’t make you wait for it. We’ve got destruction in Scene One, a giant monster in Scene Two, and our first giant monster fight (of many) before the third act is even over.  It’s like Warner Bros. heard our collective complaints about Godzilla (2014) and unloaded three sequels worth of monster fights into one follow-up. I guess that’ll show us. Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel) and Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things) as Dr. Emma Russell and her daughter, Madison. They’re stationed in a rain forest, waiting for one of the newly discovered “titans” to hatch. There are 17 titans that the organization called Monarch – which has been studying these creatures since the events of Kong: Skull Island – is aware of, and the group is trying to convince the U.S. government to treat Godzilla more-or-less like an actual god so he can protect them from the more dangerous leviathans. Meanwhile, Dr. Russell has invented an “Orca” device which can be used to communicate with – and possibly control – these enormous creatures. But the second she successfully tests it, extreme environmentalist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance, Game of Thrones) kills everybody in the station and abducts Dr. Russell, Madison and the Orca. (Apparently they were all perched outside of Monarch’s doors, guns drawn, ready burst in or beat a hasty and embarrassed retreat if the Orca didn’t work today.) Jonah Alan can’t be trusted with the Orca, because A) he’s a murderer, and B) he wants to use it to free the titans and make them wreak havoc on Earth, in order to save the planet from humanity’s climate-changing madness. To find Jonah Alan, Monarch needs to find the Orca, and for some reason Dr. Russell never told anybody else how it worked, so they enlist her ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler, King Kong), who helped design the device many years ago, to track its signals across the globe, as the bad guys free one monster after another. There are a couple of unexpected reveals, but mostly Godzilla: King of the Monsters uses all of its build-up and mythologizing to justify flying around the world, chasing Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and Ghidorah as they fight each other and any other giant monster that wanders into their paths. Once the fighting starts it never stops for very long, and that’s a good thing, because even though the film’s supporting cast includes Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Bradley Whitford, Zhang Ziyi and O’Shea Jackson Jr., they’re all saddled with one-note characters who only exist to explain plot points or come up with new ones. Even the main cast struggles. Kyle Chandler plays “the inexperienced outsider who repeatedly teaches a whole team of experts how to do their jobs,” a role that hardly any actor can get away with, and playing an American condescending to an international cast only makes it harder for him to be likable. Vera Farmiga has some nearly impossible scenes where she has to justify seriously iffy decisions, and she mostly gets away with it. But at least Millie Bobby Brown emerges unscathed, playing a girl whose ideas and identity are challenged, who then steps up to the plate, which may be a straightforward arc but at least it’s a complete and effective one. So the human cast seems like they’re trapped in a 1990s disaster movie. They’re not the reason we’re here. We’re here for those giant monster fights and Godzilla: King of the Monsters has got them. Pretty much all of them. And they are unbelievably huge. Dougherty, his cinematographer Lawrence Sher (Joker) and the visual effects team have created vast leviathans who always look overwhelmingly gigantic, whether they’re in dangerously close shots or looming in the distance. Every fight features images that are suitable for framing, and the creatures themselves are so detailed that some – particularly Ghidorah – practically look like impeccable stop-motion. There are multiple matchups, often between multiple monsters, and they wreck damn near everything in their paths. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an impossibly huge movie, an exhilarating theme park attraction where the guides are all award-winning Hollywood stars. If you think of blockbuster movies like something that just happens to you, never mind thinking about it, this is a cornucopia of eye candy that’ll shake your seat and make you cheer. You’ll have a truly amazing time with Godzilla: King of the Monsters. If, on the other hand, you treat blockbuster movies like any other movies, you’re going to be frustrated by the film’s failure to take advantage of its astounding ensemble, not to mention its deeply confusing messaging. Godzilla started out as a metaphor for nuclear destruction but the only people in this movie trying to prevent man-made disasters are the villains, who are also trying to start man-made disasters. By the time the film is over, it’s genuinely hard to tell if the movie is trying to tell us the eco-terrorists had a point or not. If King of the Monsters hadn’t played like a toy commercial it could have gotten away with some moral ambiguity, but instead, it comes across like a big muddle of contradictory ideas. With that being said, let’s be clear (even if the movie isn’t): Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a big, kinda silly, but otherwise exciting blockbuster. It’s gorgeous, it’s epic in the extreme, and it features some of the most impressive monster fights you’ve ever seen. Maybe someday Americans will make a Godzilla movie that isn’t just “badass,” but which also works on another level and resonates in a meaningful way.

While you wait for Alien: Romulus, the folks over at Devilworks have cooked up their own slice of “mockbuster” fun with Alien Hunt, and we’re debuting the trailer here on BD this morning. This brand-new sci-fi horror from director Aaron Mirtes (The Bigfoot Trap, Painted in Blood) is set for its US premiere on May 14, and you can find it on digital thanks to Devilworks. You can exclusively watch the official trailer for Alien Hunt below, which looks to combine elements of Alien and Predator. This particular “mockbuster” has very little interest in hiding its inspirations, with the alien designs plucked straight out of H.R. Giger’s beautiful brain. Hey, if you’re going to pull from other movies, might as well take from the all-time greats! In Alien Hunt, “On a hunting trip in the wilderness, a group of siblings discovers an abandoned military outpost on their land, but is it what it seems? “Their trip takes a sinister turn when they find themselves facing off against a relentless army of extra-terrestrial beings. Suddenly, the hunters become the hunted. “The formidable squad of alien soldiers will stop at nothing to wipe out the enemy and in an all-out, brutal battle for survival, it’s kill or be killed in Alien Hunt.” Barron Boedecker (Escape Pod, The Bigfoot Trap), Brent Bentley (The Perfect In-Laws, Haunt Season), Deiondre Teagle (The Visitor, Painted in Blood, Death Ranch), Chelsey Fuller (The Bigfoot Trap, The Silent Natural), Jesse Santoyo (A Nashville Country Christmas, Potter’s Ground), and Adam Pietripaoli (The Bigfoot Trap, The OctoGames) star."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," I understand if you didn’t like Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla. It was a choice to obscure the monsters and if that’s who you came to see, you’d be disappointed. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is definitely more in the Kong: Skull Island mold, so maybe you’ll like that more but not me. Godzilla: King of the Monsters may have more monster battles on screen but they do everything they possibly can to make sure you still can’t see them. They’re dark, shaky and obscured by elements like rain and snow. Even when fun money shots happen, the action is on the bottom righthand corner of the frame. God forbid you have to see this in 3D where it’s even darker. No matter what the location, they find a way to make it ugly and incomprehensible. In Antarctica it’s all gray and snowing. Or they’re underwater and you can’t see (Hello, this is the studio that made Aquaman which was a bright and vibrant waterscape.) Even in Mexico with a volcano erupting it’s all dark, burnt and shaky. A climax includes lava and radiation in a flaming hellscape like a heavy metal album cover without the composition. It’s no Volcano, I’ll tell you that. They also keep cutting to the humans. If we’re basically all agreeing to watch animated movies at this point (because that’s what the monster scenes are), why bother having live-action elements anymore. It never looks like the actors are in the same place as the monsters. If your complaint with Edwards was that Godzilla wasn’t in the movie enough, he’s still hardly in this. There are 17 monsters in King of the Monsters so Godzilla is a supporting character in his own movie. Don’t get too excited, you don’t see all 17 fight each other. It’s only the main four who fight each other. There are also 17 human characters too. None of them get enough to latch onto. Gone are the days of epic ensemble movies like The Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno where everyone is a memorable character. Or hell, even Independence Day. There’s still a lot of science and military people talking in between the monster fights, just like a Toho Godzilla movie. Of course, Charles Dance is the best at it, and Kyle Chandler is committed to the drama of it. The movie stops dead for one liners that aren’t funny. “It’s going to be a bad day for Red Sox fans” when there’s destruction of Boston landmarks. We get it, you know sports. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is now the worst American Godzilla movie. Say what you will about Roland Emmerich’s, but at least he showed Godzilla a lot."
"May 28, 2019",NEUTRAL," “How many nukes do you have?” one character is asked in matter-of-fact fashion towards the end of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the cacophonous and deeply confusing new movie featuring the gigantic, dinosaur-like creature first seen in a Japanese film in 1954. The new Godzilla is a sequel to the 2014 feature directed by Gareth Edwards. Five years have passed since the day “the world discovered that monsters are real”. Whatever number of nukes or new weapons the humans may now possess, it will never be enough to kill off a creature who already has 35 movies to his credit. Besides, atomic blasts don’t harm Godzilla. They give him a healthy electric glow as if he has just eaten a big bowl of microwaved porridge. Director Michael Dougherty, who also co-wrote the screenplay, has thrown a huge amount of ingredients into the monster mix. This is partly a family melodrama, partly a sci-fi fable and partly a piece of sub Ed Wood, B-movie-style hokum. Early on, a kitchen scene involving bread about to burn in a toaster is treated with as much gravity as the apocalyptic moments that end the movie. Rebellious teenager Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things) has a close but strained relationship with her workaholic mom Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), the ace scientist who knows how to communicate with the monster. They’re getting over a bereavement. Madison’s father, the square-jawed scientist Dr Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), has taken the loss even worse than they have. Dougherty throws in footage of the family in happier days and keeps on showing close-ups of a photograph in which they are all together. Two parallel stories are being told here: one about the monsters and one about the teenage girl who yearns to go back home. You can see what Dougherty is trying to do. He wants to emphasise the human factor and to make the audience care for the characters. We all know that the film will soon turn into a gigantic wrecking spree but, as buildings are flattened and cities destroyed, we can still anchor ourselves in the intimate, everyday story of the rebellious adolescent and her troubled parents. The filmmakers are also keen to parade their eco-credentials. Godzilla may be a monster but he doesn’t drop litter or pollute the planet. Humans have been the dominant species for years but they’ve left a terrible mess behind them and they’ve been neglecting their recycling. The gimlet-eyed eco-terrorist played by Charles Dance is keen to rebalance earth. In his opinion, a little cleansing destruction will do the trick. Every human in the film seems vaguely sinister. The Monarch scientists who should be saving the planet are strangely flippant. They behave like teenagers playing a video game, high fiving and whooping at inappropriate moments. Farmiga’s Dr Russell is courageous but clearly slightly unhinged. Her estranged husband is an embittered and angry figure. Given that they can hardly communicate with each other, it’s a stretch to expect them to make contact with the creatures. Nonetheless, they have their own “alpha frequency” device, the “orca“, which, when tuned to the right radio frequency, has a wonderfully calming effect on Godzilla and his ilk. Far too much is going on here. At one stage, Moscow, London and Washington DC all come under attack at once as 17 different monsters emerge from the earth’s bowels. The filmmakers lose sight of most of them and end up concentrating on the epic battle between Godzilla and the three-headed, snake-like creepy-crawly Ghidorah. This is the cinematic equivalent of watching a WWF bout between two heavyweight wrestlers wearing scaly suits. The choreography is scrupulously even-handed. First, Ghidorah will be on top, using one of his many mouths to bite Godzilla. Then, Godzilla will have his moments of dominance as he tries to throttle one of Ghidorah’s many necks. The entire film has the feel of Hanna-Barbera animation. It is dismaying to see actors of the calibre of Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn and Sally Hawkins giving such cartoonish, one-dimensional performances. There is, though, something very satisfying about the sheer random destructiveness of the storytelling. The filmmakers are like kids knocking down their cousins’ elaborately constructed Lego models. They show huge glee as they go about their task. Meanwhile, Godzilla’s personality grows on us. Whether he is saving humanity or destroying it, he has a stoical, even-tempered quality that bodes well for his future battles. He is up against Kong in the next sequel, directed by Adam Wingard and due out in 2020, and it’s a fair bet that most viewers will be rooting for Godzilla in that particular battle. "
"May 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"If the chemistry between Farmiga and Brown goes underused, opportunities for monster mayhem do not."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," What is the expectation for a viewer stepping into a Godzilla movie in 2019? While I was thrilled with the gradual build-up provided by Gareth Edwards’ 2014 American relaunch of the classic kaiju, others decried the minimal presence of the title monster. Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels like a direct response. With a desire to deliver monster battles on an enormous scale, this latest entry in the longest-running movie franchise of all time (35 films and counting) has a mind on fulfilling the expectations of those wanting a more explicit reminder of the wackier days of the Godzilla series. This includes attempts to hold the film together with a story attempting to make sense of it all, though it may not be the most crucial aspect when watching titans tearing it up (preferably on an IMAX screen). Getting into the plot is a comical task. Understandably, a modern audience seems more concerned with rooting out issues and things misconceived as plot holes than merely engaging with nonsense now and again. For every superhero film and action spectacular that receives praise, plenty of folks feel concerned with making a note of what doesn’t make sense in a movie about superpowered folk, gunfighters, time travelers, and even giant monster movies.  So, what can I say about the story in Godzilla: King of the Monsters? This series includes stories involving nuclear accidents, space invaders, time travel, assassins, international spies, evil pollution monsters, the construction of a robotic Godzilla to go toe to toe with the original, sacred creatures watched over by magic fairies, and a theme park modeled after the very beast that has caused so much destruction. King of the Monsters is no less restrained when you sum it all up. It concerns the efforts of the crypto-zoological group, Monarch, to contain the increasing number of gigantic monsters surfacing around the globe. An eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) with another agenda on his mind gets involved, resulting in the release of Ghidorah, the three-headed monster, and a rival alpha that can challenge Godzilla, the peacekeeper. The story is nuts. That’s what a Godzilla movie tends to be. You can look through the 60s/70s films in particular and see the filmmakers leaning into the ridiculous, but you can also see the attempts to maintain a specific tone. The 80s/90s films played a different angle, choosing to be on board with a higher level of seriousness, despite the crazy monster battles that surrounded the cast. King of the Monsters feels like that middle era (the Heisei period), as it’s doing its best to treat these giant monsters like the threats found in disaster movies. It’s not about action heroics, as the big beasts do all the fighting. Instead, you have a bunch of scientists doing whatever they can to hold onto a workable tone for the film that helps it feel thought out and fun. Does all of this really matter if you are simply looking for giant monster battles? Try as he might, director and co-writer Michael Dougherty does little to hide his reverence for these classic kaiju creatures. Already having worked with monsters on a smaller scale in horror comedies Trick ‘r Treat and Krampus, King of the Monsters challenges him to think big, and Dougherty delivers. If you have concerns for the effectiveness of leads Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown as a family at odds with each other over what actions to take concerning these monsters, the material is there, and the actors are good enough to handle it, however shallow the characters may seem. Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields understand this too, which is why the cast is stacked with recognizable and effective co-stars, including Bradley Whitford, Zhang Ziyi, Thomas Middleditch, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Aisha Hinds, and a returning Sally Hawkins & Ken Watanabe. It’s the kind of cast that has enough presence without being there to overshadow what matters, the incredible monster fights. As a fan of the Godzilla franchise, the idea of seeing not only Godzilla, but Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah brought to life in 2019, is unbelievable. Turning these kaiju that have primarily been seen as puppets and practical rubber suits wrestling each other into intimidating visual effects-driven monsters is a wild sight to behold. Everyone has their favorites, but I was particularly impressed with the work done with Ghidorah. What was once a wacky three-headed puppet is now a real menace, where the heads have distinct personalities, and the immense size makes me consider the gargantuan effect it has on everything around it. With a more standard summer movie approach relying on characters shouting exposition in between action sequences that arrive every twenty minutes, great depth is not so much a concern here. Even the climate change subtext that was a part of the Spielbergian approach to 2014’s Godzilla is called out much more directly (and yes, I want to see a Ghidorah-Godzilla-Thanos three-way brawl). We’re a long way from the deliberately haunting tone of the original 1954 film that found director Ishiro Honda using Godzilla as a metaphor for the horrors of nuclear fallout. However, that’s not to say this film is failing to live up to the legacy of this series. What King of the Monsters may lack in graceful approach to parables, it makes up for in the artistry of what a giant monster movie can offer. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography finds real beauty in how to put these massive beasts on display. Wide shots portray these creatures as if they were once a part of some warped version of a Rembrandt painting. Striking color contrasts pave the way for audiences to have a terrific visual understanding of these creatures. Bear McCreary’s score is suitably playing to the scale of this film, mixing in touches of the original compositions by Akira Ifukube whenever he sees fit. For a film that fits as the literal biggest event of the summer, the effort in production is presented ever so clearly. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is big and bold in its choices. It delivers the monster battles you want to see on a huge screen while supplying a story ridiculous and straightforward enough to have fun with in between the visual effects mayhem. Even in its broad attempts to go poignant, there’s effort put in by the cast to maintain a proper tone. How else can you explain the commitment Ken Watanabe brings when staring eye to eye with Godzilla or the ethereal bonding seen between Zhang Ziyi and Mothra? This film knows what it is, as Dougherty and his team have done what is needed to bring on a giant monster movie that’s as chaotic as it is fun. The expectation for a viewer: Let them fight."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is the latest film from co-writer and director Michael Dougherty (Krampus, Trick ‘R Treat) and is an incredible, show-stopping addition to the Godzilla franchise that finds our favorite sea monster up against some of the most dangerous monsters in the history of the franchise. The film stars Kyle Chandler (The Wolf of Wall Street, Argo), Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, The Conjuring films), Millie Bobby Brown (TV’s Stranger Things), Bradley Whitford (Get Out, The Post), Sally Hawkins (The Shape of Water), O’Shea Jackson Jr. (Straight Outta Compton) and Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai, Inception, Godzilla). In this new story, we follow the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Radan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species – thought to be mere myths – rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity’s very existence hanging in the balance. With destruction and chaos raining down upon cities all over the world, and loyalties tested and secrets unearthed, it’s up to a few to help Godzilla put a stop to these Titans. When it comes to god-like monsters, Godzilla definitely takes the cake. As one of the most recognizable figures in pop-culture history, the Godzilla franchise has amassed over 35 films in its honor since 1954. I’ll be the first to admit that I have not seen all the films, as my introduction into the franchise was the 1998 Godzilla film (which man, that movie does not stand the test of time), followed by 2014’s Godzilla (which I loved). As a massive fan of director Michael Dougherty’s work, I was beyond excited to see how he would take such a beloved monster icon and make it his own, and I’m happy to report that he did not disappoint. Though there were some issues with the writing in terms of the story feeling choppy and disjointed at times, the visuals and overall execution were beyond impressive. I think what I enjoyed most about GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS was that it was a reminder that humans are capable of being just as monstrous and destructive as the Titans, just in their own way. We find out very early on that the Russell family was affected tremendously with the events that happened in the 2014 Godzilla film. We then fast-forward five years and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), along with her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), is hard at work on a device for Monarch that could potentially allow us to communicate with the Titans. Meanwhile, Dr. Russell’s husband Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), wants nothing to do with the organization until his wife and daughter are kidnapped, forcing him to join the Monarch scientists in order to rescue them and help with combating the Titans. Through this portion of the film not only do we see the re-emergence of Godzilla and the accompanying Titans, but we also become privy to secrets and betrayal. For some, the human interactions may not seem as interesting as the large-scale fight scenes between the Titans, but for me, I found it to be both surprising and relevant to a lot of what is going on in the world while also questioning what is truly good and what is truly bad. As for Godzilla himself, he has always been a metaphor for what is going on in the world, and once again, he is a reminder of how humanity is destroying itself and the world.  Most impressive was by far the visuals and the CGI. The special effects used in the creation of Godzilla and the Titans looked positively seamless and beautiful. Add in the cinematography of Lawrence Sher and you have a film that will leave you stunned and breathless. Furthermore, the music, which is composed by Bear McCreary (10 Cloverfield Lane) is both unnerving and exquisite, lending itself perfectly to the chaos unfolding all around. I was also very drawn to the use of color and it how that identified each of the Titans. Having had the chance to speak with Dougherty about the color symbolism, he informed me that it was due to what they represent – earth, wind, fire, and air. Honestly, the film is a stunning piece of art and I can’t urge you all enough to watch it on the biggest screen that you can. Like me, you’ll probably find yourself constantly having to pick your jaw up from the floor. Even with some of the minor issues with the writing, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is still a sight to behold. Vera Farmiga, per usual, is fantastic and Millie Bobby Brown kills it in her feature film debut. I would have loved to have seen Bradley Whitford’s character more but regardless, he ends up being the comic relief that the film embraces wholeheartedly. The cast as a whole does a tremendous job and it was such a pleasure to see both Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) return to the series and for the mythology around these creations to take on an even larger form while also paying homage to the earlier films. In all, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is an astonishing creation and one that I think Godzilla fans far and wide will enjoy. The reveal of the Titans are spectacular with iconic fight scenes between Godzilla and his opponents. It safe to say that the King has risen again and I don’t think he’ll be going anywhere anytime soon. GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS opens in theaters May 31, 2019."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"  Fans of Godzilla movies–and the kaiju genre overall–don’t have a high bar of expectations when they sit down to enjoy a movie about giant monsters beating the shit out of each other. Essentially, that is exactly what we want to see: titanic creatures clobbering each other and smashing the hell out of whatever unfortunately gets in their way, usually in the form of entire cities. Of course we want to see it done well; noticing a zipper running down the back of King Ghidorah’s spine can take you out of the fantasy just as easily as the buildings looking too much like papier-mache as they crumble. We don’t need to be enlightened, but we don’t want to be insulted either. So why has it been so hard to get it right? Toho, the studio that brought the kaiju genre to mass public consciousness, has had more than its share of clunkers over the course of the 65 years it’s been producing Godzilla movies, but generally speaking, if you do anything for more than six decades, you’re not going to do it well every time out. But America, and Hollywood to be specific, has rarely gotten it right relative to its output. The disaster that was 1998’s Godzilla has been well-documented over the past 20 years, and while director Gareth Edwards’ 2014 reboot took several major steps in the right direction, its notable flaws have diminished its impact over the past five years. 2017’s Kong: Skull Island was a course correction in many ways, amping up the monster-on-monster action, creating a general tone of barely repressed insanity and laying the groundwork for a shared universe that actually made sense. And now comes Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the third and easily best entry in Legendary Pictures and Warner Brothers’ MonsterVerse, and the first Hollywood production to truly capture the awe, excitement and lunacy that made so many of us run eagerly to our TVs on Saturday mornings (or weekday afternoons) hoping to catch one of Toho’s more magical outings. Director Michael Dougherty has stayed primarily in the horror or superhero lanes until now, writing/directing modest but effective chillers like Trick ‘R Treat and Krampus while also contributing as a screenwriter to the soon-about-to-end X-Men franchise. Dougherty has real genre cred and, as he makes more than clear in both his interviews and the work up on the screen, is an unabashed Godzilla, Toho, and kaiju fan. So was Gareth Edwards, by the way, but he was hampered by both the usual constraints of an origin story as well as his script’s structural issues. Dougherty has dispensed with all of that. Working himself on the new movie’s script, along with Zach Shields and Max Borenstein, he’s fixed two problems that dogged the 2014 film: the lack of thrilling monster action until well into the second hour (and Edwards’ curious decision to cut away from it), and the lack of engagement with the human characters. No one is going to accuse Godzilla: King of the Monsters or its game and competent cast of creating nuanced, multi-faceted humans, but they certainly come to play and are at least a pro-active part of the action as opposed to the powerless cyphers of the previous film. As for the monsters, Dougherty brings back some of Godzilla’s greatest foes and allies and sets them at each other’s throats with a sense of scale that dwarfs just about everything you’ve seen before. At its heart, the movie is about a broken family: scientists Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga) both used to work for Monarch, the government organization tasked with tracking and, if possible, containing the spread of the ancient, giant creatures known as Titans, more of whom are emerging in the wake of Godzilla’s arrival five years earlier. A family tragedy has split them apart, with Emma continuing to work on the Orca, a device capable of communicating with Titans, while Kyle has retreated from the mission. Caught in the middle is their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), who loves both but cannot bridge their emotional and philosophical chasm. That chasm grows even wider when Emma and Madison are kidnapped by an eco-terrorist organization led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), who has his own ambitions for the Russells’ Orca technology. The resulting human conflict leads to the awakening of King Ghidorah, a more fearsome and larger beast than any seen in this universe, and a creature capable of not just wiping out all human life on Earth but rallying the other monsters to its side as well. The only creature who may be able to take on Ghidorah is Godzilla himself, but the humans of Monarch are not entirely sure that he has their best interests at heart. There’s not much in the way of shocking revelations or spoilers in the script for Godzilla: King of the Monsters, although there are a number of homages to previous Godzilla and Toho films that will delight diehard fans, especially if they experience them without advance notice. It’s no spoiler to say that most of the movie is given over to a true clash of the Titans, as Godzilla and Ghidorah go head to head while two of the most famous supporting Toho monsters, Rodan and Mothra, join the fray at various critical junctures. The humans weave in and out of the story, zipping around the globe in planes, boats, and subs. They’re actively participating instead of just watching the world crumble around them, which makes for a faster-paced and more satisfying story. It doesn’t hurt that Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins return from the 2014 film as both connective links and avatars of scientific gravitas, while excellent comic relief is provided by Bradley Whitford as a kind of live-action Rick Sanchez. Make no mistake, however: Dougherty is much more interested, and rightly so, in massive beasts bringing the Earth crashing down around everyone’s ears. Godzilla: King of the Monsters has plenty of money shots of pure spectacle, and while some of the action gets a little confusing on the ground (the death of one major character almost goes by before you realize it), he stages the battle royales with elegance, scope, and power. The four main monsters always feel huge and their destructive power vast, but there are several quieter moments–one between the humans and Mothra, another between a dying human and Godzilla–that hint at a supreme and unknowable intelligence at work as well. The director also gets off a number of clever tableaux, such as Ghidorah rising from a mountaintop, the atmosphere and landscape around him almost buckling, while a solitary cross stands forlornly in the foreground: the old, true gods coming back to shove aside humanity’s younger, feebler beliefs. In keeping with the pro-nature and pro-environment message of many of the Toho films, Godzilla: King of the Monsters also expands on the idea that the Titans are here to protect Earth from us as well, although they’ll tolerate our presence if we stop trashing the place. Ghidorah, who brings extreme weather with him wherever he goes, is a walking embodiment of climate change at its worst. Don’t think, however, that Godzilla: King of the Monsters is preachy in any way; it’s not, and enough of the exposition is delivered so quickly that you may lose track of which monster is on whose side at times. But none of that really matters: Godzilla: King of the Monsters is as enjoyable, electrifying, and satisfying a kaiju extravaganza as a fan could possibly want. The bar has been met and even exceeded, and the crown can now pass to this iteration of the king."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” can be accused of overkill. Then again, there’s so much to kill! Though we don’t meet them all, we’re told that no fewer than 17 massive creatures, hidden away in Antarctic ice packs, Mexican volcanoes, oceanic bachelor pads and what have you, come a-calling in this enjoyably chaotic continuation of the so-called “MonsterVerse” put into play by the 2014 “Godzilla” and the 2017 “Kong: Skull Island.” As the paleo-zoologist played by Sally Hawkins summarizes early on, eyes wide and mouth agape, studiously avoiding technical jargon: “They’re everywhere.” The new film likewise scoots all over the place, in a near-constant onslaught of rain. When last we saw Godzilla five years ago, he had chosen to retire, gunslinger style, after saving the world (while destroying much of it) and leveling San Francisco in the process. The “Skull Island” epilogue more recently rolled out the blood-red carpet for a host of additional monsters, tracked for decades by the super-secret agency known as Monarch. Key non-human players in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” include Godzilla, whose head remains touchingly small for his body, and therefore reminds me of our dog, Maisie; the bat-winged hydra-headed dragon King Ghidorah (first introduced in 1964’s “Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster”), who surely knows the subtitle of this film specifies Godzilla as Earth’s rightful monster king; the glowing, sympathetic Mothra, who doesn’t look like a killer but then, neither do most killers; and Rodan, the volcano-dwelling fire demon.The humans familiar from previous MonsterVerse pictures are led, staring, agog, by Ken Watanabe. Reaction shot after reaction shot proves it: This man is the king of the staring-agog division of screen acting. The fractured, grieving family unit introduced in “Godzilla, King of the Monsters,” meantime, takes up most of the narrative acreage. A son was lost in the 2014 San Francisco melee. Now divorced, the boy’s mother (Vera Farmiga, high priestess of dramatic exposition) and father (Kyle Chandler, getting paid by the glare and worth every dime) are the inventors of a bio-sonar means of communicating with the monsters. This little boom box, known as ORCA, serves as the linchpin of plot devices in the script by director Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields. Some of the motivations and reversals involving a vicious eco-terrorist (Charles Dance), who swipes the boom box, lack a pleasing clarity. The script’s quippy streak could’ve used better jokes. But this is one franchise that doesn’t feel fished out or exhausted or exhausting.The monsters, Toho studio classics redesigned but faithfully so, are pretty swell and monumentally destructive. The real stars here? Sound designers Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van Der Ryn, whose aural creature designs actually sound like something new — part machine, part prehistoric whatzit. Director  Dougherty keeps his hand-held cameras very close to the human faces, too much so, probably. But he’s going for a very different, more action-laden movie than director Gareth Edwards’ “Godzilla.” I don’t think it constitutes a spoiler to mention the climax, a two-bout, four-creature smackdown set (in a downpour, natch) in Boston’s Fenway Park. Between the Ben Affleck robbery thriller “The Town” and “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” there can’t be much left of it. In “Kong: Skull Island” the John C. Reilly character lived and died by the Cubs, and memories of Wrigley Field. Truly, this franchise is major league baseball’s best friend."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,"The net effect is more numbing than stirring, with only a few monster-on-monster tussles that come close to being worth the price of admission."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," The Godzilla formula is at once very specific and relatively flexible, allowing filmmakers to put their individual stamp on the familiar story of a giant reptile destroying a city. Previous films in the six-decades-old franchise have offered awe-inspiring spectacle, biting satire, or, most commonly, kid-friendly goofiness. Michael Dougherty, director of the holiday horror movie Krampus, is fixated on the monsters themselves, and proves as much by jamming three kaiju set pieces into the first 45 minutes of Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. The creature design in King Of The Monsters is bespoke—it looks like Godzilla has been hitting the gym between movies—and meticulously detailed, with special attention paid to texture. The monsters are alternately painterly and lifelike, and their movements are expressive enough to convey  personality even through the sheets of computer-generated rain that pour down throughout the film’s climax. When they fight each other, or scream in triumph over the smoking ruins of various world capitals, it’s difficult not to fist-pump  a little. However, to Dougherty’s presumed disappointment—and to this movie’s ultimate detriment—you can’t just have two hours of kaiju slapping each other around like a gargantuan WWE highlights reel. In fact, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is reminiscent of an era when the popularity of pro wrestling was at its height. The film blends bombastic excess and deadpan silliness in a way that recalls late ’90s action films of the Michael Bay/Roland Emmerich school. (Think: a machine-gun wielding grunt muttering, “Oh, shit,” just before a massive CGI explosion sends bodies and helicopters flying in all directions.) Even the decision to make the film’s human bad, Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), an ecoterrorist has an endearing ’90s nostalgia to it. But although it seems as though Will Smith could walk around the corner at any moment, the quippy heavy lifting is performed by Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Chief Warrant Officer Barnes (O’Shea Jackson Jr.), with Whitford in the role of the gum-chewing, snarky skeptic and Jackson playing the career soldier who keeps emptying round after round into the monsters, even after it becomes obvious that the big guys can’t even feel it. Unfortunately for the rest of the cast—like poor Thomas Middleditch, who looks genuinely uncomfortable throughout—it takes a certain sardonic flair to deliver  hammy lines in a way that induces knowing laughs instead of derisive ones. And with dramatic actors like Dance, Sally Hawkins (who disappears halfway through  with very little fanfare), Zhang Ziyi, and Aisha Hinds rounding out the ensemble cast, the dialogue ends up being unintentionally funny more often than intentionally so. Then there’s Ken Watanabe, who has the gravitas to make anything sound good but whose quest for spiritual communion with the beasts is from another movie altogether. Add in the trading-card aspect of the globe-trotting trips to secret military bases around the world and a self-serious but extremely muddled nuclear/climate change metaphor, and you’ve got a film that is clearly invested in its own mythology but too scattered to decide which direction it wants to take it in. The least successful flavor in this swirl of them is the family drama, which brings in characters that were not in the previous film, Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla, though they’re written as if they were. Vera Farmiga stars as Dr. Emma Russell, a brilliant scientist driven to the point of obsession by—what else?—the death of her youngest in Godzilla’s rampage across San Francisco last time around. Dr. Russell is developing a device called ORCA that can communicate with the kaiju through sonar à la whales or dolphins, but her holistic approach is deeply unpopular among the general public, which is mostly in favor of just nuking the “Titans” to hell. Russell has a sadsack ex-husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler), recruited by MONARCH—the series’ monster-investigating intelligence agency—after his ex-wife and their daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), are kidnapped by the ecoterrorists. For her part, Brown wears the traditional baseball cap of a precocious Godzilla kid, but her performance is more sullen than outright annoying (as Godzilla kids also traditionally tend to be). She’s clearly very used to all of this, so much so that she doesn’t seem to notice 150-foot monsters battling all around her when she’s got her air pods in. Of a piece with that particular bit of cognitive dissonance  is the film’s sense of scale, or lack thereof. The sheer size difference between human and kaiju that was so prominent in Edwards’ Godzilla disappears from King Of The Monsters once  the big fights really start cooking, and is never recovered. That’s not to say said fights aren’t cool. The action is pretty legible, all things considered, and the compositions are often beautiful, with a strong element of chiaroscuro. In contrast to the mixed tones, the monsters are coded in straightforward elemental colors: Oversized insect Mothra is born as a glowing blue pupa that hatches into a butterfly whose elegant wings give off puffs of gold glitter, while the pterodactyl Rodan explodes out of a long-dormant Mexican volcano with hard and crispy lava skin and orange magma blood. Some of the set design, particularly MONARCH’s underground headquarters and an ancient underwater temple, is gorgeous as well. It’s just that, in his eagerness to smash together Godzilla and Rodan and Mothra and the three-headed dragon Ghidorah like so many action figures in his personal blockbuster sandbox, Dougherty doesn’t seem to have thought through how it should all fit together. Of course the monsters should be the stars of a Godzilla movie. But until blockbuster filmmaking goes entirely non-narrative, some attention should be paid to the rest of it as well."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," Confession time: I love it when one gigantic thing fights another gigantic thing. They can be monsters like Godzilla or robots like Mechas or robot-monsters like Mechagodzilla. So long as they’re tossing each other through skyscrapers or landing sucker-punches in the middle of the ocean, I will be, at the very least, temporarily enthralled. This is likely a symptom of growing up as a television-obsessed, upper-middle-class little boy in the 1980s, when the entertainment landscape’s ancillary toy market was saturated by “good” action figures whose only purpose was to smash up against “bad” action figures (and maybe the occasional foot or eye of a sibling; sorry, Paul!). I realize how cheap and juvenile these thrills are, and why I should have long outgrown such base pleasures once I started to, say, put on my own pants. Definitely by the time I started to calculate mortgage rates. But I haven’t, and neither has a good portion of today’s movie-going population, which is why Hollywood is now mostly in the business of Giant Noun vs. Equally Giant Noun. Yet, there are wildly different levels of quality within this stupidity. First, stupidity does not equate to visual incoherence, which is why Michael Bay’s final few Transformers films have sucked dry any easy smashy-smash pleasures. Second, you have to have a scintilla of emotional investment in a clobber-fest’s outcome, which is why such recent and creatively emaciated efforts as Pacific Rim: Uprising and Rampage replaced the excitement of watching a fight with the sensation of being punched in the face. And third, you have to deliver a genuine sense of location and street-level destruction, which is why the finale of Avengers: Endgame, set in some intangible CGI no-man’s-land that felt as real as the inside of your iPhone, felt so soulless and arbitrary. Fortunately, the new film Godzilla: King of the Monsters rises to all three of these challenges to hit Peak Stupidity, in a good way. Director Michael Dougherty’s sequel to 2014′s giant-lizard reboot – marking the 36th time the big boy has been seen onscreen since 1954 – is everything your stupid inner child could hope for. Monsters take over the world, fight with each other to the death and destroy countless cities in the process. The creature design is superb, the action is relentless, it is all captured beautifully, and Godzilla’s many melees are injected with just enough dramatic tension to make us care about which beast will come out on top of the mayhem. The stupid film’s only problem, then, is when it tries to be smart. Like Gareth Edwards’s 2014 movie, Dougherty’s follow-up has set itself up to be in constant conflict with itself. Its only reason for being is to stage fights between Godzilla and his equally large enemies (including the pterodactyl-like Rodan and the three-headed dragonesque Ghidorah). Yet, the film also wants to tell a deep and dark story about humanity’s tendency toward self-destruction, and there is a distinct sense that it feels above all this monster nonsense. Or that’s how it feels about 45 per cent of the time, which is how long Dougherty focuses on a group of scientists and military types, the standard human fodder for the genre. This balance of beasts and brains could have worked were these puny humans very interesting or possessing compelling narrative arcs. But mostly there is little reason to care about, say, the motivations of Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) for unleashing a frozen Ghidorah upon the world, or why her ex-husband Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) is convinced that only Godzilla can stop the destruction, or how the couple’s daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) may hold the key to everything. Dougherty and his co-writer Zach Shields also weigh the film down with loads of soggy mythology about Monarch, the shadowy government agency that is meant to act as the cohesive franchise bond between this film, 2017′s Kong: Skull Island and next year’s Godzilla vs. Kong. (If you have to ask whether this film includes a postcredits scene further setting up the brand, then bless you, child, you’re so sweet.) Yet, when Dougherty is able to keep these intelligent-ish impulses at bay, King of the Monsters is stupendous stupidity. In addition to all the varied kaijus (Japanese for “strange creatures”), the good dumb fun this time around includes active volcanoes, subterranean wormholes, military jets the size of aircraft carriers and a brief detour to what is more or less the lost city of Atlantis. But a Godzilla movie rests on its titular Lizard King, and Dougherty’s large adult son delivers. Godzilla thrashes and stomps his way into our hearts with ease, and by the time the walking, shrieking metaphor for the Nuclear Age biologically revs up his back scales to unleash a torrent of white-hot fire upon Ghidorah, the sweet embrace of stupidity feels like a big, warm, radioactive hug.

"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," The very first thing Godzilla: King of the Monsters presents to you is the blaring skree-onk of Godzilla’s iconic caterwauling cry. It sets the tone immediately: This is not going to go how 2014's Godzilla reboot went. It’s also perhaps not going to go the way you might have expected it to. Ever since its haunting first trailer wowed San Diego Comic-Con last year, Michael Dougherty’s King of the Monsters has presented itself as an artful paean to the inherent beauty of its monsters. Everything from “Clair de Lune” to tasteful orchestral covers of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” has soundtracked footage of Godzilla and his kaiju cohorts, inviting us to consider the poetry behind the carnage unfolding. But while the film itself does indeed revel in the destruction its gigantic namesake and its monstrous rivals to the throne bring with them, it doesn’t really have anything poetic to say about that calamity, beyond acknowledging that watching a giant, three-headed dragon barrel towards an atomic-breath-spewing radioactive monstrosity is completely and utterly awesome. As a love letter to the cinematic history of these beloved beasts, King of the Monsters excels, an antidote to the collective dismay that Gareth Edwards’ 2014 cinematic reboot spent more time teasing epic monster fights instead of actually showing them. While there are plenty of intriguing aspersions and allusions to the vivid, half-century-plus history these creatures have on film in the background of King of the Monsters for diehard kaiju fans, this is a movie that is all about its triumphant action—whether it’s watching hapless humans get mulched and blasted by monster stomps and electric breath-blasts, or the even bigger thrill unfolding as Godzilla and Ghidorah truly begin their tussle for the titular crown (Rodan and Mothra admittedly play second ringers, but each get their moments to truly shine). Every set piece in the film is vividly, gorgeously rendered, artfully shot to convey a sense of scale and scope to its destruction unlike anything its predecessor—or even any other action movie around right now—could even begin to comprehend. There is a coherence to Dougherty’s framing of the action too, that straddles a difficult line between being clear enough for audiences to see (and admire), while visually hectic enough to convey the alien, furious scope of the monstrous battles unfolding in front of their cosmic beam and explosion-seared eyeballs.  If you’re the certain kind of person who would cheer as Godzilla drags himself up from a beating to charge back into combat against his three-headed foe, then King of the Monsters doesn’t just invite you to do so openly, but encourages it with a gleeful gusto with its almost ceaseless dedication to bringing the full weight of its monstrous stars to bear. It helps that Big G and his titanic comrades also have oodles of personality to them—from the way they thunder across landscapes or through the piercing screeches of their battle cries—that make them feel just as charismatic on screen as their human counterparts, if not more so at times. Therein lies one of the films’ problems, however. Being so gloriously self-indulgent with its impressive action means that ultimately what King of the Monsters cannot cure from its predecessor is a weak storyline driven by its human stars, one that wildly veers from place to place with little coherent sense beyond needing to set the stage for another epic action sequence. It is here that King of the Monsters is at its weakest, and it’s a weakness that will be exacerbated by just how much you brought into the movie’s pre-release presentation as a monster movie with something to say.  Set five years after the events of Edwards’ Western reboot of the Godzilla cinematic opus, King of the Monsters takes place in a world that, while free of monstrous carnage since the fateful attacks of the original movie, is one that’s been forever changed. Monarch, the shadowy organization tasked with originally attempting to cover up Godzilla’s emergence (and now acts as the narrative thread unifying a cinematic franchise that’s already roped in King Kong for a future scrap) is now an all-powerful organization going toe-to-toe with the world’s militaries and governments as it researches and contains not just Godzilla’s presence on Earth, but dozens of other sleeping titans. But when a group of eco-terrorists swipes experimental Monarch technology to awaken the monsters buried beneath the Earth, the stage is set for an all-out battle royale between the likes of Toho icons Rodan, Mothra, and Ghidorah, as they all come face to face with the return of Godzilla himself.  While the basic narrative is propelled by the drama of Monarch’s scientist/black ops team—headed by Ken Watanabe’s Ishirō Serizawa, returning from 2014's Godzilla—trying to chase after the bafflingly well equipped eco-terrorist cell lead by Colonel Alan Jonah (Game of Thrones’ Charles Dance, who clearly revels in being a comic book villain sick and tired of the idiot heroes chasing after him), King of the Monsters’ human heart is centered on the plight of the Russell family. Torn apart after the loss of their son in the background events of the 2014 movie, doctors Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma (Vera Farmiga) Russell find themselves on opposing sides over Godzilla’s place on the Earth. Despite their differences over whether or not the creature and his ilk should be killed or co-operated with, the two soon find themselves—alongside their young daughter Madison (Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown)—caught in the middle after the technological MacGuffin they were working on as a way to communicate with Godzilla and his fellow monsters, the Orca, is swiped up in the globe-hopping quest to unleash a titanic do-over on the planet. While the premise opens up some potentially interesting questions, the problem is that King of the Monsters almost immediately drops any pretense of the moral debate it sets up in its early moments in order to facilitate its (incredibly lovely-looking, at least) monster action. The human characters are paper-thin, and given very little to really do other than to look in either awe or horror at the action around them while occasionally spouting bland hoo-ah mannerisms. At their best they’re a boring facade for the monstrous stars to stomp around in front of, at worse they make increasingly bonkers decisions that feel like they serve only to facilitate the plot arriving at more monster mayhem, rather than because they actually feel like coherent choices ostensibly smart people (they are scientists, after all!) would make. Brown probably stands as out as the highlight of the human cast, but even then, as Madison she gets little more to do than either be frustrated by the adults around her in the wake of all-out-monster mania, or scream at said mania. The flaws of King of the Monsters’ human side are exacerbated by a wildly inconsistent tone, too. The movie thunders along at a rapid pace thanks to its action, but it dances between wanting you to be horrified by the scope and cost of the monsters’ destruction, before asking you to laugh at something like Bradley Whitford’s Rick & Morty-ian scientist making some crude joke in the background seconds later. Entire threads and character arcs disappear from the film willy-nilly in order to chase the next big monster bash, especially as it draws to its explosive conclusion. It comes together to leave the feeling that King of the Monsters is little more than beautifully stunning sound and fury, sadly signifying nothing for its human stars—beyond them being a vector in which the movie can thickly spread on some b-movie cheese that lends the whole endeavor a sort of “classic monster movie with a modern budget” vibe.  King of the Monsters quickly reveals itself as not the movie its artful trailers sold you on, and arguably never seemingly was meant to be, but that’s fine. Indeed, plenty of Toho’s classic Godzilla movies have likewise been all about the simple joy of the explosive spectacle Godzilla and his titanic foes can unleash. But some of the very best have at least had things to say about topics like nuclear warfare, environmentalism, and Japanese nationalism beyond their monstrous action. King of the Monsters barely tries in its own attempts to add an ecological bent to the reasoning behind its clash of titans—turns out that we are the real monsters, after all—and almost unabashedly leans into knowing how little it has to try on that front, self-aware that you will clearly care as little as possible about the plight of its human characters when the alternative is more spectacular action.  Whether or not that is an unassailable dealbreaker or not will depend on how much you enjoy the cheap thrill of gorgeously rendered monster action. If you’re fine with some incredibly stupid people playing second fiddle to glorious kaiju moments, King of the Monsters will provide one of the best popcorn blockbusters of the summer. But if you wanted a Godzilla movie that had something, anything to say about its destruction? Then you’ll be definitely looking for something meatier than Ghidorah flank to chew on."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," If there was an overriding complaint with Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla reboot, it was a surprising lack of screen time for its titular mutant lizard — the director’s admirable attempt at restraint instead resulting in a Godzilla film that barely featured any, well, Godzilla. Krampus director Michael Dougherty’s sequel, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters, feels like a direct address to that issue, introducing more of Toho’s classic creatures — from Mothra and Rodan, to three-headed dragon King Ghidorah — for the big guy to brawl. But while it isn’t lacking for behemothic beasts, the latest entry in the MonsterVerse suffers in nearly every other conceivable way. While the film promises plenty more monsters, it’s clogged up with a bafflingly large cast of humans. Doctors Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga) are the creators of the Orca, a MacGuffin able to signal the ancient monster ‘Titans’, and are tied to nebulous monster organisation Monarch — the MonsterVerse equivalent of S.H.I.E.L.D. — whose interest in the tech sparks a fresh outburst of creature activity. Enter a swathe of Monarch associates: Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins returning from the previous film to establish connective tissue; Silicon Valley’s Thomas Middleditch to fumble awkwardly; Bradley Whitford to dispense zany quips; Zhang Ziyi to stereotypically intone about ancient myths; Aisha Hinds to dispense orders to O’Shea Jackson Jr and Anthony Ramos’ soldiers. Also along for the ride is Millie Bobby Brown as the Russells’ long-suffering daughter Madison, while Charles Dance pops up sporadically as an eco-terrorist-cum-monster-DNA-trafficker. You won’t know why most of them are there, or care a jot what happens to any of them. That’s because the staggeringly poor script merely has everyone standing around and explaining the plot and their personal motivations to one another in dialogue so clichéd that it goes far beyond winking B-movie pastiche. When characters aren’t spouting dramatically inert Monarch-centric exposition that only exists to establish Wikipedia-dump franchise lore, they’re somehow mysteriously guessing Godzilla’s own intentions. And yet what little character traits are established are inconsistent and routinely ignored — grieving father Mark is set up as monster-phobic one minute, but has everyone chase after Godzilla the next. There’s no human spark to any of them, nobody to truly root for. All of which would be more forgivable if the monster mash-ups satisfied — but they too disappoint. For the most part the action sequences are lost in shaky cameras and jittery editing, with the first key set-piece taking place in a storm that renders everything genuinely incoherent. When the final smackdown between Godzilla and Ghidorah comes, the result is an overload of repetitive, joyless destruction that mistakes volume and demolition for actual excitement. The scale of the monster fights is so unengagingly huge that an attempt at a human-level story amid the carnage in the final reel feels almost laughably inconsequential — it’s a gulf that the film cannot reconcile. Despite fleeting moments of beauty, King Of The Monsters largely fails to conjure any sense of awe about its creatures, with the sole exception of the ethereal Mothra. What you’re left with is a catastrophically dumb, thunderously boring blockbuster as numbing and unsatisfying as the worst Transformers movies — even one hilariously nutty sub-aquatic development can’t liven things up. Despite the occasional fan-pleasing plot nod to the original 1954 Godzilla, King Of The Monsters has a glib attitude to nuclear weapons that feels particularly galling considering the creature’s infamous H-bomb subtext, with a seemingly nihilistic outlook that revels in the razing of civilisation and casts the one person concerned about global warming as a crazed radical scientist. King Of The Monsters should be monster fun — instead, it’s a bit of a monstrosity."
"May 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,Lost some of its pop and luster as the film went on...I wish it had worked better for me.
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," Godzilla has long been served with a side of preachiness. The big lizard’s origin story in the 1950s was that it was awakened by nuclear explosions to wreak havoc on Japan. Makes sense, right? Then in the 1998 Matthew Broderick film, nuclear tests don’t just wake ’Zilla up, they create him — by affecting the DNA of a normal Gila monster. Broderick’s character even demanded our hearts go out to the vicious beast because, like Lori Loughlin, she’s just a hardworking mother who wants to help her kids survive in a harsh world. Well, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” pushes its messaging to belly-aching extremes. In an absurd speech, Vera Farmiga’s scientist, Emma, explains that the destructive force of the Titans — Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and a menagerie of others — is actually a good thing.
Say what, Vera? Humans have developed and polluted the planet to such dangerous extremes that the leveling of London, New York, Chicago and San Francisco by a giant moth and a three-headed dragon will “restore balance.” The filmmakers don’t necessarily endorse her controversial theory, but this third film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse series has nonetheless gotten awfully touchy-feely about huge, uncontrollable killers. Nobody, it seems, wants to even attempt to put them down. Emma, who works with the top-secret Monarch organization, which keeps the creatures around the world in a state of hibernation, has her switch from responsible lab worker to psycho after being kidnapped by the crazy Alan (Charles Dance). He’s a powerful eco-terrorist whose turn-ons include stealing weapons and punishing mankind. Emma is also joined in captivity by her daughter, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who accomplishes one major task in more than two hours. It’s lovely to hear Brown talk after being mostly silent on “Stranger Things” for two seasons, even if she’s speaking on-the-nose dialogue such as, “You’re a monster!” to her wacko mom. Instead of Emma awakening the beasts herself, however, their alarm clocks all surprisingly go off at once — thanks to a previously unknown dragon-ish thing called Ghidorah, who, after Godzilla, is the alpha-empowered to call the shots. Ghidorah commands his crew to destroy Earth, and boy do they. Meanwhile, Emma’s ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) is still traumatized after the downfall of San Francisco and the death of their son, but is brought back into the fold anyway. See, there is endless exposition here, when all we want are monster fights. While we get a few very cool monster fights, there are simply not enough monster fights. Next time, please, more monster fights. The big, final scaly skirmish takes place in Boston, but unlike Roland Emmerich (from Broderick’s “Godzilla”), director Michael Dougherty doesn’t have a flair for clobbering landmarks. While we see Fenway fall, we never get to see Faneuil Hall stomped on or the Tea Party ships in Boston Harbor sent flying. Beantown is indistinguishable rubble before you know it. The whole movie is indistinguishable rubble."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,"  I was tempted to start this review with some long, thoughtful wind-up about how every generation gets the Godzilla movie it deserves. But why bother tip-toeing around what needs to be said and said clearly right off the bat — Godzilla: King of the Monsters is not a good movie. In fact, it’s a pretty terrible one. Don’t shoot the messenger, Kaiju fans.
  As the title promises, this sequel to 2014’s aggressively mediocre reboot is more than just a one-lizard show. It’s a globe-demolishing battle royale, pitting Godzilla against an oversized menagerie of monsters familiar to anyone who grew up watching deliciously cheesy Toho smackdowns on rainy Saturday afternoons – namely, Rodan, King Ghidorah, and Mothra (although that last one turns out to be more friend than foe). But you get the idea, this is one of those the-gang’s-all-here, bigger-is-better all-star jamborees that is, in fact, bigger but not better. The human characters (and I’m using the word “characters” loosely) are flavorless afterthoughts, spouting unintentionally laughable dialogue designed to do nothing more than move the risible plot from point A to point B.
  Among the B-movie’s B-plus cast are some good actors doing work they’ll probably regret one day if they don’t already. Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler star as married scientists who’ve split up since the cataclysmic climax of the original. Farmiga’s Dr. Emma Russell is hell-bent on awakening the world’s stable of hibernating underground monsters to help mankind evolve and stop it from killing itself. Basically, her M.O. is that old Vietnam War chestnut: we have to destroy this village in order to save it, but couched in a lot of eco-hogwash because, you see, we humans are the real monsters. Chandler’s Mark thinks this is a bad idea (right on, Coach Taylor!). Caught in the middle is their teenage daughter Madison (Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown) who just wants everyone to get along.
  Meanwhile, Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, Thomas Middleditch, Ziyi Zhang, and Bradley Whitford, all stand around offering various shades of slack-jawed green-screen awe, parceling out scraps of half-baked exposition that screenwriters Zach Shields and director Michael Dougherty should be a bit ashamed of. The usually-welcome Charles Dance also pops up as a villain because any movie this big and phoned-in requires one.
  Reviewing the 2014 franchise launcher, I wrote that Godzilla felt like two movies Scotch-taped together. One with the cast of Hollywood actors trying to keep a straight face and the other with mammoth CG beasts knocking the snot out of one another. The same is true here – only more so. No one comes to a Godzilla movie for deeply shaded character development (fair enough), we come for the monster mayhem. And this time around, the skyscraper-sized titans are solid enough. Dougherty, whose last two turns behind the camera were for the low-budget horror flicks Krampus and Trick r’ Treat, seems out of his depth. The monsters are too darkly shot and edited too frenetically as if he’s trying to hide something. Plus, it takes too long to get to them. It’s the cinematic equivalent of getting stuffed on bread. We’re never given the opportunity to truly soak up the grandeur of Godzilla and company.
  King Ghidorah, a.k.a. Monster Zero, a winged, fire-breathing dragon-type creature with three hydra heads, is Godzilla’s chief nemesis – the Lex Luthor to his Superman. We’re told over and over again that he’s an “alpha”, as if Monster Island had some sort of high school social-clique pecking order. When you do get a moment or two to really feast your eyes on him (her?), he/she’s impressively destructive and majestic. But without any coherent context, he/she’s also just an expensive action figure tearing cities and landmarks to ribbons of rubble, including Boston’s Fenway Park (the failure to even attempt a “Green Monster” joke feels like a softball whiffed upon).
"
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," I’m having a hard time remembering a recent movie I disliked as much as Godzilla: King of the Monsters. And, look, I can appreciate a bad movie. Remember Venom? Now that’s a bad movie, but it’s also remarkably watchable and insanely entertaining on about eight levels. I wish Venom had been in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. (Alas, Venom is not in this movie.) Instead, it’s just filled with a lot of stupid characters who all do stupid things to the point that the “plot” is just some crazy afterthought of nonsense. What a mess. Okay, yes, if you saw Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla from 2014 and thought, “Um, I’m mad, there’s not enough action in this movie,” well you are in luck. Edwards’ version was almost a master class in how to build anticipation, then let it all come soaring out in fiery rage. That’s why, at the end, we felt that adrenaline rush. The movie was designed for us to feel that way. That’s the way it works. But here’s what happens: People see the ending to 2014’s Godzilla and wonder, well, if I felt that rush at the end of the movie, why can’t I feel that rush during the whole movie? Why can’t I just feel the nice thing all the time! It’s because our bodies don’t work that way. When a movie is just nonstop monster action, guess what happens? It all becomes the new “normal” and it becomes boring. And this is the approach Godzilla: King of the Monsters takes. It just felt like the same scene over and over again. “Oh, look, there’s a monster – and now here come some jet fighters to shoot missiles at it. Oh, dang, the missiles didn’t work, again. Well, maybe next time. Oh, wow, it’s next time again already.” (More on these monster fights in a bit.) Well, here comes the part I’ve been dreading, trying at all to explain the plot of Godzilla: King of the Monsters. [Deep breath] All right, here we go: Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) lose their young son during the carnage that ensued in Godzilla’s fight with the MUTO during the events of the first film. They are now estranged, with Mark spending his time studying wolves (as one does after a Godzilla attack) and Emma living on a secret research facility with her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), unearthing Mothra. A team of “bad guys” (it’s not super clear who these people are, so “bad guys” will have to suffice), led by Colonel Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), infiltrate the base, kill all the researchers, then kidnap Emma and Madison. Only then, for reasons not super clear, it turns out Emma is working with the “bad guys,” because she has decided the only way to honor her dead son is to release all the monsters hiding on Earth in an effort to lower the world’s population – because this would put an end to overpopulation and suffering. (Obviously, Emma saw Avengers: Infinity War last year along with the rest of us.) None of this makes sense. I don’t even think it’s trying to make sense. In reality, this is all just an excuse for the filmmakers to have a lot of monsters on the screen at the same time. And, sure, I get that’s the end goal in a movie like this. But it would have been great if a little more thought had gone into the whole thing. Moving on: a secret government group studying the monsters recruits Mark to help try and stop Emma. So here comes another very odd choice. This team – which also includes characters played by Ken Watanabe (reprising his role from the first film), Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins (also back), O’Shea Jackson Jr., Thomas Middleditch, and Zhang Ziyi – spends about 90 percent of this movie on an airplane. But, as you may expect, there’s not a lot of fun to be had when your heroes are just literally hanging out on an airplane for over two hours. (I do love Bradley Whitford in this movie. He seems to be the only actor who kind of gets it. In one scene he’s drinking out of a flask for no reason. I like to think this isn’t the character and more Whitford realizing what kind of movie this is and just having fun with it.) Additionally, there’s no sense of where anyone is in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. One moment they are flying to Antarctica. The next they are flying to Mexico. Well now let’s fly to Boston! On the way to Boston, let’s stop over and shoot at some monsters Yee-haw! The whole movie is just a nonstop rerouting of flights. But back to the monsters: the other disappointing aspect is every single monster fight occurs at night and in the rain. Now, this is a VFX trick used to hide CGI flaws and maybe do some effects for a little less cost than if what we were watching were happening in full daylight. So what we get is monster fight after monster fight happening at night, in the rain. Now, you may be wondering why it keeps raining all over the world and why it’s always night? Conveniently, a lot of the monsters show up with their own pre-built storm clouds. Just their existence creates sun-shielding storms. At one point in the movie a major character dies, but it’s so dark there was no way to really see this happen. I think even the filmmakers realize this because the very next scene is a picture of this character with the word “deceased” written next to the picture. My absolute favorite part in Godzilla: King of the Monsters is, about halfway through, from their airplane (of course), the team is monitoring a monster’s heartbeat. We actually hear the heartbeat monitor “beep beep beep” sound like you would in a hospital drama. Bradley Whitford says, “Come on, big guy!” Then we hear the flat-line sound “beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep” and everyone looks sad. It was hilarious. I wish the whole movie was like this. It could have been up there with Venom. Instead, it’s a movie with a convoluted plot and makes no sense (having no plot would have been much better) with nonstop, barely comprehensible monster fights that just go on forever and keep happening. There were times when even Godzilla looked bored. At one point he just goes away for a big part of the movie so he can take a nap and “recharge.” (I’m not making that up.)"
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," In the recent words of the polymath artist and great thinker John Lurie: “Though Godzilla has appeared in 47 different movies, his acting has never improved.” Lurie’s count may be quite a bit off, but he’s on to something. Whether embodied by a man in a rubber suit or a vast team of digital artists, the eponymous radiation-breathing monster can’t be counted on to carry the films he stars in. Their success depends on the pacing and execution of action sequences; the sweaty brows and urgent voices of scientists speaking to generals; and the subplots screenwriters must use to fill time before a giant lizard thwacks a skyscraper with his tail. So even if he could still use an acting coach — and, like a certain superhero god we could name, really needs to go on a diet — the old monster has a grand time in Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Easily the most satisfying of his Hollywood-produced adventures and a respectable cousin to the long string of Japanese ones, the sequel to Gareth Edwards’ admirably serious but dullish 2014 film is the first to suggest any promise for what Legendary is calling its “MonsterVerse” — a franchise in which the Japanese kaiju world meshes with that of Hollywood’s favorite oversized ape, King Kong. Here, that impressive legacy of big-screen destruction gets a nostalgic assist from humans known for comfort-food television: Stranger Things‘ breakout actor Millie Bobby Brown gets more dialogue than Eleven did, and briefly shares the screen with Randy Havens, who played the show’s enthusiastic science teacher; Kyle Chandler, as her father, recalls the fiercely virtuous protectiveness of Friday Night Lights‘ Coach Taylor; and kibitzing in situation rooms, Bradley Whitford hails from The West Wing, that fantasy of presidential intelligence whose stock shot up at approximately 2:30 a.m. Eastern time on Nov. 9, 2016. Comforting ingredients are very welcome in a film that posits not only a giant lizard and a Kong in the wings (we don’t see him, but his showdown with Godzilla is set for next March), but secret sites all over the world where equally dangerous beasts lurk. The sites are guarded by a well-funded scientific organization known as Monarch, whose researcher Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) tries to calm a frightened public. Five years after Godzilla fought off monsters while wrecking San Francisco, protestors demand that all “Titans” should be killed; speaking to a congressional committee, Serizawa insists that humans should seek to coexist peacefully with creatures that, after all, were here a long time before we were. That San Francisco catastrophe killed the son of two other scientists studying Titans. In the aftermath, Chandler’s Mark Russell started drinking heavily and fled society. Wife Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who kept custody of their surviving child Madison (Brown), doubled down on her research and built the Orca, a sonic device that can soothe or enrage Titans by imitating their screeching calls. Just as the Orca’s effectiveness is demonstrated in a scene that introduces the giant, radiant moth called Mothra (“Queen of the Monsters,” and a natural ally of Godzilla), it is stolen: A crew of so-called eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) wants to use it to bring about monstergeddon. They also kidnap Emma and Maddy, giving Mark a reason to help when Monarch comes seeking his expertise. Cue arguments on military submarines in which most of the scientists want to save Godzilla from the bad guys while Mark, still heartbroken about his son, wants to kill him and all other superpowered giants. Mark’s position will soften gradually, as Godzilla keeps saving his life from new and more frightening beasts. Chief among them is the hydra-like King Ghidora, a spiky-tailed dragon whose three heads sometimes seem so angry they fight amongst themselves. Unlike some of the titans, Ghidora is an “invasive species” from beyond our galaxy; replacing Godzilla as the planetary alpha-beast, he eventually strikes a terrifying pose atop a volcano, spreads his lightning-rod wings and sends sonic messages to monsters everywhere that boil down to “smash everything in sight.” It sometimes seems as if, in their attempt to focus on monster action, the filmmakers have cut out material that might have enriched the human side of the tale. We don’t always understand the backgrounds or responsibilities of supporting characters, leaving it to the charismatic actors (welcome faces including Sally Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson Jr. and Zhang Ziyi) to make us not care; and the script by Dougherty and Zach Shields could use a polish from someone with a gift for witty dialogue. The longest speeches here are canned op-eds — villains promise that Titans, “the original and rightful rulers” of the planet, should take it back from the humans who have wrecked it; more thoughtful scientists repeat the kind of “Godzilla will restore global balance” stuff we’ve heard since the series’ early days. While monster nerds tally appearances by lesser-known (or maybe brand-new) Titans and cheer the battles between the main attractions — suffice to say that Queen Mothra isn’t as fragile as she looks — the pic gives Maddy a shot at saving the day and Mark a chance to save her while she does it. The film puts just about the right emphasis on this familial plot: If we can’t have comic relief, at least viewers can occasionally rest their eyes from an onslaught of beautifully designed CGI mayhem. News footage seen during the closing credits tries to imagine a world in which calmed-down Titans become a part of everyday life before flashing on a tantalizing cave painting: It seems that even in prehistoric times, humans fantasized about who would win in a showdown between a giant ape and a giant lizard."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a fun exercise in giant monster madness that indulges in all the kaiju fights fans and even casual viewers could hope for. It looks amazing while also giving its human characters a chance to stay interesting amid all the battling beasties by providing them with some really cool tech -- and some great one-liners among the supporting players. Unfortunately, the film’s plot is needlessly confusing, and not all that smart at times, and the lead characters could’ve used a little more fleshing out. Still, King of the Monsters course corrects from the 2014 film by giving audiences an abundance of monster action, proving that Hollywood can do right by Godzilla and his fellow kaiju."
"May 28, 2019",NEGATIVE," If one were to imagine the worst possible location for a blockbuster action sequence, it would be hard to conceive of a more visually disadvantageous setting than a blizzard at night in the middle of Antarctica. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, that is not a hypothetical. That’s where the first big monster fight takes place. In Antarctica. At night. In the middle of a freaking blizzard. It’s so hard to see what’s going on that after one of the major characters is killed, the film cuts to a computer screen with the character’s picture on it and the word “DECEASED” written under their face in giant block letters just to make it clear what happened. And that’s one of King of the Monsters’ better sequences. The first film in this new Godzilla series wasn’t a masterpiece but it at least it surrounded its bland cast of human characters with truly horrifying sequences of monster mayhem. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is as narratively incomprehensible as it is visually, with an even-more-talented roster of overqualified actors tasked with carrying the film’s insipid story and trying to make their characters’ bizarre decisions seem halfway plausible. That includes the heroic Vera Farmiga, whose Dr. Emma Russell sets a new standard in terrible movie parenting. Emma works for Monarch, the government agency that monitors and studies the world’s monsters (called “MUTOs”). She builds a device that can communicate with — and perhaps even control — MUTOs with a couple of touchscreen clicks. Mom of the Year candidate that she is, she even brings her daughter Madison (Millie Bobbie Brown) with her to the profoundly dangerous underground laboratory where she’ll test the gadget on a captive MUTO for the first time. Emma and Madison spend maybe 12 seconds in their lab before everything starts going haywire. The power fails, a giant larvae smooshes some guards, and then a group of ecoterrorists breaks in, kidnaps Emma and her daughter, and takes their new monster communication device. That sends the leaders of Monarch, including Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins), to seek out Emma’s estranged husband and former partner in monster sciencing, Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler). He’s supposedly the only one with enough knowledge of Emma’s research to find her. And with Emma’s device awakening more and more MUTOs all over the globe, it may be up to Godzilla (playing himself) to save us all. Mark seems destined for a tearful reunion with his wife, which had me excited for the prospect of a movie about Godzilla, the 200-foot-tall dinosaur marriage counselor. Alas, it is not to be. Instead, the plot’s logic begins to break down faster than polite society when a three-headed-dragon begins marching through a major metropolitan area. The characters from Monarch are introduced in a government hearing where they plead with Congressional leaders not to make them a branch of the military. Then they spend the rest of the movie acting like a branch of the military, flying around the world in a magical jet with a group of elite soldiers in tow (including a completely wasted O’Shea Jackson Jr. who gets nothing to do but bark orders in crowd scenes). One member of Monarch even plays their own identical twin — albeit so briefly and with so little explanation that some colleagues I spoke to didn’t even realize the actor in question had a dual role and just assumed the film was so shoddily edited that one character appeared in two places at once by mistake. The new monsters — including giant pteranodon Rodan, massive moth Mothra, and three-headed Ghidorah, who might rival Godzilla in the power department — are impressively detailed, at least on the occasions you can see them through the darkness of an Antarctica blizzard or various other clouds of schmutz. And Godzilla remains an intriguing presence; part divine protector, part angry god furious at mankind’s destruction of their planet. The problem is that Godzilla barely appears onscreen until the final act, and doesn’t appear at all for the first 45 minutes. In his place, we’re forced to follow the human characters from a secret base to a secret plane to a secret submarine — all of which look exactly the same: A dimly lit control room filled with computer screens. Godzilla: King of the Monsters was directed by Michael Dougherty, who has gained a solid reputation in recent years directing cult horror films like Krampus and Trick ’r Treat. I‘m not sure what happened here, but something went very wrong along the way to the multiplex. The characters — particularly poor Vera Farmiga’s monster scientist — behave so irrationally that Godzilla and his simple, clear motivations feel downright human in comparison. The last movie this big saddled with a story and characters this bad was Independence Day: Resurgence. Not that it matters. Legendary’s “Monsterverse” will roll on anyway. Next summer, the studio will release Godzilla Vs. Kong, uniting the two most famous kaiju in history. I assume it will try to outdo King of the Monsters’ set piece in a blizzard at night in the middle of Antarctica by setting the explosive climax between its title characters in deep space in the middle of an eclipse. Additional Thoughts:-King of the Monsters has more talented actors than it knows what to do with. David Straithairn has two scenes and maybe six lines reprising his role as a Navy admiral from the first Godzilla, and Joe Morton has exactly one scene and then vanishes, never to be heard from again. (Also, according to Wikipedia, he’s playing the older version of one of the characters from Kong: Skull Island, but how you’re supposed to know that from the film itself I have no idea.) -Speaking of Kong: If you’re hoping for a direct teaser setting up next summer’s Godzilla vs. Kong, you will have to instead make do with several fleeting references to him and Skull Island."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," Mass extinction has never looked so gorgeous. Over a period of 132 mind-numbing minutes, Michael Dougherty's Godzilla: King of the Monsters lays waste to humanity with stunning tableaus colored in ghostly blues and faded golds, resulting in visual landscapes worthy of Aivazovsky's brush. It's a pity the world built around all that jaw-dropping monster mayhem is so damn dull. Cities are leveled, Lovecraftian monsters reign supreme, and the only thing I felt was a bad case of ennui. The ultimate kaiju smack-down shouldn't be this boring. The 2014 American reboot of Godzilla received praise for its few scenes of monster-inspired destruction, but most criticism of the film took aim at the lifeless human characters who got most of the screentime. In what can only be seen as an attempt to give the audience what it wants, the sequel Godzilla: King of the Monsters ups the kaiju carnage tenfold while trying to inject some life into a new group of humans. But once again, it's the monsters who reign supreme. It's very hard to give a damn about any of the poor helpless mortals here, even when they're played by talented folks Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown. Those three actors play the Russell family. Chandler is Dr. Mark Russell, Farmiga is Dr. Emma Russell, and Brown is their daughter Madison. After a quick, and perhaps needless, prologue that directly ties into the 2014 Godzilla, the Russells have become fractured. Husband and wife Mark and Emma are estranged, and Madison is growing slightly concerned with her mother's behavior. Emma, who works for the government monster-tracking organization Monarch, has a plan to make great use of Godzilla and all his monster buddies. Think of Emma as Thanos, and the monsters are her Infinity Stones. The good doctor thinks human beings have all but destroyed the planet with their stupidity and selfishness (she has a point, folks), and her solution is to balance the scales. Monarch has spent years finding, and containing, giant monsters – or Titans, as they're officially called. And with the notable exception of Godzilla, all the Titans are fast asleep. Emma plans to wake them up and control them with a MacGuffin, er, I mean, a device she developed called the ORCA. Needless to say, this idea doesn't go over so well with most of the human characters. And as you might've guessed, it backfires spectacularly. Because one of the Titans that awakens is the three-headed nightmare King Ghidorah, a super-powered beastie who has the ability to control other monsters. Humanity's only line of defense is Godzilla, who has an ancient beef with Ghidorah. This certainly isn't the silliest set-up in Godzilla movie history, and there's a lot of room here to craft a compelling story about very flawed humans grappling with an apocalypse of their own creation. But the script, by Dougherty and Zach Shields, has no idea what to do with any of these people. They're blank slates, required to do little more than gaze up in awe as monsters lumber through the frame. Chandler's character is so useless that he might as well not be in the movie at all. There was a great opportunity to make Farmiga's Dr. Russell a fascinating human villain, but after her big set up, the script reduces her to a weepy background player stuck spouting off laughable dialogue. And Brown, in her first big screen role, is required to do almost nothing until the final twenty minutes of the movie. The only two humans who make any impact at all are Bradley Whitford, having the time of his life playing a whacked-out scientist, and Ken Watanabe reprising his role as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, who takes the god part of Godzilla's name quite literally. But the fact is the only reason these two stand out is because of the life the actors breathe into the parts, not because of the way they're written. Whitford is the only cast member able to make any of the film's stale, clunky jokes work, and Watanabe brings a remarkable amount of gravitas to his role, even though he's stuck repeating the line, ""We should wait and have faith in Godzilla!"" over and over and over again as the world crumbles. But enough about the humans. The monsters are the stars of the show, and they don't disappoint. Godzilla, in all his chunky digital glory, has more screen presence than 90% of the living, breathing cast members. Regal and stately even as he's demolishing the planet, Big G stomps and roars his way through the film with grace. His supporting cast of Titans – the ""Magic Kingdom of Horrors"" as one character calls them – make quite the impression, too. King Ghidorah, with his regenerating heads and electricity-based powers, is often downright terrifying. And the theme music for the character, from composer Bear McCreary, adds an extra air of menace, employing Tuvan throat singing, pounding drums and choral music. There's also the beautiful, ghostly Mothra, who may or may not have a thing for Godzilla. The best monster intro, though, belongs to the pteranodon Rodan, who enters the film via an exploding volcano, and proceeds to soar over a city with a wingspan so massive and so powerful that it has the ability to level buildings with the wind it kicks up. Dougherty and cinematographer Lawrence Sher capture all of this destruction with a painter's eye. When the monsters arrive, the screen is painted in burnt oranges, corpse blues, and hot white streaks of lighting. The awe and majesty of these massive, god-like beings is rendered perfectly, and there's a palpable sense of dread whenever they arrive. It's suitably terrifying. But this terror has an odd, and likely unwanted, side-effect. It's clear that Dougherty wants to have his cake and eat it too, creating a big, scary monster movie that also entertains people with wrestling-inspired kaiju fights. The problem is, those two don't mesh well here at all. Dougherty is perhaps attempting to jam together the mood and atmosphere of the original 1954 Godzilla movie with its endless, silly-yet-engaging sequels. I have no doubt there's a way to make this work in some capacity, but Dougherty and his team haven't figured it out. As a result, the monster brawls end up looking amazing, but lack any real excitement. The visual of Godzilla body-slamming Ghidorah into a sports stadium should inspire thrills, but the end result is hollow and oddly lifeless. A film of this magnitude should provoke endless awe and excitement. I got the ""awe"" part every now and then. As for the excitement, well...there's always Godzilla vs. Kong, I guess."

Night sequences in the final season of “Game of Thrones” inspired a litany of complaints from fans and critics that they couldn’t see what the hell was going on. Now we have “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” — and with it, fresh inspiration for squinting. If you thought you couldn’t make out what was happening during The Battle of Winterfell, prepare thyself for an entire film built on the concept that, when giant monsters battle each other, they actually create tropical storms, gusting rain, and a baffling amount of cloud cover. Bad weather is the least of the problems that beset Michael Dougherty’s inept sequel, the latest film in Warner Bros.’ growing MonsterVerse. Picking up five years after Gareth Edwards’ superior 2014 feature “Godzilla,” the new film attempts to imagine a post-monster (or, in “Godzilla” parlance, post-Titan) world. San Francisco is a memorial, the planet is dotted with secretive outposts run by “crypto-zoological agency” Monarch, and the government is hellbent on enacting a plan to kill the remaining monsters. None of this is terribly involving, so Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) who, along with her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and estranged husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), have been shoe-horned into the mythos of the MonsterVerse in an effort to make audiences care about the tragedy that broke up the family … just as Godzilla and friends destroyed San Francisco. (It does not work.) Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (a returning Ken Watanabe) still loves the big monster who seems to maybe love humans back. And Dr. Russell has invented ORCA, a machine meant to “speak” to various Titans by mashing up their “bio-acoustics” like the world’s strangest mixtape. This puts her in the crosshairs of rogue eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), who wants to use her contraption to, well, it’s not entirely clear. Like so many things that unfold in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” it really doesn’t matter. After Emma and Madison are kidnapped by Jonah, there’s a nonsensically flip-flopping character (not to be revealed here, as it’s something of a major spoiler) who sets about using the ORCA to wake up the rest of the planet’s Titans, many of whom have been contained in Monarch’s various outposts. (Why? How? When? Who knows?) Drawn from the Thanos school of philosophy, said character believes that letting loose the Titans will bring balance to an ailing world. In Dr. Serizawa’s parlance, it’s time to “let them fight” and see what shakes out. Fight they do. As the film’s many monsters hash it out, the human contingent hem and haw about how to stop this terrible turn of events. In addition to returning stars like Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn, there’s an eye-popping set of supporting talent including Ziyi Zhang, Thomas Middleditch, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Anthony Ramos, and a truly wacky Bradley Whitford. (They’re largely introduced during one exposition-packed meeting that happens well into the film’s first act, setting the stage for audiences to wonder just who else might emerge at any given time.) As for the Titans, we’ve got Mothra, a stunning giant moth with an allegiance to Godzilla; the three-headed dragon-like King Ghidorah; and winged Rodan. There’s also an impressive selection of lesser behemoths, but most of them appear during understandably panicked newscasts that appear to be filmed through Vaseline. At least the Titan faceoffs are something to behold, despite the boneheaded decision to set so many of the film’s juiciest battles in a monsoon. Occasionally bogged down by human POVs, with the camera peering though portholes and helicopter windows, Dougherty and his team do at least wisely zoom out for a series of wide shots that remind both the audience and the human characters just how massive these monsters are, and how terrifying it can be when they fight. As the Titans continue to rise, Mark and his band of Monarch pals (including at least one with a secret twin, a footnote revealed for no discernible reason) manage to be everywhere they need to be at any given moment, thanks to a massive super-speed jet that seems directly inspired by a similar vehicle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” never met a sci-fi film it didn’t want to rip off — brace yourself for a dramatic sequence that pulls so liberally from “Armageddon” that we can only assume Michael Bay is readying a lawsuit — and the result is a sloppy, stitched-together offering with no sense of self. At least Godzilla seems to remember who he is — all the better to gear up for the next MonsterVerse film: 2020’s “Godzilla vs. Kong” — and when the biggest monster of them all appears, he slips right back into his role as Earth’s most unlikely defender. Godzilla’s interest in saving humanity never made much sense, but it’s this CGI creation with no dialogue that gives the film the continuity and character it lacks elsewhere. When Godzilla lights up his nuke-powered tail and lets loose his interminable scream, for just a moment, the MonsterVerse has something to offer.

"May 28, 2019",NEUTRAL," If there’s one positive outcome from Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the summer’s first inarguably bad blockbuster, it should be that the marketing team at Warner Bros receives a monstrous raise. On paper, the $200m sequel seemed like an unnecessary addition to 2014’s soulless reboot, a recklessly expensive extension to a franchise-restarter that no one cared for. With production finishing almost two years ago and with two projected release dates scrapped, bad buzz was starting to grow. But then the first trailer was released and naysayers fell silent. Flashes of grandiose imagery were matched with the lush sounds of Clair de Lune and what seemed to be a bravely apocalyptic tone, the sort of preview that suddenly vaults a previously discounted film to the top of your must-see list. The more recently released “final trailer” was similarly artful, hinting at a monster movie with heart, a rousing do-over for Gareth Edwards’ forgettable predecessor. But smoke, mirrors and then more smoke can only do so much. Within minutes of the film itself expectations start to dissipate, quickly replaced with crushing disappointment. For Godzilla: King of the Monsters is every bit as redundant as one would expect, a hollow piece of business masquerading as something necessary. Godzilla’s emergence in 2014 has left the world forever changed (we’re reminded of this by a montage of thunderously dumb news reports) and in particular, the lives of the Russell family. Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler) lose their son Andrew in the carnage and years later find themselves estranged. Mark has retreated to the wilderness while Emma is living with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and working for Monarch, the shadowy corporation tasked with protecting both Godzilla and other creatures around the world. Emma has been perfecting a machine that uses bioacoustics to interact with them to avoid further catastrophe, while Monarch fights with the Senate over control of the monsters. But when eco-terrorist Colonel Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) breaks into a facility, all hell breaks loose. Taking over from Edwards (who has since managed to make amends with 2016’s wonderfully effective Star Wars spin-off Rogue One) is Michael Dougherty, whose credits stretch from the bad (a story credit on the execrable X-Men: Apocalypse) to the middling (he co-wrote Superman Returns) to the bonkers (he wrote and directed 2015’s fun, nasty Christmas horror Krampus). There are brief flashes of his affinity to B-movie mayhem here (he also wrote and directed cult Halloween anthology horror Trick ’r Treat) but King of the Monsters is a mostly anonymous film, processed and boxed up like a forgettable schedule-filling studio product. Rather like 2017’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, it also feels like it could have been released in the mid-to-late-90s, with a tone and aesthetic that feel strangely dated along with some head-scratchingly retro casting (Charles Dance as a hammy British villain! Bradley Whitford as comic support!). There’s a first-act twist that would be cruel of me to reveal but it lands with such a thud that the film barely recovers, revealing one character’s motivations as laughably absurd, so absurd that even the actor forced to reel off the accompanying dialogue seems sort of embarrassed. As an unintentional comedy, the film does work to a degree, filled with so much stupidity that if not for 1998’s atrocious Matthew Broderick-starring Godzilla, this would be the dumbest English language version to date. There was plenty of sniggering in my screening, either linked to the rote dialogue or the film’s adherence to tired cliche (not one but two characters play the well-used action/disaster movie self-sacrifice card). These issues might sting a little less had Dougherty at least nailed the film’s many monster-on-monster fight scenes, but too many of them are blurry and hard to follow, paling in comparison to last year’s Pacific Rim sequel, which was able to make such large-scale showdowns feel coherent and involving. Isolated imagery does impress, but most of it we’ve already seen in trailers, and it’s frustrating to see Dougherty fail to capitalise on this, the odd epic visual lost in a sea of confusingly choreographed chaos. In interviews, he’s referred to it as his Aliens in comparison to Edwards’ Alien, but it plays more like the Alien v Predator of the franchise, a shiny but empty multiplex-filler. In the previous chapter, things really lost their way when Edwards focused on his human characters – a stacked cast including Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe and Elizabeth Olsen failed to bring life to an inert script. There’s less star wattage this time (although a post-Oscar nominated Hawkins does have a minor, perhaps contractual, role) and an even less convincing family dynamic at play. Dialogue is awkward and weighed down by clunky exposition, and despite boasting the first big-screen appearance from 15-year-old Stranger Things breakout Brown, she’s lumped with a reheated strong-willed yet soft-hearted teen role, and she struggles to make it work. Around her, there are almost too many cast members, leading to fleeting, thankless roles for O’Shea Jackson Jr, Anthony Ramos, Zhang Zyi and David Strathairn. It’s a film with too much yet somehow so very little. There are references to Skull Island throughout and then, in some rather silly headline-smattered end credits, a crushingly inevitable match-up is made clear. Next March sees the release of Godzilla vs Kong, a film that retains some of this film’s cast, a desperate attempt to expand a universe that’s already buckling under its own weight. My money’s on that devilish Warner Bros marketing team, sure to craft another trailer suggesting something far better than what they end up releasing."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," 
	A sequel to the 2014 'Godzilla' makes for a spectacular clash of the titans, but this one has a less commanding balance of schlock and awe. There are a lot of timeless movie monsters, but Godzilla, in the dozens of Japanese films that featured him, always raised a metaphysical question: Was this 165-foot-tall, beady-eyed, radiation-breathing T.-rex-meets-lizard-king, with bony sculptured plates running down his back and skin like raggedy carpet, an awesome creature to behold despite the cheesiness of the special effects that created him? Or because of the cheesiness? The answer (which is very Zen) was, of course: both at once. That’s the essential Godzilla principle. You knew, somewhere deep inside your reptile brain, that you were seeing not a gargantuan nuclear dinosaur laying waste to Tokyo but a man in a monster suit trashing a miniature train-set mockup of Tokyo. All of which made Godzilla a little fakey and a little funny — and, when I was growing up, watching him on a black-and-white TV set in the late ’60s and early ’70s, weirdly comforting. But that tacky/innocent edge-of-camp quality also cut to the essence of what was spectacular about Godzilla. There was an honest wonder to this scowling giant (and he was touching, too), because the primitive ingenuity of the effects made it feel like you were seeing the ultimate creature-feature puppet show. To watch Godzilla was, and still is, to lose yourself in make-believe. The beauty of the 2014 American reboot of “Godzilla” is that it was a special-effects lollapalooza — as advanced, in its way, as a Marvel epic — that used digital technology to recreate that analog aura of rubber-suited, flying-dragon-on-a-string primitivism. And the sleight-of-hand trick was, in itself, awesome. The movie stayed true to the cheeseball splendor of the original kaiju films even as it turned them into retro pop poetry. It was a monster movie for the child in us all. So is “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” but Gareth Edwards, who directed the first film (and went on to make “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” one of the rare artistic knockouts in the “Star Wars” franchise), didn’t stick around to direct this one. And Michael Dougherty, who now takes the reins, isn’t the same kind of bravura pulp magician. He gets the job done, staging a movie that, at its best, makes for a giddy and satisfying clash of the titans. You won’t feel cheated; at stray moments, you’ll feel the wonder. But for every high point, there’s a moment when the thrill threatens to leak away. This isn’t a “Godzilla” sequel that throws one or two additional monsters into the mix. It’s a full-blown, shoot-the-works, open-the-floodgates-and-let-it-rip primeval-beastie blowout, like a remake of the 1964 Japanese orgy “Ghidorah, King of the Monsters” — which, in effect, it is. It’s the third film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, coming after “Godzilla” and “Kong: Skull Island,” but I’ll be damned if I could tell you how it advances the larger narrative. We’re now all set up for “Godzilla vs. Kong,” coming in 2020, but if you told me that the next film in the franchise was “Party with Megalon,” it would make about as much sense. In addition to Godzilla, the new movie revives a number of the fabled creatures from the classic kaiju era. There’s King Ghidorah, the gargantuan winged serpent-hydra who first appeared in “Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster,” and who still swings those three elongated necks around like the lightly bobbing limbs of a marionette, though his heads have been redesigned so that they curl back like fiery ’50s car fins. There is Rodan, the dragon crossed with a pterodactyl, who here gets updated into a kind of demon hawk. And there is Mothra, always the most bizarrely angelic of the kaiju creatures (as well as the star of my all-time favorite Godzilla film: “Godzilla vs. The Thing,” as it was once titled in the U.S.), who starts off as an angry larvae and then metamorphoses into a luminous moth of lyrical vengeance (though I did miss, from the earlier films, the way Mothra’s flapping cardboard wings could produce hurricane gusts). As long as these creatures are up onscreen, I remain more happy than not, and Dougherty does his best to carry forth the style of towering beasties clashing by night that Gareth Edwards raised to such a pitch of grandeur. Yet this movie feels more prosaic and less magical. The monster battles set at night, lit by blue phosphorescence, get a little visually sludgy, and you may start to long for some daylight clarity — for those moments when you can sit back and gawk at Godzilla and just sort of behold him. The kaiju films, once you got past the early classics, often tied themselves in knots trying to decide which creature was a friend or foe to mankind (and why), and “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” turns that theme into a lot of blockbuster cud-chewing. Too much of it. The first film had Bryan Cranston to lend it some panache, and the void he left is now filled by Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler as Emma and Mark Russell, a divorced pair of scientists who lost their son during Godzilla’s 2014 destruction of San Francisco (the last time the monster has been seen). Emma, along with Mark, is the co-inventor of the Orca, a bio-sonar device that synthesizes the cries of various titans into a sound that can communicate with them. You’d think that Emma was one of the good folks, but when she and her 14-year-old daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), are kidnapped by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), a former British Army colonel turned eco-terrorist (he wants to get his hands on the Orca), their agendas actually line up. Emma is pro-titan, which might sound sympathetic, but she’s so pro-titan that she’s become a fanatic. Sounding a lot like Thanos from the “Avengers” films, she declares that to restore the karmic ecological balance of things and deal with issues like overpopulation, the titans should be allowed to run wild, destroying what they want; then the planet will regain its equilibrium. The trouble is, Vera Farmiga is too level-headed an actress to deliver this stuff as if she believes it, so it just sounds like nutcake raving. There’s a lot of B-movie boilerplate in “King of the Monsters,” like the opening half hour, which is fairly deadly. And all the debate about whether mankind should stand with the titans or not doesn’t come down to much, since it’s ultimately revealed that Ghidorah — no, this is not a spoiler, it’s movie mythology that’s 55 years old — is an alien presence who puts out a kind of siren call to control the other creatures. The film leaps around from one Monarch outpost to the next (China, Colorado, Bermuda, Mexico, Antarctica), and while that provides some geological diversity — it’s fun to see Rodan emerge from a Mexican volcano, or Ghidora (dubbed Monster Zero until they figure out who he is) frozen in a giant tomb of polar ice — it deprives the plot of a center of gravity. Complaining about the storyline of a “Godzilla” movie may seem beside the point, since even the best of the Japanese films (including, yes, the restored, de-Raymond Burr-ed, original 1954 “Godzilla”) were, in a word, schlock. Yet they were schlock haunted by a weirdly masochistic metaphor. The fact that the films saw Godzilla as a stomping nuclear god made the apocalypse he caused seem like some terrible act of fate. In “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” the metaphor has shifted: It’s all about government conspiracy and ecological balance (the titans are part of the earth’s natural defense system!), which can make your brain glaze over. Most of the actors spend the movie yammering on in an overly standardized disaster-movie mode of much-intensity-about-nothing, though Ken Watanabe, as the venerable Monarch scientist Dr. Serizawa, evokes a little of the old Godzilla reverence. A lingering question: Is it my imagination, or does it look like Godzilla has been hitting the dessert cart? I’m not merely speaking about his distended belly. The creature has been designed so that his head and neck, which used to resemble the top of the letter f, now sort of melt right into his torso. As a result, his face no longer pops in the same vivid anthropomorphic way. And that’s a miscalculation. If Godzilla looks a little chunkier than before, so be it, but you don’t want to watch a “Godzilla” movie thinking that his personality is slightly out of focus — that for all the agreeable destruction he causes, he’s not quite the same dude."
"May 28, 2019",POSITIVE," There was no greater slap in the face to Godzilla fans everywhere than back in 2014 when director Gareth Edwards’ GODZILLA went to great lengths to hide the eponymous giant monster (confoundingly like the beasts from JAWS and ALIEN) for most of the feature, choosing to focus on fairly uninteresting human drama instead. While director Michael Dougherty’s GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS takes a few cues from Edwards’ regenerated jump-off, it delivers far more satisfying thrills and terrific spectacle when it comes to what fans expect from these kinds of films. Trouble is, a lackluster human element sadly still impedes, throwing a wet blanket on the fire sparked by this new creative team. Things begin on a promising note: the world is an
irrevocably changed place after the devastating battle between the MUTOs and
Godzilla leveled San Francisco. One married couple in particular, Mark and Dr.
Emma Russell (played by Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga respectively), lost
their young son when they were working in the Bay Area for Monarch, the
crypto-zoological agency tracking these kaiju. In the years since the tragedy, Mark
has turned bitter, letting angst and anger overtake his life. His now-ex-wife
Emma and their rebellious tween daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) have
grown more curious as to what these “titans” are doing here, looking for
solutions to coexist.  Emma has invented a top secret soundwave device that can
control the currently dormant titans, all of which are scattered across the
planet. However, right as they’re testing the MacGuffin, waking Mothra from her
deep slumber, a rogue militia unit led by eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles
Dance) kidnaps Emma and Madison and absconds with the device. He and his crew
are bent on resurrecting other massive magnificent monsters – like three-headed
dragon King Ghidorah, and smoldering, ashy-winged pterodactyl Rodan – with this
bio-sonar technology. Now it’s up to scientific minds Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken
Watanabe), Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins), and Monarch’s top brass Dr.
Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang), Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Sam Coleman
(Thomas Middleditch) to bring Mark back into the fold to save his estranged
family, not to mention the rest of the world. Dougherty and co-screenwriter Zach Shields find new,
exciting and unique ways to add to our beloved kaijus’ legacy. Not only are
there a few new abilities revealed (I won’t spoil who can now do what), the
filmmakers utilize iconography left out of Edwards’ previous iteration. Their
ability to integrate rousing fan service moments with their new ideas works
efficiently and successfully, blending nods to the franchise’s past (everything
from 1954’s GOJIRA, to 1968’s DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, to 1995’s GODZILLA VS.
DESTOROYAH and many others) with its future. This philosophy is echoed in its score
as well, which finds a captivating balance between Akira Ifukube’s iconic
compositions and Bear McCreary’s viscerally charged soundscape rooted in culture
and mythology.  The picture’s scale and scope is on a whole other level,
delivering awe-inspiring widescreen visuals of these fantastic beasts in fight
and in flight. Though Dougherty and cinematographer Lawrence Sher’s epic action set pieces capture what Godzilla, King
Ghidorah, Rodan and Mothra would look like fighting on a heavy metal album
cover, their fire-and-brimstone aesthetic assigns a gritty gravitas to the
gorgeous imagery, as it augments the narrative’s ecological overtones. That
said, whenever they cut away from these show-stopping monster mash-ups to the
humans attempting to take down or flee from these behemoths, the battles are obscured
by jittery editing and shaky cam. It’s dizzying – and not in a good way. What further complicates matters are the characters
themselves – specifically each member of the Russell family. Their motivations
are sketchy at best, driven mostly by contrivance or convenience. The real
monster actually isn’t one of the gargantuan kaiju, but one of the humans,
who’s right up there with Thanos in terms of a master plan to cure the ills of
the Earth. Mark’s righteous anger at Godzilla dissipates almost immediately,
and Emma’s confusing actions are followed by an expository speech dump ten
minutes later. Her perfectly curled locks flatten as the run time ticks away,
which can only be construed as a metaphor. Madison smashes a perfectly good
iPad with a family photo as the lock screen when she could’ve just changed the
photo. Her purpose on the whole is solely to aid a male’s arc – i.e. for Mark
to be able to re-enact his past traumatic experience during the climax. Plus,
their interpersonal family dynamics are not particularly interesting or
engaging. This is the biggest surprise, as this film comes from the clever
minds behind KRAMPUS, which supplied a subversive take on familial hijinks. "
