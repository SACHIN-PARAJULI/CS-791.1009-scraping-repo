"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is great from start to finish
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,I think this Godzilla movie is fantastic but one of the worst theater experience ever from amc but the rest of the movie was amazing and terrifying and sad but I am excited for the DVD and Blu-ray
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!
One of the first times when human action was awesome!
Such an emotional and awe inspiring journey!
Loved it would recommend
10/10"
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,This is how a Godzilla movie should be! Driven by by Japanese-style human drama instead of mindless Hollywood destruction and special effects. The best Godzilla movie ever.
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"WHY IS IT SO GOOD?! Everything down to the soundtrack, characters, and story are absolutely flawless. Even the 10 million dollar budget CGI, although flawed, was amazing. I can't believe I cried for the half of the movie's runtime. I also hate and love Godzilla so much."
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,La película más realista de Godzilla.
"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is what Hollywood should aim for. This was a beautiful movie with a very well written cast of characters and Godzilla maintained his charm without loosing it from the Human characters and was used quite well.
I'm glad that this movie has been extremely successful and that Toho continues to make more well written and thought out stories with Godzilla."
"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE,It was great! It's waaaay better than the garbage Hollywood has been churning out. Hollywood is only producing leftist trash. I loved how Godzilla minus one showed that people don't need to rely on government. It also focuses on family. It's an absolute must watch!
"Apr 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Setting aside my love of Godzilla. This may have been the best movie of the year. As an OIF/OEF vet, much of what he went though, and several different themes rang true. Even without ""Big G"", this was just a great drama. I hope they don't make another one, how could it be better than Minus One?"
"Apr 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Película de Godzilla muy fina de ver y con tan bajo presupuesto se pudo hacer una obra de arte
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was trash. Human characters are stupid, plot is same as others movies that have the same plot, VFX effects are actually good and godzilla was only good part. is a waste of time -1/10"
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing film, definitely top 3 in the Godzilla universe."
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Low key masterpiece!
"Apr 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Man oh man what a ride this one was. I chanced the trip to Tucson in my van that is edging ever closer to 300,000 miles, and that is about the payoff I got. 

The plot is masterful, the creature spfx are enormous, and rightly deserved the Oscar it won, and the best part? There are no oxygen destroyers, no fantasy fictitious scientific weapons. Nothing but real life applications such as ship cabling and explosive laden aircraft to employ in their frantic effort to take the monster down. And the cliffhanger of the dorsal fin shaped radiation burn spreading across the female protagonist's neck was the best part.
I sincerely hope that there will either be a direct sequel or that Yamazaki is tapped to do another kaiju film. I know I will be watching!"
"Apr 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"I wanted to wait a bit to make sure it wasn't recency bias, but I'm confident in calling Godzilla Minus One the best Godzilla movie in the franchise's 35+ catalog. With a gripping story of confronting and dealing with grief and guilt, the film utilizes Godzilla as a perfect representation of the internal and external chaos we encounter in life. Only by learning to value and cherish his own life does Kōichi find true purpose in living. Every human character is incredible in their writing and acting. Godzilla is a terrifying presence that capitalizes on every element that makes him a great antagonist. The low budget is often brought up as part of the mind-blowing realization that this movie fits right in with Hollywood's best effects, and for good reason. With Oscar-winning visuals, Godzilla Minus One is able to deliver one of the best stories of 2023 with a beautiful canvas in its presentation. Always thrilled to see the Kaiju genre be used so masterfully."
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"""THE BEST MOVIE OF 2023"" IS ALL I CAN SEE WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE. It was perfect, every single bit of the movie. The atomic breath scene with the dorsal fins look very clean. I thought for a second when I watched the trailer that the city behind Godzilla really was destroyed, turns out I was wrong, it was just the best CGI I have ever seen. This movie shouldn't just deserve only 1 Oscar for just best action movie, It deserves best movie of the year."
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,This is an absolute masterpiece!!! Highly recommend
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is a boring and and quite lacking film. This doesn't even come close to Godzilla x King Kong.
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is perfection. I have no complaints. It's absolutely amazing. Godzilla having meaning again and being a metaphor for the horrors of humanities creation is tragically beautiful. Definitely the best human plot I've seen in any film of the daikaiju genre
"Apr 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A little too talky, but the monster stuff is way good!"
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the first and only Godzilla movie that made me care about humans in movie all other Godzilla movies America and japan I never like boring except for one and two nothing more Godzilla actually looks terrifying to me any other Godzilla movies he never look scary to me this is better than shin Godzilla human parts are not as boring compared to shin Godzilla and more likable and Godzilla fights as should not like transformer in shin Godzilla shooting lasers from tail and back fins.,"
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was perfectly executed. From the storyline and acting, to the visual effects and cinematography- my expectations were far exceeded. I found zero faults with this film."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"The greatest solo kaiju feature of all time, a beautiful story, mixed with beautiful effects, and amazing acting from everyone involved.
I had to wipe my tears away in time for the next scenes constantly."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I never expected even to watch another Godzilla movie, but luckily I read some rave reviews and went. This is one of the strongest recent movies from any country, and it may be the greatest giant monster movie ever made, in part because of the stellar special effects, cinematography, editing etc., but mainly because you care deeply about the human characters--all of them, including the nameless city dwellers who have to face destruction. There's a strong sense of tragedy that is right up front and really makes you love the characters, even the ones who seem at first to have been crushed by the war. They recover in moving ways. There's a moment early on when an embittered neighbor lady who has lost everyone in her family suddenly makes a decision to help an orphaned baby and the young mother who has taken her in. It sounds cheesy, but the actors make it work really well. At that point I realized this might be something special, and it keeps getting better and more gripping from there. There's another moment where a major character gets swept away, as if she were nothing, that made me sob loudly  in a theater for the first time in years. Great psychological depth throughout, and politically interesting in that its disillusioned heroes are striving toward a different form of heroism than the fascist wartime version of heroism as self-destruction.  If you want to see a convincing movie about the power of hope, watch this. Plus it's got the best little crying girl in movie history."
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can't add anything more than what has been said, except that the hype is real.  This IS an exceptional film, that just happens to be a Kaiju movie."
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Simply moving and brilliant on a human scale and the brutal terrifying force that is GODZILLA takes the whole movie to 11! Best Godzilla movie next to the original 1954 film.
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Easily the best and scariest Godzilla movie so far. The time spent with the human drama could stand to be a little shorter but still a great movie.
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Expected to enjoy the movie but surprisingly loved it. Top 5 movies i ever seen. Can't wait to see it again.
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,This is the one I wanted to meet after all! The long-awaited Godzilla's overwhelming presence is the best!
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es impresionante, es simplemente... arte"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Unica y de verdad es una obra de arte
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,I love this movie and the story and Godzilla this is definitely the best Godzilla movie I've seen 10 out of 10
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,EHHHHH.  it's whatever.  I fell asleep.
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film is beyond your average monster movie, it has a thrilling story, deep and fleshed out human characters and gorgeous visual effects.
Godzilla in this film, although smaller than his monster-verse counterpart, is pure terror and an unstoppable force of nature. Deserved Oscar winner, the atomic breath scene gives me chills every time."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Yes it is soooooooo
Hooooooooody wooody looody heoes"
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Truly amazing to see the human side done so well
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Truly an amazing and beautiful piece to have the pleasure of viewing. Can't wait for the digital release!
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Didn't really know what to expect as it was the first Japanese style Godzilla film I had seen in a very long time and it blew me away. Enjoyed it alot
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"The amount of emotions you go through in this movie is crazy for a monster movie.
But it isn't just that, it has heart, character and the humans in this you actually care for.
I never expected to be emotional over a Kaiju movie.
A well deserved Oscar too."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is a cinema masterpiece.With a small budget and a lot of heart.This movie blows away every other Godzilla movie made by miles.Centering around an actual story about the ppl was a long needed approach.We learn to care for these ppl in their fight with Godzilla,fresh off WW2.I really can't say enough good things about this movie....simply a masterpiece."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you like Godzilla, this is a must see.  I was blown away by how much I enjoyed Godzilla Minus One.  My favorite to date for sure."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is unequivocally and truly a cinematic triumph.  With a 15 million dollar budget we received a film with emotional depth, meandering characterization, beautiful visuals, and a masterpiece addressing significant themes of survivors guilt, PTSD, shame, and the human condition.  

I am blown away simply by how this can be one of the best action films of the year, perhaps the best Godzilla film ever put to screen, yet have me invested emotionally in so many of the characters. In typical fashion, this is not normally the case.

After reading and hearing all the hype for this film, I did want it to be in my top 10 of 2023 but, I don't think, by no fault of the filmmakers, that this is necessarily a movie that resonates with me.  And full transparency, perhaps my viewing experience and personal feelings towards the film may have been elevated if I'd watched it in a theatre with an audience. 

Nevertheless, this is (hopefully) a wake up call for Hollywood; great films can be made with amazing visuals and an encompassing narrative without the 200+ million dollar price tag attached."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was amazing,you actually feel for the characters and godzilla is portrayed as a actual character"
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Simply fantastic. A perfect showcase of the franchise's original roots.
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"the perfect godzilla movie
terrifying
the human drama was intense yet natural
godzilla is an ABSOLUTE MENACE"
"Mar 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,I love that we have more godzilla movies and this one was good. But I am looking for monster mayhem and not a sad story about war when I go to watch these movies.
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Human Characters good story an amazing Vfk
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Spectacular and Epic
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is good but the end was mediocre with feeling rushed but a serious and dark story with amazing storytelling and visuals that really sell you to the story
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing It has emotion scary and cool 100% to watch if you can
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever made
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Gripping and tense. Finally a Godzilla film where the human characters have depth and a purpose to the story more than just being filler. Godzilla is depicted almost horror movie like and for the better. Truly one of the best Godzilla films.
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"こんなに素晴らしい映画は見た事がありません！音楽・映像・演技の全てがしっかりしていて臨場感が凄くありました！2時間くらいの映画でしたが、30分のように感じるくらいの素晴らしい映画でした。もう1度見てみたいです！

I've never seen such a wonderful movie! Everything about music, video, and acting was solid and there was a great sense of realism! It was a movie of about 2 hours, but it was such a wonderful movie that it felt like 30 minutes. I want to see it again!"
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, I had to see it twice!"
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,A great film. Nothing like the Japanese to make a awesome Godzilla movie.
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,this is a good example of staying in the original 54 gojira film's roots with the best atomic breath scene of all time
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing, true Toho classic Godzilla"
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Beautiful cinematography, music that perfectly matches the movie, characters you care for, good acting, good story telling, Godzilla scenes are powerful, not just a monster action movie but a cinema masterpiece and a work of art. Won best visual effects at the academy awards and deserved way more than that. This movie will keep you focused until the final moment and leave you with the feeling of satisfaction. A must watch for all movie fans. Language is Japanese but you won't mind cuz you will be focused on the amazing story and will want more at the end of it all!"
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is awesome.
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Simply the perfect Godzilla film.

This movie is everything you want in a Godzilla film, a terrifying Godzilla, an amazing soundtrack and easily the best human story in the entire franchise.

This movie uses VFX but in a way that still feels like suitmation and the tiny budget makes it even more impressive."
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best films of 2023. Possibly the best Godzilla film ever made. One of the best theater experiences of my life. Perfect balance of the humans and Godzilla himself.
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing. Number 1 Godzilla movie
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's amazing. For my firsts Godzilla movie seen in theaters, this movie is a masterpiece. The first Godzilla movie to get an Oscar. It's well deserved."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"it was really good BUT shin godzilla still better, and the wife of the main character who survive is a lot weird, i know she's probably wife godzilla power or something like that but it's still not relevant sadly"
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I never thought I would walk away from 2023 with ""Godzilla: Minus One"" in the Top 3 Best Movies of the Year, but here we are and I'm still mad that it wasn't nominated for Best Picture.  Then again, the Awards never made sense anyway, nor have they ever mattered in decades.

One of the many things that has been missing from the Godzilla films, especially the ones made in the USA, are likable characters we want to see survive.  And this movie delivers that missing ingredient, along with great directing, writing, and acting.  Despite the film being in Japanese, I was able to understand and become invested in the lives of these characters in a post-WWII setting of Japan.  The main character has an arc that is in connection to Godzilla, and it's done very well.

Speaking of which, Godzilla himself makes a return to his roots as just being a monster of destruction, a true animal of nature on a bigger scale.  In what appears to be a mixing of previous films interpretation on the King of Monsters' origins, Godzilla is an ancient creature that mutates due to the radiation of the nuclear bombs dropped in Japan.  So, it's a mix of mother nature and man-made.  And the best part is that they made Godzilla scary again.  Which in turn makes you want to see the characters survive and win against the giant monster that is tearing apart their new lives that have been built from the ashes of a world war.

There's only a few flaws to speak of.  Some of the CGI isn't that good, although when it is good, it's really good.  There's a few edit choices that felt weird and some moments of dialogue that didn't feel right, but they're very few and far between.  Aside from that, it's a very solid film.

In all honesty, this just might be the best Godzilla film ever made.  It has emotional weight, a terrifying Godzilla, interesting and likable characters, and just an enjoyable experience."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,absolutely phenomenal
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"GMO was a fun story. The story is quite surprising because it follows very closely a man and his family, after WW2. Very touching story that will get you some tears at times. Don't worry Godzilla is there. You are also showed the state of Japan after the war. The acting is really good. Of course you can almost feel the acting coach with the very young girl, but that's ok. The special effect are fine to amazing. The way they show how heavy Godzilla is, is interesting. And there is no magical: I can stand on the water, with this one. I give it 85%. This is by far, the best Godzilla movie I have seen."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Lived up to the hype I'd been hearing about. I have loved Godzilla since I was a kid watching the movies on local TV on Sunday mornings growing up. I like the more recent MonsterVerse films, but it was awesome to see Godzilla as he originally was, the bad guy. Also, the human element delivered better than most Hollywood films."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is easily one of the greatest Godzilla movie of all time, and I'm saying this as a Godzilla fan and a critic. The effects, the plot, the emotions, and the characters are all amazing. And this film made me actually be afraid of Godzilla and it even made me root for the characters to win. i'm also glad at one at the Oscars for best VFX's."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,INCREDIBLE!!!!!! I did not even want to go to the bathroom.
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"PELICULON, al fin la historia de los humanos es interesante"
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Man what can I say. Never thought I'd be able to bring my any of my somewhat picky siblings to watch a Godzilla movie but this one was so good, I had to make them see it. They actually loved it and one of them cried."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great Movie,Breathtaking Visuals that will have you Questioning the Budgets of some other Hollywood blockbuster. Godzilla is Back to his Horrifying glory of the 1950s in this film where he terrorize the country of Japan after the end of the war. In the film you will grow and care for the characters while staying stunned by the world that's built in it. 9.5/10"
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Second greatest kaiju movie of all time. “King Kong” (1933) was the first. 
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the most emotional and satisfying movie experiences I've had in recent years!
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,furrys  vs japan part 674367843643
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,The first Godzilla movie to win an oscar. Very Well Deserved!
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Story was riveting, characters were fleshed out, and the visual effects were stunning. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack, to die for."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible. I have to be real. I don't like Godzilla movies, I think it's the same story all the time so when I heard there is this movie titled ""Godzilla: Minus One"" I was not hyped for it but my god I never knew I could enjoy a Godzilla movie so much.

Very well done, the acting, the visuals, FANTASTIC!"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie should win the OSCAR
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Hands down the best Godzilla movie I've ever witnessed. The action was awesome and the characters were great. I would love a continuation of this version if it were to happen
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,This film is a love letter to Godzilla and the films of the 70s/80s. How I wish it would win the Oscar for visual effects.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Surprising story wirh emotional depth and stunning visual effects. Really sad that it was not presented in theaters the way it should have. Best modern day Godzilla movie ever.
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"""i cant believe oppenhiemer did this""- Jim Caddik AKA Caddicarus"
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing storyline and special effects! Can’t wait to buy it!
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film ever made so far.
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love this movie alot and can't wait for it to go on DVD. As a Godzilla movie, it slaps and as a movie, it rocks. I suggest you watch it if you can."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I see as many new movies as I can, and this was the best in the last 12 months (at least). And I just saw dune 2 which was great. The soundtrack made the movie. Great visual effects on top of that. Hands down the best best Godzilla since the original."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,An excellent monster movie that features human drama just as compelling
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"A monster of a film. This was one of my favorites of all time--it may even make the Top 10 list. The story was fantastic (and unexpected). I laughed, cried, and cheered for the protagonist the entire way. Who knew that a giant monster could win my heart? Love."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie ever created, on par with the original"
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic. The story is meaningful and impactful. Redefines what a modern day Godzilla movie can be.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,If you dont like this movie you are a sissy ducker that sucks dicks. Simple as that
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"yes,that's kind of it."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing movie, loved the visuals and the storyline."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,First Monster Movie To Make Me Cry
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,No doubt THE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,it's godzilla folks what more can I say
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"With real careable characters, compelling story and the horrorific godzilla, this becomes a perfect movie"
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing they could do so much with such a relatively small budget. The movie hits hard and doesn't rely solely on over the top action scenes to entertain and keep the audience engaged. The human story is powerful, the acting top notch and the writing… well this is the best written Godzilla movie of all time."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was great! I can't wait for another Godzilla to come out! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This is so much better than the Monsterverse movies.   Watching this movie made me feel like I was 5 again watching the 70s/80s Godzilla movies.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"The story of the human characters was beautiful and the best feature here, not the giant lizard. It could have been better and far more realistic (although I appreciate that's not what this was aiming for) with an environmental threat that didn't involve a CGI headache hogging so many scenes."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best movie of 2023. Endlessly rewatchable, every character has a strong arc and action scenes are edge of your seat. Poignant and super smart."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is unbelievably good ! I was expecting more of a action type of godzilla but in japanese,  but the story itself was completely S tier writing. the best movie of 2023"
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,The perfect example of how to make an ideal film.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"‘Godzilla: Minus One' is possibly the best entry for the character. The visual effects are absolutely astounding and the human characters are actually compelling, this feels like a modern take on the classic ‘Gojira' film from the 1950's but for a new generation of fans to enjoy!"
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think I've seen all the Godzilla movies... and this is my favorite by far! One of the best five movies of 2023. Try to see it on the big screen... also saw Minus Zero, which I -- and my 12-year-old son -- loved as much if not more!"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"fist things first
this movie would be best pic material if Godzilla WAS NOT IN THE FILM, the human story is that good!!!!

this movie is special and different, its a human story with godzilla in the backround and it works great, we see just enough pof him that we are satisfied, but the human drama is excellent, morbid, realistic and very well written

this movie to Americans may come off as terryifying in some scenes, americans may find the japanese dialect  as very nerve wrecking
simply put, a great analogy

Minus to the godzilla films, is ""joker"" to the DC films

its just different and way way better if you ask me, the mosterverse in USA looks laughably bad compared to this film,  mark my words

this flick will break streaming records in america for a international release when it comes out"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Possibly movie of the year and clearly the best Godzilla film. Some of the acting was a bit over the top for me, but in general an awesome movie with some meaningful themes where I actually care for human characters in a Godzilla movie, which in itself is a great achievement 😀"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,pretty good all in all.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Literally so good that you could take Godzilla out of the movie and it'd still be fantastic.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Never did I think in a million years that a Godzilla movie would make me sob in the theater like a child after it finished, and make me have a ten minute long train of thought about life, death, self-sacrifice, war, and the value of life. Good god, this movie is good. I genuinely think this is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely the best Godzilla movie. Please go see it if you get a chance, you will NOT be disappointed."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film and I think it is far more better than The American version of Godzilla. Every Godzilla fan and non Godzilla fan should watch this film.[Note: You don't need watch any other films to watch this film because it's a complete reboot😊] Thanks for reading my review ☺️☺️.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I am a huge Godzilla fan.  This was the best Godzilla movie that has been made so far.  Normally when I am watching these movies, I don't feel like the plot line is very strong,  so I really enjoy the monster fighting, although it seems as though while the monsters are fighting, we are cutting away to the human characters talking about 
some inane thing.  This story was engaging enough that you didn't really miss that Godzilla wasn't in the movie constantly."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Leave it to Japan to totally outdo Hollywood at their very own game with a fraction of the budget one would normally get for something of this magnitude and scale. Simply put, the best Godzilla movie to date. Awesome visuals and a thoroughly engrossing story-line with human characters you actually care about. Something I couldn't say the same thing about with Apple TV pluses Monarch: Legacy of Monsters in my opinion.

As mentioned, the characters and story were true standouts and Godzilla was portrayed as the most fierce and menacing monster I've ever seen before on-screen through so many films over the years. When this monster is walking, you genuinely feel the tremendous impact with every footstep taken.

Loved the character arc for the lead actor and for those not familiar with why this total was chosen, it's done with reference to Japan being characterized at Level Zero in terms of the state of fragility with this Country following the conclusion of World War 2 and with this new ever menacing threat, its now a step below this.

Great actions sequences and a feel-good movie that delivers in spades. Superbly crafted. The director Takashi Yamazaki has said he will take his time as far as coming up with a great sequel and I'm completely fine with this. Take all the time you need if it means something similar here can be re-done with new aspects. 

Loved some of the careful and proper nods paid by the director to classic thriller movies before this like Jaws for one. Extremely well done."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Perfection. Hollywood has *everything* to learn from this gem. Though I do enjoy the ‘Monsterverse' films, they're nowhere near the level of artistry this film has to spare. As good as could be hoped for - and then some. I love this film, and am still angry I wasn't able to see the monochrome version in theater. Hoping they'll both be on the Blu-Ray, & that it's released sooner than later…"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"not only the best godzilla movie, but the best possible godzilla movie. maybe it's just that most of the other godzilla movies aren't that great, but in my opinion, there is nowhere else to go from here because minus one is perfect. Shakespeare's tragedies absolutely cannot match the absolute despair I felt when I realized I couldn't put six stars"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Beautiful and well made movie. I saw three times in theaters and cannot wait to own this forever.
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best film of 2023! great script, excellent visual effects, fantastic performances. An emotional and great film, simply the best Japanese film I've ever seen."
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Yep, this is it. The best movie of 2023 no questions asked. Take notes Hollywood."
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie kicked ass no lie. You think you're getting an monster mash movie, which is fine, those are fun, but you're getting a deeply layered, earnest story about family, love, bravery, mental trauma, courage, and the value of a human life. Scary monster, good effects, great story, wonderfully done."
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the best films to come out in the past few years (In my humble opinion). Excellent story writing, dialogue to action ratio is well balanced, some of the most compelling characters I've ever seen portrayed in a film, and a great musical soundtrack. Way to go Japan, keep it up :)"
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Una película excelente y dramatica
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,A surprising win. We loved it.
"Feb 10, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was breath taking with stunning effects. Godzilla minus one is my favourite Godzilla movie in the franchise and one of my favourite movies ever.
"Feb 10, 2024",POSITIVE,this movie was so beautiful. I did not expect something so emotional and powerful. a great Godzilla intro movie I think. a great combination of action and plot that leaves you wanting to learn more about Godzilla if you don't already know
"Feb 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Utterly terrifying and riveting movie on Godzilla.
"Feb 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the best films I have seen in a while. The design of Godzilla was phenomenal and I was left speechless during the scenes which featured him. The soundtrack too, wow!!

Also, I felt fully connected to all of the characters who led most of the story. I understood their motives and decision making and felt strong emotions to the twists and turns of the film. 
It showed the braver side of humanity during a time of big hollywood films demonising different groups. 
I forgot I was reading subtitles for most of the film. A truly fantastic watch that I highly recommend you see!!"
"Feb 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Está si es una película de Godzilla, la cual impone miedo y tensión al momento de aparecer, al igual que la historia que se maneja como va avanzando hace que no pierdas la mira y la atención a la misma película, es grandiosa."
"Feb 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"This might be one if the best films I've ever seen. It really felt like an authentic film. The story freaky sucks you in. Godzilla wasn't even the star of the first half of the time. And by the time he makes a reappearance, you're invested into the characters  and feel the pain they go through."
"Feb 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Surprisingly good. Always amazed (and should not be, but it is what it is) when I see such emotion and silliness and ........ humaness in the Asian characters. Obviously prefer to see a movie without subtitles, but this was a real surprise and very good. Fun even."
"Feb 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've always been a fan of Godzilla, but this movie is spectacular!!! Great story and incredible visual effects. Godzilla movies are usually just escapist fun, but this movie has a very heavy plot dealing with PTSD and loss. It also treats Godzilla as a terrifying bad guy, in the true sense of his origin. Also got to see this movie a second time in 4DX! WOW!! If you get the chance - DO IT!!!"
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Muy buena película la mejor de godzilla que se a hecho
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, this design of Godzilla was downright one of the best, and the human characters were great, maybe the acting was pretty forced, but the movie writers put so much work into making the characters great and compelling, and you critics who rate these movies on their CGI, just shut up, seriously it's so stupid, even if we were grading movies on their cgi Godzilla minus one would be praised, which it is. This movie did so much for a budget that was only 10 to 15 million dollars, and I hope that there is a new movie that takes 5 years to make, if it takes one year, I fear for the integrity of the first Godzilla films."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"best movie of 2023, easily"
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla film I've seen for a long time.
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Such a great movie to watch, a fresh of breath air to the copy paste formula Hollywood has since replicated. The movie although is titled Godzilla, is very much about people. How they relate to each other especially after losing WW2, how they try to heal from that when all of a sudden they're all faced with the enormous obstacle that is Godzilla."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I grew up on Godzilla (mostly the American version) but this outdid anything the Legendary put out by a long shot, and legendary is my favorite Godzilla. I watch Legendary all of the time but this is the perfect movie to balance the dumb kaiju fights with serious and villainous Godzilla. Loved it, top of the line movie, would most definitely recommend to anyone."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,It's the best take on a Godzilla movie yet. You actually get the human perspective.
"Feb 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie is horrible it's the worst movie about Godzilla
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've seen this 3 times, 2 in color and 1 in B&W.  This is the best version of Godzilla since the original in 1954 and a welcome respite from MCU and the Monsterverse!   I've also seen all the major films in 2023 and I would rate this even or just above Oppenheimer.  It is that good!  The only disappointment is that they pulled it to make way for another Monsterverse film, which after this masterpiece can only disappoint us.  This movie has set the bar that high."
"Feb 5, 2024",POSITIVE,this Movie is the best movie you have to see this movie because how much money it made is worth it because First: is how Great it look's please give this movie 10/10 now theater's plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
"Feb 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,Godzilla was fantastic !!  Just not enough of him !!!  Instead we get sappy love story.
"Feb 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen no seriously. I've never been a fan of Godzilla and let alone the Japanese audio and didn't have very high expectations for the movie, but it was amazing and I will definitely be rewatching it on streaming services once released."
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Probably the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. Recommend seeing this if you like big nasty monsters!!!!
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,it's like if a film had godzilla in it
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Saw minus color.  The B&W made the film even more fantastic.  If you have the option to see it that way, I highly recommend.  But if not, watch it in color it's a movie you shouldn't miss"
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Compelling and entertaining.
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Wow!  A monster movie with a plot!!  A must see if you're a Godzilla fan.
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023. Best Godzilla movie ever. I had a great time
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"simple, old style Gojira.. interesting storyline. A real treat"
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Que filme incrível, a melhor adaptação de Godzilla sem dúvidas, pega a essência do monstro, tem cenas EPICAAAS, uma história que é impossível não se emocionar, direção fantástica, fotografia linda, tudo muito perfeito. Vale a pena a experiência que é sem dúvidas fantástica."
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"An awesome and emotional movie, even for a Godzilla film!"
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Watched the decolorized version. Fantastic movie, uses Godzilla as a tool to drive the human-centric story. In my inexperienced opinion, it succeeds in transporting the viewer back in time to Japan shortly after the war."
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This reboot of the Godzilla movie felt like a more serious science fiction story and was more enjoyable for it.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,One of The Best Movie! In 2023 Awesome!
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Really fun and well crafted.  Yes to seeing it on the big screen if humanly possible.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Awesome but Zilla is my boy... I have seen 👀
them all...and I love them all."
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"The rare viewing experience that was a mix of awe, eye-rolling, and suspense."
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,INCREDIBLE FILM NOT ONE FLAW.
"Feb 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I did not see the original color release of Godzilla Minus One, but friends had recommended I see it. Being over 70 years old, seeing the Minus Color version took me back to my Saturday afternoon matinees as a kid. It was very much like watching the old films I remember, but better."
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Story and special effects where great!
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,cinematography was perfect. Action seen were well done and didn't feel overdone or cheesy.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla films ever. Got a great story with the humans and seeing Godzilla on big screen and hearing the iconic theme on it as well gave me goosebumps. Definitely a 10/10 film.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Probably the best Godzilla movie ever made. Even if you're not a fan of monster movies it's still an excellent movie in it's own right. I hope they make more.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great storyline, totally over my expectations!"
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie! Though not really a fan of the ""Godzilla"" series (I might have seen one or two of them during my teenage years), or even of ""monster movies"" in general, I found this to be thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. The story was more interesting to me than the monster itself — but various scenes involving the monster were quite compelling. Probably my favorite movie of 2023, even though I saw only this, the B&W, version in February 2024. It didn't really look ""low-budget"" to me the sets and cinematography totally brought me, making ""suspension of disbelief"" work in most every way except when it came to the monster."
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,My two sons and I love the movie even though want’t colors. Well at least has English sub.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,An instant classic. Most likely the greatest Godzilla movie since the original. Monochrome was a nice added touch that made me possibly prefer it a smidge over the color version.
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly, one of the best movies I've seen this year!"
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked the Minus Color first as it captured the feel of post World War II era but my review for this movie is the same as my review with that version. Perfection from the characters, less but more effective & terrifying screen time for Godzilla, and an efficient way to spend the production budget that delivered so much more than the modern movies as of late. This deserves an award for that alone in Hollywood and they should really take notes. 5 stars."
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Sensational - in color and b/w!
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dear Hollywood,

When making monster movies moving forward, you should really take notes from Godzilla Minus One. Keep the human drama front and center while also having it feel compelling. That way the audience can have characters to latch onto from start to finish, especially after sht hits the fan. Incredible VFX work made all the more impressive by the fact that this film was made on such a low budget. Magnificently scored too."
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved loved loved every single second of it. Everyone need to go see it!
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent movie! Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color was great to watch in this format. Evoking memories of the original film but with much more enhancements due to the special effects. A must see!
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,loved it no matter what version
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Totally Japanese Totally serious
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"An incredible collaborative effort on all parts that legitimately brought me to tears. As a longtime kaiju fan, this transcends the campy nature of the genre and was effectively scary despite the ridiculous premise. The only downfall is the sequel foreshadowing. I wish we could purge these moments from modern storytelling."
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"an absolutely epic, gritty, terrifying and beautiful thrill ride. one of the best films i've seen in a long time. this will be a timeless classic."
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever.
"Feb 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Solid movie. Great Godzilla movie. Great job.
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Japanese version of Godzilla since its inception 70 years ago. The story and visuals are EVEN made better with the decolorization “BLACK & WHITE” only makes this movie more enjoyable with the aftermath of World War II backstory. Hats off to Toho Studios
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wow! Story, Story, Story…Perfection!"
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Acting, plot, special effects, sound, b/w, story. Best monster movie since Forbidden Planet."
"Jan 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"None of the movie was in English, worst God Zilla of them all, & it was way to long"
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,This is my favourite Godzilla film! It is a Masterpiece!
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"incredible film, easily the best Godzilla movie of the 21st century"
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing.  I Wasn't expecting much to be honest, But I was Amazed. Well balanced between action and drama!! Loved the story"
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is underrated. The acting, the cinematography, the storyline...it hit all the spots. An impeccable mix of action and emotions."
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies I’ve ever seen! Godzilla is absolutely terrifying and the characters are so well written and performed! I need to see the color version of it now!
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Wow. The plot. The superb acting. The stunning visuals. The riveting score. The epic conclusion...Godzilla Minus One is a bold reminder of why cinema is one of the most inspirational art mediums of our modern age. This film is a reminder of why I fell in love with movies in the first place. 10/10
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"If this isn’t the best movie I’ve seen all year, maybe ever, I don’t know what is. Dramatic, great story with an engaging score. Just a surprising joy."
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,As much about the main character's battle with his inner demons as it was his battle with Godzilla.
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,I need time to understand what I saw. All I know is that I am challenged and I feel invited.
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Everything I expected and more from a monster movie. Godzilla does not disappoint. Music score is perfect and adds so much to the movie.
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was great !!
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"A really good film. I love the storyline, the acting."
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Quite possibly the best Godzilla movie of all time!!!
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing, an Epic Godzilla. Great story and acting. We loved it"
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One puts the other recent Godzilla movies to shame.
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Although movie was not in color, was still outstanding"
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! Filled with so much heart and drama. Compelling characters all around especially the main protagonist who has a beautiful arc. Godzilla is a beast in this film. They made him a force of nature and downright scary at times. Incredible film all around. A must see in the theater!
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,An excellent masterpiece!
"Jan 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The main character has an obsession with being a kamikaze. 1/10 idea. It's not that great, but the Godzilla attacking Tokyo scenes are pretty good.
If you like Japanese Godzilla movies... Well you're probably going to watch it anyways."
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Much better than the recent American version of Godzilla!
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, but it wasn't the advertised color version. I actually believe I might not have liked the color version as much."
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely brilliant and moving! The best Godzilla movie ever!
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,Thought film told a great story about post war Japan and the toll of all wars in general really. Was glad to see the subtitled version versus dubbed.
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely awesome! Godzilla is a beast, powerful and Absolutely ferocious! A must see. Completely different from the new American origin stories. This is by far a fun, action, scary,  movie classic story of the original powerful Godzilla continued as part two. So brilliant, I had to watch twice on the big screen. Fantastic."
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've seen every Godzilla movie ever made. This is, hands down, the greatest one. It's an underdog story about redemption for not only the central characters but the country, as well. There won't be a dry eye in the house at the end. Watching Godzilla Minus One reminds me of the power of film with a focus. Spend your money on movies like these and not the garbage that has infected the modern movie industry. 

We need to un-Marvelize our standards as movie-goers and this is a perfect starting point to demand quality and heart in our films."
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,truly a amazing movie
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"Perhaps Toho's finest outing for the G-Man since the original, Godzilla Minus One brings the kaiju's back to his thematic roots without sacrificing an iota of thrills."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve ever seen.
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Just simply amazing movie on all levels.
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic! Old school feel, great story and characters, and the Godzilla moments are🔥🔥"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,It was just as good as the colored version. The only complaint I have for it is the missed opportunity to make Godzilla’s atomic breath be colored blue as the rest remains grey.
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Why this movie is not up for Best Foreign Movie I do not know.  An amazing historic drama that incorporates an oversized monster but still feels believable and the audience caring for the characters.
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"For some context, I missed the first theatrical release and saw the Minus Color version, after hearing about the nominations.  While I haven't seen it in color, to me the visual effects felt almost like a surreal blend of modern CGI and the goofy [to our modern eye] classic rubbersuit practical effects.  My gut is telling me it looks a lot more modern in color

That being said!  The film holds up to an award-winning rating even without relying on it's effects.  Characters were compelling, pacing and editing are extremely tight, and the entire thing feels like a timeless cinematic classic.  What if Godzilla but with Miyazaki levels of charm and Kurosawa levels of thematic depth?"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing . The most well thought out emotional and terrifying 
Godzilla film. Highly recommended !"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"What can be said about it that hasn't already been? It's Big G at his best, both narratively and visually. Japan may be at Minus One but Godzilla is back at one hundred percent!"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was hard to keep up with the subtitles sometimes, but overall it was good."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is ABSOLUTLEY the best Godzilla film in the franchise. And this is coming from a die hard Godzilla fan, collector and connoisseur. And just when you think it can’t get better. It does. Godzilla Minus One Minus Color is even better. The B&W version is simply magnificent. It’s like a whole new movie. Plays like a documentary of real events and ups the ante. Takashi Yamazaki outdid himself again. Not only should this win the Oscar for best VFX. It should have been nominated and should have won best picture. Brilliance."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie reminded me of the older, original Godzilla movies.  It was also a wonderful monster movie!"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,A unique and enjoyable way to experience an already amazing movie!
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Part of me regrets seeing it first in color. Special effects are great, heat ray charge up is iconic, chef's kiss to the roar and score. Better hero's journey / redemption arc than ANYTHING in the recent Star Wars Trilogy, though the twist requires a suspension of belief a little too high for me."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Emotional, dark, and scary -- something Godzilla hasn't been in decades. This is a must watch."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Damn good movie. The budget is low, but you can't see any cutover in the scenes. Everything looks good from fire to explosions."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome. I love Godzilla, a huge fan entirely. This movie was refreshing and exciting throughout the whole story. I love the actors. They were all so good! The storyline of the civilians was  portrayed in the most excellent way. You won’t regret seeing it."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie ever made, 9/10. It captured the emotion and terror from Gojira in the modern era masterfully. The only other movie that tops this is the b/w version which is a 10/10"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Better than anticipated. The storyline was very compelling
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it! Way better than Oppenheimer!!!
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Went to see this in the theaters on a whim. So glad I did. Acting was great. The story and struggle of post war life was exceptionally portrayed. The way the story played into Godzilla was enjoyable. My new favorite Godzilla movie.
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a must see. Godzilla is a force of nature. The human characters are up front though, and the story is excellent. Well worth watching."
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best films I’ve seen in theaters in a long time. Really enjoyed this film! Congrats to the creators of this film - well-deserved kudos!
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie for fans of the original Godzilla movies.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved the personal story besides the monster action.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it! :)

I'm not normally a Godzilla fan but the setting, storyline, and characters were believable. They had great character development too."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,A+ Godzilla references.   Special story taking place in slums relatable for many living in similar poverty conditions on Earth today if they get an opportunity to watch it.  They should find it enjoyable without even knowing the wonderful job workers of this film did specifically touching Japaneses and Godzilla memories.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Incredible. One of a kind.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it! Passionate actors in a genre that was new to me. Godzilla the monster was very nostalgic and this setting was perfect for the film. The story of the pilot was gripping as was his life after the war. Putting pieces back together and having a future that is hopeful. Very well done!
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely a must see.  Godzilla: Minus One (2023):  NO ONE told me to bring tissues to a GODZILLA movie!!! All joking aside, this is an amazing movie.  

A $15MM movie that completely outclasses higher budget Godzilla movies serves only to prove that you need a good story, compelling characters, and well crafted cinematography to deliver a compelling cinematic experience.

Try to catch on big screen, but I believe this translates very well to the smaller screen."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic. Felt the rare chill when you know you’re witnessing something that’s going to be talked about for ages.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,I saw this movie when it came out and I thought it was really good. But all of these reviews are over hyped. rotten tomatoes rated it too high. Knowing they have better movies with lower ratings
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is fantastic alone. The minus color version adds a layer of art to it
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"I like everything about the movie best godzilla ever 
Great story"
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the most well written and exciting movies I have seen in a long time.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Storyline was great and not predictable. Godzillas depiction of an unstoppable and terrifying force was done very well. Hands down the best Godzilla movie to date.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Must see! A movie like this reminds me why I love movies, and how amazing it is to see it in a proper theater."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,This is a masterpiece
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'm torn between the two versions. Both the color and Monochrome offer different things. 

As far as the movie goes, great human drama along with fantastic special effects! You don't have to be a Godzilla fan in order to watch and enjoy this amazing film. Go see it asap."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Such a good flick.  Suprisingly will appeal to many audiences you wouldn’t expect it to.  Must see!!!
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,best Godzilla ever! Classics or recents! see it in B & W
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"godzilla minus one took me back to the first time I saw a godzilla movie, some 60 years ago."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've seen nearly all the Godzilla movies and this one was my favorite. Great story, great characters, a little humor but mostly drama. And of course… the King at his best. All subtitles but I barely noticed. Can't wait to see it again!"
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever made
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Outstanding, the best movie I've seen in a long, long time. The performances were gut-wrenching and touching, and Godzilla was the force of incomprehensible destruction he was always meant to be."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. I really enjoyed it better than the color version.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Stayed true to the original with all the necessary upgrades for the current audience. Extremely well done.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,It has been awhile since I genuinely enjoyed a movie. Love this!
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,one of the top godzilla movies. this godzilla does not fu** around!!
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Perfect pace with an emotional ending. Thrilling.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Fun. Great action scenes. Well acted. Just the right amount of Silly.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Awsome movie great cast really recommend
"Jan 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,The beginning was good and the Tokyo attack was kinda good.  The rest of the movie is a bore.  I’ve seen almost all Godzilla movies and I watch for the attack scenes.  Hopefully the put out the plus one version
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Como fan de godzilla desde que soy un niño debo decir que es mi favorita sin duda, es hermosa una obra de arte al cine, es increíble como con tan poco presupuesto lograron hacer una obra de arte, una película perfecta para iniciar con la saga, llena de referencias que logre captar una por una"
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is what a movie is supposed to be in a word, Awesome"
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, one of the best Godzilla movies ever!"
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"We loved the dramatic, well-crafted storyline and the way it related to and referenced the history and culture of Godzilla.  Well done."
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! Excellent story!!
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie great story great action
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely spectacular!
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Perfect enough said.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the best films I've seen in years. Such a great story, restrained use of the monster, and gorgeous cinematography. Highly recommend!!!"
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've definitely seen more Godzilla movies than the average viewer due to being friends with some absolute nerds (<3) so I can add my verification that this is one of if not the best Godzilla movie made. Typically I either find the destruction funny/lackluster or the human story unnecessary and dull, but this one aced both sides. The characters were each memorable and had excellent actors, they all contributed to give a strong sense of humanity in a time of crisis in a way that was deeper than previous Godzilla movies. This gave the destruction and devastating parts a truly epic feel that none of the characters just ""walked off"" afterward. This Godzilla monster caused a deep-seated dread in me while watching which is something this franchise is either really good at or fails terribly at. All in all a truly great movie."
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,The only bad thing that can be said about this film is Godzilla has strange eyes. This is a must watch
"Jan 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,The power went out at the theater. Sat in the dark for a while waiting for it to come back on. Actually stilll sitting here right now with my kids getting antsy waiting.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,The epitome of Kaiju Monster movies. A must see in theatres. Absolutely blown away by everything in this movie.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Esta no meu Top 3 melhores filmes não apenas do Godzilla mais de 2023

"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"amazing film. great story, amazing action, beautiful cinematography, and the B&W really enhanced the experience of the film."
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolute digital masterpiece!
Everything the original Godzilla was meant to be and much much more!"
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Came for Godzilla and got the best movie I've seen in years. Phenomenal action with a compelling and wonderful story to match.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,I think this was best Godzilla since last 20 years
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,best godzilla film hands down
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,This is THE Godzilla movie that everyone should watch on top of the original. The best movie of 2023-2024 and an amazing sequel to Oppenheimer.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,I like the color version better. But I cannot rate this movie lower than five stars.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely amazing. Godzilla is devastating in this one. So much humanity/ tragedy, action and love. One of the best I’ve ever seen. 10/10"
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible, beautifully re done with more intensity and gorgeous shots, it was so much more than previous which was already great!"
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I have ever seen!
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story. Great acting.
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,The best movie of the year
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"FREAKING AMAZING. THE MUSIC AND EFFECTS. THE EMOTIONAL ELEMENT OF IT AS WELL. 
It got me at the end though, I wasn't expecting it."
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year 2023. Every Godzilla fan needs to watch this. Whether you’re a fan of the Toho or legendary you’ll surely enjoy it. Unlike legendary humans characters just being annoying and pointless. With Toho The humans have a good story that’s actually entertaining and essential to the plot of the movie. Even has a Oscar nomination for best visuals
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Probably the best Godzilla since the original!
"Jan 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic. A classic Japanese Kaiju/ Godzilla film for the modern day. The human story line was not only beautiful but simple unlike the multiple human storylines in the American Godzilla franchises. Godzilla proves to be a horrific and ominous threat throughout the film. Invigorating work of art worth reading the subtitles or just watch and enjoy the beautiful visual. A must watch movie. 10/10.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great Movie!!! Huge Godzilla Fan!! Didn't like seeing Godzilla Lose, but the story was convincing enough to understand the human element surviving a force of nature!!"
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,That was the best movie by far I've seen in a few years. Amazing characters and sound design. Can't wait to see what comes next for godzilla.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a kid's Saturday afternoon TV movie for adults... and kids. Want to experience classicaly portrayed Japanese culture. This movie's cinematic shots, story line flow and character development including Godzilla's, makes it a must see. Yes, there is a moral underlying story too. As a Japanese living in Panama and as  other kids played with their favorite dolls and actions figures, mine was Godzilla.  Thanks for the walk down memory lane from the oiriginal 1954 movie. Godzilla is not a monster but an animal... and so are we."
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome experience! Just like way back when!
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Well made movie.Great monster flick.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Epic. Wish I saw it in color but B&W was still crazy. Extremely entertaining movie. My gf loved it too and she’s more into romcoms.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely the best of all the Godzilla Movies .
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Having seen it in color and without it I can definitely say I prefer it without color. It makes for a much more intense and darker movie (pun intended). It felt like watching a documentary and though it makes no sense I felt my other senses were heightened. I wasn't distracted by colors. I felt more in the moment. It definitely made for a scarier movie as well. I'd pay a 3rd time to see it again.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a fascinating, emotional, gripping, action packed, meditation on ptsd. Just see it."
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"A foreign film that puts 99% of Hollywood movies to shame.  With a very well thought out story and compelling characters, this movie is probably the best I've seen in 2023.  It will go down as the greatest Godzilla movie of all time."
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely INCREDIBLE.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year! Loved it!
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,this is truly a great movie with a great story and godzilla looks great
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing story and effects were perfect.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,best film of 2023 and a beautiful b&w remaster make this a must see!! don't miss this limited release!
"Jan 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,I think the film is suppose to be like films back in the 1940s so it's unusual to modern day movies.  The actors emote too much and there is a bit of a cheesy factor consequently.  The tempo is plodding.  Godzilla is cool.  An effective job was done with the monster.
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve seen in a while
"Jan 26, 2024",POSITIVE,A beautiful movie with Godzilla in it
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,BEST Godzilla movie made
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen this year.
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I seen this film for the 3rd time and it still surprises me how great everything is and more tears flow the more I watch Godzilla -01. It's the acting, story and production that make this  film movie of the year maybe decade and rock on to Hollywood by showing how much the elites appreciate a masterpiece from a foreign country!

 Wait they skipped over the movie and ignored it? Huh but the academy gave 12 Oscars to Titanic and it's lack of respect for the tradgic  deaths by creating a fake plot for the love of Scrouge McDuck moneys, but not this? How you say the word that you can call a person who is self centered shameless bottom feeding spinless soulless gutless envy fueled and phoney baloney filled hypocrite?  ?"
"Jan 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm not as high on it as many others seem to be, but Godzilla Minus One is a pretty good film. There are no huge surprises."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"That movie is very epic with some of the best visual effects. Marvel makes terrible progress with its visual effects. Tokyo always advances in technology. I appreciate it, samurai."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Monster movie perfection!
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,The best designs amazing human characters for once and a amazing plot
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Emotional, intense, and full of action. I really enjoyed this movie, the scenes with Godzilla in it were truly beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Not to mention, the human plot is actually really well. Whether you are a Godzilla fan or not, this is a must see, full of excitement, terror, suspense, and emotion."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can't think of a better film to see in 2023 or 2024. From the beautiful visuals to the incredible story, everything in Godzilla Minus One is over the top. The story of the little girl, Akiko, is extremely sad, and even I was broken up over her situation. And the girl playing Akiko did a phenomenal job! She was more believable than most adult actors today. Hands down, this is one of the absolute best films I've ever seen. Watch it, watch it, watch it. And when it goes Blu-ray, buy yourself a copy, and all of your friends copies too!"
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome movie with outstanding pacing and a superb musical score. Acting was great and told a powerful story.
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"A real movie unlike some Godzilla movies.  
Well written and acted.
Takes us back to the very early days of Godzilla after the war before Godzilla had become the hero defender of Japan.
You could almost say, Godzilla is the war or the United States....

Well worth seeing more than once"
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan. I've seen Every Godzilla film both from Toho and American Godzilla films. This film was a MASTERPIECE of Godzilla storytelling. I normally don't care for human characters in a Godzilla film. In this film, I actually care for all the characters and want them to live. Godzilla himself? My god, this is the scariest Godzilla in all of his films! I LOVED THIS FILM! It's my new FAVORITE Godzilla film of all time. SEE IT!!!"
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,A Godzilla movie that will leave you in tears! What a masterpiece.
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,The first Godzilla movie that manages to create human characters that the audience will actually care about.  Shockingly good and well told story.
"Jan 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I am perplexed why so many people rate this movie so highly.  As a lifelong Godzilla fan I was sorely disappointed after the rave reviews.  The acting is not good.  The character development makes no sense and is full of holes.  The plot, again, full of holes and unrealistic in an uncreative way.  They could have done so much better.  Underwhelmed and perplexed, but I'm glad y'all liked it so much."
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"The soundtracks and the essence of Godzilla are very strong points of this film, in addition to the fact that they knew how to take advantage of the budget they had."
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Esta película no es de esta época, me estaba temblando el labio en el clímax, esto es una verdadera película de Godzilla. En esta película nos muestran a un monstruo real que causa destrucción. Me lleno de emociones y me encantan las escenas de destrucción, se sienten muy reales y fue mucho mejor en el cine. Aquí no nos importa ver a Godzilla y ya, también tiene personajes entrañables a los que no quieres que les pase nada."
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie kept true to Godzilla classic fashion. The acting, action, storyline and graphics were top tier! Loved it."
"Jan 23, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I've ever seen and tied for the best movie I saw in 2023. Phenomenal human drama with a Godzilla that is legitimately terrifying. Who knew you could cry during a monster movie? Highly recommended!!!
"Jan 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Minus One was one of those movies that felt like a remake of it's original. Godzilla: Minus One is one of those movies if you were new to the series, and if it comes, ready for the sequel if it comes."
"Jan 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's kind of surprising to find a touching human drama in the midst of a monster movie, but there it is. Great characters and a very entertaining!"
"Jan 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film is fantastic in every sense.  Storyline, characters, music (the music is brilliant) and special effects.  This is unlike any Godzilla film you've ever seen.  It's about the people, not the monster.  The human emotion story is very strong.  Lose any preconceived ideas you might have of a Godzilla film and watch this.  It's a must watch."
"Jan 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie perfectly captures the horror that Godzilla initially was, bringing the terror and fear and sadness that Godzilla brought. The movie has a great story, characters, score, and the visual effects were OUTSTANDING. Not just a good Godzilla movie, a good movie in general, one for everyone Godzilla fans or not to enjoy."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,That's what I call cinema ! A great movie ! Better than a US blockbuster !
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Very awsome to any Godzilla fan and even if you don't know the story or series it's still very enjoyable
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty good. Was expecting better from all the amazing reviews, but solid. The twist wasn't a twist and the female characters were weak and no great character arcs anywhere. But it had heart."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie of all time!!!
"Jan 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What movie did others watch. This is laughingly bad…. For a moment at the beginning of the movie I thought it would be different, original and elevated with the kamikaze pilot story line but then it quickly descended in predictable cliches. Outrageous larger than life acting, with exaggerated body movements  and ""everybody in the back of the theater"" needs to be able to hear this stage line delivery. 15 minutes of a non-scary, so slow moving, obese Godzilla and 1 hour 45 minutes of sentimental Hollywood type fare minus the true spectacle."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great story and amazing rendering of Godzilla. Takes the best of old school 1970's Godzilla and updates to a modern quality, but also a great personal story for the characters."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is the epitome of perfection.
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Old school Godzilla in a new, fresh way! great character development and story as well"
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Movie was absolutely stellar, and riveting story telling made this a great piece of cinema!"
"Jan 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,Overhyped. Effects are impressive for the budget. But the heart isn’t there. 
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,The absolute peak of monster movies
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie from start to finish. Had everything from action to a great storyline. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if you’re not a Godzilla fan."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this movie is a complete throwback to the original 1954 movie. It's not just a guy in a suit or CGI but it feels real. The characters are great. There can be over reacting here and there but overall top five best movies in my opinion."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great characters and story, a powerful Godzilla movie that should be enjoyed on the biggest screen you can find!"
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever.
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Yeah. You MUST catch this in the cinema. If you want to watch something that reflects the heart of the Godzilla story, it's beautiful, well paced, fantastically acted romp. Although the ‘Zilla Beat Intro kept throwing me to ‘Simon says'.  Well done Japan…you're awesome."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Die hard Og Godzilla fan right here from day 1."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story. Not just interested in Godzilla but everything else that is being affected. Impressed.
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic story and super fun godzilla angle. Very enjoyable.
"Jan 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was ok, I high higher expectation based on feedback and ratings. Very slow at times. I wouldn't recommend it."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"la mejor pelicula de godzilla que eh visto en mi vida ♥ emocionante, epica, simplemente hermosa ♥"
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome movie with outstanding pacing and a superb musical score. Acting was great and told a powerful story. 
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve seen this decade
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"As an avid Godzilla fan, this was character driven, plot driven, had some light messaging which informed us of Japanese culture during and post war, and the Godzilla music right when you just started to miss it. I cant wait to see it again in minus color! This is easily the best Godzilla movie out of all the US and Japanese movies. Go see it!"
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Saw my 1rst Godzilla movie over 50 years ago, this one did not disappoint. I would recommend seeing one of the original 50s/60s movies before seeing Godzilla Minus One and you will see how far they have come - Loved it"
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Easily a great movie Godzilla really feels real. The acting is insanely perfect. Plot is great. This is a movie you will never forget!
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film is a masterpiece. The perfect balance of an, incredibly, compelling human interest story and action/blockbuster elements that put to shame anything I've seen in the past decade. It's an, absolute, event and it sticks with you. True greatness."
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie gave me the will to live
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Such a beautiful movie. A cinematic masterpiece if you will. Definitely a must watch for any Godzilla fan
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Una obra maestra emocionalmente
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best movie of the year! Awesome action, crazy suspense, a dark and sad tone, and a incredible 2 act, we will be hungry for more films like this!"
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is ""Jaws"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" meets Akira Kurosawa.  This movie is amazing, and it shows what's wrong with so many American action movies.  The characters are so compelling!  Unlike so many ""monster"" movies, the story between the human characters is as important -- or maybe more important -- than the story about the monster.  This is a truly great movie.  My only criticism is that very occasionally some of the special effects are a little substandard, but given that the movie only cost $15 million, it is amazing.  Full of heart, a little humor, lovable characters and great action!  Go see it in the theater!"
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Closed captions were not a problem.

Positive life affirming theme overcame a silly Godzilla plot! Well, what do I expect in regards to intelligent, plot and such its a Godzilla movie crying out loud!"
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excellent story, and so much depth  and action!"
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Definitely not a typical ""Godzilla"" movie and that's a good thing. This is more of a war drama following the traumatic experiences of a failed Kamikaze pilot along with the residents of a war-ravaged Tokyo. Godzilla is more of a secondary character and a symbol of another enemy combatant that allows retribution for our main character. Well written and a superb and refreshing ""Godzilla"" movie which does have plenty of action when Godzilla attacks with a couple of unexpected twists along the way."
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Filme espetacular, ignorem a Louisa Moore, ela deu o cu na esquina"
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla-1 rocked my world! It's not just a monster flick it taps into deep fears and societal stuff. Visually stunning, emotionally gripping – a wild ride for sure! 🦖🎬 Hands down, it's the best Godzilla film to date!"
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely blew me away
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"There was only a singular showing of this movie in my country, I spent a lot of money on a cab home afterwards since the public transport was out, costing me 7 times more than the ticket, but damn was it worth it."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. It brings old school Godzilla back to life in an incredible way. It’s the most pissed off Godzilla I’ve ever seen lol. The story line/plot was great. And the acting was very good. Always loved Godzilla growing up and this movie did him justice. Unlike a lot of the other new ones. 
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I took my son and we both liked the movie. It kept my attention right from the start. I thought the effects were good. I would watch again.
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,this movie of godzilla is so good and i think the movie can have a sequel why the final scene godzilla regenerates in the deep of the ocean and the sequel according to the director will be in development
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"A little bloated but, Godzilla holds a very strong presence on the screen yet the monster doesn't completely steal the spotlight. The character development and story line is attention grabbing and, we still have a massive lizard breaking things. Pretty cool."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this film! Godzilla looked so real and terrifying. And the acting was great.
"Jan 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Special effects excellent and the plot line was good too.  View of their government was surprising and provoking.  Great sound, too! On the downside the movie was a little too long, overall."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I've ever seen.  Classic Godzilla themes and pitch perfect Japanese cast with modern special effects and great cinematography.  Fun watch even with the subtitles.
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"For the first time since the original 1954 Godzilla movie, I actually cared about the human characters in a Kaiju movie. Unlike most other films about giant monsters, this one focuses more on the struggles of trying to rebuild after everything has been destroyed and it works beautifully. You really feel for these characters and you get tense and worry when the titular monster rampage is its way back into their lives. 
Godzilla himself has been taken back to his roots as the villain of the flick. He's a being of pure destruction, an unstoppable force of nature that can't be reckoned with and it's perfect. 
In my opinion this is by far the best Godzilla movie and it a strong contender for my favourite film of 2023."
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Special effects were top notch!  The acting in very Japanese style. All in all Godzilla was bad ass
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Es la  película de kaiju que se preocupa tanto por la vida interior y las motivaciones de las personas que se escabulle del camino de los descomunales pies del monstruo. Está versión de Godzilla es como la versión de Michael bay dónde se ve peleas momentos icónico que se pasa de la ciencia ficción.
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,me encantá este contenido!
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Está película nos enseña mucho que debemos luchar pase lo que pase en cada adversidad tenemos que ser muy fuertes como un Titanic para sobre salir de cualquier problema o situación que afrontemos en nuestro diario vivir
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,La verdad es una película excelente la recomendaría por sus escenas son geniales
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"La película es muy buena, efectos especiales excelentes, el sonido es inigualable, las actuaciones son muy acertadas al igual que la dirección y elección de actores."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie! Not just a Godzilla movie, it's so much more!"
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una muy buena película, innovó en cuanto a producción y desarrollo de historia!"
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Hands down the best Godzilla movie ever, and one of the best movies I've ever seen. Can not think of a single negative critique of this film. Even the parts that felt like familiar tropes kept me engaged because I was so emotionally invested. Must see."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Me encantó buena película para disfrutar en familia buenos efectos especiales y buenos actores 10 de 10
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Muy buena película para ver con amigos recomendada
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,This was a beautiful action-fantasy movie. Absolutely wonderful in every respect and so emotionally engaging. This movie is destined to be a classic of its genre. I'm not at all surprised that the best movie of the year did not come out of Hollywood!
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"En mi opinión, esta película de Godzilla es la mejor de toda la saga. Es una auténtica obra de arte, y el diseño de Godzilla es brutal, ya q es el mismo de la era heisei, pero más detallado, sus espinas dorsales son de las mejores q eh visto."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una película con muy buena trama y un final interesante, muy recomendada."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Top notch Godzilla. Great story with a truly scary monster

"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Una película muy interesante y entretenía
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Maravillosa película entretiene de principio a fin
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the best kind of monster sci-fi movie, one that doesn't rely on blood and gore for its suspense, but built entirely on its plot line, human drama, and minimal yet incredibly well-timed use of creature action/violence."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente pelicula, godzilla volviendo a las raices donde representa muy bien la destruccion y las consecuencias de la bomba atomica a japon"
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"A triumph. How many movies called ""thrilling"" genuinely thrill you? How many dramas can actually break your heart? This film is a rare and stunning masterwork. Highly recommend a theater viewing."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"As a Godzilla fan from the 80's this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, great visuals and sounds, highly recommend to see in the big screen"
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie all throughout, but the ending could've been better"
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing for a 15 million dollar budget. The cgi is great and the godzilla looks awesome. The actors did a wonderful job and there is almost n9thing I would change about the movie.
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Action from beginning to end, great acting, great story, best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen. Must see"
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible production, characters, I loved the definition and quality of the film. I think that in the medium and long term it could be very well received by the public or the audience in general. The music selected highlighted the role of the characters and this type of cinematic design is incredible."
"Jan 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Do you really need me to tell you why it sux?
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Genial la película la recomiendo
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Pienso que es una excelente pelicula muy buenas escenas muy recomendada 10 de 10

"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wow! Sinceramente es una película que recomiendo demasiado, primero porque me hizo sentir mucha adrenalina y segundo porque tiene muy buenos efectos visuales, es increíble."
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Me pareció super enserió es un poco envolvedora al misterio y ala incertidumbre de lo que puede suceder excelente
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"En mi opinión, esta película de Godzilla es la mejor de toda la saga. Es una autentica obra de arte, el diseño de Godzilla es brutal, ya que es el mismo de la era heisei, pero más detallado, sus espinas dorsales son de las mejores o la mejor que he visto. El aliento atómico es el mejor que voy a ver en mi vida, ayer la estaba viendo, y cuando lo lanza hace como una especie de explosión nuclear cuando impacta con un objeto."
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Una película completa están buena uff ya me la e visto varias veces 
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Que exelente, me parece de lo mejor, súper recomendado, lo mejor de lo mejor"

"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,good action film w heart
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is totally wild how this ends up being my pick for best movie of the year despite: Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Killers of the Flower Moon all being an amazing benchmark. And yet it was. I thought I was walking into an another monster movie. But that's only part of what this movie is. Last thing I will say is, I really would not wait for this to come to DVD/BR unless you have an excellent sound system because the sound design and music are second to none. Go see this in the theaters where godzilla is the large and terrifying creature it's meant to be and your eardrums will thank you."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It kept me on the edge of my seat!
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This film was phenomenal!! Please make more movies like this.
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Simply amazing. Special effects are sublime and the story line is not just big monster action but people centric too. The best godzilla yet
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Of all the movies I've seen about Godzilla, this one is by far THE BEST!!"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I wish it was a more English version movie
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"as usual nippon entertainment never dissapoints, AMAZING ¡ real actors, no ridiculous plots, nothing forced

i enjoyed it so much ¡  (learn something hollywood i bet youll never do)"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have been a fan of Godzilla since I was a little boy. I have seen the original 50's version all the way up to newer installments. This movie takes Godzilla back to its roots and makes the human side of the story on top of that very interesting. Normally I don't  care about the characters not named Godzilla this movie changed that. The writing was incredible, and the acting was top notch. That combined with the great special effects,  visuals, and action make this a great movie. I would say not only is this now my favorite Godzilla movie of all time, but also just a great movie in general. Even if you have no experience with Godzilla feel free to go watch this movie you will not be disappointed."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Before to watch it, I read the reviews and I absolutely agree is a must"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best versions of Godzilla.
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"What a surprise this was.  Engaging emotional human story wrapped around a monster movie is how I describe it.  Loss, sacrifice, redemption. It runs the whole gambit.  I don't think I've ever shed a tear while watching a Godzilla movie before."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie was overhyped.  I love monster movies with monsters big or small.  This movie had a lot of hype and well it did not live up to it.  it did have more backstory for characters that were no Godzilla, so that was different and good.  the special effects were ok, and I do not need top notch stuff to enjoy a good film.  The story I thought stole scenes from Jaws.  Weird.  The acting I thought was a bit over the top.  Overall worth a watch, but average at best."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The storyline and pace are slower than other Godzilla movies, and there are less action scenes with destruction. But the Godzilla scenes are enjoyable!"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I saw this film with my son. He is the biggest Godzilla fan I have ever know. After taking him to many of the newest in the Godzilla installments… I have to say this one was so captivating. 
I went several years ago to see Shin Godzilla not expecting much. However, I completely enjoyed it. 
With Godzilla Minus One I was blown away. A great story and plot. Excellent actors, and not a moment of boredom. As a casual Godzilla fan I truly feel this is among the top five of ALL TIME."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this is the first Godzilla movie where I really cared about the human characters and were rooting for them to take down the kaiju! The story is well-paced and heart-pounding, and the scenes with Godzilla are visually stunning and terrifying! Amazing!"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is rousing entertainment on a grand scale. Totally, happily, fulfilling in every way. You may want to resist — you've seen ""Godzilla"" before, right? Not like this, and not in a movie this enjoyable.

"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I have high expectations on this based on stories heard from the media. It was a bore-fest, highly predictable and histrionic. Ignoring the monster, I have to suspend believe when it comes to plot. How easy to find his damsel in decimated Tokyo, in the most populated city in the world? Easier than buying my coffee at Pret - at least there's a queue. He just walk right up to meet her in the middle of it all. A sailor walked into control centre to declare he's actually is the nation's top scientist? WTAF. 

I've grown up watching Japanese films. Never have I expect the acting is still this OTT. It is distracting. It is one dimensional. Every actor has the same expression. The worst is Kuranosuke Sasaki. He becomes hysterical with every scene, even at dinner. Muscle clenged, eyes bulging and mouth wide ajar, its excruciating to watch. 

It is cheesy, it is predictable and Godzilla is so prosthetic. Expect the expected. Reminiscent of 90s Hollywood big budget disaster films from Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich minus the slow motion. Its the same - everyone survives, everyone claps in the end. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie 
I liked so much Godzilla"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it! Glad there was much more of a human element to the story than just a monster movie! Ok, I cried!"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una excelente película la recomiendo mucho si ere espectador casual o fan de Godzilla

"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I cried...at a Godzilla movie...and not from laughter.  'Nuff said.
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Had the choice of the original Japanese with subtitles or dubed in spanish. Definately better in Japanese
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the most competently made movie I have seen I awhile. Does for Godzilla what Christopher Nolan did for Batman. Godzilla is not the star but the actor that's a conflicted former Kamakazi pilot. Any veteran can understand him. Just very well made, written, and acted movie."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Me gustó los efectos especiales no muy buenos y la historia y el dramatismo de los personajes le agregan gran interés
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Me encanto fue la mejor película que me he visto y de verdad súper recomendada y para este 2024 para q vayan y la vean
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"YOOOOO!!!! This movie is better than any Godzilla movie has the right to be. If I saw this when it came out in December of 2023, this movie would easily be in the top three movies I saw of that year. GO SEE IT!"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Mainly the Godzilla movies bore me, Godzilla comes out very little time or the humans are very boring, but this movie is a big exception, the human characters are really charismatic and their stories really interesting and the ending really moved me and left me with a good taste in my mouth knowing that the protagonist ended up being happy, It's my favorite movie of all time, to tell the truth."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una adaptación que mezcla la ficción , el drama y efectos especiales , para pasar el rato sin mayor expectativa"

"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,good movie...true Godzilla..the monster
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Lo mejor que vi en el año 2023 sin lugar a duda. Con un buen CGI, buena trama e Historia este Godzilla se ve Imponente y se los recomiendo vayan a verla con la idea de que verán una buena historia y no con la idea de ver Kaijus peleando como en el Monsterverse."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"unexpectedly Amazing, one of the best Godzilla movies ever, this one has a soul & a heart, great direction"
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,Buena película buen trama

"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muy buena la película, para verla en familia, excelentes efectos especiales, la recomiendo"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente pelicula, vale la pena verla, muy buena trama."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie and great to
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"El vídeo da un buen abrebocas de lo que genial que va a ser la película, da un resumen de escenas importantes, pero a la vez deja la sensación de querer ver bien todos y cada uno de los detalles de la misma."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Lo recomiendo mucho es una excelente opcion
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Increíble, es una película que por primera vez no muestra a godzilla como realmente es, un monstruo y no un pobre animal que se está defendiendo y por eso actúa como tal,por eso me pareció bastante buena, muestra el terror en los habitantes."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"No creerías que una película de monstruos podría hacerte sollozar y pensar, pero Godzilla Minus One sí."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Esta película es fabulosa me gusto mucho 100% recomendada y ni hablar de esta página tan increíble nos da todas las pelis que queramos😝 véanla porfa
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente película, te atrapa y te emociona en cada minuto, la recomiendo 100%"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"una agradable sorpresa, buena historia, buenos efectos; entretenida. Increíble que con el poco presupuesto que se tuvo para realizarla pueda ser tan buena. Empatizas con todos los personajes y protagonistas, entiendes y te involucras con su sentir y sus vivencias, creo que el final fue demasiado perfecto, pero también te deja abierta la trama a una segunda entrega. Vale mucho la pena verla y, por favor, de verdad, disfrútenla en el cine porque sí vale la pena gastar en buen cine como este y no en porquerías que actualmente nos quieren meter a la fuerza, con costos de producción ridículamente altos, pero que no le llegan ni a los talones a producciones verdaderamente  exelente la recomiendo."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una película bastante buena no me canso de verla ya que su calidad y la manera que los actores interpreta cada papel es una cosa única ☺️
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Las escenas de acción fueron geniales. Especialmente el tema musical utilizado para Godzilla. Realmente disfruté la película de principio a fin. Las últimas escenas deberían haber sido las más intensas, pero estaban tan inconexas que parecían eventos aleatorios de diferentes películas."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me encantó la película, tiene unos efectos especiales increíbles y la trama es bastante interesante, súper recomendada"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic compelling thoughtful
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is a interesting, I think that this is the best movie"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Es la. Mejor película que eh visto un bien trabajo en formación y video
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It was so cool how they created an old movie and made it look real
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,The most emotionally in-depth monster movie ever created!
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is a good entertaining movie and can be enjoyed in company, I give it an excellent rating because it has good things."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,me gusto mucho es la mejor película que he visto
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece!  The storytelling in this movie was amazing and it tugs on the heart strings throughout.  You would expect that a movie BARELY featuring Godzilla wouldn't really entice fans of the series, but the monster is so well done and its rare appearances so spectacular that you're just waiting with bated breath until the next time he does pop up on the screen.  Godzilla was always intended as a cautionary tale about the danger of nuclear weaponry and this movie returns to the series roots in glorious fashion.  They did a tremendous job of conveying the raw destructive power of Godzilla, but do yourself a favor and see this in theaters so you can truly experience it in all its glory.  My ONLY complaint is that they changed Godzilla's iconic roar."
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Only cared about the scenes with godzilla. Couldn’t care too much about the barely fleshed out characters. I do see what they were doing though, and it made it the best godzilla movie by far. However, the plot is so basic that I wasn’t intrigued all that much. But this makes a great theater experience with the godzilla sequences."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved every moment! Great movie!
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"The single best monster movie ever! not just a great Godzilla film, but a great film with truly impressive SFX and a surprisingly gut-wrenching emotional wallop! 10 out of 10!"
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,Its mostly centers around a guy dealing with trauma.
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,This is one of the best movies I've seen for years. I really wouldn't change anything about it.
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Tengan cuidado con estas páginas, están estafando gente vía telegram para robarles su dinero"
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Wartime movie must watch!!
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Really enjoyable movie with a lot of classic references and throwbacks with modern cinematography. Cant wait to see where they go from here!
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Even though the CGI wasn't the best I've seen, It has an excellent story. The action scene's were great. Especially the theme song used for Godzilla. I really enjoyed the movie from beginning to end."
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,A liftle slow at the start but was really good.
"Jan 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"There are good moments, but I was intensely aware of the editing process and the lack of sense in the sequence of scenes. The last scenes should've been the most intense but it was so disjointed it felt like random events from different movies. The character's motivations didn't follow the facts laid down by the film and then their actions didn't follow their motivations as laid out by the film. The character growth was undermined by the deus ex machina undoing meaningful choices. The monster design face looks like a sea lion with a big clown grin and for some reason they gave it human eyes with big stone eyebrows that say ""angry"" which is just too goofy. The body is identical to Barney character in the children's show. It stands and walks like a fat naked toddler taking its first steps. The boats behaved like cars, they simply parked in rows in the ocean. The main character was the only character with any depth. The monster was a slow lumbering moron then a whiplash fast clever opponent, but then a lumbering moron again."
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,my head exploded 🦎💥
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Fast pacing and emotionally poignant Godzilla Minus One lives up to its name with its title character as a terrifying monster for once
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,The overall feel of the movie is amazing. It has you routing for the humans to win. Godzilla is terrifying. It also reminds me of the 1954 Godzilla. Music is amazing. Definitely one of the best Godzilla movies!
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best monster movie since Jawsand like Jaws, this movie makes you care about the people, not just the monster.  Amazing movie."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Second time seeing it! Great movie!!!
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is simply the best Godzilla film ever made. I wanted the characters to live and wasn't cheering for Godzilla to win. Hollywood can't invoke that.

And Godzilla was terrifying to look at. Amazing.

$15 million budget? Hollywood, you have been shown the door."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"They went old school with the monster's presence and it totally worked. The human drama fit perfectly with the overall plot, which is rare for a movie like this. I think this will go down in history as one of few perfect movies."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie since the first on in 1954!
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"A solid personal story line, interesting context of post-war Japan, and of course great monster!"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla film ever made and the best film of 2023. First and foremost, Godzilla is SCARY. This is the most menacing depiction of the legendary Kaiju, and two sequences in particular had me gripping my seat. The visual effects are breathtaking and better than anything Hollywood has put out in years. Godzilla's main city attack MUST be seen on the biggest screen possible - the mayhem, destruction, menace, and sound should be experienced in IMAX theaters. All that aside, the heart of the film is the characters. This is the only Godzilla film to date in which the characters are so well developed that you care about each and every one of them. The finale will tug at heart strings, and I heard some sniffles in the theater. When the credits rolled, applause erupted with myself included. 

GODZILLA MINUS ONE - An epic, astonishing cinematic achievement, the best Godzilla film of all time, and easily the best film of 2023. Go see it!!!!"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Happiest I've been leaving the theater in 2 years. Killer movie. 
Spoiler alert..
Godzilla is kind of a jerk"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"this was the best and greatest Godzilla movie of all time, the human characters were perfect, Godzilla was an absolute menace, and the music was pure perfection, highly recommend watching this movie"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla I've ever seen.
Definitely worth 98% on rotten tomatoes."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved it, best movie of 2023. Great characters, Godzilla made you feel like he was a natural disaster."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best Film I've seen in theaters since they reopened. Wonderful, moving story coupled with incredible acting and great visuals blows all American Godzilla adaptations out of the water. HIGHLY recommend seeing it in theaters while you still can!!"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is proof that you can make a blockbuster and still tell an important, even emotional story.  Hollywood should take note of this one.  One of the best of 2023."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Gripping thriller!!!!  Loved the story, the characters and the CGI special effects.  Best Godzilla movie ever!!!!!!!"
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,La recomiendo 100% mejor pelicula del 2023 muy humana y la mejor de godzilla
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolute incredible!
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzila minus one was amazing, before I watched it I thought it being in Japanese would be bad but the subtitles were very good and easy to read, the movie doesn't have the most diolauge so I don't mind it. The CGI wasn't the best at times but it still looked amazing, the ending was okay but it could have been a bit better. the SFX were amazing and the movie all around was fanominal and I would highly recomend watching it. The progression of the main charecter was great and it was an all around great story."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Tiene buena calidad de imagen y efectos, muy fácil de entender apropiada para la gran mayoría de publico"
"Jan 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Godzilla: Minus One proves just how solid direction and a darker tone on a character as old as him, can still be entertaining and thrilling after all these years.

The movie exceeds in it's visuals and atmosphere to sell you on the setting of a Post-War Japan which is now under threat of a greater evil. When Godzilla is on the screen the scenes are great, they're engaging and tense which is exactly what you want with a movie like this. Alongside with a set of characters with some decently good performances to boot.

Where this movie lacks, is the character development being quite minimal for everyone besides the central character. This isn't an automatic issue, but these additional side characters felt more like props to the main character rather than individuals with their own morales and personalities. It comes across as the movie as a whole contains only 3 characters, Shikishima (the main character), the side characters and Godzilla.

Godzilla just being a force of nature with a clear murderous intent to cause death and destruction everywhere he goes, it's shallow but works for the style of character he plays in the movie. And the side characters play nothing more than the prop that pushes Shikishima forward. There's some small exceptions to this but they're never shown more than a few minutes of screentime and automatically conclude with blending into the same formula everyone else plays into. It's extremely jarring how lacking these side characters feel, when we get so many scenes around them. 

This added onto how predictable and cliché the movie ends, if you knew how it was going to end when watching you were likely correct. It doesn't ruin the experience and I'll happily rewatch it when it gets posted on streaming or a physical copy release. However the movie had so much potential to be so much more, yet ended up being a pretty inoffensive and by the books movie.

One which I'm happy people enjoy, but I think after almost 70 years. We deserve so much better."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"A story about love, loss & redemption. You wouldn’t think I’d be talking about a Godzilla movie but indeed we are. Godzilla returns and this time he’s menacing, terrifying and absolutely unstoppable. An extraordinary film that taps into the heart of what it means to be courageous in our darkest hour. Extremely well developed characters that take us on this journey, often times forgetting we’re watching a Godzilla movie. Incredible scenes of destruction balanced with an emotional story and unforgettable characters."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic Film all around!
The soundtrack is great as is the drama and CGI.
The low budget is incredible considering the movie's quality."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Godzilla minus one is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life easily 5 stars.
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Best film of 2023 & it’s not even close
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Minus one is a masterpiece. 

It stands right along other greats like Shin, 84, and Biollante. The characters are well written and do a great job of grounding the story. Goji is definitely CGI, but he looks scarier than ever before. The effects were good (not as polished as the Legendary movies) as was the story. It is 100% too scary for most kids under 12, for any parents wondering. 

This will be a day one 4k purchase for me. Do yourself a favor and see it as soon as you can."
"Jan 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,I really like the movie although very predictable ending. It was well made BUT the movie was way too LOUD. Its one full day later and my ears hurt. Why was it so loud. It was not worth it to watch the movie with the pain it has caused my ears.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Buena pelicula. Recomendo.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"es súper emocionante y sensacional ver este tipo de películas ya que es un verdadero espectáculo para los fanáticos, entretiene demasiado, una película muy buena🤩"
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla era!
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie perfectly gets the nostalgic feeling I got from watching the old Godzilla movies, paired it with well shown storytelling and depiction of of the effect WW2 ad PTSD had on soldiers, especially Japanese.
The 98% rating of this movie (at this point) is quite spot on for me. This movie was perfect, up until the end, where I stopped liking it as much - at least until I get to see a possible sequel.
Still, besides me not liking the ending as much, I really really liked the movie and it totally scratched that Godzilla-itch I have had."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Me pareció una excelente película buenos elogios a su productora espero sigan haciendo películas con ese realismo y así podamos los espectadores seguir admirando su trabajo bien hecho me encanto
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie eloquently brings in characters that make you care; the story and plot Of the movie is amazing and it makes you feel absorbed in the movie, and other than that it looks amazing!"
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla es eterno y continúa regresando por más pase lo que pase.esta película es un recordatorio de lo arrogantes que somos  los humanos y de cómo creemos  que podemos conquistar la naturaleza o hacerle cosas sin consecuencias. Pero también son un ciclo de la vida y de cómo en realidad pasamos por altibajos que vuelven en 
nuestra contra cuando menos lo esperamos."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023 by far. And top 10 godzilla movie ever.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Definitely a fun watch.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Spectacular! Must see! Totally legit and fresh retelling.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie!!!!

How did they pull this off with a 15m budget? The SFX is superb, and the storytelling is perfect, you root for humans in this monster film...Am I watching Godzilla???

Hollywood take note, gloves have been thrown!!! Just TRY and top this production with such a meager budget!!!"
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie gripped me and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. A refreshing take on Godzilla
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely riveting and so much heart!  Best movie I've seen in a very long time!
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Matinee with my wife.  Really enjoyed the movie. I have to agree that the people that say this is the best Godzilla movie of the bunch.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"The king returns for his 37th feature film in this stunning masterpiece that reflects on the issues of honor, sacrifice, and the horrors of war."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE IS AWSOME DEFFENITLY RECCOMEND IT
"Jan 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was subtitled, but had a good storyline.  Godzilla is not in it very much but when he is, it's very exciting and the same theme song plays which we loved!"
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'm no critic, but, I love a good movie and this one has me writing about it. Absolutely amazing movie, and they made that monster so monstrously destructive, and despicable. I hate Godzilla all over again. I can't wait to see some other monster come punch him in his heat ray spewing face.  Oh yeah, the music is fantastic! I think Godzilla wrote it for himself; wouldn't put it past that pompous city stomper. I'm on Japans side when it comes to Godzilla, and that's not my Prius talking. ""F"" that irradiated lizard-they can't find an ocean deep enough to bury him in."
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story. Kept to the true Japanese classic with phenomenal performance by all Japanese cast. The film score was amazing and Godzilla was so real.
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Godzilla minus one was fine if u wanted a emotional war drama, but i think anyone who likes godzilla for being godzilla is there for monster stuff not human drama, literally no new grounds being made on the titled character of the franchise instead we got 2 hours of some dude being sad, after shin Godzilla and that cliff hanger getting this movie feels like i died inside. TAT"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Wonderful character development and cinematic realism.   I loved this movie!
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Excelente película recomendada

"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie of all time with fantastic visuals, characters that we care about, and great Godzilla action"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"El impresionante Godzilla Minus One de Takashi Yamazaki es el espectáculo más grandioso del año, mezclado con el análisis sobrio de Japón de los horrores de la guerra y las piezas de esa atrocidad que colectivamente poseen."
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente, la recomiendo"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me parece genial esta nueva adaptación de godzilla, super entretenida y con mucho suspenso además de la trama que me lleva a querer verla completamente, una obra de arte para el cine de estos tiempos donde hay muchas ideas nuevas."
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"me parece una excelente pelicula, muy buena para disfrutar en familia, con un gran guion, muy recomendada"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,La película es muy buena el desarrollo de la trama se va desenvolviendo muy bien y lo atrae a uno desde la primera parte
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie Ive ever seen!!!!!
They just blew every American made Godzilla movie out 
Of the water. Showing that in the words of late James Brown 
 often imitated but never duplicated"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Oppenheimer and THEN watch GMinus One.
Movie of the year... That's all i got to say"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"""I got a friend request, we talked for a few hours and when I found out he was a fraud, I ignored all his messages. I honestly wouldn't have suspected him if not for the exposure of a professional hacker whom I hired after realizing my Bitcoin wallet had been emptied. I sincerely don't know how, or why these fraudsters operate and if they know the pain and trauma they cause in the lives of their victims. When I found my wallet had been emptied, I nearly had a cardiac arrest, I am a 58-year-old taxi driver and I need money now more than ever. I resolved to find ways to recover the stolen money and that's when I found Cyber Genie Recovery Expert, These guys used their wild tech skills to help me trace and recover all that was stolen from me within a short period I hired them. I was really patient and understanding with them because, after a few sessions, I began to have my doubts, during these trial moments, Cyber Genie's team was very persuasive and encouraging. I am glad my doubts and fears never won because the recovery was a success at last. All hopes lost were restored, stolen money recovered, and created a lifetime relationship with Cyber Genie's team.

"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Great storyline. Made me cry at the end- I enjoyed it!
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Didn't like the movie, was in Japanese and had subtitles. I actually fell asleep but my grandson and his friend liked it and that's all that mattered since I took them to watch it as they were on winter break from school."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Godzilla Minus One is perhaps the best Godzilla movie that I have ever seen. The monster parts are vicious.
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is an unexpectedly amazing film with deep character and story development. While you want to see Godzilla decimate cities and wreak havoc, those types of scenes are used sparingly in Minus One. However, when Godzilla makes appearances , it has maximum impact. Less is definitely more. The human characters and stories are the heart of this film, which truly make it stand out. It is a story of survival, rebuilding, gaining hope and losing hope. It is also a movie about PTSD, relationships, and camaraderie and altruism. Godzilla just happens to be the antagonist and an excellent one at that. Go see it, even if you're not a monster movie/Godzilla fan. You will not be disappointed unless you have absolutely no empathy or feelings. The acting, character development, and story are that damn good. With a budget of 15 million, this movie easily equals and easily surpasses many Hollywood blockbusters with 200 million dollar budgets or more."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely spectacular!! Seriously. But I have to include a warning: this is NOT classic Godzilla. He’s scary as hell!! Think twice before bringing your children to the theater to see this, because more than a few parents had to escort their crying kids out of the showing I was at!"
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Shikishima, a failed kamikaze pilot, struggles to come to terms with his cowardice and building a life in bomb damaged Tokyo.   Godzilla doesn't help.

This is what I've wanted every time they announced a new Godzilla film.   And they always failed me.   The series of silly heroic Godzilla films of the 60s and 70s were entertaining as a kid, but when I was older I realized what a quality film the original was.    This film honors that initial portrayal and instead of giving us lackluster humans we don't care about (such as in the recent US films) we are given sincere portrayals representing citizens and soldiers to which we can relate.   Found family.  Survivor's guilt.   Hope.  Redemption.  These themes are explored in such a way we are made part of the characters' journeys.  

Highly recommended

There is a mid credits scene"
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall best Godzilla to date clever reboot of the original, and best human acting of the franchise."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Brilliant in every aspect. That Godzilla is a true monster, and you do now want to mess with it because it does not give a damn about humans at all. The movie keeps its speed and tension from the very beginning to the very end. Worth every penny."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Espectacular.la mejor película de godzilla de la historia.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Simplesmente fantástico.
Um verdadeira obra de arte. 
Uma verdadeira aula de como fazer um filme 
Sobre Godzilla. 
Sem dúvidas é o melhor Filme sobre o Godzilla de todos os tempos.
Espero que Hollywood aprenda como se faz."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,The Best Godzilla movie ever made and one of the best MOVIES ever made.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is the best movie I have seen. I've seen it 17 times now and I never get tired of it. In fact, every time I see it, I feel a new meaning. The powerful VFX are worthy of an Academy Award. It will always be a masterpiece among masterpieces and will continue to impress future generations."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Cuenta con una trama increíble, y el desarrollo de la película tiene un buen suseso"
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una gran película me gustó bastante tiene unos grandes efectos sin duda un 10/10
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Una pelicula sorprendente con grandes efectos y un gran guion completamente recomendada
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Excelente película recomendad
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,This film got me crying like a baby. 100% the best film of all time ( in my opinion). Makes other movie studios look bad with the 15 million dollar budget.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Quite honestly the most engaging film I saw from 2023. An extremely character driven movie with likeable and interesting characters who's motives made you feel the hate they had for Godzilla. This was a monster movie done and executed to perfection with a small budget. It has been a phenomenal year for movies and this was the cherry on top. I hope to see more quality films like this in the future.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Actually makes Godzilla scary!
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"The superb story, and a film that makes Godzilla scary as hell!"
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Great screenplay and acting. Good balance between Godzilla wreaking habit and the story of the new little family. Special effects and soundtrack were great. Best movie of the year.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever. It was terrifying. All the characters were great and likable. Story was good.  5/5. Would like to see this adaption to continue on in future movies.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"The action, the drama, the destruction!! Everything about this movie was just perfect to me!!"
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie overall and the best of all the Godzilla movies including the Hollywood movies, great combination between a good human stories and the monster attacking, love it."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Saw this opening night. What can I say that everyone hast said already. Go watch this!
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have not gone back to the theater to see a movie a second time since The Dark Knight Returns.  Godzilla Minus One is an incredible film on trauma, life, and humanity.  A must-see!"
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I have seen in years.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Best godzilla movie since the 70s.  It's a must see for godjira fans.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,a compelling human story that is also true to the original Godzilla movies. best movie I've seen in quite some time
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!!! Best Godzilla to date!!!
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,awesome movie from start to finish
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Impressionante...
Ótimo roteiro. A história foi bem elaborada.
E um Godzilla dentro da realidade, (Apesar de gostar muito do Godzilla vs Kong). 
E um núcleo humano que nos cativa e emociona ao mesmo tempo."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie looks great especially considering the budget.  Fun film about humanity working together to overcome their past miatakes
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Not just another Godzilla movie.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"TRUE KINO!
It made me feel like I was having my first cinematic experience again.
Riddled with subtle references to previous films and Godzilla media, and incredible direction. I have only minor quibbles with any of the editing decisions but those pale in comparison with the excellent story telling, acting (splendid Toshiro Mifune tribute from at least one of the actors), and impeccable slapstick timing. The new Godzilla design is simply stunning - you can tell they based it off an actual bipedal dinosaur because of the way his head bobs when he walks. The closest thing to a perfect movie I have watched in a very, very long time."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Easily the best Godzilla movie ever made. The storyline was compelling and the character development was excellent. The special effects were perfect. This is a really great movie.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic ending, no more monsters. Japan has had enough."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great acting. A story about humans and their relationships.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great gojira movie. Could've been more bloody and a little less cliché, but nothing that disgrace the movie"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pleasant surprise! I couldn't be less interested in Godzilla, but I loved it. Great character story. Action sequences were refreshingly brief, in a time where most action movies over-do it (looking at you, Marvel). I don't need to see monsters or superheroes crash through CGI buildings for 30+ minutes per scene."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story - loved it!
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is an up close and personal story of a war survivor who's ability to fight his demos is repeatedly wrecked by Godzilla until the guy totally loses it.  And it's not your dad's Godzilla, this one is meaner and more powerful than all others.  Well written, well acted, beautifully presented."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Más que un homenaje a la película original, es una reimaginacion con una gran y sólida historia que conmueve y te hace empalizar con los personajes, excelentes efectos especiales, se necesitan más obras con el corazón que tiene esta película en ella y en los que la hicieron."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,A return to the beginning - A well crafted update of the original film. Leagues ahead of the drivel churned out by hollywood.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I’ve ever seen 
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"A monster movie with fully developed characters, a fresh and interesting plot, and a kick-ass monster. If only they were still making this kind of movie in Hollywood, I wouldn't have had to read English sub-titles. That said, the film was so engrossing that I soon forgot that I was reading."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story!  Great character development!  Great visuals!  It should win awards!!!!
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great plot to accompany the normal destruction from Godzilla
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"The story was very good, very moving.  Never thought to understand what it was like in Japan after WW2"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great story and plot, great characters and you feel a lot of affection for the characters. For a low quality budget movie its a masterpiece."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"If you like epic kind of monster movies, I totally recommend this one. I think this one is so much better than hollywood-made kitsch films."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Despite not being familiar enough with Japanese it keeps you hooked to read the subtitles for the entire runtime which this is what I'd say is an average runtime but it uses its time incredibly well, more than anything, this truly puts the majority of at least the last decade of movies from Hollywood to shame.

Every element about a movie that matters is most excellent, it does an excellent job at especially highlighting the burden/shame and pain that Shikishima carries, the human cost of everything involved leading up to Japan's surrender in WW2 and to experience catastrophe from a new threat. However, on the opposite side of this rhetorical coin, is Godzilla. The way I understood him, their monster, their villain... was primarily two fold, one where I can feel sympathy for him but one where I also dislike him for the destruction he does, and his seeming lack of awareness or concern for the damage he's causing."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I came into this one not knowing what to expect. Never saw a Godzilla film before this and I felt like this would be a Jurassic World type film but with another monster. Man I was wrong. This film had pretty much nothing that I could point out that was done poorly. Everything felt just right. 10/10!"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Wow! Easily the best Godzilla movie ever made. It was like all of the Godzillas combined. Also it was a good storyline even if you took Godzilla out of the movie
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely awesome! Very well done.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie to date!
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Am I the only one who thought this movie fell flat? As interesting as his background was, the main protagonist was hard to root for. Plot was predictable, wasn't very clever. Cut out all the scenes without Godzilla, and i would've left much happier. Sigh, I really wanted to like this one."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"The story is superb and very engaging even if you have no interest in the movie monster part of it! I enjoyed the acting and thought it was beautifully shot as well. Godzilla was pretty scary, too! But it was the relationships between the groups of guy friend and the ones with Koichi and his found family that made it a great afternoon at the movies."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story. Awesome camera angles. Great looking old school Godzilla. See it before it leaves theaters as it is a definite must see in the theater.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best films I’ve seen
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was really entertaining, and godzilla……holy cow i love his atomic breath. It really showed me that you can do different things with godzilla. This is a must see movie!"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not only is Godzilla Minus One a spectacular monster movie, but it also manages to cross genres and give us an excellent World War II movie. Told from the perspective of characters grappling with the aftermath of WWII, over the course of the story they struggle to find their place during the period of Japanese reconstruction. How can life ever return to some semblance of normal with cities in ruins, families destroyed, and a new threat already on the horizon? The story is heartfelt and surprisingly moving. By the end you care so much for the lives of the characters, lending refreshing gravity to the threat of the monster. This is my favorite movie of 2023 by a long shot, highly recommend checking it out."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla since the original.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,A return to the classic style of Godzilla. Excellent movie.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,So much better than all the American versions
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,My favorite film of 2023. Good plot. Good acting. Good themes.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Just one word.  A M A Z I N G ! ! !
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,I really like the movie love the Godzilla great movie I recommend
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Good modern take on the cheesy old movies from Japan. Full of emotion and drama. Only negatives were some of the plot holes
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,This is the best movie of the year!!!
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the best films I've ever seen in the cinema, from the trailer you could see that the film would be good, but it far exceeded expectations"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Surprisingly enjoyable.   The subtitles did not bother me at all
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pinche película toda hermosa,hay que verla de nuevo,hablando enserio la película es una obra de arte la recomiendo 100% si eres o no fan de godzilla."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked that at every part of the movie I was constantly entertained. The climax ending was amazing as well.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was absolutely amazing!!! Everything about the movie was spot on!!! A must see!!
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"This throwback to the origins of the Gojira legend leaves every Hollywood version in the radioactive dust.
Cloverfield is the only American monster movie that comes close in terms of emotional resonance, but even that relied heavily on narrative gimmickry.
What makes Godzilla Minus One stand out so much is good old fashioned storytelling. While it takes it's time establishing it's characters and setting, it never drags due to the standard of writing and acting. This milieu of people eking out an existence in post-war Tokyo is interesting enough without a monster attack, so when the carnage does start, we genuinely care about these characters.
If only Hollywood could put away their DEI manuals and concentrate on good writing like this, the cineplexes wouldn't be clogged with so many empty spectacles."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Exactly what I wanted going in. I kept myself from watching any trailer or synopsis.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,A fantastic movie!  You're cheering for Godzilla and cheering for the better people as well.   Great story telling!  The characters are relatable and you feel for them. It's nice to see Godzilla back.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever!
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"As someone who despises the Godzilla films of Legendary from the past few years, this was refreshing as heck. The humans actually feel important, and they make actually logical decisions on how to handle said kaiju, and have proper character development. The writing in monsterverse was abnormally stupid, I must admit (they had a kaiju-destroying bomb but they preferred to abduct kong from his natural habitat and destroyed a whole city, like what?), but it's good to see that the humans here actually seem like they're doing what they can as they learn about Godzilla, and the post-war storyline behind the movie was done very well. The only downside to this movie would be that Godzilla, as a CGI monster, had very blocky movements at points when the shots were afar, and the water CGI was also a bit meh, but to be fair, its budget was 15M, which is especially impressive since Godzilla vs Kong was literally 10x that much and it was pretty bad."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One was such a wonderful surprise of a movie. I went with my 13 year old twin boys and even they loved the emotional storyline and the suspense in addition to Godzilla destroying things, which is really what they came to see! The subtitles did not get in the way of enjoying this movie. You didnt even notice it because the acting, story and action were just so captivating. I also thought that the innovative and scientific way they came up with trying to defeat Godzilla was so refreshing and a welcome intellectual departure from just using guns and bombs, which is typically what you see with monster movies. You will not be disappointed. And the orchestral classical musical score was so outstanding! Its what made the suspenseful parts suspenseful and was the perfect complement to the magnitude of this movie. The score was even something you would want to listen to on its own. Hands down, the best movie Ive seen in a long time and unquestionably the best movie of the year. Bravo Godzilla Minus One! Bravo."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Better than I was expecting. This was a compelling story with characters I cared about. Godzilla -1 went well beyond the standard monster vs the good guys flick. No bs western preaching. Just a good story.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Gets back to the simplicity of storytelling and less on special effects. Hollywood needs to take notes and apply this formula to American films.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Godzilla stayed true to the original version.  One of the best Godzilla's Ive ever seen.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Una carta de amor a la franquicia.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was such a great movie I'd highly recommend this movie for everyone to watch. it's not just a monster/action movie, the story telling in this movie is so great!"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,This is a really enjoyable movie as it's well balanced. There was just the right amount of everything.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was great it sets it up to bring Godzilla back to his original roots and it had a perfect mix of characters and had a very interesting story to tell
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,I cannot say enough good things about this movie! It is the best movie of 2023 hands-down.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,i dont understand why this moving is getting high ratings. Both wife and i hated it. B moving at best. Lost of over acting and moving was not in English.  Bottom line not worth it.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,1 of the best movies I've seen in many moons.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Love. Absolutely loved it. And I have never seen a Godzilla movie before - clips and bits and pieces but never a full film. I am gobsmacked that I loved it so much. I would see it again. Loved the characters. Superb acting. Fantastic videography. Wow.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Who knew a monster movie can have so much heart! I may or may not have cried at the end of the movie. 10 out of 10 would recommend! 🥹
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"For the first time in my Godzilla viewing history, I was genuinely sucked in by the character arc of the humans and their many challenges in living while such an ever-present threat (Godzilla) is looming over them. I consider this the best Godzilla movie of all time, and a great movie outside of that franchise as well. Watch as soon as you can."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,It renewed my faith of going to the movies!
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is by far the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen! It's not just about the battle with Godzilla, there is a major subplot involving characters that you truly grow to care about. It's very well done all around!"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,It was so good! Really fun movie. We all loved it. The character's storylines were heartfelt/engaging while still getting plenty of Godzilla. Definitely worth a watch and a rewatch.
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film is just a masterpiece! It's like the creators of this film is proving you don't need 100's of millions of bucks to make a movie with this films budget, and godzilla, he was in the film enough, and the human character were better in this film than what the monsterverse is bring out! This has got to be the best godzilla film in history!"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"My son & I loved the movie! Didn't mind the subtitles! Lots of scary suspense, drama and action. Also liked the part of Japan's history of tragic loss and regret during WWII. Great special effects and Godzilla at his scariest dark side! Japan is 1 again at making Godzilla movies!!!"
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Almost perfect , beautiful story of redemption and perseverance!"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great character development, subtitles are easy to read. Really enjoyed this take on Godzilla."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely emotionally amazing. A must watch for any Kaiju fan and a great movie for anyone.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Best monster film ever.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Thoroughly entertaining and thoughtful at the same time. Godzilla never looked better!
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie to date! Before the movie came out, my favorite Godzilla movie was Godzilla vs. Kong. When the first teaser for minus one came out, I was so excited to finally see a new Godzilla movie! Also, keep an eye out for Godzilla x Kong the New Empire releasing this year!"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,This was way better than I expected
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"After the 1954 film (Gojira) and the 2016 film (Shin Godzilla), this film closes a ""trilogy"" of good Godzilla films. Between very interesting characters and a new story, this film throws real spears at very important issues for Japan, such as war, honor, death. A gripping plot which will quickly make anyone fall in love with this film"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Unexpectedly, great! Intense, epic, and refreshing. A lot more genuineness to godzilla and focus was placed on human characters, and very well done so. A complete and strong recommendation for this fantastic film!"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es una película muy buena, algo muy disfrutable en el cine, los personajes humanos tienen buen desarrollo y godzilla tiene buen diseño y buen uso del cgi que lo hace parecer real en muchos escenarios, en mi opinión es de las mejores peliculas de godzilla"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is a masterpiece of writing and storytelling. The water looked a bit off but the rest was amazing. The ways it implies it's messages of war, love, the japaneses gov, it's very good, the passing was very good could be a bit faster. The ending kinda angered me a little bit, but it was still good all in all 9.5\10"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Can’t stop thinking about the historical story and symbolism. Unexpectedly wonderful story.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I have ever seen.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you liked Jaws, you will like this, the pacing, the development of the people, echos Jaws."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not only does the movie tell a touching, meaningful story about humanity, sacrifice and will to live, but it is also a wildly entertaining Godzilla movie. The monster is extremely menacing and terrifying, which is surprising considering the really low budget. The movie is a masterpiece and it should be watched by everyone interested in both blockbusters and more artistic cinema."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting , typical japonese exaggerated performance . Not sure why it got over 90% rating . Are all good movies gone that we’re into something mediocre like this ?"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story.. movie flowed nicely throughout.. human story and monster story combined to perfection.. Well done and Refreshing from most of the garbage out there now!!!
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a owesome movie, but the half of this onel is just boooored! But they make up for it with the appearance of Godzilla!"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,It was fantastic even with the subtitles. It had a great story line and also great scenes with godzilla.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Story Line and Excellent Film Quality! I advise everyone to see it!
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,I love foreign films. It was nice to see this one from Japan. It was WAY too loud!
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved the old school feel and show how Godzilla become strong each time it gets hurt
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wow… an absolute amazing film… It has drama, action, suspense, and everything you could ever want in a movie. Unlike other Godzilla movies this one focuses more on the human characters rather than the monsters themselves."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"The best movie of 2023!!! A true example of what going to the movie theater is all about. Simply the best Godzilla movie out there. With much respect to the 1954 film, this is the best Godzilla and Movie of 2023! You have to go to the movie theater to really enjoy it and the art of it. A must see movie on everyone's bucket list."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic Movie! My all time favorite Godzilla movie! Now THATS a scary monster!
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent special effects
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This version was much more centered around the human characters and human drama.  The creature was a device to move those stories along, rather than being the complete story itself.  It also kept essential elements of the ""tradition"", including some of the drama-building music.  Extremely well done!"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I had never seen a Godzilla movie before. This was a fantastic time! Good action, great effects, good story, characters you care about."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,ONE OF THE BEST GODZILLA FILMS. FANTASTIC REITERATION OF THE ORIGINAL DEFINITELY A MUST SEE I WILL ADMIT THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES ARE SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATED BUT FIRE FUCKING MOVIE
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Way better than I was expecting it to be. Great emotion. I was a bit disappointed with the very end though.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Esta película es una de las mejores formas que pudieron adaptar a la semejanza las películas antiguas Japonesas de Gojira, no deja nada que desear y aunque hay personas que les resulta rara la actuación o la historia recordemos que es Cine Japones y es tan fiel como las antiguas producciones cinematográficas de Gojira versión Japonesa de Toho, sinceramente una joya que si no fuera por ciertas partes de la pelirroja que se vieron un poco forzadas esta película (si eres fanático de TODOS los filmes de Godzilla) podría decir que no te dejara con sed de mas, actuación y apartado grafico de primera, Banda sonora es la original y hermosa un gran acierto, escenografía excelente, diseño de Godzilla increíble, recomendable para personas que les interese la acción, dramaturgia, y Godzilla"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Must watch for all fans of Godzilla
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,The monster was incredible for a guy in a rubber suite! Special effects were top drawer .
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"What an incredible film. Fantastic pacing, never really slows down right from the opening. You definitely don’t have to be a monster movie/Godzilla fan to enjoy this. "
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is everything a Godzilla movie should be about. Calamity, disaster, hopelessness. Loved every moment of this film and I'm definitely seeing it for a 2nd viewing with my dad who is a massive fan of the Original ‘54 film!!!"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Godzilla is of the japanese, undoubtedly. Nobody like them to make movies about the famous, feared and beloved monster. An interesting story based on the human characters, not the monster, with a good development, and technically magnificent. Not any signs of CGI, a very natural aspect of the VFX. Also a very early showing of Godzilla in the very first minutes of the film, which I saw as a good thing"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best movie of the year!  Yes, a Godzilla movie can be THAT GOOD!  The human story is so good I was in tears, and the monster was better than it has ever been!  There has never been a monster movie this good, and the fact that it was better than any other movie this year, is mind boggling!  Go see it on the big screen while you still can!"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"The first Godzilla movie, from 1954, depicts a post-war Japan devastated by war and nuclear bombs.
""Godzilla Minus One"" takes place mostly in the late 1940's Japan and plays on the same theme. In fact, Minus One borrows heavily from the early Godzilla movies, and its great.

The protagonist, Kōichi Shikishima played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, is ridden with survivor's guilt. He's kind of mopey and somewhat dislikable. It begs the question of whether, we as an audience, should appreciate his yearning for a heroic sacrifice. On the other hand, the movie's heartwarming qualities comes from the supporting cast, humanizing the victims of this new threat.

Beyond its visuals, themes, and great soundtrack, ""Godzilla Minus One"" managed something amazing; It rejects traditionalistic values and brilliantly exclude any involvement from the military or the government from the problem solving. 

Most definitely one the best movie in the franchise, if not of the whole genre."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"I did enjoy the movie, even though it was in Japanese.  I did not like that I had to read to understand the movie"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was amazing to watch, it always had me on edge. I also prefer that it is in Japanese with English subtitles."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,A must see movie for all ages both emotional and heart stopping great story....it's just Godzilla with his mayhem
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This is an excellent movie. It avoids all the cliché stuff that you see in Hollywood productions of Godzilla movies. Great development of characters and you never know the fate of certain characters. The only minor gripe is the slow pacing in certain places. Overall a great change to how a Godzilla movie was made compare to U.S. ones.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"A fantastic drama with compelling character development and emotion, with the Godzilla action and spectacle being the cherry on top."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"A well-written, powerfully-acted, emotionally-gripping historical drama... that happens to have a nuclear-powered dinosaur in it!"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"The action, the story, the setting, the characters, the emotion. Well rounded film that over performed any expectations I had going in. This is the best Godzilla film I've seen and I've seen many."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic! The story was engaging and it took the viewer through a range of emotions...empathy, fear, honor, love.  It showed the power of ordinary citizens when they unite for a cause."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was arguably the most predictable movie I've ever seen. Halfway through the movie I could tell you exactly how it was going to end, and knowing how it was going to end made the lead up to the final scene a complete slog. They spent way too much time building up to a climax that everyone in the theater knew was coming. It's like the script was written by an AI who had spent the last 10 years learning all the action movie cliches. I had really high hopes and walked out feeling like I had wasted two hours seeing a movie I'd already seen a hundred times before."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"As a fan of the MonsterVerse films, this is everything that I have been missing and so much more. Going into it I knew the Godzilla aspect of the film would be wonderful, but the emotional depth and tone of the story made for such a captivating film. My only problem with this sort of film is the redundant nature of making up a new way to kill Godzilla and Godzilla being able to withstand it. With that being said, it was better that the film was mainly, human, character development led. The interconnectivity between the visuals and the story made for a smooth 2 hour runtime that keeps you entertained the whole time. Moreover, the fact that the film was created with just $15 million is absolutely insane and you could tell so much effort/work was put into the final product to create an enjoyable fan experience. Basically, it was a lot more meaningful/heavy (in terms of subject matter) than I was expecting it to be and I'm ashamed I waited so long to see it!"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent movie!  Story and Characters were all done perfectly.  Godzilla’s effects were amazing. We can only hope more Godzilla movies will continue with such attention to the details that result in such excellent storytelling.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Great attention to detail and honored the original!
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2023, a classic."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was asked to join friends, so I bought 2 tickets and took my son with me. I was not aware that the entire movie was in Japanese with English subtitles. My son does not read fast enough to keep up with the subtitles, and I could not read them to him out of respect for the other movie goers around us. This made it less enjoyable for both of us.  The movie itself was OK, but not great."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"It’s Godzilla, what’s not to like about it! Characters, the same/original (ok a little updated with the nuclear blasts) beast and the storyline was great. The original score from the old movies was nice to hear. Reminded me of watching them with my family when I was growing up."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Emotional roller-coaster,  human survival against surmountable odds. Realistic view on what PTSD can do to a person. I've watched Godzilla movies since the original with Burr, this one by far is the most terrifying. The casting fit like a puzzle. Must see!"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023.   See it on the big screen when you can!
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing human characters and story versus a truly terrifying Godzilla.  Captures everything that made the very first Godzilla a huge hit while making you care about the plot and drama encircling the monster.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever!   Must See
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve seen in a while
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One: A Thrilling Cinematic Experience!""

""Godzilla Minus One"" is an exhilarating cinematic journey that captivates audiences with its stunning visuals, powerful storytelling, and mesmerizing action sequences. As a devoted fan of the Godzilla franchise, I was thrilled to witness this latest installment that takes the beloved giant monster saga to new heights.

What sets ""Godzilla Minus One"" apart is its ability to balance the awe-inspiring spectacle of colossal battles with a poignant and compelling narrative. The filmmakers have masterfully crafted a storyline that not only showcases epic showdowns between larger-than-life creatures but also delves into the emotional depth of the characters involved.

The special effects in this film are nothing short of phenomenal. The CGI work is seamlessly integrated, bringing the monstrous creatures to life in a breathtakingly realistic manner. Every clash, roar, and destruction scene is delivered with such detail and grandeur that it immerses the audience in the heart of the action.

Furthermore, the cast's performances are commendable, with each actor bringing authenticity and depth to their respective roles. The human element in the film is as crucial as the giant creatures themselves, adding layers of emotion and empathy that resonate throughout the storyline.

The pacing of ""Godzilla Minus One"" is another aspect worth praising. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, delivering adrenaline-pumping sequences while also allowing moments of quiet reflection, creating a perfect balance between excitement and contemplation.

I also appreciate how the film pays homage to the classic Godzilla legacy while infusing fresh and innovative elements into the narrative. It's a testament to the filmmakers' dedication to honoring the franchise's roots while offering something new and captivating for both longtime fans and newcomers alike.

In conclusion, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is a triumphant addition to the Godzilla series that exceeds expectations on multiple fronts. With its remarkable visuals, engaging storyline, and heartfelt performances, it's a must-watch for anyone seeking a thrilling cinematic experience. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or simply a lover of epic monster movies, this film delivers on all fronts and leaves a lasting impression that won't soon be forgotten."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Kept you on your toes the whole time and it was just the right amount of cheesiness without overdoing it. It made you scared of Godzilla and how indestructible it could be. Main characters were very likable too! 100% recommend!!
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"I didnt realize it was subtitled when I bought the tickets. 
However, it was a decent movie."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,MADE FOR THE BIG SCREEN WATCH IT WHEN YOU CAN
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Is the ending really necessary? I personally think not. Other than that the movie is great
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla move ever and I have been watching Godzilla movies since the early 60's.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Simply put, the best one yet."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the first time I can remember caring about the humans in a Godzilla movie, even more than Godzilla himself. The movie is in Japanese with English subtitles, which I prefer over a quick English dubbing that would take me out of the movie. I loved the movie watching it, and I love it more the longer I think on it—for a film made with about $15 million alone, it's made an impact on me I think will stick, much more than the usual blockbusters boasting a massive pricetag."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve seen in years !!!!!
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This was a good movie
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla ever done!!!
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,First Godzilla film I've seen since I was a kid. Great action blended with some touching human stories and an interesting setting in post-WW2 Japan. A nice start to my cinema going in 2024.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Carta de amor al genero y a su estilo depresivo. Ninguna película de la saga te hace simpatizar tanto con los personajes como esta, además, no es necesario reconocer los orígenes del monstruo para entender u comprender la trama. Pseudo-homenaje a la película original, consciente de sus limitaciones (Presupuesto) ha HUMILLADO a películas actuales desde Hollywood. Atrapante, Inmenso, Sanguinario, Drama total. Es una película de godzilla PURA."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Lots of thrills and a beautiful ending.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Two words... Absolutely, Astounding!!!!.... This movie in my very honest opinion, is hands down THE BEST Godzilla movie I've ever seen. My brother and I grew up watching Godzilla back in the early 90s. We decided to go see this one for our birthday Saturday, and we were blown away!!! Godzilla was honestly terrifying in such a believable way! And his gamma ray?... it made the atom bomb look like a tiny splash in a lake 😆. But really, the best thing about this movie was the human aspect of it.. I can't remember the last time I cried watching a movie since ""the green mile"".. I sat through the whole ending credits to give respect to every single person who had a hand to play in this masterpiece! I'd give it a 10/10 if I could! If you've not seen this movie, go now! I can't wait till this comes out on dvd"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Felt like a fresh breath of air as the film makers took this subject as a serious disaster movie.  Though slow as times, I appreciated the human story in this one.  Yes Godzilla at one point seem to just float upright in the ocean but them's the breaks."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"An absolute triumph of movie making!
This is so much more than a Godzilla film.
It's hard to believe the human story could overshadow the monster but it does.
BTW, it's clear that Godzilla does not skip leg day, but he does skip arm day. 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"A fabulous Godzilla movie.  Grounded characters that you care about, tremendous Godzilla action with a portrayal of G that hews true to Godzilla as nearly unstoppable force of nature.  Tremendous use of the classic Godzilla musical scores and a wonderful look at post war Japan.  This is monster movie and human movie and is just an outstanding job from Toho."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Such a great movie, sent chills down my spine and brought tears to my eyes"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have watched this movie twice and it was so amazing. As a huge Godzilla fan, this is one of my favourite movies ever made. Considering the budget is only $15 million, the visual effects was incredible. Easily best movie of 2023."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Awesome special effects, touching story & smart script. Easily one of the best movie in last decades."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,The BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER MADE!!! EXCELLENT JAPANESE PRODUCTION!!!
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can't wait to watch this movie again. Action, drama, raw emotions, and a little comic relief. Now that's a movie. Hollywood needs to take notes. A lot of them. 
And the ending was perfect. They left it open for a sequel."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was good but attended because of my grandsons ages 5 and 7 love Godzilla movies.  The closed captions and Japanese language was a big negative.  Would have been nice to add English language.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,It's the best movie that I've seen in cinema 2023. Absolutely gonna buy this on 4k bluray when it gets out! An absolute masterpiece.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Even with subtitles this is one of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen. It was absolutely great, a must see. Excellent story and cinematography, its simply what you go to movies for."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is not a Godzilla film in the way I think most people will assume it to be. It is an examination of grief, sacrifice, and perseverance in the years immediately following the devastation experienced in post WWII Japan... and Godzilla. 

That's absolutely a reductionist view of the titular monster; he is the physical representation of the evil of man that would bring about such devastation against whom the humans must defeat for hope, not only in survival but in a better world, to possibly be restored. 

Ok, that might be too lofty a description also, but frankly, it's hard to find the words to accurately describe this film and all that it achieved. I am not a Godzilla fan. I've seen the newer ones and they're ok. The idea of a giant ramping monster especially once it starts fighting other rampaging monsters always sounded silly to me. I understand its origins were born in making sense of the horrors of the atomic bomb and fears for humanity after its creation, but mostly its appeal has been extremely limited for me, especially after 1998. I'm sorry but ew. 

BUT. 

Godzilla Minus One is just a GOOD F***ING FILM. I cannot say enough good things about it. It is 100,000% worth paying to see in the theater, and there's just not a lot of movies out these days that you can really say that for. It truly deserves more than just an Oscar for best VFX which it has been nominated for. Writing, directing, cinematography/art direction, best actor, and yes best film. 

Go see it in theaters now while you can."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome!!!!! Best Godzilla flick ever!!!!!
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,マイナスワンはおそらくゴジラの最高の映画だった
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,A comparación de las películas americanas tanto la historia como los personajes son muy buenos. cada pequeña parte de la película es disfrutable no como las americanas que hay partes que te aburren. Es una muy buena película de suspenso con una historia de fondo espectacular
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2023. Great story, loved the characters, Godzilla was big and terrifying, effects were spot on, and the music soars. It was an emotional sweep from drama to spectacle. The biggest surprise of the year and I say see it in the theater on the big screen. With some popcorn and soda."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've seen in years. The human story and monster CGI action (the best CGI I've seen in years) were balanced perfectly. I've enjoyed the ride at most Kaiju movies but never have I been drawn into the human story in one before. Every human moment in the drama was earned. Not a single movie this year can touch this masterpiece of action, drama, pathos, and story."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,This will definitely serve as a blueprint for future monster films.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"La película es una obra maestra que logró sumergirme por completo en su historia. La actuación de los personajes es simplemente impecable, transmitiendome emociones tan auténticas que me hicieron sentir parte de la historia. Cada detalle, desde la dirección hasta el guion, se fusiona para crear una experiencia cinematográfica inolvidable. Sin duda, es una joya que dejará una huella duradera en mí."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Godzilla movie!! Was impressed with story and the effects!! Take note Hollywood!!
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Highly recommend. I'm not even even a fan of Godzilla, but this movie was fantastic. 10/10"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Hardcore Godzilla fans only. Not for me :(
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,its very big hype you know
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme do ano e da minha vida merece até um Oscar de tão bom que é, ótima história, ótimos personagens e o roteiro é impecável, este filme é uma obra de arte, este filme é para os fãs mais devotos do rei dos monstros, super recomendo minha nota é 10/10"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing hero story about an authentic Japanese story. Captures real fear
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a very epic movie if you like action with good background music this is your movie and if you like Godzilla's series of course.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a beautiful, emotive, believable and very human Godzilla movie I loved it and it deserves repeated viewings as a small-budget monster movie made for a thoughtful audience by the originators, Toho."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the best movie I have seen in the longest time, and I doubt Ill see anything as good for the rest of my life. The joy I felt seeing an actual Japanese Godzilla in the theater, and then for that movie to be true to fashion while also being one of the very best Godzilla movies I have ever seen It was absolutely incredible. Thats how you make a Godzillia movie, not the garbage that America has been trying to shovel feed us. 

10/10 Hands down the best film since the turn of the century."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"As a native Japanese, this movie is awesome and this is my first Godzilla movie.
I watched this movie at a movie theater and I was so happy to see that audience in the theater clapped loudly at the end of the movie.  It shows the historical context very well, such as the chaos, struggles and emotional wounds, volatility and slow recovery after WW2. I was also amazed that the movie shows detailed historical object such as Japanese fighter plane (Zero and Shinden) and Japanese cruiser Takao.  I am very glad that they choose the era that original Godzilla was born, rather than choosing modern world. My image to Godzilla movie in the past was just panic and fighting with Godzilla w.o message or story behind.  But this movie gave us the emotional message and story of people's pain and strength. I highly recommend this movie to both who watched and never watched previous Godzilla movie."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,In One Word: “Perfection”
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Like Maverick but with English subtitles. Nice balance of action and suspense building, like the original Godzilla movies. Loved it! "
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,This is literally better than the blockbuster version from the 2010's. The story and the sound along with the special effects were absolute perfection. Couldn't recommend it more than that
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"very good special effects involving Godzilla,but there were times there times the movie got a bit slow"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una carta de amor a la Industria
100/100 y de las GOD
Véanla en el cine vale completamente la pena"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great Story, Great Effects, Great Emotion, Great Acting, Great take on History. Entertaining and while familar( we all know the monster attacks etc story) much more emotionally connecting that movies in this genra.

I was puzzled by the title but in movie realized that it is simply like saying in a game  John minus one to indicate he lost the match"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Im not a Godzilla fan, but I enjoyed this thoroughly (as did the whole family). This was so much better than the Hollywood versions."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie is exciting, it is enjoyed more if you watch it in a 4DX room since all the scenes feel as if you were inside the movie,There is constant action and that is a lot to be grateful for. The budget was low but the film looked incredible. Without a doubt this is a love letter for Godzilla fans 10/10 masterpiece."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved the movie. The main character's arch was so good and the movie was so much more deeper than I expected. I came to watch it with my little brother and left questioning the value of life.
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Did anyone actually watch this film?
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very Good movie. Highly Recommend watching, it is very epic. The acting was much better than the WB and legendary versions-- Godzilla was much angrier and the post-world war 2 setting was the perfect setting."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story telling even with the subtitles. Cool ending too. 👍
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie- not overdone. If you’re a fan of old school Godzilla movies this hit all the touchstones plus a great plot.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Outstanding movie. Hollywood could learn from this movie about writing great characters and great action for less than the budget of one episode of “She Hulk”. Hope they understand this.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Good film. It reminded us of the old Godzilla movies.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great characters and story, amazing visuals. Really got a feel for what being under attack by Godzilla might be like. But he was just a vehicle to tell a great and hopeful message."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Totally Awesome not  what I expected even my wife loved it . It had everything you expect in a movie ……..outstanding.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing. In my opinion the best one.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"My favorite movie of 2023! Such great characterizations, I was 100% invested in the PEOPLE in this Godzilla movie, which made the monster that much more of a threat. And the non-cgi effects were fantastic. Great film!!"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,If Deer Hunter was a story of post Vietnam war vets struggling with their demons then this is a story of post ww2 Japanese vets struggling with their monsters.   A great blend of a story and a monster movie.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I took my father and grandfather because they are big fans. I havent watched many of the Godzilla movies so I did not expect to be invested in it at all. Not only was I invested, but was crying by the end of the movie. It was absolutely amazing!"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,A great film especially with the budget used to make this movie. Some of the special effects seemed very low quality but I still really enjoyed it.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic, great plot, great Godzilla design, and really returns to the franchises dark origin. This was probably the best Godzilla movie to date and compared to the Hollywood movies this one blew them out of the water, even my mom loved it, and she is not very into movies."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,This is absolutely one of the best Godzilla movies ever made. There was a real depth to the characters that made every interaction with Big G a moment where you truly fretted for them. Godzilla was menacing in a way that we haven't felt in a long time.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"best Godzilla movie i ever seen. Taking it back to its roots with amazing human story with actual meaning and symbolism for every part of the movie. great character arcs, good visuals and compelling story telling.

must watch"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es asombrosa, un perfecto equilibrio entre kaijus y humanos, tan sentimental como emocionante. Pinche película toda chingona, toda sabrosa, toca verla otras 20 veces"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,The old stuff. The great stuff. That's how you do a Godzilla flick.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,It was great the action and everything and a little bit of horror was excellent.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best movies made. It's a modern classic that people will be taking about and rewatching decades from now like Casa Blanca or Lawrence of Arabia.  It felt like one of those movies.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,I now have a new favorite Godzilla movie
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film maintains the original essence of Godzilla, it is incredible in all aspects. Without a doubt a movie you can't miss"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There was never a reason why Godzilla shows up I had a big problem with that, also the movie glorifies WW2 Japanese fighters who were allied with Hitler if that's not a big red flag idk what is."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was a bad movie. First of all, it glorifies World War 2 Japanese soldiers. May I ask, would you watch a movie glorifying Nazi soldiers fighting a monster? War crimes were committed by Japan, and is now internationally recognized, so to have a movie glorifying the soldiers is appalling. Secondly, the movie was pointless. It did not talk about Godzilla lore, and with all the drama, they didn't even kill Godzilla. Granted, we know that Godzilla is practically impossible to kill, but the whole motif of the film is awkward and offensive. A Kamikaze soldier realizing he wanted to live, okay, I see the hero's journey, but the movie's acting was so bad that you can't focus on trying to enjoy the story."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,favorite movie this year
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Oh come ON!! Screenwriters who know how to simultaneously develop characters AND tell a story? A director who knows how to direct a cast? Actors who ""get"" a script and can stay ""on tone"" depending on the scene?

YES PLEASE!!

I canno recommend this highly enough. Enjoyed it as much as Jaws ... and that is saying something ...."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Truly one of the worst storylines and acting I’ve ever seen Never seen a godzilla movie, so oerhaps fans are used to this senseless type of film"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,this is the best godzilla film of all time
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I’ve been a Godzilla fan since I was a kid 51 now and have seen pretty much everything with Big G in it plus comics,animation,books etc. this ranks up there with the very best that’s been offered with the original Gojira being the benchmark. I do love Godzilla Returns(1984) Godzilla VS Biollante and enjoyed Shin Godzilla also but this is very very well done and deserves all the praise it has received. Bravo Toho Bravo"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This a was a great movie, personally I didn’t mind reading the captions but some people might. I loved how it all went the a story line. 10/10 movie I would definitely recommend this movie "
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"We enjoyed Godzilla. We saw the film on a regular screen (because we waited too long for the fancy ones) but it didn't affect the movie. The subtitles were easy to read for old people like us. We didn't cry at any point, (others have said that they did) the film was interesting, exciting, and moving. The special effects, especially Godzilla, were fascinating. How did they get that little girl to cry on cue? Watching how the filmmakers portrayed Japan after WWII, the rebuilding of their country, their lives, and how the people worked together to fight the monster was an insight into the culture of post-war Japan that we've not had.  We're glad that Japan shared the movie Godzilla: Minus One with us."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"A breath of fresh air, not just for Godzilla fans. Come watch and understand why critics and audiences are raving mad about the success and epitome of the movie monster icon that is: Godzilla (Minus-One)."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Toho got their king back after 7 years and they put it to good use.  Godzilla: Minus One is a masterpiece to say the least, 10/10"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,Good movie only wish it was in English!!
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This was a good story, but I think it was overhyped. It was definitely a whole lot better than the American Godzilla films, but that is because those films were soulless paint-by-numbers movies. This film definitely had more to say for a monster flick, but the ending was lacking something."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was a MASTERPIECE. I know that term is just thrown around, but I mean this in all it’s meaning. I cannot recommend this movie enough."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie of all time, including the Japanese original. Japan reckons with the post-War kamikaze trauma. Godzilla is a monster, Godzilla is a metaphor. But the best thing about this monster movie is the people. Which has never been done."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,So this is a Monster movie where the messaging goes far beyond the monster. Maybe we need to wake up and pay attention to it while we have 2 wars raging in the world. Nothing short of a triumph
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!! Havent enjoyed a movie like that in a long time. Cant stop thinking about it!!
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie to date!!
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
BEST VISUAL DIRECTION AND ACTING
GREAT CONCEPT for a film!!!11"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie accomplishes something no other Godzilla film has, in my opinion. It made me genuinely care about the human cast and their issues. Unlike previous films, where you might root for Godzilla, this one instills a sense of dread when he arrives, returning to the roots of what he was meant to embody. Godzilla becomes the embodiment of the consequences for man's actions and reckless disregard for the planet. An absolute unstoppable wrecking ball, it's spectacular to witness. After watching it twice, I can confidently say this is, in my opinion, the best Godzilla film ever made, and I have zero complaints."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome film! One of the best of 2023.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film shows us that even somebody with many defects and errors (from protagonist and society's perspective)  as would a Japanese deserter be, has the right to live, for that is the movie about, about life, the bonds that we make and move people to carry on, to forgive themselves, even when we face situations bigger than ourselves.
Godzilla Minus One is a balance between action, emotion, good story and character development; Touching many subjects that a human being could face and that goes beyond our beloved kaiju, this one attaining a symbolic significance of a society's unrest situations, being these real attacks or psychological. Definitely a film the very same Hollywood should envy."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,A really a good hamburger if you are in the mood.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tea-Meter: 10/10
https://boxd.it/5rU3aD"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I have seen!
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was perfectly terrifying and full of suspense. My new favorite Godzilla movie. Everything was so well done and the cinematography was incredible. I love how this movie, unlike other Godzilla movies, actually makes you care about the human characters and their stories."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,A must watch movie. I like that this is so emotional at the same time it is action packed.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing the characters, the story,godzilla it's all perfect and captures the overall theme of the movie and godzilla very well. It doesn't make the human characters boring and does a swell job on it, 10/10 would definitely recommend"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST GODZILLA MOVIE IN DECADES! For the first time in a very long time you actually care about the human characters. This is the film that I will show everyone to get them into Godzilla movies.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme muito top! Uma obra de arte que todos deveriam ver no cinema. ❤️
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great movie - if you're a five-year-old. The dialogue was stiff and on the nose. All exposition, no subtext. Every scene was predictable and overly dramatic. The acting was one-dimensional. And the monster? Fully exposed in the first few minutes, so all possibility of suspense was removed. Absolutely awful. Avoid."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great movie and the theme song made it even better
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This was peak Godzilla
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"""It's just so peak"" - someone"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Authentic, visceral story line. The period setting really brought the trauma of war through."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Por fin vi godzilla minus one 
Y de verdad me hizo recordar mucho a godzilla VS Mothra de 1992 
El godzilla original el que se movía lento, algo que no me gusta de las nuevas películas que lo ponen como malo, antes no era malo.
Me gustaron mucho las tomas donde parece que está con una maqueta y el moustro avanzando súper lento; espectacular.
Los sonidos muy buenos igual la música, solo el grito de godzilla no es el original me hubiera encantado haber escuchado el mismo sonido que tenía antes.
En general una buena película para pasar el rato.
Le doy un 9.2/10"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredibly well made movie (loyal to its subject matter with an intimacy to detail) on an epic scale.  
But its much more than just an action film.  The heart, the drama, the emotional pull and authenticity of skilled actors and a story line you care about make it easily one of the best movies of the year!!  Must see on the big screen"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved everything about this movie! So many emotions felt.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The human element of this film is incredible.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The Godzilla of all time
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Shockingly good. I am far from a Godzilla fan but easily one of the best movies I have seen in a while. This is how it's done.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally, one of the Greatest Godzilla movie out there!"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Interesting story of post WWII Japan.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked how much they focused on the characters, it added depth to a franchise normally focused on big lizard blow stuff up. Greats work by TOHO on this one, and I would definitely recommend it. The ending was very predictable, but was still really good. Definitely deserves 5 stars!"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Me a encantado la pelicula! Es asombroso! La calidad de la animacion SGI 3D o como se diga es muy buena. Es cruda a terradora triste y gracioso en algunas veces :D Yo considero esta PELICULA UN EXITO EN TODO! En mi opinion es PERFECTA-A-A!
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Freaking loved this movie, the characters, the action, the destruction, the drama, all of it, fantastic!"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie a lot of emotion
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aside from being the best Godzilla movie of all time, it’s just a fantastic movie. Moviemakers here in the United States need to look and learn. It’s not about the big budgets, it’s about telling a truly good story. And the special effects are wonderful. This is a must see in the theaters if you can."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie in years if not the best
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of godzilla in the history
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,A spit in the eye of Hollywood.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sorry but this movie was bad.  Nearly every scene was overly-dramatic, the plot beyond predictable, the acting was meh and quite emotionless - which I partially blame on poor translation.  Even the star monster was disappointingly fake looking - reminding one of a transformer-type toy."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must see! Finally a good movie worth watching, thank you Japan!"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic Godzilla movie. Godzilla looked amazing. Even with subtitles, the movie flowed well and was a good story."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent story telling and a lot of thrilling action. With a little humor thrown in. All in all a truly enjoyable experience.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is a truly terrifying experience challenging the human spirit wherever it stomps.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was hesitant on seeing a subtitle movie but from the start this movie captures your attention and soon the subtitles just disappear.  The movie was the perfect pace, character development and action. I was seriously impressed with this amazing movie!"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyable monster movie
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Touching movie.  Intense.  Godzilla shows up.  Go see it.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! A must watch in theaters.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,A really good storyline.....with of course Godzilla
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,My God. Godzilla was scary as all hell in this telling. This isn't just a monster movie; it's an incredible story of redemption and family. I cried like a baby. You will too.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the BEST & MOST CAPTIVATING MOVIE in a very long time. It’s so good that I forget that I am watching a foreign movie with subtitles and captions. 
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Needed that. Refreshingly two-dimensional. Loved the feel. Must see. (4.6/5)
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie to date
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film ever!
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of the original franchise, youll love it. Great special effects without feeling CGI. FUN."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing piece of film! This ""monster movie"" had more human emotion that most everything else that Hollywood has produced. Amazing performances. And, oh yeah, Godzilla was as bad-ass as ever!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a film that knows what it wants to be and executes in perfectly. With great acting, characters, story, and theming, Godzilla Minus One automatically takes the cake as perhaps the greatest Godzilla flick yet."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very heartfelt movie! Lots of suspense!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I FN LOVED THIS GODZILLA MOVIE!
It had actual characters, emotions, good action, amazing SF, and that all inportant feel from a Godzilla movie: hopelessness
Amazing MOVIE, not just a bunch of computer stuff"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Very skeptical. My husband wanted to see it and I didn’t think I’d like reading the movie but it was so good!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"OK, so it probably needed more of Tokyo destruction, rampage type scenes."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite Godzilla movie ever from actors cgi story etc only just starts a little slow but it’s definitely worth it.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Suspenseful  and really good. The first part was very interesting with how it opened up and set the tone for the remainder of the show.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just reflect on why their own defeat garbage
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie, showing the monster verse how to handle human characters. Godzilla was a force of nature. Brilliant effects and they kept the iconic theme"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I tend not to watch many films from japan, but this one really set in motion my interest in these film makers this film from start to finish was soo good! it had emotion, action and great characters, with a story that pays off!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Drama and good storyline
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a fresh take to Godzilla! And it's so great that there are still film makers focused on characters and story telling. I loved the characters, the compelling story and how they incorporated Godzilla into the entire story line, overall a great movie. Definitely worth watching in theaters!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maravilhoso, muito bem feito, com pouco dinheiro."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely brilliant film! I loved every minute of it.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible from start to finish. Terrifying at times, hopeless and soul crushing but in the best way. This is not a monster movie. This is a masterpiece. This is deep."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sticking to the ""family"" recipe, it captures the essence of the first films with all the terror, drama and suspense. This without mentioning an open ending that generates expectations."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzilla movieever
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla movie ever!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great reimaginiing of the earlier Godzilla flicks. 
Told from the original Japanese perspective that started the franchise.
A fun ride."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,it was amazing like i do not know how to describe how good it is just watch it for yourself and trust me its the best godzilla movie out there!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the story great efffects. 
Didnt like some of the music."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best films I have seen in the theatre since Dunkirk.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie well done with the characters. Better than the boring friendly Godzilla we see. But otherwise it's a 10/10 for me totally recommend seeing it!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow didnt expect it!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is Godzilla in its purest form. The human element is tragic and heartbreaking. You feel a sense of terror anytime Godzilla appears and knowing he will reappear fills you with a constant sense of dread. This is one of those films I urge everyone to see at least once. It is an experience that stays with you.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very well made film that only Japan can produce.  I had no idea I was going to watch an epic film about life and its complexities.  Very real and very moving film.  I think it was one of the best films I've seen in 2023.  I feel like if Jaws and Dirty Dozen had a baby kaiju named ""Gojira."""
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Biggest surprise ever!! Great movie
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,makes you actually care about the characters and fear godzilla for once😭
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Long time ago that I don't want to be at cinemas, this film bring me to it, and I love it. Great sound, picture, acting and monster."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal film that surpassed all of my expectations. Incredible visuals, great characters, and an engaging, emotional story. Believe the hype! This is a movie that must be seen on the big screen!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the film and movie. Brought my whole family and they were all surprised that they enjoyed it too. Not just another monster movie. Character-driven.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was the only Godzilla movie where I was hoping the big guy would lose. There is so much tension throughout the movie with such an incredible cast. Unbelievable climax, go see this movie!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, emotional, historical, and amazing effects, best movie I’ve seen in a long time!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story and acting were amazing. Even with reading subtitles and not understanding the actors actual speech, you can feel the emotion and sincerity in their voices. The visuals and effects are excellent, especially for a such a relatively small budget. This Godzilla is more genuine and has more soul than the recent American Godzilla movies, which were fine, but lacked the character that Japanese Godzilla movies possess."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline. Action sequences were good. Characters were well developed.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great movie added to the library of Godzilla movies. Good action scenes but also a very compelling story line that has you rooting against Gojira.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"There's no way to convey in words how wonderful is Godzilla film is.  It has so many things that very few films have today like quality acting,  an exceptional sound score a realistic story (for Godzilla film),  an incredible look at Japanese culture post-world war 2...  I've watched a lot of regular films in my life but this is one of the best things I've ever seen. If you like high tension drama and monster movies, this has got both of them in one package."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,An incredible movie the best movie of godzilla
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The action scenes are framed so well and the movie looks great.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"La grandeza de Godzilla y una buena trama, increíble para tan poco presupuesto"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies that I've seen. What an incredible film. 10/10 acting, 10/10 plot, 10/10 everything. Very highly recommend!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"It plays the source material straight, and really emphasizes individual human tragedy and value. Loved it."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic story and character development. The most impressive Godzilla yet!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing story. Amazing graphics and cinematography. Proof once again that focusing on the story, not the frills, not just maxing out the budget can lead to a great movie and ROI."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best 2023 movie! The action, the story, the effects. The combo is perfect!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although the plot is a little preposterous at times, this Godzilla film has a lot of heart and excitement. Fun to watch!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly the best movie in 2023.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice to see a Godzilla movie that goes back to the roots of the original movies.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla minus one is the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen I'd recommend it absolutely. Godzilla is just an amazing Villain like the original!
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Holy smokes this was a great movie.  It is easily, and I mean by a mile, the best Godzilla movie ever made (and I've been watching them since the 1970's 👴🏻).  While that may seem like a low bar, that's 60+ films, and the hundreds of millions of dollars Hollywood has thrown at it in the last 20 years."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good effects but not a great movie.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, awesome CGI, very likeable actors."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"A monster movie where you actually care about the character and hope they don't die in the end, on top of Godzilla being possibly the coolest thing to exist as usual."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie I’ve seen. he’s terrifying, and there is a good story written around him."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have not seen a better storyline in recent years.  Extremely well written and directed.  This was more of an epic feel than a typical monster/action movie.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Due to its length and the amount of drama I don't think it's one that I will want to watch as often as other godzilla movies, but the post-WWII tie-in is compelling and adds so much to the depth of the story."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The best film of 2023. Period.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies in the year!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Best  Godzilla “FILM” of all time.  A actual serious story to the background terror of Godzilla.  Thought through by the writer. Well Done!!!!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't miss this! Godzilla Minus One is a movie about people you'll care about ... that just happens to have a monster. It serves as a thoughtful companion piece to Oppenheimer that presents the Japanese perspective of the atomic bomb ... while also wrestling with the consequences of war, deftly navigating the stages of trauma, guilt, grief, and redemption. It measures up to prime 1970s-1980s Spielberg for the masterful way it anchors amazing action and cinematic virtuosity with believable humanity. What a surprise! My favorite movie of 2023."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Unexpected ending. Has you on edge from begging to end. 10/10 recommend.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla ever. Great effects, fantastic acting, a moving story, and that classic Godzilla theme never gets old."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible. Next level vfx, set design, costumes, performance. B Genre with A+ technical prowess 🇯🇵"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Can’t believe my best movie of the year was a subtitled Godzilla movie. This was an unexpected win. 
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing. I truly have no issues with any of it. People say they feel like Godzilla has no screen time. He doesn't but it would be repetitive if he was on screen for two hours. It is actually one of the best in my opinion in recent years. I would highly recommend watching it.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,the only reason I didn't give it all five stars is because it wasn't dubbed in English
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie understands perfectly how a disaster/monster film should be, and yes Godzilla is important but if you don't have a good human story where you can connect, then it doesn't gonna work. Here we worried about the characters we can relate with them, we wanted that they win. Oh, and by the way Godzilla… not a nice guy… just saying. Godzilla is going to protect us the same way we protect the ants."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just a great monster movie, but a great movie over all. Godzilla is awesome,  but it is the human characters who carry the show."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a matter of taste. To me it seemed like a tribute to the original films, but with a very slow narrative and little action."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie 2023. Maybe the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMAZING! Great design, plot, and overall feel."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect, best godzilla movie"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was happy to see this after seeing the so called ""Monarch Legacy of monsters"" that show is a disappointment completely. 
At least you get to see Godzilla back in the day doing what he does best!
Just a fan as is my family! Well worth watching if you love Godzilla! Can't wait for the new Godzilla and Kong!"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"For anyone who needs to hear it: Don't let having to read subtitles keep you from seeing this film! It's a fantastic film with a beautiful story and messages that should be heard. Also, see it on the big screen while you still can!"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie si fantastic, the best movie of the end year."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simply one of the best movies of the beloved kaiju, the story and the visual effects are amazing. They really knew how to make Godzilla a bad guy again attacking Japan's famous landmarks just like the old days. If you're a true fan you'll love it and if you're new or simply want to try something new, then this is the perfect movie!!!"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jaw was dropped 95% of the time. 
Fantastic movie"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man, this was a GREAT movie with Godzilla in it or should I say it was a GREAT Godzilla movie as it is the first one from 54'."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maneja muy bien la tensión y el suspenso que causa la presencia de Godzilla, la historia está equilibrada entre escenas de acción con las escenas de diálogo y desarrollo de la historia. Me encantó"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Godzilla movie!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I love you so much goodzilla 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encantó el diseño de Godzilla es súper sus dientes son muy filosos, el aliento atómico es ultra increíble y el rugido de Godzilla es super ultra increíble usaron el rugido del 54 pero con máximo volumen la película está muy viene echa y actualmente se conecta con Shin Godzilla es una secuela y además la musicalizada con el tema de Shin Godzilla por qué es el mismo"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible. Every last part. An incredible story from start to finish that had us in awe. See this movie.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never expected such a compelling story to be in a Godzilla movie but I’m so glad it was. Brilliant directing, brilliant script, brilliant acting and a brilliant cast. It really is Oscar worthy."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great piece of story telling. The CGI/SFX are not the greatest, it does not need to be seen on the big screen but it is character driven, well performed and the end result is a very enjoyable experience."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,At least half this creature feature was devoted to making us care about the people in this world. What a welcome change!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Una película espectacular esto en efecto es cine🗿🚬
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best Godzilla movie if not the best, for the first time I cared about the human story."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Woooo!!!! Espectacular película, superó todas mis expectativas"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"great heartfelt movie.  characters, though following traditional tropes-- were characters to root for.  unlike other godzilla movies where the monster has personality- the people and their relationships drive the movie. I cared about the people."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I know why it’s called Godzilla minus one. Because that’s how m ay stars it deserves…. Minus one!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Its great to see a movie with character development and effort.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,if only US Godzilla releases were this good.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Estuvo genial el estreno en mexico, el soundtrack, la tensión, todo fue god."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing to say the less. What they did with 15 mill, it's  just amazing. A family/ centered monster film perfectly done. Kochi's arc it's just so well done. FXs are amazing considering the budget and even more. Paced very well up till the end. I do hope something comes after cause it the deserves more stories continuing this plot."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie!!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Not just a good Godzilla but literally one of the best movies of all time.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I’ve seen it twice and it’s the best and second best movie I’ve seen this year.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never expected a moving and engaging Godzilla movie. That would even get a tear out of me. American Godzilla movies definitely aren't the masterpieces this was.
       I've never cared about the human characters in a Godzilla film as much as I did in this. This deserves every Oscar this year."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was true to the original Godzilla movies.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a great movie, very well made with good CGI, good story and it is a great adaptation of Godzilla"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exelente película, ideal para toda la familia"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Characters and story are so good you'll forget you came to watch a nuclear powered lizard movie.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie for Godzilla!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,SEE THIS MOVIE LIKE TODAY! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IVE EVER SEE IN MY LIFE! And this also one of my top 3 favorite movies! SEE THIS TODAY! Here let me tell you about it. The story if 100% NOT boring. Amazing acting. And This will be one of the best movies you've ever seen. So what are you saying for? GO TO YOUR CLOSEST THEATER NOW!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Nearly cried at times. Even if you're not keen on Godzilla, it's a decent WW2 movie."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Who would think a Godzilla movie cause me to shed a tear?

In 2 hours, this film managed to tell a moving post-WWII story with epic and tragic monster mayhem. Plus a really positive and aspirational message:

No matter what you've been through in life, there is always something to live for. 

Godzilla Minus One truly needs to be seen to believe. It effortlessly blows the roof off any Hollywood blockbuster today."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The perfect Godzilla film. It hit different!! The emotion and humility of the characters teamed with the dismal desperation of the setting was absolutely superbly told in the story, and then you throw in a genuinely terrifying, giant monster, you now have a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, laughing, crying, gasping, unable to turn away. Phenomenal!"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Nostalgia ultra. Great story. Great character development! Best movie of 2023!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,What a brilliantly devastating monstrous take on our titan king! Instagram @legendslounge_tv_and_film
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is absolutely perfect! It makes you feel for the characters and keeps drawing you into the story, an easy 10/10."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This was without a doubt the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen! I've went see it 3 times and cried 3 times!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una de mis mejores experiencias en el cine. Es muy buena, y sin duda está en el podio de las MEJORES PELICULAS DE GODZILLA.
Un CGI precioso, unas actuaciones y personajes muy buenos. Godzilla obviamente se roba cada escena en la que sale y en verdad da miedo aveces, un muy buen villano. 
Muy feliz."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Great here is your knee. Great cat carriers. An amazing plot. Overall, good movie."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla! Along with a fantastic story and great acting.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way better than i expected. Great characters, really awesome effects. I definitely recommend it!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,True to the original Godzilla. Great story
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie I have seen. The story, special affects, and acting top notch. You really felt for the characters. And Godzilla was the monster he was meant to be.  If you like Godzilla, monster movie lover, sci-fi, or a solid mankind overcoming type movie you'll like this. Also the soundtrack was great."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,2nd best Gojira movie
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie even without Godzilla. The human characters, and their story, are compelling and well performed. Add in a unique but familiar Godzilla with some classic Godzilla soundtrack and you have a must-see movie for any Dan of the G man."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"CGI was disappointing at times but the story was absolutely brilliant. Perfect godzilla portrayal, was worth the watch"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so good! Front to back, a very compelling movie."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite movies since Shin Godzilla and the 1954 Godzilla.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely my new favorite Godzilla movie! I recommend watching for sure!!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One tells an intriguing and at times heart wrenching human story set to the backdrop of early post World War II. The monster itself delivers all the punch you would hope for as a modern version of the classic Godzilla we know and love. Every scene is a work of art. A bit of humor is interspersed to keep the mood from trending to dark. I usually hate CGI but found the effects in this movie felt more practical than computer generated. This wild ride is what going to the movies is all about.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven't been to the cinema since 2018. And there hasn't been a single film I've been enticed to see in all that time. Hollywood is, and has been, dead to me.

But then Godzilla rumbles into town and shows me that Cinema isn't dead .. it's just moved HQ.
This movie was spectacular .. and I'm not talking just about visual effects (which are pretty much a given in this day in age). The story is tight, compelling .. wastes no time and yet breathes with incredible ease. Letting you get to know the characters without any ham-fisted plot dumps. It's not possible to watch this movie without tearing up even just a little. You WILL get a lump in your throat and you will be grateful for it!

I'm not particularly into Godzilla or monster flicks in general .. but I have to say I am grateful to some friends who convinced me to go and see this film. I had seen reviews of it saying it was brilliant so I was sure it would be an enjoyable film .. but seeing is believing. This film absolutely deserves a 100% rating .. and it's very heartening to see it get 98% from both the professional cretins (critics) and audience alike.

So bravo to Toho studios .. you guys knocked it out of the park!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have never had such a powerful experience in a theater. Immediately engaging, and every moment is potent until the last credit leaves the screen. Did not know me and my wife would be crying tears throughout for a Godzilla movie. This is maybe the most important movie to come out in my lifetime. As a descendant of Japanese people who endured WWII it was a deeply moving and overwhelmingly spiritual experience. I will never be the same.

Please go and see this movie, in theaters if you can."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla shouldnt be that good. Gave you all the monster destruction you expecting and then hit you in the feels with themes of guilt and redemptions and Japanese Reconstruction after WWII. One of my favorite movies of the year.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Godzilla movie!  Saw it in Japanese with subtitles and enjoyed that.  Great acting and story line.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great storytelling. Good combination of analog and digital effects. Characters I cared about. Great character arcs. Essential universal human values honored, cherished and celebrated. Evolution of a family and nation coming together through hardship with love. Great depiction of a terrifying Godzilla."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an absolute masterpiece of a movie and a must see, as a Godzilla fan I can say this movie is worthy."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film, besides the 1954 original, is the best Godzilla film I've seen.  I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen.  This is Godzilla at his finest moment and most poignant.  Godzilla, as a symbol, has never been more terrifying."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla film of all-time. Normally I don't care about the people in a monster movie but this time I did. Incredible story telling, and a great monster movie!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie one of the best Godzilla movies I seen in a while
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie i’ve seen this year
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed it. The film takes its time developing the characters and Godzilla's mystic isn't killed with cheap attempts to humanize it or by overusing it in scenes. They also limit the amounts of time they show its full length and size which is how you're supposed to treat a giant monster in a giant monster movie. Score was amazing and no wasted scenes. By far my favorite film of the year and I appreciate both bomb scenes in this one over Oppenheimer which was beautiful but slightly underwhelming especially after the first time you watch it. Anyways go check it out folks.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Left me a bit more optimistic about the monster movie genre returning to its roots.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"An emotional, human story with devastating destruction and tense Godzilla fights."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,It had an absolutely horrible story and had more screen time of a baby crying then godzilla.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"My first Godzilla movie ever! Came with my sister and we had zero expectations and was just enthralled from beginning to end. It's not just a monster movie. At its core it's a movie about people and how they deal with collective trauma. I can't spoil but its definitely the best movie that came out this December, if not this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a supposedly monster movie, but I am."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good! Tugs at your heart strings in multiple ways!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was overall the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing!!! 100% recommend this movie. I truly loved every second of it! 👏
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great watch, very moving and exciting, true to the spirit of the original, which is not a silly film. The franchise has been trashed by American movie studios ! Well done Japan. (And I highly recommend the original 1954 one as well.)"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was true to the originals and particularly appreciated its raw look at post-war Tokyo.  Excellent film!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,A master piece! Um filme que te emociona mesmo em cenas que não são de drama. De prender o fôlego. Fazi atempo que não via um filme tão bom!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely 100% must see film I'm cinema this year! One of the best films of 2023.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla looked soooooo good!   Especially when he was following in the water! We loved it!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! Not a slow spot at all.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie that I saw in the theaters was, ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!!, I absolutely love it, But the only thing that holds this one back, Just one spot is that, Critics are being rude about this movie, Stop being so crazy for once, Gosh, But it's their opinion on it, So I do mind it, But I'm not going up against them."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good action movie!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunningly superb!  A surprisingly moving human story of duty, shame, redemption, and tenderness, all embedded in a monster movie, of all things.  Highly recommended."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I was a kid my parents had a VHS of Godzilla's Son that introduced me to the Godzilla universe. I watched that movie a hundred times. Going in fairly blind to Minus 1, my expectations were tempered as recent Hollywood versions have been a bit too childlike for me (I had enough of goofy Godzilla). This film is a work of art, with real characters to root for and a monster that's actually terrifying. I hadn't experienced this much fun in a cinema in a while. You can sense the filmmakers were so committed and inspired. My love and nostalgia of Godzilla is alive and well!"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encanto la trata de la pelicula, es muy interesante y tiene muy buenos efectos"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good! I loved absolutely everything about this film. I grew up amidst the monster craze of the 1970s, and Godzilla was my first favorite. He looks and sounds great in this film. The human cast is great as well and the story is deep and heartfelt. Awesome!"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved everything except the main character.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best Godzilla film I've ever seen. I cried like, multiple times. Godzilla was legit terrifying.

I actually cared about all of the human characters, something that hasn't happened since the first 15 minutes of Gareth Edwards Godzilla.

After this, I think Americans should just leave Godzilla alone. Let Japanese creative teams handle it, the American versions are nowhere near this quality."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the perfect Godzilla movie for the modern age! So glad I went to see it!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly best movie that toho has released (In my opinion). It makes the human characters actually interesting and entertaining. Godzilla is terrifying and everything he does is horrifying and the fact that he's a reflection of the atomic bomb that destroyed Japan is amazing. The CGI and everything graphical is great and makes Godzilla look real. Honesty there is probally more to say but that's all I can give this movie credit.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a perfect Godzilla movie for the new age. The blend of practical effects and special effects was seamlessly done and visually excels above most Hollywood productions. The human story was thrilling and every time Godzilla was on screen, it invoked the terror you'd expect."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu amei o filme, definitivamente o melhor, com trilhas clássicas, não tenho nem palavras para descrever ele...

I loved the film, definitely the best, with classic soundtracks, I don't even have words to describe it..."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"To me, this movie is an outstanding tribute to the classic Godzilla movies!  There were so many moments that caused a ""flashback"" to the originals, brought back to life in such a spectacular way!  You don't want to miss Godzilla Minus One - one of the best, if not the best movie of the year!  Really hoping they do more films like this adding Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Ebirah, KIng Caesar etc."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, it was amazing! Never thought I’d cry watching a Godzilla film. It’s that good and probably one of 2023’s best movies! Do yourself a favor and go watch it before it leaves the theaters."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a Godzilla fan, this movie is everything I wanted. Great action and interesting human characters. This movie awe you with the terrifying sequences of Godzilla and brings you to tears with main characters. A perfect balance."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best depictions of Godzilla. The movie portrays the struggle of the common folk against insurmountable odds. It's mindboggling how the movie managed to accomplish so much in a single movie compared to a cinematic universe that fails to execute a single objective. Minus One deserves your attention for it is an triumph.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Menos Uno"" es una epopeya cinematográfica que fusiona la grandiosidad de los monstruos clásicos con una trama intrigante. Con efectos visuales impresionantes, la película cautiva con su intensidad y creatividad. Cada escena es una oda al espectáculo visual, llevando a los espectadores a un emocionante viaje a través de la destrucción y la redención. Una obra maestra moderna que redefine el género de kaijus con su enfoque audaz y una narrativa que deja al público anhelando más."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Exelente trailer muy recomendado para todos los usuarios
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is never the less a masterpiece full of drama and a must watch
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. The sub titles were not an issue.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Compelling plot, good acting, great visual effects."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the first Kaiju movie I've seen where the human characters are interesting enough to not feel just like something we have to get through to watch more Kaiju action.  Both the human parts and Kaiju action are great
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well done! Subtitles were easy to fllow
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Utterly phenomenal. A powerhouse of a film that must be seen. The story, acting and F/X are incredible. Godzilla rampages on a scale never before seen. The best Godzilla film of all time, and the best film of 2023. See it on the biggest screen with best audio system in your town, because anything less is unworthy of such a great film."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The human element is what makes this movie great. The Godzilla character lacks development though. I hope Godzilla will have a chance to show its feelings in the next movie.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Stayed true to the original - had all of the elements that make a good movie!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,this is the best godzilla movie ever!!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen this movie 5 times now, and it's still incredible."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,We need more movies like this. Amazing start to finish.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie highly recommended.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I've seen. Great story. Great acting. Just great!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Really had the true feel of a Godzilla movie the way it should be.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"We all (5 of us) really liked this movie!
Best Godzilla movie of the franchise."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and almost had me sleeping in the first hour.  Lame storyline. Just bad.  I went to see it because of so many positive reviews.  Who is reviewing these movies?  The people in it?
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautiful plot and a good Japanese movie.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took my 10 year old daughter who loves kaiju movies and we both agree, hand down best Godzilla ever! Great characters, plenty of Godzilla, excellent actors and storyline."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heartfelt, well developed , engaging characters,  Great storyline, and beautifully done with awesome background music.  Wonderful redemption movie. This Godzilla movie actually had me in tears. A GODZILLA movie!!!"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I've been watching movies since I was a child in the 70's. This may have been the best I've ever seen! LOVED IT!!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"best movie of 2023, and its not even close. Oscar worthy. PERIOD."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"If this should be considered a remake of Godzilla from 1954, then this is probably the best Godzilla story ever put to film since then. An absolute masterpiece."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible. Excellent story, superior acting, and a perfect depiction of Godzilla. Oscar-worthy."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily one of the best movies I've seen. The call backs to the original and the heartfelt character moments really help elevate this film. Not many films can bring human characters in without taking away from the monster, but this succeeded. The film does get heavy thanks to the themes of PTSD and grief, but it's worth it. I was crying by the end and left incredibly happy I saw this in theaters."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I always judge based off a movie being worthwhile to rewatch, and this absolutely fits that. A great movie with a Godzilla that has a captivating interpretation. Acting is great, writing is great, and pacing was strong. Hm (Spoiler Alert), and I won't lie their solution was very clever and I was amazed at their idea of trying to kill Godzilla."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Took my boys to go see the movie (7&8 years old) but was unaware that it was no in English. They didnt last more than 15 minutes. Money wasted.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of fun. Felt enough like the original rubber suit Godzilla films with a touch of modern FX to be nostalgic and not too campy.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"una obra de arte, perfecta"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,𝐸𝑠 𝑚𝑢𝑦 𝑏𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑎 𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎 𝑙𝑎𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎 𝑚𝑎𝑠 𝑏𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑎 𝑞𝑢𝑒 𝑚𝑒 ℎ𝑒 𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑜
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Great characters and story. Why can't Hollywood make movies like this anymore. A+
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Been watching Godzilla movies for 50 years. This is a really good Godzilla movie and a good movie in general. The action has tension that builds and gives the scenes more weight. Saw it almost 4 weeks after it came out and the theater was packed.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It had good characters and a great story
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Japanese with English subtitles. We really enjoyed this take on Godzilla. Great plot, characters, setting, and ending."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slow pace.  Climax was good.  Godzilla has mo character, reminded me of Giant robot japanese animated cartoon from 1980s!"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente película para compartir en familia lá recomiendo
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an EXCELLENT movie that gives you a glimpse into the emotional Japan has felt through all of the destruction through the years. You FEEL this movie through what will be several very iconic scenes. This film also manages to keep you invested in the human characters as opposed to having us feverishly waiting for Godzilla with tunnel vision.

This will go down as the best Godzilla film ever produced. Toho did an incredible job."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is a  slow overcooked movie.  Too much dialogue with little meaning. I kept waiting for the movie to get better but it never did. The salute to Godzilla when he died was ridiculous. You don’t salute a beast that just destroyed your home and killed your friends and family.  I’m surprised at the good reviews. This movie sucks.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent movie I recommend it very exciting
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining throughout with compelling human interactions and crazy monster destruction. Worth the watch, even if you're hesitant about having to read subtitles."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"es una película que se sumerge en la temática de redención y nacionalismo de manera abierta y sentimental. La narrativa persigue una historia de redención en la que Kōichi y Japón son protagonistas. La película no presenta a Godzilla como una criatura amigable, sino como un monstruo enojado e incomprensible, que parece no estar motivado por el hambre, el deseo o la venganza. Además, aborda temas de trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT), vergüenza y culpa del superviviente, ofreciendo una exploración optimista de estos problemas. En resumen, es un homenaje verdadero a la película original de Godzilla, con temas postguerra y un enfoque en problemas mentales y emocionales."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Me gusto mucho la película tiene un drama espectacular súper recomendada
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,ESTA PELICULA ES FANTASICO ME GUSTO MUCHO
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sus efectos especiales están muy  bien adaptados te sumerje en la trama , muy entretenida de principio a fin ."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Hola me pareció una película muy buenas para pasarla con amigos o familiares la verdad la recomiendo muchísimo
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,subtitles not so good 😕
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Es muy buena película me gusta mucho quiero verla en cine con mi hijo y mi familia.!

"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,La pelicula es muy buena tiene una historia interesante que atrapa al espectador de principio a fin con muy buenas escenas de accion
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Compelling from start to finish, yet not rushed or overloaded with unnecessary characters. The simple subtitles were easy to read while watching characters face and body movements. Absolute must-buy."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,MUY BUENA PELÍCULA LA TRAMA ES EXCELENTE Y CADA UNO DE LOS ACTORES  SON MUY Profesionales PARA REALIZAR SUS PAPELES
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena película súper recomendada.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Una buena película me parece muy buena ojalá llegue lejos
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente video se nota la dedicación que le pusieron.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Les recomiendo esta película es muy buena para los que les gusta la acción y ciencia ficción, también que Godzilla es una de las películas más vistas en Japón se las recomiendo mucho"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Execelente película, muy buenas actuaciones, la trama es envolvente, recomendadisima, la Vi con mis hijos, les encantó."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, los sonidos, la fotografía, todo eriza la piel. Lo que más captura es que si usan un real origen de Godzila (que es en Japón), cautivada por completo y recomendada a todos, no solo a quienes somos fanáticos de la historia original ya que el guion de la historia es bien logrado"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Que gran película, me encantó la drama, diálogos mejor dicho todo"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena película se las recomiendo❤️❤️
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one una pelicula muy interesante la verda me encantó demasiado, es una pelicula de acción y de una excelente drama uff la recomiedo mucho por favor verla completa, por eso le doy 5 estrella 
Simplemente me Encantó!"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a life changing experience. I will never see the world in the same light again. Gooojjjjjjjjjiillllllaaaaaa forever.    
Hiaaaaachiiii"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una excelente película, recomendadicima, con mi familia a vimos y fue genial"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterful storytelling and excellent special effects create a tale that is a hit. So very Japanese and a must see for movie lovers.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Story telling at it's finest. I never expected this movie to be so good! Worth every minute
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Los gráficos se ven espectaculares,  esto es un exclusividad y la mejor de todos los tiempos."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It looked cheap. Godzilla looked like a toy. Also the overacting was ridiculous.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,all around best movie this year for me.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Está excelente la película, me encanta"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's OK, but it's slightly over hyped.
it's a Godzilla movie, but it doesn't have enough screen time, the drama is the main part of the movie, and when it does it's underwhelming"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it had a very strong story and the characters really meant something.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Godzilla film was something as fresh as Shin Godzilla with the realism, and real life situations that would happen if Godzilla was actually in this world. Great characters in this film that actually made me care, great soundtrack and a great Godzilla. Overall a good film that I recommend to anyone who is into Godzilla or film in general."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kinda old school feel, i e. Very Japanese. Monster was outstanding and story was sustainable. Forgot I was even reading the subtitles."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The perfect movie for any who is a big fan of Kaiju monsters or Godzilla, this movie actually makes you care for the characters and has its emotional moments, and this is right of the bat a huge difference from the Americanized Godzilla, so I really recommend you go to the theaters to watch this outstanding movie & support the director."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Não sou muito fã de filmes com tema de Godzilla, mas eu fui pego de surpresa com Godzilla Minus One, o filme é divertido, emocionante, tenso, uma boa história e efeitos especiais merecedor de concorrer e ganhar ao oscar. O figurino e fotografia também é de tirar o chapéu.
Que surpresa boa no final de 2023."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla in Japan is essentially half God and half Monster. There is no reason for Godzilla to appear, just as there is no reason for a hurricane or a huge earthquake to occur. The horror of this walking nuclear disaster is well expressed. The battleships and the fighters are those that actually existed in the past. I was surprised to see the heavy cruiser Takao, the lucky ship Yukikaze, and the mythical fighter Shinden. I would like to express my respect to the director and TOHO staff."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Must watch ! I did not expect it to be so good !!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Stayed true to the 1950's version. Special effects were fantastic.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible horrible horrible.  I practically laughed through the entire movie.  The acting is terrible. Where did they find these people?  The entire premise was so ridiculous and adding a love story to the plot so that it would round out the movie fell like a thud.  I love godzilla and king kong movies and could not wait to see this movie. I went with my 2 sons and 2 nephews and we were all disappointed.  It was almost a comedy.  Save your money and watch it on tv!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a near flawless cinematic masterpiece. I can't say anything negative about this film.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of the year, and one of the best Kaiju movies ever made. This is definitely one of the best Godzilla movies."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I appreciate that there was character development in addition to an interesting storyline and great graphics.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023! Go see it now GO! GO! GO!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great storyline,  Godzilla at his best!! Subtitles,,,,, not a problem,  totally worth going to see."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not convinced this was a Godzilla movie when it the script was first made, hell they could have even gone the Jacob's Ladder route if they wanted. Awesome flick."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is great. It is a great story with characters that I cared about. The action was excellent and Godzilla looked awesome. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Takes the franchise back to its original roots and does them proud.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"My girlfriend cried and I hoped that Godzilla would show these characters mercy...

Godzilla Minus One is a great WWII film that meets a Kaiju with elements of JAWS mixed in and some of the best sound and visual design.

This is the first time I've ever cared more about the characters in a Godzilla film than Godzilla himself. With that said, this is probably one of the most impressive portrayals of Godzilla on the big screen.

Went in expecting a monster flick loaded with mindless destruction and amazing visuals... ended up getting the film of the year.

It's incredible they made this film with less than $15M. This film puts Hollywood on notice and to shame."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just another monster action movie, not just the best Godzilla movie, it is an incredibly well-made and a deeply satisfying movie"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies EVER! This is why you go to a big screen at a theatre!!
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great cinematography 
Fair to good acting and script
This classic clearly wont die"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie starts out a little boring but as you go on it's amazing the actors put genuine effort into their characters and I actually started crying. The pain and suffering of the main characters was crazy and they conveyed the emotions so well I almost thought it was real. If your thinking about seeing this movie please do it was amazing.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not enough action and It was hard to keep up with the subtitles
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great story focused on the characters instead of Godzilla.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"興奮する、恐ろしい、感動的な 。
完璧なゴジラ映画です。大好きです。"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! It was so much more than the monster movie you would expect from the name. Very emotional movie, and so well done. I would highly recommend it!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película espectacular, logra atrapar a la persona de forma que una mismo también se siente dentro de la película, impresionante, la recomiendo demasiado"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute masterpiece. Well done TOHO.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved the story,and the ending made me cry."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Best kaiju movie ever made. Transcends the genre.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This is not just another Godzilla movie. This is an Epic Godzilla movie. People I know who are not into this kind of movie are glad they have seen Godzilla Minus One. Very strong likable characters are not just fodder for Godzilla. I feel bad for any Godzilla movies that follow. This one has set in incredibly high bar.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una película muy buena... Llena de muchas emociones totalmente aconsejable para verla
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,excelentes efectos visuales y la ubicación en la época caracteriza una mejor precisión de los hechos; se aproxima mas a la versión original de hace algunas décadas.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,very emotionally deep; probing into the human condition ...especially for a monster movie
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrific in all areas of the film! Godzilla design and FX, story, character development, intelligent dialog!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitivamente, apocalíptico se queda uno pensando,que tal que creen un monstruo de estas dimensiones para acabar la humanidad, me he visto todas las de Godzilla y está me parece de miedo"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Backstory, cinematography, character development and action was top-notch."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla es una aterradora fuerza de muerte. No me di cuenta de lo emotiva que sería esta película. Realmente una película fantástica
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding human-centric drama. Godzilla is terrific, too!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this I'm going back to watch again! Loved how they made Godzilla an actual scary monster that you should be scared of! So much better than anything hollyweird has shat out over the last few years. Highly recommend this movie to everyone...great story, Godzilla is actually terrifying, doesn't drag on for too long..brilliant sound design..didn't even notice the subtitles after awhile. GO WATCH IT!!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The 98% rotten tomatoes has to be a joke!
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic character driven story. You'll feel the experiences of the protagonist, and follow along on his journey. Godzilla is a terrifying force of death. I didn't realize how emotional this movie would be. Truly a fantastic movie."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic character driven story. You will have empathy and share the experiences of the protagonist. Godzilla is a horrifying and menacing force of death. Can he be stopped? You will not be disappointed. Truly a fantastic movie.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a Masterpiece in all areas!  A must see for everyone, not just Godzilla fans. I wasn't a Godzilla fan, but now I am since this movie was more than just Godzilla."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great character development and story very very good.  Godzilla cgi amazing!
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Very great movie I can see why it has had such a positive reception. The human story was very well done with solid acting from the cast. Each character is endearing and you really do root for them. As for Godzilla very solid design mixing traditional and newer aspects and it was definitely great to see some city destruction as well as something different like the water chase scene. Great movie for new and old fans.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of thr best movie of the year.

Glad that I got to see this one in IMAX and I wasn't expecting this movie to be so emotional with a lot of heart.

In my opinion this is the first time where you actually fear godzilla and see his true side of destruction.

Awesome movie in every way"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty embarrassing for Hollywood
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,so worth it...the  story ..even though it was a completely different language...never a dull moment
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Insanely good, human characters are fleshed out and have you fearing for their safety throughout the whole movie. Godzilla and his theme are perfect."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,My third time! Best Godzilla movie ever and I have seen every single one.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"While everyone were talking  about this movie, I'd enjoy Goz's plot and details of screen play.
Nicely done!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was genuinely having a hard time believing the good reviews this movie was getting, and keep in mind this is coming from a hardcore Godzilla fan. So I was hearing a lot about this movie ever since it released and I finally came to watch it tonight. And I have to admit, I was worried it was going to be a disappointment. However, now having sat through the whole film, I can safely say it was quite the opposite of that. From beginning to end, I was hooked. That's something I never get from one of these movies. Like I mentioned before, I'm a fan of these monster flicks. But I've never given a monster movie a good rating only because I'm biased towards it. This changed everything.
I don't even know where to start. The beginning sequence. The ending sequence. The family dynamic. The score. The VFX. The main character. And of course, Godzilla himself. I actually care about the characters here, and it was heartwarming seeing this disjointed family come together. Some might find this all a bit slow, but personally I was invested. I was never left wondering when the next Godzilla scene will take place. And of course, we have to talk about that. Godzilla in this movie is just, wow. He was not there to play games. He was not there to save the world against some world-ending threat. He was just a monster, there to cause destruction and make the characters we know suffer. Legitimately, this was the only time I remember wanting the humans to win and not the big old kaiju. There might be mixed feelings on his screen time, though. Some say he's got plenty to offer, while others say he's in it too little. My take is that if you take the term ""screentime"" literally, then yes, that lacks a bit here. But the thing is, he always feels like a threat. You can feel his presence. He's just lurking in the ocean, waiting for the next time to strike. And when he does come on screen, my god. He is terrifying and you will not be disappointed, even if it's a brief scene.
Many of us can agree he is more of a side character, which I can imagine a few people getting upset about. But what about the center of the story? The main character, Shikishima, is a failed kamikaze pilot. He deals with survivor's guilt and has trouble coming to the realization he's even alive. He's convinced he died back in the war, and his newfound life was just his last dream. I'm not going to spoil anything, but his character felt very complete and well written. His character development was straight up beautiful. The other stars of the show are a little girl, her adoptive mother, and a minesweeper crew. They all have their good moments and have a lot of heart and personality to them. 
This movie also has a very good score. It has hope, it has fear, it's haunting, it's grandiose. And of course, classical. The original Godzilla theme, is of course, used in the film. It is remastered, but it still keeps the feel and terror of the 1954 suite.
This movie cost less than 15 million dollars. Look what they did with that money. The average MonsterVerse movie costs around 200 million dollars. Look what they did with that money. The fact that the CGI cost just a mere fraction of a Hollywood movie and looks just as good, if not better than one, is mind-blowing. There are just shots where you are staring at Godzilla and his imposing figure. It really is mesmerizing. This should be the standard for modern movies.
So in my conclusion, this is my personal favorite Godzilla movie by far. It's a beautiful story that you will get lost in. I can only really see one small flaw with it, and that's how it is a bit overacted in some parts. But the more I think about this movie, the more I appreciate it. It's almost perfect. I came out of the theater only a couple of hours ago and I already feel like seeing it again. I can see myself rewatching this over and over again for years to come. And this review is not biased at all, I am giving my true and honest opinion. You will probably have a good time watching this movie even if you are not into kaiju movies. If you are into the goofy, more dumb fun monster flicks, I can't guarantee you'll like this film as much as others and I have. If you like more grounded, serious, but still light-hearted movies, I highly recommend it. Go see it before it leaves theaters, I'm honestly very happy I got to see it on the big screen because it truly was a big experience. I'm so happy about this film's success and I can only imagine how embarrassed Hollywood is right now. They really need to wake up."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,this is definitive Godzilla at its best. absolutely stunning incarnation.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Even better than the original. A real story with good character development. We really enjoyed it.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,An awesome godzilla movie great story.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Loved the character development.  Wonderful story.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente película, ya me la vi como 20 veces"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Plus 10!!!! Wow!!!!!!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is not perfect, visual effects could be better. But in everything else the movie is simply amazing."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally awesome film from the beginning to the very end. The character development, storyline and Godzilla meshed perfectly together."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Superb film, very hear felt, tense and emotion post world war 2 drama with real characters and great character development, as well as a great monster movie, impressive with the budget it had, need to be seen to believe it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Blows away any Godzilla movie from the last 25 years. The story and the action were awesome.  I'd see it again in theaters.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,wonderful story! nice pace! 2nd time seeing it in theaters! highly recommend!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una gran apuesta, que conservas la esencia de las películas clásicas de la franquicia con efectos especiales sumamente convincentes y una historia muy bien elaborada."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED this movie! A perfect tribute and celebration of the franchise 70-year history! A very serious treatment, with excellent casting, direction, and production. These are real characters with an emotional story to tell. Everyone involved in this project contributed masterfully. The original score is perfectly performed and aligned. The subtitling was also executed tremendously well (not a distraction of your attention - you stay immersed in the action and drama). HIGHLY recommend for every Gojira fan and absolutely anyone who has ever wondered what the ""big deal"" is. This is not camp, cheese, or silliness - it's an excellent homage to the franchise roots and reintroduction for current and future generations. Thank you TOHO and everyone involved!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Reminds me of the Original Godzilla movie starring Raymond Bur. Excellently done !
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encantó, super recomendado"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Que gran película ❤️🫶
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"They really stuck to the classic meaning of Godzilla, and they story, just everything was nothing short of perfection."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece, I am 14 rn and I watched godzilla since when I was 4, it was absolutely beautiful movie, perfect, perfect for godzilla fans, and non godzilla fans!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only best Godzilla movie ever made, but one of the best movies ever made period!   If you don't enjoy Godzilla for all its' wacky cheesiness, you'll find no cheese here. Just a fantastic story about characters you care about and want to protect."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película de un nivel al que el cine de acción y ciencia ficción no nos tiene acostumbrados (desde hace unos años).
Sublimes interpretaciones, llenas de sentimiento y garra, un guion perfectamente enlazado y trabajado, unos efectos especiales sorprendentemente realistas y eficaces (te metes en la película desde el minuto uno) y un drama de 10."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzila minus one, sin duda uno de los más grande exitos del cine, una película totalmente envolvente y que te deja sin aliento en el momento que la ves, súper recomendada sin ninguna duda...¡Maravillosa!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an outstanding movie, and a good alternative to the more over the top shenanigans of a Legendary Godzilla movie.  That's not a knock on those movies, I love the role they play also.  After Shin Godzilla, I was disappointed that it didn't get a sequel because it was so different and explored avenues that the franchise never had done before. I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the human characters in this movie.  For once I wasn't always anticipating the next Godzilla sighting.  That's not something you can usually say about a Godzilla movie and it wasn't that Godzilla wasn't exciting and incredible... it just was a great overall experience.  

You don't need to be a Godzilla fan to love this movie.  That's the biggest compliment a movie like this can earn."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great Godzilla movie! It recaptures the feel of the original where Godzilla is an existential threat to the people of Japan. Also no suit-nation here this Godzilla is executed with modern special effects that are scary and real. Godzillas initial appearance and indeed the whole movie is probably too intense for younger viewers. This is an adults Godzilla. And his appearances are rationed enough that you dont get used to his size and destructiveness. And since it is a period piece (set in the post war 1940s)It is also a window on postwar Japan and the hardships endured by its people. I find it better than the latest Warner Bros monster universe movies. You may genuinely be moved and cheer by the end. And yes its subtitled but it is not to me overwhelming and nor did it take me out of movie. I happy I go to see it on the big screen!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una excelente película la recomiendo demaciado no se la pueden perder
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Best remake of all of legendary monsters
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"La película me encantó sobre todo los gráficos los efectos especiales, la película es la mejor de la historia"

"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla: Minus One"" balances crazy monster action with story and heart. Unlike other Godzilla movies, this one has human characters that you care about. An absolute ride from start to finish."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie is a great visualization of post nuclear Japan. It also reflects on Japanese experiences, post war. And there's the added excitement of a giant monster wreaking havoc."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrific movie.  The visuals, story, acting, and overall vibe of the movie really pulled me in.  Glad I saw it in the theater to get a fuller experience.  I'm not a big subtitles person, but this didn't draw away from the movie at all.  Highly recommended."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing film incredible special eff3cts.  Take note Disney this is how to make a good and profitable movie
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best version of Godzilla I have seen in film, and the characters are well developed."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best movie I saw all year! Its a post war drama about guilt, sorrow and redemption that just happens to have a giant monster wreaking havoc.

The story is great, there are times you forget it's a Godzilla movie and this is not the Godzilla who is here to protect humans. Nope, this one is an absolute destructive menace.

Highly recommend even if you are not a fan of monster movies! See it on the biggest screen possible!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent. I've never been a big fan of Godzilla movies or similar monster movies. But this was quite the achievement. Godzilla has never felt more threatening and it's all due to the character work done here. We want the destruction to stop and the characters to win. This is intimate story that gives you a bit of everything.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,É perfeito  eles juntaram tudo que faz o filme bom
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genial, excelente 100% súper recomendada!!!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR THE DISASTERS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT WERE SILENT NIGHT AND THE SHIFT. Very happy with how fun this movie was, and how solidly-written and well paced it was! Godzilla was a fierce-looking badass, and I liked the human characters' stories. But what does the ""Minus One"" mean? Inquiring minds want to know. Video review: youtu.be/-WRgIy4eakw"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente película me encanto la recomiendo a hijos cerrados
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,well scripted logical action and rapid character development. Good intense action
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally enjoyable. LIke any 'zilla flick, of course, it has its campy side, like the monster standing somehow as it decimates ships in the middle of the ocean. But overall great monster, some surprisingly solid character development, a clear narrative arc, and interesting reflections of post-war Japan."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Consigue equilibrio entre arte y drama y es emocionante
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película realmente interesante, los escenarios son increíbles, todo parece tan real que te trasportar trasportar ella."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a well written story with Amazing effects. The period in what it was set is amazing. It is a no BS movie that stays on track with what its about.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Foi incrível assistir esse filme!!!
O drama humano faz sentido, até porque o Godzilla do Japão é para mostrar o quão destruidora eram as bombas usadas na guerra, e o quão aquilo afetava a vida das pessoas.

Só de estarem reutilizando a trilha sonora antiga do primeiro Godzilla de 45 já é algo espetacular, e ainda por cima foram lá e usaram a trilha sonora do Godzilla X Kong The new empire, o que ficou espetacular na cena em que a toca!!!

Os efeitos sonoros ficaram demais!

O Godzilla também ficou ótimo (e ficará ainda melhor caso houver continuação, com um orçamento um pouco maior), e tomara muito que isso aconteça, pois todos os fans e não fans irão adorar ver outros monstros aparecendo nessa trilogia do Godzilla do Japão!!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Japanese ww2 movie is good? shocking.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzila movie in all of them.An absolute must see.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Campy, sincere, emotional human story… Godzilla (especially his atomic breath) is awesome! Thank you Toho."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie with a surprising ending
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't understand the praise this film gets. Boring, disappointingly predictable, hammish script and acting, and it continually invalidates any build up of stakes. You could cut edit the film into a three-scene short film and it would be better."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"By a measure, the best Godzilla film yet. That measure is the film’s humanity and outstanding performances. The beast is a back-measure but never disappoints."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Whether your a Godzilla fan or not everyone can enjoy this movie. ✨
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the better Godzilla I've seen long time.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible effects. I could have done without the lame love story. 
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good depiction of Godzilla, and character development!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Godzilla movie.  Absolutely loved it.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The humanity was palpable and Godzilla the epitome of monstrous. A Japanese version of Jaws, if I were to compare."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, absolutely amazing"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute Perfection.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"incredible, must watch. Emotionally thrilling and powerful"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of the original Godzilla movies, you’ll appreciate this movie. Go see it!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Seeing Godzilla 2024 was almost like seeing Godzilla 1954 but without Raymond Burr.
 
Godzilla looked the same, almost like being brought in from the back lot storage for 70 years. The destruction scenes were a bit better, but only a bit.
 
This version is entirely spoken Japanese, captioned with English. It did remind me of the original, so if you've never seen the original, you may enjoy the throwback video.  I had seen the original several times but did enjoy this version."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow!! Such a good movie
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Possibly the greatest movie of the decade. The human story was almost as powerful as the Godzilla story. On the Edge of your seat the whole time !
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done for a Godzilla movie.  The acting was superb, and putting the story at the center of WWII was an excellent idea that gave the film heart.  All human emotions are on exhibit in this one."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had no clue what to expect from this movie. What a surprise it was great. I can remember when I was much much younger and saw the Raymond Burr dub in version. This movie used that old one as a script. It was like traveling back it time. As the movie progressed I was on the look out for similarities,  I  wasn't disappointed.  The sound track was the glue between the two movies. This was an updated version. I will be seeing it again. Awesome!!!!!!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I just don't see the appeal to this movie. If you are a huge Godzilla fan then go see it. If you are not it's a pass.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just a great monster and effects, but strong plot and endearing characters."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,exceptional storytelling. i'm going to see it for a second time!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Best action movie of 2023. Go see it in a loud theater. The sound mixing and vfx are fantastic.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The story of Godzilla Minus One was very good and the story was a little emotional but a very good movie. and I like the design of Godzilla. :) and the movie is my top 10 favorite ones of the year.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the call back to the original films.  I liked the care to historical detail.  I loved Godzilla.  The CGI for Godzilla was great and the atomic breath was so awesome.  I liked the symbiology and the characters.  The characters were better than in the other movies.  I loved it when Godzilla threw the boat.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie!!! Just like watching back in the day  but much better.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Es muy buena la pelicula 10 de 10
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was a well done return to Godzila's roots. A love story where the main characters overcome their past and find each other and redemption with a giant monster thrown in to add tension, suspense and trials for them."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing special effects and good beginning
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Just came back from the cinema. I actually cried. This is a drama movie first with some Godzilla sprinkled through.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent one of the best Godzilla movies EVER!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena película, grandes efectos especiales"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a must. My favorite movie of all time now.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Me encanto esta película no puedes dejar de verla!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,OMFGodzilla!!! You have to see this movie! Terrific! Human! Destruction! Godzilla!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"In short, Minus One is my favorite movie of the year, and possibly the best Godzilla movie I have seen. 

It does a fantastic job of creating characters that actually feel real and meaningful to the story. Where previous Godzilla movies have often had shallow or underwhelming characters that serve to bridge the gaps between scenes where the titular monster is on screen, Minus One has established a set of characters that genuinely feel like the primary focal point of the film. The characters are well-written and feel so legitimately human that they steal the show from Godzilla - something that works wonders for the pacing and narrative of the movie and makes Godzilla's actions feel much more meaningful. 

In addition, the visual effects of the movie feel phenomenal. Godzilla movies have a history of requiring some considerable suspension of disbelief to make the monsters feel real; this is a trend that I expected to see carried on into Minus One, especially with its incredibly small budget. However, the look of the movie is nothing short of phenomenal. I never felt like the movie was ever cutting corners or trying to keep its effects within budget. The shots of Godzilla and the general feel of the movie as a whole feel very similar to the original Godzilla, but put together in a way that holds up to the modern cinema standards. 

All together I personally feel like this is the best movie I've seen this year, and highly recommend anybody - not just Godzilla fans - to watch this entry into the series."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You've got to be kidding me!! Why is the ratings so good for this movie? Depressing, very little GODZILLA action and just sad sad sad....maybe this is what everybody likes now....I went to watch this because everyone rated it sooooo good....WHATS THE DEAL???? C'mon, I've totally lost my trust in Rotten tomatoes and anyone who reviews it now"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena la película.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,La película es muy buena e interesante lo que la hace demasiado interesante la recomiendo 100% a todo el público en general vale la pena verla
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! And definately the best movie I've seen this year and one of the best I've seen in a long time. The story was excellent, acting was great, CGI was good, especially considering the budget! Some parts did look unsual however they obviously stood true to the original design of godzilla. The atomic breath was undoubtly phenomenal!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una de las mejores pelis que he visto , me atrapa y me llena de emociones verla."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,raw.  emotionally charged.  fantastic in all regards.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente siemppre para disfrutar en familia y compartir con tu ser querido, imagenes fabulosas y un contexto extraordinrio"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Es súper emocionante muy recomendada para q la vean se las sujiero
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Que buena película es la recomiendo
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una muy buena pelicula tienes excelente es Cena de luchas y romances y tiene algo de exelencia en sus comedias
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie. It's different from the others with the same theme. The scenes are good and so are the actors
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente película !!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una pelicula espectacular, de las mejores para estos tiempos de poca calidad, la recomiendo bastante y es de prioridad para estaf en peremios y festivales. "
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the Greatest Godzilla Movie of all Time.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me pareció muy buena la película, la recomiendo para ver en familia"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pelicula, la calidad de actores es buena y tiene una historia que atrapa"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Seriously… unless you like a speed reading session, not enjoyable"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I usually never write reviews, but this one deserves it. The story is fantastic, the characters are fantastic, the CGI is amazing for the budget. I could go on forever so I'll stop. This movie feels like a modern version of the original Godzilla in the sense that it isn't overly Americanized with nonsense humans and destruction to mask a nonexistent story. Go watch this movie in theaters while you can. You will not regret it. This is the best Godzilla movie out right now (not including the anime trilogy, which is ultimate perfection)."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Exelente película la recomiendo a todos mis conocidos
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A phenomenal addition to the franchise. Godzilla: Minus One brings back the horror element of the franchise that the original movie introduced. Minus One has everything you would want from a monster movie, starting with a fantastic Godzilla design, intriguing characters, brilliant acting and a interesting plot!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The best monster/kaiju movie ever made hands down.  It is actually more of a drama with a human element anchored by incredible action scenes and special effects.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have given this a top rating and like all reviews, it is entirely subjective but I would like to offer some context first. 

As a Gen-X'r, I have grown disillusioned with movies over the past decade at least to the point where until seeing this film, I haven't been to the cinema for over six years. I know there has been good films out there over but having seen so many underwhelming movies over the years, I have turned to apathy due to fear of being let down again and just not bothered. 

I had heard a lot of positive things about Godzilla Minus One as a fan of Japanese entertainment and had decided to give it a chance once it was released here in the UK but when it did, I had got cold feet and decided not to bother. However, I had went to the cinema the other day to see this on an impulse and was blown away by it. 

I'm not going to do a in-depth review of this movie as other people have done such a better job but I want to describe my feelings about this, why I had given it such a high rating and why I have renewed faith in blockbusters now. 

It is simple that at the heart of this film, is not a monster going on a rampage but a disaster movie where a group of people are thrust into the destruction and mayhem caused by this monster and do their best to survive it. 

As the film focuses on the characters rather than overblown CGI and action sequences, I was sucked into the world of these characters, their fears, their problems and yes, their hopes for survival and it made me care for them  and become overcome by their emotional struggles. 

Sure, some of the heart string pulling has been done plenty of times before and parts of it is corny but the story is so strong, the direction brilliant and the acting amazing that it didn't bother me and I let myself get carried along on the whirlwind of emotions that the film threw at me. 

As I had mentioned at the start this is purely subjective and  if this film had come out at a time where the overall quality of movies is more superior as to what it is now, the film may not have had the same effect on me but it isn't and because of this, I feel justified in giving it such a high rating. 

I know people may be put of because it is a monster movie but I had said, it is more than that and is highly recommended to watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,An emphasis on story and plot. Wonderful cinematography. Godzilla is both magnificent and terrifying.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing the fact that this movie with less money actually did a better work than hollywood movies
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,De las mejores películas de godzilla
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A love letter to both the Japanese Godzilla and Hollywood blockbusters of old.  Larger than life, while still grounded by a hard hitting story of humanity that keeps the audience invested in the human characters.  If this is the future Toho envisions for Godzilla, I can't wait to see what happens next."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente película, entretenida y de muy buena calidad, grandes actores y excelentes efectos especiales."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Olha, eu acho que foi perfeito, o fato do godzilla começar em uma forma de dinossauro e evoluir para a forma monstruosa que vemos no meio do filme por causa dos americanos e tbm pelo filme acontecer em 1946 e não em 1954 como no filme original coloca um senso de realismo muito maior do que já foi estabelecido no de 54, o único problema do filme foi os efeitos especiais de algumas cenas, mas o filme é tão perfeito que ofusca completamente este erro."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One proved to be one of the highlights this year at Cineworld. It's surprisingly optimistic; exploring survivor's guilt and post-traumatic stress disorder. Takashi Yamazaki gets the balance spot on between drama and spectacle with a decent storyline. A movie that must be seen on the big screen.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Es muy buena la la página se la recomiendo al 100%
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor raio atômico do monstroverso está nesse filme !
Filme de bater bilheteria com baixo orçamento é por que realmente é excepcional."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was just incredible, first Godzilla movie to actually make me feel for the human characters in a while. Definitely one of, if not, the best Godzilla films to date, and it will probably become a timeless classic. Great tone setting, great moments of feeling despair along with the humans and that Atomic Breath scene in Ginza was just PHENOMENAL. The atomic breath was so powerful, the buildup was beautiful and so was the result of that long buildup. I won't drag this on, but I think most people will agree that this movie is a must-see movie for all people, Godzilla fan or not."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,You go to a monster movie and a masterpiece emotional movie breaks out. One of the best movies of the year. Unlike the schlock that is out the last few years. MUST SEE!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Just amazing!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the best Godzilla movie. It's the only one of them that's ever made me cry.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This is what Godzilla needs to be
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One ditches cliche monster movie tropes and focus's and a character driven narrative highlighted by tension provided by Godzilla himself.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever. We so enjoyed the dramatic acting and special effects 👌🏽
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing!  Unlike recent Godzilla movies, the creature in this movie as tangential to the story.  It was really about what makes a person brave and making the right decisions to show this.  Great acting, great visual effects, and great ending!!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"First time seeing a Godzilla film, and I highly enjoyed it."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A return to the roots. Gritty, raw, human emotions of post-war Japan, survival and guilt."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie. Excellent character development. Very good FX.  All around very enjoyable!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible story. Really feels like your a kid 20 years from now  in your living room watching your parents old Godzilla movies. 10/10
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!!! Being that I’m a Godzilla fan since I was a kid and my wife was not we both came out of the theater very impressed with how the movie was made 
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,truly as phenomenal of a war movie as it is a monster film. truly breathtaking
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie of all time. Really good movie!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was perfect. Absolutely perfect. That's really the only way to describe this movie. Surprisingly, it's the first Godzilla movie 70 years where the human protagonists are actually likable and sympathetic."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing!! The story with the human characters was so moving and heart breaking. I went in a few scenes. The king of monsters did not disappoint either. Definitely go see it!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fun from start to finished.. some parts had me in awww.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"omg, dude like this is amazing. i definitely prefer this over the american versions (no shade) it portrays godzilla in a light that we haven't done in so long. In some parts the cgi is spotty but it's overall the best godzilla film i've seen (so far as to make an account to give a good rating) 10/10 would recommend!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thank you for bringing this amazing story to the screen!

So for me the best movies I'm glad to have paid movie theatre prices for. This one I saw twice.

Can't wait to watch it again when it streams but if you haven't seen it in theatres you should!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of, it not the BEST movie of the year!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplesmente fantástico
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well done modern  version of an old classic. Interesting story line.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Word of mouth on this was great, so I had to make a trip to my local movie theater and see it for myself.
The online chatter was correct, this is a great entry into the Godzilla movie series.
It's mainly a post World War II drama with scattered appearances by the big lizard.
And it all works."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent story and performances were on point.. CGI was good but not great but that doesn't detract too much from a wonderful (go figure), well directed film."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent monster movie that also had an interesting and compelling human plot, which seems to be a rarity."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A good story with interesting subtext.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever! Best movie we have seen in a long time PERIOD. Surprised and happy to see Yuki Yamada in the movie. Been a fan since Mischievous Kiss!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilar Movie with original theme on the big screen.

If Hollywood can produce Jaws than Godzillar has found Japan! 

#TakashiYamazaki done a smashing job with this original  post-war theam, and yes Godzillar is terrifying, mean,  bad and ugly! 

It's not all about Godzillar, he's  carnage and distraction rather the unique ballance the  Japanese director  brings to the script, with  its centeral characters. The  drama is ausum. Takashi Yamazaki includs a fantastic love story twist; power of family and friendship that  Bollywood will take time to catch up with! 

Yes you will be on your toes but you will appreciate why Takashi Yamazaki took time to build up the key characters for and explosive and interesting ending! 

Let me know what you think. 

Its a 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Movie!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing.  You wouldn't expect to get sad from a Godzilla movie (other than 1954) but it made me quite emotional.  The characters are great, Godzilla is great, Visuals are great, Soundtrack is great.  Please, watch the movie."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was well made. Pretty dark tonally which was is vastly different than any of the other Godzilla films Ive seen. Was really surprised and worth a trip to see it in the theater.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The best representation of Godzilla.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Still think the 1954 movie is better but this was entertaining.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good movie, 100% recommended, it has  good moments of action, but when godzilla appears for the first time, cool"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!!! Best movie of the year.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,good but a little long
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ive seen most of the Godzilla movies (including the original and Hollywood), and I would say this is the best.
This one is focused more on the human drama, which is believable/relatable, and adding to that, the Godzilla was terrifying with good CG technology.  Some audiences gave some applause at the end, and so did I."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie!   The visuals and story were great.  The characters within the movie were also engaging.  Really glad I saw it at the theater to enjoy being fully immersed in the fun!  Recommended!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie. Best movie I have seen in theaters in a long time.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película, me entrevé viéndola con mi esposa, la recomiendo"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,1 tenth the budget and way better than anything Hollywood dreams of producing
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,So good and emotional. My favorite Godzilla movie so far.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies of the year!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Movie was a great work of TOHO studios. This one goes years before the Original 1954 movie. This one where the Japanese had no Aircraft and old out dated tanks, also there war Ships were the weapons had been removed this was only a couple of years after WWll. This was the agreement with the The Allied Nations."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Well acted well directed well edited a little slow at a few different points but just an excellent movie all around
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genial, muy entretenida. Mucho suspenso"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than anything coming out of Hollywood...
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie of the year and it's not even close. I went to watch a monster movie and got a heartfelt movie about the human wartime struggle and survivors guilt. A modern masterpiece. Go see it if you can.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente película... 😍
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is very good
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Eselente pelicula yo soy amante a las películas de acción y no avía visto una película tan buena la cual puedes ver sin desprenderse de la pantalla desde que empieza asta que termina buena para ver con tus hijos esposo papá mamá o amigos los invitamos a verla es muy buena
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great kaiju monster film, and also a surprisingly emotionally dramatic film about a young man coming to terms with war trauma."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película que combina suspenso,ficción y realidad de una manera bastante distinta
Trasmite muchas emociones y es perfecta para ver con toda la familia 
Es muy buena película la recomiendo"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me parecio exelelente, la forma en que fue creada y el diseño, muy bueno"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fue interesante, quede con ganas de volver a verla 🤭"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Una gran película va a ser la mejor de todas en el cine de estas temporada
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love Godzilla as well as the strong themes that thread through the entire cinematic universe. In Godzilla Minus One, the characters and storytelling are compelling. Watching the struggles evoked so many emotions. The action had me awe struck as well. There were many scenes that were shot so brilliantly, I noticed in the moment just how perfect that were.  This is a must see if you love Godzilla, but also if you love a great story depicting the struggles that many people go through every day."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me parece una muy buena película, me gustó mucho y ya es una de mis películas favoritas, sin duda  la recomiendo."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película, me parece bastante interesante como muestran al villano con una historia muy detallada de este. Sinceramente 10/10 y bastante calidosa.

<3"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest monster movie ever!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Una película muy entretenida para ver en familia.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Me párese una excelente película por su contenido .y muchos niños la miran .claro y adultos.pues la verdad me quedo corta de palabras
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena, la recomiendo al 1000% sin duda alguna veanla"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Es excelente está escena es impresionante que se siga la trologia sin dejar otra atrás no se podía esperar menos de estás películas ecxelente y encantado con ella
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an incredible film from start to finish and was firing on all cylinders with the writing, directing, and acting. Such an interesting take on the Godzilla franchise that we haven't seen in a while with the recent Hollywood adaptations. The human story line and character development were as good as it gets and Hollywood could certainly learn a thing or two from it. Definitely a must watch in theaters if you can. It's easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best Godzilla movies ever. If only this film had been marketed in the US it could have blown up so much bigger, but most people didn't even know it was in theaters."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película súper buena y entretenida, sirve para todo tipo de situaciones, no aburre y aparte de eso no es tan larga ni tan corta, súper recomendable, súper buena, es súper la película..."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Emocionante historia de kaiju con muertes y destrucción masiva.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A amazing story about the pain of war and the trauma that followed after it, getting down to what Godzilla was always supposed to be a monster that means something. A must see movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic all around movie that anyone can enjoy. A fun action war movie that's full of heart and creativity while also quite grounded and personal (for a movie with a giant atomic Lizard that is.) It does get a bit goofy here and there but surprisingly you will buy into the majority of the movie. Little to criticize, much to love here from yet another GREAT Godzilla film!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was incredible what the director did with such a small budget. The destruction caused by godzilla atomic breath was on whole other level. It was like him dropping another atomic bomb on Japan.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than I expected, wonderful cinematography and the storyline was moving. Would watch again just for the special effects. 10/10"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I was nervous with the subtitles. Absolutely worth it. Best monster movie in a long time. And I actually felt connected with the characters!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen this movie four times and I now am confident that it is the best Godzilla movie ever, surpassing the original. The story is one of personal honor and family, built around The King's appearance near Japan at the end of World War II. The acting is superb. Everything is treated seriously it's not like the cartoonish Godzilla movies of the 1960s. It offers a new perspective of Godzilla's threat: several instances show him menacing ships at sea. The CGI images of him raising hell on land are magnificent. And there's nothing quite like watching half of a Navy destroyer coming flying across the screen after Godzilla has ripped it apart and thrown it away. It's not simply an exceptional Godzilla movie. It's not simply a good science fiction movie. It's an outstanding movie period...."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest godzilla movies to be made with not only a action fuelled kaiju destruction but with a compelling human story which is a rarity for a kaiju film. the design of minusgoji is also quite amazing combining pieces of past form with a modern feel. you should watch now.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent. Truly great storytelling and the special effects are mind blowing. Highly recommended to see on the big screen. Minus One truly delivered a must-see movie.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie so far in my opinion. Great story arc, characters you feel invested in and of course great monster action too."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,its amazing movies remake from 1954
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,If you are a movie person who watches movies not in to godzilla that much this could make you love the godzilla franchise. the film is just amazing. also keep in mind this film has a budget less than $15M and is far better than any hollywood blockbuster film. it wont make much on box office because its underrated asf and the score dont even get me started on that IT IS AMAZING.  all the fans giving it so much praise is hart warming. go watch this film now!!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The 3rd act was just breath taking and the movie itself is just amazing not a single shot I was board I was always invested in the story chareters and world
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie itself exceeded my expectations. I came into it thinking it would be mainly an action movie, but was pleasantly surprised with the nuance and emotional take that the audience felt. The one thing I will say, though is I was a bit taken out of the movie when we first see a full body shot of Godzilla. I believe that the form and shape of his body in this movie was an interesting choice."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow! This Movie hit all the notes. Not only does it look like it was filmed in the 1950's the cinematography is fantastic! The flying sequences containing the main character are so well filmed they catch the spirit of many of the old Japanese samurai pictures. in fact that tone punctuates the whole movie. The casting is superb and even minor characters stand out and deliver a punch. There isn't one goofy special effect shot anywhere. If you like the genre then only one word describes this movie. Outstanding!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,No words can describe. Breathtaking.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie makes you feel immersed into the humans' lore and care enough about them to feel absolute terror and anxiety whenever Godzilla is on screen. Left my eyes wide, my chin hanged and tears in my eyes. The writing and the visual effects make Minus One a must watch Godzilla movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing film! Waited 39 years for a movie like this!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie to date.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Over acting was a bit much
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,this is a true movie.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie was absolutely horrible! Godzilla on screen for a total of 20 minutes. The lead character cried the rest of the entire movie. The film and special effects were middle school theater class quality. Completely low budget. Launching a Japanese movie in US market in Japanese with subtitles is lazy film making, marketing, and editing!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brazil - Portuguese
A cinematografia extraordinária, desde os ângulos, detalhes e efeitos, o Godzilla em si tem aquele tom nostálgico incrível do primeiro filme, tanto quanto a formatação e trilha sonora, sem dizer que a história dos personagens é profunda e interessante. Filme sensacional. 10/10"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute Masterpiece start to finish. 
A Godzilla Movie where you're actually sympathetic to the Human characters? I didn't think it could be done.

It's an absolute triumph!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really surprised that the movie was this good, even with the subtitles! had great story aside from Godzilla wrecking havoc, My grandkids loved it."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best Godzilla movie ever and I have seen them all.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing telling of the story with the focus being on the people rather than feeling they were in the way of the story as they do in the current American remakes.  Gripping, beautiful portrayal and incredible effects, especially considering the budget."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing story, every second was entertaining. By far the best character story in a Godzilla movie EVER. CGI was absolutely amazing especially for a 15m budget."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was beyond amazing to me. I haven't seen all godzilla films but this one is by far is the best godzilla movie ive seen. Its one of the most tragic, heartfelt, emotionally engaging, dramatic and beautiful movie ive watched. The story was incredible, the acting, the cgi, the effects, the music, It was just incredible!!"
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One was amazing. I was unsure what to expect when going in, but I am glad I went. Amazing."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Besides being one of the best Godzilla movies, it's one of the best movies made.  Even my 8 year old grandson, who kinda kept up with the subtitles said it was a great movie."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simplesmente, incrível! 

Com toda certeza, meu melhor filme do ano. Não esperava nada e foi entregue tudo. O primeiro filme de ""monstro gigante"" que realmente faz com que nos importamos com os humanos, torcendo até mesmo contra o Godzilla."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"While I typically haven't gone to movies with subtitles, I was very happy that I chose to go to this one. I'm a big fan of movies of this genre, so I may be a bit biased, but the film stitched together a great storyline with wonderful graphics. There was not too much CGI that has made other movies seem cartoonish, the acting was appropriate and when our dear friend Godzilla is on-screen, it is truly intimidating and jarring.  The dialog is just enough to become engaged with the characters and feel for them as they pursue their goals. The subtitles are well spaced that you don't feel you're reading versus watching a movie. Ultimately, the two hours flew by and I would highly recommend this film."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever. Atomic breath scene was terrifying and awesome. It is a must-see movie.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Está muy bien la volvería abre buena película
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing film! Easily in my top 3 films of the year
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie. Best movie I've seen in years. Definitely a message to w.o.k.e Hollywood. We don't need $150 million dollar budgets, overdone on the CGI, and force fed messages and narratives. Just a great story and characters. Can't wait to get the 4k Blu ray.."
"Dec 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Honestly I expected this to be a phenomenal ""Godzilla""installment, but was disappointed. The after effects of Japan losing the Great War is interesting and the storyline of a kamikaze pilot who ""failed"" was new, but overall it was lacking the overall UMPH! to make this THE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE OF ALL TIME.....Not even close."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Estupendo guión y con muy buenos efectos especiales
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Me gustaría poder ver más de estás películas están buenas
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was far and away the best movie of 2023 and quite possibly the best Godzilla movie. The characters were so well written and acted perfectly, it really made me care about the story more than just the specticale of Godzilla."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hollywood shall learn how to make great monster movies, it's not always about CGI and how good your actors are in portraying their role only, it's about the chemistry and how they are invested in the whole screenplay."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gran pelicula, buenos efectos la mejor que hay de Godzilla"
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente película me encanta
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with a solid plot that doesn't need to rely on any gimmicks. The story is well executed and the cg is amazing.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is one of the most gripping and satisfying Godzilla movies I have ever seen. As a huge Godzilla fan I would have to say that this movie has become my all time favorite Godzilla film. What makes this movie standout from the rest of the previous Godzilla movies are the human characters. For the first time I actually cared about and was moved by the story of our main characters. You feel for all the characters of this film and are at the edge of your seat every time the big guy appears on screen. This is definitely a movie that needs to be seen in the theaters.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie with great effects
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very slow, too much whining and crying, unlikeable main character, and left much to be desired. I honestly wonder if I watched the same movie as all the other people who wrote reviews"
"Dec 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,STORY LINE WAS AVERAGE AND COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE ACTION... DEFIINITE A LULL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOIVE.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever! A perfect film.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best godzilla movie, including the original."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one speaks on many levels, it's not a simply monster movie, it aim at personal fear as we  face and reflect our own monsters in life (fear). Very emotional movie and perfect character development."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first time Godzilla has been scary in a long time, the plot is amazing as well,  the character writing is amazing too. The perfect movie."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Fire. The plot is the reason why this film should win an Oscar. 
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful and brilliant film! I love the mix of history, traditional Japanese cinematography, music, campiness, and fantastic story telling that brings this to life.  It's not over the top CGI or camera tricks, just honest fun and filmmaking."
"Dec 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the best GZ movies to date.  Really fresh take on the Japanese perspective although elements of the story are a bit too formulaic
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie with actually amazing human characters. Normally in Godzilla movies I don't care about humans, but that doesn't apply to this one."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best action and emotional movies of the year
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,oh god i was BALLIN!!!
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was AMAZING!!! Go see it in a theatre while you can!!
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched for a second time! Loved it!
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was hands down the best monster movie and the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. And I've seen them all. This was stunning. I highly suggest anybody even non-fans of Godzilla see this movie cuz it's really really well made.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,really enjoyed the movie with my wife. great action and a compelling found family story wrapped in one
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is great, although it starts off slow at the beginning, it picks up speed when Godzilla makes an intimidating and terrifying appearance."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplesmente espetacular
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I’ve seen all the showa films, the 80s, 90s, and american films, this is one of the best godzilla movies i’ve seen."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER!!!!! THE STORY WAS AWESOME! ACTION AWESOME! WOW!
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie. Well crafted, with a unique human story. First time I have seen the Kaiju story line enhance the human story. Should be best foreign film of the year and maybe a nomination for best film as well."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Well written and brilliantly acted movie. I was entertained through out - worth seeing.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My new favorite Godzilla movie and my film of the year. This is what Godzilla should be. An epic ode to the origin of the giant lizard monster.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,As a long time Godzilla fan this movie is fantastic. A must see.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie!
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great story on many levels. Great humanity and action in the same movie.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome killer classic monster movie of epic proportions!
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla will never die
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love that Godzilla looks like an actor in a giant rubber suit while also somehow looking streamlined with excellent CGI. The character story is definitely cheesy and full of hero drama tropes characteristic of this type of action film. But it's the perfect level of drama for the type of film it is. The whole theatre ended up cheering out loud for Shikishima, Noriko and little Akiko, so it obviously was effective story telling! Definitelya solid 4.5/5!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one is a true kaiju masterpiece. Good Godzilla action with a truly heartwarming and compelling story filled with grief and anguish, and the metaphor of what war actually brings.  the awesome sound editing in the film is truly enriching you can actually feel like you're actually there and you're gripping on the edge of your seat when you see the destruction that Godzilla brings And the havoc and destruction that is afterwards, you truly feel it. This is finally old-school Godzilla back on the big screen and it's truly one of the best Godzilla films ever made right up there with the original 1954 classic."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the most impactful Godzilla movie I can remember seeing since the original; both the U.S. version with Raymond Burr spliced into the Japanese cut of the film for the sake of American audiences and a subtitled version of the original film I now realize I need to re-watch. An excellent way to spend time at a cinema!
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena pelicula de accion
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie. Very well produced and directed. The effects were amazing and the way they captured the emotions, and thoughts of the cSast were amazing. Godzilla was a Beast! The design and overall physiology of him were second to none. The overall plot and how it all tied in were phenomenal!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The greatest Godzilla movie ever made. It did Godzilla right, and it did all the humans right."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una exelente película, recomendada totalmente."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the greatest and most story driven Godzilla movie I have seen in a while, I love most Godzilla movies but this is just on another level."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been a Godzilla fan all my life, and have seen many different interpretations and directions for the movie and character to go. This is easily one of the best, if not the best I've ever seen since the original! You don't even have to be a Godzilla fan to appreciate this one, absolutely epic mastery and vision for what Godzilla is and means! 100 percent must see movie and a breath of fresh air for what movies have been over the past decade which is over uses and bad CGI in the laziest writing and acting era  ever. This one has everything you wants movie to have and then some! Saw it 2x!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The Mc should of called Kamen Rider Agito to beat Godzilla
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una verdadera obra maestra, doy las gracias por el cariño la producción y los efectos de esta película.esto demuestra que no es necesario explosiónes sin sentido y efectos x doquier. Una trama muy bien contada. La pena es qu no viene doblada"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"An awesome Kaiju Movie with just 15 Million Budget Shows up what went wrong in Hollywood. 

Godzilla is badass like never before and the movie is full of emotions and breathtaking Godzilla animations. This is the way!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a standalone Godzilla movie from Japan. It brings the franchise back to its roots where Godzilla is a monstrous force of nature, an allegory of war. While I do love the Western Monsterverse franchise, it is mostly for seeing Godzilla or Kong fight another giant monster. The writing and characters have never been a highlight in that universe. Does Godzilla Minus One deliver more than the Monsterverse?

Firstly, Godzilla's design is spectacularly frightening, his roar is menacing and his heat rays are some of the best and most impactful blasts I've seen from Godzilla. Every Godzilla action set piece is terrifying and tense. I love how these sequences are filmed from a human perspective, so we get to truly see the scale and how dangerous Godzilla is. The music score by Naoki Sato is phenomenal! His subtle orchestral score compliments the scene and illustrates the pain and struggles that Japanese people in WW2 went through. He then uses a strong powerful orchestral score for Godzilla to show how he is bringing back the pain again. His use of the Godzilla theme is effective every time. The visuals and cinematography look great while the CGI can be a bit wonky sometimes, for the most part, it looks good. Especially for Godzilla who looks awesome. It is honestly astounding how good this film looks for a movie under a $15 million budget.

What this film succeeds at in comparison to Western Godzilla movies, is having compelling human characters that you truly care about. The characters are all suffering in some way from World War 2, whether it is PTSD or loss. You're watching these characters try to overcome and push through this dark period. The camaraderie and family dynamic is at the core of all the characters and it is extremely touching to watch. I was especially rooting for the main character to get development just because I wanted to see him be happy. That is why for the first time, I was rooting for Godzilla to lose as I didn't want to see our characters get hurt. I also love how the story doesn't shy away from the negative aspects of Japan's government during WW2. The human drama is wonderfully engaging and can even tug at the emotional strings which is such an achievement in a Godzilla movie.

Overall, Godzilla Minus One is not only a terrific Godzilla movie, it's an amazing movie period. This movie shows that you can tell a great story with great characters and still have Godzilla as a major element. Not only that, you can still make a great looking movie with good CGI on a low budget. The CG in this movie looks better than a lot of these western movies with 200 or 300 million budgets. Godzilla Minus One is must watch and I highly recommend going to a theatre near you to experience it in all its glory!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is quite simply the best Godzilla movie to date! It handles the same themes as the 1954 original, but better. This film addresses the human cost of war, defeat, and tragedy with a level of passion and honesty that the original was simply not allowed to."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Characters were actually compelling, writing was quite good, and the appearances of Godzilla were awe-inducing and even a bit frightening at times. Puts Hollywood to shame, and with far less of a budget than any dedicated blockbuster. Must-see."
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe I missed it, but I hate trying to read a movie. If that was the case, I would read the book instead. Reading and watching at the same time is annoying."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A diferencia de las otras películas de Godzilla, esta me ah sorprendido bastante! muy buena pelicula, vale la pena verla."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Exelente película la recomiendo totalmente
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Modern reincarnation of the 1954 classic that preserves the themes that make 1950s Sci Fi so beloved, but modernized for a new generation.  This is classic Godzilla, force of nature and destroyer."
"Dec 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nothing happens until the last 15 minutes of the movie.
Well made movie, no doubt.
But little suspence.
Too simplistic in how it developed characters.
The last scene is average/ok. Nothing to write home about.
The first 80 minutes were laborious/dull/slow."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I never expected a Godzilla movie to be legitimately AMAZING... and I love Godzilla! Haha
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, this thing is severely overrated. Besides some excellent special effects, the acting is pretty lame and it's slow."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not know what to expect, but certainly a masterpeice on human emotion, shame, culture and war was not in my imagination. This was beyond a movie i have ever seen, the emotion, storytelling, and hope it brings you, makes you question so much of your surroundings. How much do we suffer because we think we should? This movie is truly one i will never forget, and it reminds me of the magic of a movie done with love, passion and a story to tell. Thank you for this dream come true of a movie, and for making me feel and want to be alive. ( a nod to the characters theme)"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a fantastic movie and displays incredible moviemaking and storytelling. I'm just amazed to see a Godzilla movie where Godzilla is secondary to the characters and everything they're already facing.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the Godzilla movie we've been waiting for.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta buenísima la película muy entretenida
"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023! The characters have such depth and interact with such emotion. Godzilla was fantastic wasnt cheesy or bad looking. It was a very intelligent movie where the characters actually think of how to combat Godzilla instead of shooting it nonstop even though it doesnt do anything like other entries in the series. It is a bit odd watching an entire movie in Japanese but after the first few minutes I didnt even realize I was reading subtitles. Way better than anything Hollywood has created since EndGame.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This rebirth of Goji was one that we never knew we needed until we got it. Paying homage to earlier iterations but also branching out with new ideas and stories.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was almost a perfect movie. but it is the best godzilla movie. And it's the best movie of the year.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best films I've seen all year. This is probably the first time I've seen a Godzilla film that was focused more on the people than the monster and you became invested in what happened to them. That speaks volumes to the writers as well as the actors.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece, pure cinema. A Godzilla movie that makes you actually care about the human characters and is just such an overall compelling story. Meant to be watched in theaters, such a beautiful film. One of the, if not the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. Dont listen to Adam's review, he doesnt know what a true movie is. Please, do yourselves a favor and go watch this movie. You won't regret a damn thing."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"OUTSTANDING!! Possibly one of, if not the, best Godzilla movie made. Not to mention the meager budget it was made with. Hollywood needs to take some notes o this one!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película, entretenida para ver con la familia"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzilla movie of all time 10/10
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm a big Godzilla fan of the originals
Was very excited to see this, I think they executed it very well for the $15m budget but in the end it really was just an average Godzilla film"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This filme is Like perfect,An Good ilumination Actors that act Perfectly,An Good History,Perfect Scenes,Just Go watch."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely incredible movie. One where you actually care about the human story. Everything from the music to the acting was excellent. A must see do not be afraid of subtitles it is not a lot of reading
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The perfect monster movie, a true masterpiece that deserves to smash the billion dollar box office bar. It has to be seen at the cinema to get the proper Godzilla experience. Cannot wait to watch it on blu-ray at home"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,God damn! Gozilla is terrifying and broken. Stories of human characters shed tears through and through. A beautiful movie!
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This isn't just a great Godzilla movie, it's a great movie in general and one of my favourites of the year. It seamlessly blends modern action with the feel and spirit of the originals. Not only is this the best-looking Godzilla, but it's also the most badass and terrifying one too. The human characters are all so real and fleshed out, that by the end it's so satisfying to see the conclusion."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Japanese historical WWII drama which happens to feature a giant lizard.  The plot plays out as expected but has a more traditional style, focusing on the characters as they struggle to deal with the aftermath of the war and a new threat of the giant monster.  Cultural issues such as the virtues of honor and survivors guilt are well portrayed by the varied cast of characters, but it does make it a bit slow to get going and some scenes felt labored.  Godzilla itself looks impressively menacing and the special effects and scale of destruction invokes shock and awe.  Great use of music and an emotional ending, even if it was a bit too happy."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is what you should expect from a Godzilla movie.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"a healthy amount of monster fun and human drama, and a tad more brutal then most Godzilla movies I have seen. definitely a really fun and epic watch."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absoluto cinema, faz jus ao original de 1954. Excelente história sobre um núcleo familiar em que nenhuma pessoa tem relação sanguínea, senso de comunidade, crítica de como o estado tratou sua população e os traumas de um ""ex"" kamikaze julgado pelos outros e acredita não merecer ser feliz. o Godzilla é assustador e dá agonia vê lo como uma força imparável e pode matar qualquer um a qualquer momento."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s just a good movie.  Perfect
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A love letter to Japan. In all its grand, stained glory. A film that honors its survivors and encourages unity, courage, strength, honor and most importantly, redemption. To live not for yourself but for those who will come after, promising them a better future. Oh and it’s also a monster film too hahahah. The CGI is gritty and impressive. I was stunned and the story line is engaging. It’s a different Godzilla movie. Also, the ending - although not so epic as our American counterpart, has an interesting resolution not seen on the big screen. Some of the acting teeters to overt BUT each character has a moment of growth and that’s powerful to see. "
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little slow through the middle, but more than makes up for it with the emotional ending."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have to say, this was about as perfect, and balanced that a film can be nowadays. It had a great story, filled with emotion, good characters. I've been watching Godzilla movies since the early 80's, and this is about the best one I've seen."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,this type of Godzilla movie is the best. it was almost as good as shin Godzilla. i loved it.
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't like this movie at all.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was amazing! Absolutely breathtaking, I was on the edge of my seat the whole film!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story telling and fantastic visuals, an easy 10/10 for me!! Bravo Takashi Yamazaki!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,that was probably the best toho (old school) style  godzilla movies and there's probably gonna be a part 2
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wasn't aware this movie had came out a few days after its release in North America. Been a big Godzilla fan since I can remember and was not sure if I was going to see it theaters. I watched the all 3 trailers and a couple of spoiler free reviews on YouTube, and saw how much love and hype this movie was receiving, so I figured, ""Why not?"". I went last Sunday and to say that I even cried in a movie, let alone a Godzilla film says a lot to me about this movie. So well I got a group of 3 friends and invited my mother out last Tuesday since she got me into the franchise as far back as I could remember. This is my second favorite movie behind Jurassic Park, and the only movie I've paid to see more than once. To Mr. Takashi Yamazaki, sincere thank you for bringing Godzilla home and the phenomenal work you did on this film. You have a created a masterpiece of a film. I hope Toho continues to work with you."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the story, CG was amazing.   Cannot wait for the next one."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Favorite film of 2023!
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Out of all the Godzilla movies, this is the best one hands down!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Was definitely a top 5 movie for me this year
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good very very good enough said
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Both thrilling and dramatic, with amazing visual effects. This is Godzilla like you've never seen him before."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great  human story .
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,WOW.. great movie... back to its roots!  love the Japanese versions always BETTER than American Hollywood garbage
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good story line and not a bad movie at all but it annoys me when movie characters make stupid decisions that could have saved them it makes no sense
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a deep investigation of grief, guilt, and Godzilla."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't normally cry during movies, but this one got me good"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 my brother said he wanted to watch this movie so we ended up watching it and it was the best. Recommend for u guys to watch it
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie I've ever seen.  The story is very touching and special effects are amazing.  Looking straight up to into the face of a 100' Godzilla is scary, especially on the movie screen."
"Dec 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is over-rated. Some of the acting was pretty terrible and the effects weren't very good. Don't get me wrong it wasn't all bad, but when I see scores over 90 percent I was expecting something better than slightly above average. Now comparing this movie to Godzilla 1985, then I would agree to the high praise."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Toho has gone back to its original roots. I could have not asked for a better Godzilla film.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Scariest-looking Godzilla ever. Great effects. Loved the pacing… lots of quiet, human moments interspersed with suspense and mayhem. My teen and tween loved it too."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ture to the Godzilla story line, excellent special effects and it's the 70th anniversary edition."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,La película está muy buena se las recomiendo
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"La mejor película que he visto de Godzilla, me gusto mucho. Creo que supera por mucho las que fueron creadas por hollywood."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest Godzilla movies ever made. Acting was top tier
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Pienso que es una gran película lleno de emociones con excelentes efectos la recomiendo
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The effects were good but the human story really made this one of the best G movies ever.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,even better than the 1939 classic awesome story line Godzilla does major destruction the only way Godzilla can bets monster movie version to date
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The only Godzilla movie to make you care about the humans. Western interpretation can't even begin to compare in terms of writing or direction.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Está película es extraordinario solo me bastaron los primeros minutos para que no dejará de verla y llegar al final muy satisfecho, la recomiendo al 100%"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una muy buena película de acción y emocionante además de muy buenos efectos
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than any US made film
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Best Godzilla movie ever with a real emotional human drama interwoven. Great story, superb acting. I also think this has the best incarnation of Godzilla ever - don't make this Godzilla angry. I didn't mind the subtitles on this particular movie because, let's face it, Godzilla is a product of Japan and in many ways the Japanese language made the movie feel even more authentic to me."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena película tiene una trama muy interesante
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é maravilhoso, retrata o desespero e sofrimento dos japoneses pós guerra, porém com uma criatura que imerge do oceano para piorar a situação. Com isso, o Japão foi de 0 a -1.
Esse é o tipo de filme que supera as expectativas e trás a verdadeira identidade do Godzilla e oque ele pode causar."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie reminded me of the old Godzilla movies. Only thing I dislike was people in the theater couldnt be quiet during the movie.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the characters, loved the action. By far the best Japanese godzilla film"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a fantastic movie for 15 Mio. $ ... Hollywood should be ashamed spending much more money on so bad movies in the last time. Great characters, greatt story, fantastic camera. For me movie of the year."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is my top Godzilla movie now!
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla ever made!!!
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una buena revisión del tema original, excelentes escenas con el Monstruo, gran trama humana. De lo mejor que he visto en el género en un buen rato."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película fantástica una de las mejores la tensión y lo épico que es por los personajes que se presentan dentro de un escenario espectacular, los efectos de sonido que hacen como si estuvieras en ese lugar, los personajes que se presentan son de gran categoría y también las secuencias de acción que tiene esta película recomendable"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena recomiendo la trama envuelve desde el comienzo. De la película 
Genial para todas las edades... perfecta para un fin se semana"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well done. The combination of Japan at its lowest state in history, people coping as best as they could, then having Gojira show up worked. My only complaint is that the director should have had occupying troops in the background as they were common in Tokyo at that time, especially in the Ginza area where the Wako Department store had been made a PX. They at least did show the PX sign."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant storywriting, really captures grief, guilt, and shock realistically. Some suspense was ruined because you knew something good was going to happen but the dramatic scenes still were adrenaline filled despite that."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie with characters you care about. Also Godzilla is there.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie I've seen. Good story and well developed characters, in addition to the usual monster rampage. Particularly liked the way  Godzilla looked close to his original incarnation and wasn't reinvented."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,When I saw the trailer I thought this would be a definite no for me. I couldn't do with 2 hours of a large creature destroying downtown Tokyo. Following that I did listen to a review which indicated that there was so much more to this film. Hence today I thought I would give it a try. Glad I did. It offered so much more & is the best Godzilla movie I've seen.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, definitely the best Godzilla film I have seen, great story and it's cool it's set during ww2"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"My One Minute Review
https://youtube.com/shorts/HxKOej-VpvA?feature=share"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Godzilla movie! My 2nd favorite of the year in general.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is hands down the best movie of the year. The characters, the story, the message, the visuals, it leaves absolutely nothing to be desired. And unlike Oppenheimer, I didn't look at the time once while watching Minus One. If you can get over the one inch barrier of subtitles then you definitely need to watch this movie"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"My take on this movie was an absolute jaw dropping experience from the start! Easily the best Godzilla adaptation I have ever watched, not too mention a real human story was mixed in to keep the viewers interested on not only a Godzilla appearance, but an understanding of the human characters in the process. I would watch this again and again. Destined to become a real classic!"
"Dec 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Subtitles the entire movie, slow but was ok."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well written, classic Godzilla!!"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie period. Great story, good acting, layers of meaning, relatable and timeless."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had be speechless from start to finish, got me crying and caring for the people like the original Gojira. When the credits rolled, I wanted to give it an standing ovation so badly. My movie of the year, and rose my standards for how movies should be from now on, because of it's intense situations, fear for the people, and creative storytelling that will get you wanting to watch it for  the first time again."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a big fan of subtitles, but this was FAR better than any Hollywood Godzilla film."
"Dec 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok story. Mostly bad cringeworthy acting. Not sure why they (subtitles) kept saying fighter jets instead of fighter planes, it’s post WW2."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rivals 1954 as the greatest Goji movie to date. As harrowing as the original, told through the POV of a struggling survivor of WW2, a kaiju movie that will move you to tears."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. You really connect with the human characters. I already watched it three times in the cinema and I cried every single time. An absolute masterpiece and must see.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done war movie.  Nice to see it done in old style with no fake special effects.
Provides different history other than Hollywood prospective."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is hands-down THE BEST Godzilla film ever
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"No Japão pós-guerra, devastado pelos ataques aéreos, vai se reconstruindo, até que uma criatura gigantesca emerge do fundo do mar, despertada pelos testes atômicos no Atol de Bikini, e o Japão está no seu caminho. Decididamente, os Estados Unidos não conseguem desenvolver filmes envolvendo os famosos kaijus e, em especial, o Godzilla. Tivemos vários filmes americanos com o monstro, desde a iguana anabolizada do Roland Emmerich, até este último no encontro com King Kong. Agora temos aqui uma película que custou US$ 15 milhões e tem uma CGI muito melhor que todos os filmes americanos com o Godzilla, principalmente porque as cenas com efeitos são de dia e não de noite. Outro ponto: a participação dos personagens humanos. Os filmes americanos enchem com personagens desinteressantes e sem nenhuma empatia com o público. Este filme tem um personagem principal, que tem todo um arco bem desenvolvido. Você se interessa por ele, ele te emociona, mesmo em momentos em que parece manter as pessoas afastadas dele. O seu entorno também possui personagens secundários que nos emociona como a Noriko de Minami Hanabe, a vizinha dele,ou os seus colegas do barco caça-minas onde ele vai trabalhar. E todos são bons atores. Takashi Yamazaki fez um filme de kaiju, com excelentes personagens, críticas sociais tanto ao Japão da época quanto a política dos Estados Unidos, mais preocupado na Guerra Fria com a União Soviética, excelente elenco, CGI admirável, boa reconstituição de época. Você teme pela vida das pessoas mesmo que sejam apenas figurantes. Há destruição. E, principalmente, há o Godzilla, como imaginamos que ele seria se existisse. No final de 2023, uma grande e agradável surpresa e uma lição para os americanos."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible storyline, perfect acting and by far the best version of Gozilla (I love all other versions too). A must watch! I watched it in 2D, I'll be going back to watch it in 4DX soon! 10/10."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful story that illustrates that you can make a Godzilla film with characters you actually care about they feel human and you understand there struggles and the impact Godzilla causes to their lives along with a striking score and well envisioned action scenes Godzilla Minus One definitely has my vote for Film Of The Year!
"Dec 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Japan is trying to rebuild after WWIi, but now they have trouble defending themselves from a natural enemy from Odo Island, a creature called Godzilla.
The plot was well done, the monster was scary, the only thing I didn't like was I had to read the entire movie in the English subtitles. Instead of being able to watch more of the graphics I had to constantly look down to keep up with the plot. I think it would do better at the US box office if it had English dubbed in for the characters speaking."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I have seen in a long time, best Godzilla movie for sure!!! American film makers can learn a thing or two from this movie!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! 5 STARS 🌟"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies of 2023 for sure on my top 5 of this year it brings humanity in to a monster movie that you rarely see these days and it looks very good for a movie that was made with only 15 million and by far the best Godzilla movie I ever saw !
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s poetic justice that this has all come full circle with the Japanese giving us the best Godzilla movie ever. A true masterpiece. The best film of 2023.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A powerful love story against the WW2 backdrop with an incredible monster providing the connective tissue between key events and relationships of key characters.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! Godzilla and humanity at their finest. Post war Japan and survivors rebuilding their lives must face the new horror of Godzilla by joining together.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down best movie of the year. A must see. Best movie ticket you can get.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nothing less than GIANT!  Absolutely, amazingly, refreshingly - SUPERB!! In every way.

I never would have imagined a kaiju film could be this good. Like, one of the ‘best period piece' movies EVER made good.

The quality throughout  (story, character development, pacing, effects, period accuracy, acting, soundtrack)… I'm simply floored at how dialed it is.

You WILL be impressed.  I'm confident, Godzilla fan or not, you'll have DEEP appreciation for this film.

5+ out of 5 stars!!

Most satisfying movie experience I've had in a long time.

In my humble opinion: Should be, at the very least, nominated by The Academy for Best Film AND, unquestionably, Best Foreign Film."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the perfect Godzilla that I needed give me more!
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie so far of the year.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just a good action blockbuster, but a good movie period. Will buy once the blu-ray comes out. It's incredible how this cost so little to create."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, good effects, entertaining, excellent"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,so friggin good.... a re-imagining of the original 1954 movie but almost certainly a bit better
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible and emotionally engaging. The movie was suspenseful action packed, and full of heart. I teared up a few times throughout the film, one of the best films of the year and Godzilla films."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderful movie ! The story is good and Godzilla stays true to its Original character. The subtitles were easy to follow and do not take away from the story (even for the reading impaired) and the only reason more people haven't watched this movie is because the fear of subtitles... but it is well worth the movie experience.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually and shockingly enthralling.  The human aspect will have you engaged as the post WWII suffrage is very real and the apocalyptic Godzilla is pure, unstoppable carnage."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla films ever made!
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Amazing story and Godzilla has never looked this terrifying. Go watch it on the big screen!
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Normally, I hate humans in these Monster movies. Koichi changed my mind. This movie was brilliant! 
Great storyline, plenty of Godzilla, and the score was beautiful."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing movie that is a based on the original Godzilla movies a must watch for any Godzilla fans
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Greatest Godzilla movie of all time!!!like the original!!
A REAL Godzilla movie!!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing. The atomic breath seen was so suspenseful aswell. I almost cried while watching
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics and people's ratings aren't wrong. Great story. very emotional. The acting was phenomenal. And the characters had nuance and depth versus generic stereotypes. Godzilla aside the bigger story to me was seeing the effects of war on humans regardless of what side you're on. No one really wins.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Phenomenal story and one heck of a good time!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie gets everything right, as opposed to most Hollywood movies which get almost everything wrong. Great story and character develop. The best movie I have seen all year."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome special effects... Godzilla and everything looked so real.  Acting was superp.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a MASSIVE Godzilla fan, and this movie was PERFECT! It perfectly incapsulates how dangerous a radioactive monster would be, and how it takes from the first ever Godzilla movie. Even though I had to read it in subtitles, this movie has a perfect plot and overall the characters and acting is perfect. By far my favorite Godzilla and Godzilla movie of the whole franchise, I highly recommend to anybody who loves Godzilla movies."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzilla movie in many years
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even if you put aside the Godzilla stuff, this movie has a ton of heart. It made me cry and feel for the characters. It has very good pacing. Godzilla is pretty cool himself too."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzillaaaaaaa!!

I Am very pleased  it's in full subtitle and the cinematography was just genuine, 
Specially the way Godzilla moved and the storyline, everything about this film I fully enjoyed and it payed homaged to the original film -

Great original style of filmmaking making it look like the early style of Godzilla. Great use of technology that was for that era, the film didn't adapt any new style of CGI or weapons or vehicles and kept this film in its true form. 

Some of the scariest Godzilla monster scenes in it - makes you  feel like you're physically there in the chaos and looking into the eyes of Godzilla which past filmmakers have failed to do so instilling fear. 
Excellent performance from all cast. 

A brilliant film, keeping its authenticity to the true classic that we all love."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nailed it.  By far the best human characters in a Kainu movie.   A great human story set in the end of WW2 into reconstruction

Not much new in regards to big G himself, but the character drama around him I'd top notch."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think over all.the best Toho Godzilla movie made and perhaps better than Legendary.  It was reminiscent of the past great Godzilla movies but was focused on engaging characters. In reality Godzilla was not the main character as it often feels in the other movie. The acting was also dead on and a more realistic solution to dealing with Godzilla rather than a made up super weapon, giant robot or some alien species. 
 I highly recommend this movie.."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wanted to see some monster fights. lol
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG THIS MOVIE SLAPS SEE THIS MOVIE
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is at a whole new level, even scary at times! Along with a solid story line & epic action scenes this is a must watch."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,What a perfect Godzilla movie!!!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brilliant, absolutely loved it. Really interesting back story, loved the characters & the 2hrs went by so quickly! A really welcome change to the ""kick ass"" US monster films & a great watch !"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great retelling of the original movie, with some new twists and takes.  Great special effects, and a fantastic human story.  Cant wait to see it again!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was worried this had been too highly hyped. Having just sat through an IMAX showing I agree, best film of 2023."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to the movies expecting a big, dumb action movie (which I love, don't get me wrong) but this was so much more. The human story was original and compelling, and the action sequences and VFX were outstanding. I didn't expect a Godzilla movie to bring me to tears but sobbed for a good 15 minutes towards the end. Not just the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen, one of the best movies I've seen in a while! 10/10 recommend."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent! loved this movie
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film, I recommend it!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie restored my faith in cinema as this was the best movie I have seen in years!!! Hope it plays in more theaters and remains for many weeks; I plan on watching it again in the theater.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie made.  Best film of the year.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,De mi parte la película esta muy buena ya que se centra en lo que en verdad es godzilla y ademas los protagonistas humanos si tienen su espacio para cada dialogo de su historia....
"Dec 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Being better than other blockbuster cgi messes doesn't make it an actually good movie.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great onscreen story telling.  And then the way how Godzilla makes his first appearance... fantastic!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely the best Godzilla movie in years; The perfect homage to ‘the Big One'; The one Japanese Giant that shook the world by storm so many years ago; With shot-for-shot recreations of it's monochromatic godfather, and the most emotionally compelling Post- WWII Japanese plot if ever experienced; This  is one for the history books. 10/10"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,no words can possibly describe how great this movie is. from the acting to the design of godzilla.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Even out 8 yr old daughter was able to read the subtitles and enjoy it. Expect this to win best foreign film Oscar. Loved how they respected the style of the original and the heart of the story.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you took Godzilla out of this movie, it would still be great. That's how good the story itself is. The shots look fantastic. I'll definitely be checking out more of this director's work in the future."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this is the best movie of 2023!!!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing cinematic masterpiece. I've been a Godzilla fan since the 1970s and Godzilla Minus One delivers on so many levels that Hollywood never strives for. Both a great monster story and an even greater human story. I found myself sympathizing for the main human characters. A definite must watch and an instance classic.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,S tier Godzilla movie
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I cannot believe this is knocked down two points...  This movie was absolutely perfect for what it was.  The complex story and characters were completely compelling.  I did not want this movie to end.  The nod to prior Godzilla movies in the motion of Godzilla and some of the ""rampage"" scenes was too sweet to pass up.  Truly an amazing piece."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually entertaining, engaging story, and relatable characters. Thoroughly enjoyed!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,GODZILLA in PERFECTION !!!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow just wow 
Everything at the point 
Thrilling 
VFA just wow
Amazing blend of love family honor everything beautiful 
🥹"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"great history, it's more than just Godzilla, you care about the people and what is happening to them"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie. But expect Godzilla to show up a few times
"Dec 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good. Reminded me a lot of the older style Godzilla films. Some epic moments. The only thing that I’m knocking on, is the story line. A little over board for my taste. "
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Como fan veterano de la saga, esta es sin duda la mejor pelicula de Godzilla que hay, es una carta de amor a los fans y una pelicula que nadie se puede perder."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie had a wonderful synopsis of a young Japanese soldier who had to return to his homeland after the devastating bombings. A lil hollywood flaire is added such as the fact that he is a kamikaze pilot who didn't actually commit suicide and its super tied into the movie... bruh too cheezyyyy but cool. godzilla tho. CGI was trash but design was kinda cool and unique. I like the more radioactive elements where his body was burned after his beam. His spikes going up made me go up. BIG DAWGGGG. But eh typa movie more like emotional pacific rim with historic tied situation. :) watch it why not
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must see Godzilla movie.
It is in Japanese and subtitled in English.  Interesting.
Very well done."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best movie I've seen in the theaters in decades. I'm not a monster movie fan and went with friends, what a show. Seriously, the story telling in this movie is better than anything America has produced in my lifetime, I'm 28, nothing touches the way the story moves me in this film. I've never been interested in foreign films but I plan on watching everything this director and writer have done. Words can't describe, go see it, movie of the decade."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla movie ever
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great character development. Great story and special effects.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Did not expect a poignant meditation on the brutal effects of war on humanity, but I guess I should not have been surprised. Godzilla has always been a metaphor. 

Our family loved every minute of this film. It was brutal, beautiful, surprising and shocking. Best movie of the year for me."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of 2023, and probably the best Godzilla film. Learning more about Godzilla's origins, symbolism, and his past representations has made me love this film even more. If I had seen all of the Godzilla movies I believe that this would still be on top. This movie doesn't even feel like a Godzilla movie, it feels like an interpersonal drama featuring Godzilla. It has some of the most beautiful, gripping, and heart reaching character/relationship development that I have ever seen and it truly drives the movie. It is the strongest part of the movie, yet it doesn't sacrifice the quality of the action. Godzilla's presence alone is the most menacing and intimidating I  have ever seen it, and his destruction is unparalleled, making him the first Godzilla to actually scare me. From the little that I have learned about Godzilla movies, this truly feels like it does justice to the monster's original purpose and symbolism. His shear viciousness and relentless power is chilling, and this paired with the next level character development achieves something that no other action movie has for me: it made me truly worry for the main character's lives. The only criticisms that I could barely conceive would be that it is very corny and on the nose with a lot of its dialogue (but it's a Godzilla movie so that is expected), and some could argue that there are some SLIGHT pacing issues. But overall, the pace feels very fluid and the 2 hour run time suits the movie perfectly. I will forever be astounded that this movie was executed with a 15 million dollar budget, especially because Godzilla Vs Kong, the last Godzilla movie to come out, had 140 million dollars more to work with, and it still wasn't as good in my opinion. Go see this movie, on my second watch it was sad to see that there were only two other people in the theater, give this movie the love it deserves, you will not regret it."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I don’t normally give reviews but this movie was outstanding. It was not your typical Godzilla movie. The story line and human struggle with honor for country and forgiveness was felt through the characters. The mostly old school Godzilla scenes with modern but subtle technology was a nice change. 100% recommend this movie to any and all. I also found myself getting choked up a few times.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muitos vão assistir querendo ver somente o Godzilla, mas o filme entrega uma experiência completa, com um equilíbrio e ritmo excepcional. O momento da ação, do desespero, da tranquilidade, tudo é feito e encaixado de um jeito que te deixa imerso nesse novo mundo do Godzilla. Esse filme consegue te causar as mesmas sensações das pessoas que estão vivenciando elas, além da trilha sonora que é impecável."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie had me with a roller coaster of emotions.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie. A classic. Was not dissapointed. It was unexpected and gave hope.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Good story, great effects. 

the only thing that was a little annoying was the subtitles. The acting and thoughtful script made up for it though."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story line, period accurate weaponry n ppl lifestyle n mentality makes a lot of sense. Very entertaining, enjoyable."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,the best movie of the year so far
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, I love that they brought back the original score for Godzilla. Made it very powerful during the dramatic sequences. Just great. Recommend!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"great story, well told and acted. Loved all the details about Japanese history and culture, and the love story between the two leads. Great ending too"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!!



For someone who has been obsessed with Godzilla since I was a child, I cried a lot when Godzilla was killed.   I LOVED this movie.  Godzilla was so angry and I love his new spikes!!  Loved the soundtrack that stayed true to the Godzilla series from the past.  If you are a Godzilla fan, you won't be disappointed!!!  Will be seeing it again!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I saw a bunch of youtube reviews giving this movie excellent ratings and it lived up to the hype.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla minus one has the spirit and horror of the original Godzilla.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is subtitled so don't take children who can't read.I saw a few kids there and I'm sure they didn't have a good time.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It puts together what a Hollywood movie doesn't. It's got a deep and great plot, great character development, and probably one of the best atomic breaths ever."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best films of the year!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Com certeza está entre 3 melhores filmes do ano. Fui sem expectativas e sai maravilhado. O público aplaudiu na sessão. Estamos cansados com o estilo Hollywoodiano babacao. Drama, sentimento algo que faltava nos filmes. Efeitos muito bem realizados.
Uma sacada dos japoneses trazendo o filme logo no final da segunda Guerra mundial. Encontrando uma Tokyo destruída. Trazendo o drama. Trazendo como coadjuvante Koji, uma kamikaze que fugiu e sente desonrado e carrega a culpa da morte de japoneses na ilha koho onde tem a primeira aparição do Godizilla. 
E ele na versão japonesa sempre tem um papel de vilão. 
Que Mix de drama, ficção,  culpa, compromisso e amor.
Parabéns por esta obra."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film delivers remarkable moments, perfectly packed with beautiful shots and a terrific soundtrack."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've watched every Godzilla movie ever made and this one is by far the best. Even if you aren't a fan of monster movies, go see Godzilla Minus One. It's the best movie of 2023 hands down. Hollywood could learn a few things from TOHO Studios. This movie was made with a $15 million dollar budget and it's better than any movie Hollywood has released in years..."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Freaking epic 10000/10
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Big scary monster, great human story, and nice touches with original soundtrack revival! The part where the atomic breath charges up is so satisfying! Definitely the best part of the movie."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie, moving, epic, grotesque and terrifying. A true gem of a film."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it! Probably the best Godzilla movie made thus far. I hope Legendary and Warner Bros. both take notes on how a good Godzilla flick is made.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow. This was a gut punch of a film that made me tear up in the end. By far the best film of 2023. It was a very engaging human story with the Big G representing Hiroshima again just like the original from the 50's.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023. CGI was crisp & clean. Story was in depth with character development thats usually found in a TV series. The movie was wonderfully paced & so well acted that I felt what the people were feeling. Cant praise this movie enough.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla minus one was incredible so amazing.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfectly edited. The human quotient of the movie kept the story very inspiring. Great film overall.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well made movie and quite entertaining.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Toho delivers on an epic level. Minus One perfectly portrays survivors guilt and PTSD, while highlighting how a country thought of the people who fought for it. Godzilla being an ancillary character, only used when absolutely needed, is the perfect example about how sometimes less is more. The sound design, the score, the visuals, all come together to form a perfect film."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exactly what you want from a Godzilla movie. It's not some lame hammed up western take on Godzilla. Compelling characters, emotional moments, tense action. It was absolutely refreshing and not like anything coming out of Hollywood in recent years."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic horror-esque drama with an amazing godzilla interpretation.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Albert Einstein is the real main character.
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie really outshines modern Hollywood cinema. This is the best movie of 2023. I have not been so interested in watching movies in so long until the release of this movie. With Hollywood creating the image of Godzilla as an antihero character, Minus One easily makes the top of the board. The graphics as well as the story were very well done. For the budget of this movie, this film is extremely way above standards. You care more for the human characters and fear the creature in the correct representation of Godzilla. Toho did amazing in not only bringing back the original feel of the Godzilla we all knew and loved, but they revamped him to be 10x better and much more scarier. A job well done."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, I have to say that Godzilla −1 is about the best movie I have  seen in a long time. It had a tiny budget,,[$7m] but it was absolutely fabulous. The character arks and there were many of them, were brilliant. The acting was outstanding. The special effects were fabulous for the budget. Emotional thoughtful,  complex and a great ending"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal.
Japanese movie making at its best."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"An incredible experience from start to finish. This film does what most of the modern Godzilla films haven't done, has likable and sympathetic characters."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie Ive seen in years!  When a movie can stir your emotions then its a winner.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Classic Godzilla, but improved story and effects."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was all right. I liked the way Godzilla itself looked.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was my firts movie of godzilla, and I absolutely love it, all the references to the ww2 and the atomic attacks."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies this year. Good human story and a terrifying Godzilla. Great movie to watch in the theater.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent, despite the subtitles is very enjoyable.

I'm not a big fan of the original design for the creature, but they managed to pull it off to make it look quite realistic, with a combination of practical effects and CGI.

In terms of storytelling, great insight into the Japanese culture as well as human nature, heroism and sacrifice for the greater good. Definitely a must-watch."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I own every Japanese Godzilla film ever made; and this may be the best. So that's really saying something! But just beside it being a Godzilla film: one of the finest films ever made.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Excellent post war adaption
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a good ole’ Godzilla movie.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"liked how you kept it in Japanese 
reminded me of when I watched it when I was a little kid"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece of cinema - with a gigantic lizard thrown in for action. Easily the best movie of the year. Emotional rollercoaster ride with the main leads and for the first time I rooted for the humans in a Godzilla movie. You won't be disappointed!
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,absolute pos in my opinion
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,seen it twice! probably the best Godzilla movie ever! merges the old classic Godzilla movies with today's technology.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is one of the deepest ""blockbuster"" flick movies, that it makes me almost think it as an analogy for something else. Everything from the characters, to the scenery, to the effects and visuals makes it such an incredible feat. This film makes up for the disaster run here in the US, and Japan offers us a delightful treat, showing off its legacy with Godzilla, and opening doors for a bright future ahead with the franchise."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The deadliest Godzilla movie ever!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of the year for real the plot was amazing and I was glued to this movie
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme do Godizilla, e talvez o melhor filme de 2023"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best allegories for fear ever made.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Really surprised how good this was.  Kind of like Jaws meets Saving Private Ryan.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Exceptional human storytelling makes the gigantic monster work wonderfully both on a city destroying level and on an individual human level.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome acting and plot!  This movie is so refreshing!  Everyone who is remotely curious about Godzilla should watch this movie.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome!!! Evil Godzilla, is this we desire, kill eveyone!!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pure cinema. World-class filmmaking at its finest. I cannot recommend this film enough, regardless of your familiarity or lack thereof with Godzilla and other monster movies"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This is how you do a Godzilla movie right take notes 2014
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One showcases Godzilla as a true, menacing metaphor of the horrors of war, while also including genuinely great human characters and  fantastic execution.

Rating: 98%

"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very gripping and well acted story with the monster acting as a route to tell the story of how the war had such a devastating impact on the people of Japan.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie--very well done--I smell an academy award nomination
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of the year, a practically perfect story.  Extremely human and personal story of survivors guilt.  Impeccable sound editing and amazing soundtrack."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Chef's kiss. I really hope Hollywood took some notes.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely Fantastic! Best movie ever! The setting, special effects, the acting and the appearance of Godzilla are marvellously well done! Japan is such an amazing setting for this movie! Well done!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,the best movie of the year this is how you tell a story Hollywood learn from it
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Impactante, emocionante e com cenas de tira o folego. Godzilla minus one é sem duvidas o melhor filme do godzilla. Porquê nesse filme você se importar com os humanos"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great storytelling, great characters in the context of it's country's traditional values."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"So much more than a ""monster movie."" A very human story, and refreshing change from Hollywood's usual tropes."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This great production was just like the old Godzilla films 1950s and 60s that made this genre a major success. Now this is how you do a Godzilla film.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Gozilla minus one is a beautiful piece of cinema & an example of what all films should aim to be.  What I mean is a beautiful use of atmosphere instead of music to allow you to feel the weight of everything/put you in the shoes of the characters you're supposed to love/hate
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is an absolute masterpiece! Definitely the best movie of 2023 and one of the best Godzilla movies to date! The music is so powerful with both classic and new themes. The CGI is top notch! The new Godzilla design looks incredible and is extremely menacing! You can feel his anger towards humanity. Even if you remove Godzilla, the story telling and scenery in this post World Word 2 era is absolutely breathtaking! The acting in phenomenal with characters you actually care about and want them to survive the attacks! You must see this spectacular in a theater on the biggest screen you can find with the best sound system! If possible, check it out in 4DX for the ultimate immersible experience!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Old godzilla vibes with a current format.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"best godzilla movie ever by far. storyline was pefect, action was good. it added a taste of horror into the godzilla universe and i love it.:)"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Best godzilla movie to ever exist and is one of the best movies of the 2020's. Focuses on a good story and is the only godzilla movie where you root for the protagonists not godzilla. 10/10
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is good. So good in fact that it has topped both my best movie of 2023 and of all time. Never have I walked out of a cinema so happy, shocked and awestruck like this movie did. The human story was touching and relatable, Godzilla was terrifying and most importantly, the ending was magnificent. This is the only movie I have ever wanted to review because I want it to do as well as possible. What's more is the CGI which was flawless especially at a ridiculous budget of under 15 million dollars. See it on the biggest screen possible and support this movie!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Reminded me of the old godzilla movies.  Cant go wrong with this movie.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible film! Full of meaningful symbolism. Beautiful story, And very cool action with 1940s era technology. Amazing! I went more than once to see this in the theater!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Totally worth the subtitles!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I will say nothing more than an absolute unequivocal masterpiece.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has so much character that it feels like you are there. Think of games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 for example, it's a compelling story that fully gets your attention and you you are on the edge of your seat the whole time."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I have never been more terrified of Godzilla than i was watching this film.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great actors, everything about the movie was great"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not typically a fan of this type of movie, but went for date night with my husband.  I ended up enjoying it! It was cheesy in that old Godzilla sort of way, but then really grew on me because of the story.  It was also interesting to think of Japan in post World War II times- the rebuilding- the pressure of being a kamikaze pilot who returned- etc."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,God what an absolute blast of a movie! Complete must-see!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was probably the best Godzilla movie yet, it actually had a great story line"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is absolutely the movie of the year for me. it utterly floored me. 

I never expected to be so truly terrified of Godzilla. This is just groundbreaking."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect movie!!! 100% movie of the year!!!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,There is nothing to dislike.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best film I've seen all year. I'd seen the trailer which looked great and then heard all the good reviews for it on Youtube and the internet, so I decided to watch it if and when it was released here. 

It was brilliant. Its more accurate to call this a film with Godzilla in it rather than a Godzilla film with side stories. Its more about the healing and redemption after the trauma of war and loss. The importance of being part of something whether its your family, your crew or the taskforce. 

The acting is great, you feel for these people and want to see some sort of happy ending for them, and instead of cheering Godzilla on, this time you want the big guy to lose.

The actions scenes are epic, whether is the first attack on their boat to the final battle. The Ginza scene is particularly jaw dropping. The special effects were for the budget absolutely top notch. Its hard to believe a film like this was made for only $15million, especially when you consider how bad some of the multimillion dollar flops like the Marvels or the The Flash looked and they cost nearly 20 times as much.

Watch this film, you will not regret it. My film of the year easily."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,very true to the Godzilla lore!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of, if not the best movie i watched. The acting was very good and made sense with the story and every bit of the movie is worth watching. They also waste no time showing godzilla. This movie makes us think that the japanese people werent the villains of rhe war but one of the many victims, and godzilla is the reflection of the effects of the war on Japan. 10/10"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Who thought we could get a movie with thrilling action, great practical special effects and a riveting human story. Such a realistic view of the trials of the people in post WWII Japan told through lives of ordinary people. I was so invested in the story and the characters, brilliantly punctuated by well timed apperances of Godzilla. Every attack by the famous Kaiju was full of suspense and you are genuinely scared and devastated for the victims. This is my movie of the year."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Gonna have to change my viewing preferences to international movies!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolutely gripping, human story where godzilla is the inciting incident rather than the protagonist. It is brilliantly executed, brilliantly acted, and without a doubt the best movie you will see in 2023."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!!!!!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"HOLY SHIT
WOWOWOWOWOWOW"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh is it amazing for new fans and old fans. Godzilla Minus One is incredible from the acting, plot, and emotions are amazing. I mean Godzilla and the characters and their emotions and growth through the movie are all too real. I wont say spoilers for the ending but the ending was AMAZING! Sure I absolutely hate cliffhangers but this one was good for the ending and a great start for the sequel. So If you haven't seen Godzilla Minus One yet watch it its worth your time."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unbelievably good! No expectations going into this movie but almost immediately I was genuinely engaged in the human drama played out through the movie. It 100% enhanced rather than detracted from the film. I saw a glimpse of the struggle the Japanese citizens likely faced for real after WW2 that I had never thought of before. Real people having to pick up the pieces after a brutal war and the gritty reality of hunger, uncertainty and raw needs of survival, fictional though it was. I would have never dreamed I'd be engaged at this level in the human side of a Godzilla film! By far my favorite Godzilla movie of them all and I've seen almost all of them!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"muito bom, excelente, toda parte do drama humano"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very different movie than I was led to believe but this film is more fully formed than I could have guessed.
Solid character building and performances as well as what we all came for - some giant lizard destroying stuff.
Very nice job on many details of the period and in the effects work. 
Loved that it was all in Japanese with subtitles at the showing I went to - it felt that much more authentic. 
Lots to wow at and lots to awe at
Go see it!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS is the movie, right here. The best Godzilla film ever made. It's pretty much perfect. Everything you'd want a Godzilla movie to be, this movie packs literally EVERYTHING! 10/10"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hollywood take note. Best movie of the year, easily, must see in cinema. I never in a million years thought I'd tear up watching a Godzilla movie and actually care more about the humans than Godzilla.  Perfect pacing, great acting, compelling characters, and the most brutal Godzilla we've seen. I will be going to see it again."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was fantastic, Toho has always had a way with making godzilla scary and badass, they did a wonderful storytelling for this movie and its quailty shows. For sure worth watching in theater with friends! Overall great movie."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Acting is top notch cgi is the best I've seen in a while this movie is so heartfelt it makes you cry 10/10 i would really recommend you to watch this movie.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cool to the Japanese effect on it, true homage "
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie I've ever seen in a long time the historic events, and all the other historic things, this is a definite must watch plus who ever rated this a 98 fuck off"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is epic and emotional because of the characters developments and this is perfect.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good action film. Godzilla was impeccable, with perfect and frightening CGI. As long as Godzilla wasn't in focus, I felt a little bored, but when he appeared, I was hooked on the movie screen, my rating is 3.5 out of 5.0."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great. I've loved Godzilla since I was a little kid when I would watch Godzilla 1985 over and over again. This one has characters you care about, a well-written story, and my boy smashing everything and using his atomic breath"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Well done movie and very smart director 👏👏
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"DON’T THINK ABOUT IT JUST WATCH THE MOVIE! Promise, you won’t be disappointed. 10000/10."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is extremely well done as a movie. Acting, directing, story, writing, dialogue, editing, cinematography, and every aspect of a movie is done extraordinarily well with Godzilla Minus One. Must see."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,it was to watching very  amazing  movie.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved that the movie took you back to the original.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I’ve seen in a long time. A must see, even for those who are not fans of these types of movies."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfekte Kinounterhaltung !
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is truly powerful in almost every way and is really close to being a perfect movie. Compared to everything else the movie accomplished, delivering great visual effects on a shoe string budget is almost not worth mentioning. 

This movie takes its time to deliver great characters and takes all of them through a journey that is natural and compelling. Every character goes through a satisfying arc and there is basically no scene wasted. And the music is truly sublime. 

Godzilla Minus One deserves to be nominated for multiple Oscars and deserves to break $100M in US domestic box office."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spectacular special effects and a terrific, compelling storyline make this the best kaiju movie ever made."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wait, this can't be, I actually care about the humans in a Godzilla movie!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie! Needed a little more Godzilla action!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A film that will become an instant classic, bringing in the modern and classic feel of monster film."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Good story. Great special effects. Very entertaining!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lo-and-behold, a modern Godzilla film that actually makes you care about the characters. This film was absolutely spectacular. It not only looked great for a movie of a miniscule budget by today's Hollywood standards, it tackled themes such as survivor's guilt extremely well. Warner Bros., take notes."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an instant classic with modern touch, I'm not usually a fan of the dialogue and story of the humans but was captivated by their story as much as I was with the big G man. Major props to the director for bringing us such a masterpiece!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up watching the old toho godzilla movies. I have to be honest, i stopped after final wars, not sure why but anyways. This movie was more heartwarming than 2000. The action scenes and graphics just the whole thing was put together so nicely. The characters were fun and loveable. This is the best movie of 2023 hands down. Its a must see for any godzilla fan. The ending is great"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was so enjoyable the story was great Director Takashi Yamazaki did a great job with making this Godzilla destructive the design for Godzilla was amazing and most of all Terrifying hope to see this Godzilla in the future i give it 10/10
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Back to the OG Godzilla with so much humanity. Brilliant.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie is in Japanese and is subtitled. It was long and storyline is slow.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty rad, long tho"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Compelling story and well-written characters. I cried.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla movie hall of fame worthy, a masterpiece. Godzilla has returned as a lovecraftian force of rage, and is set among the backdrop of trauma, human resilience and commentary on war. 

This movie was made for people who love the original Godzilla, and created by the labour of 70 years of love by Toho."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If u r a fan of Godzilla u must watch this one 🤙🏻
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible move with a terrific story
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie of all time!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was nothing less than perfect, you can feel the impact the characters had. Every emotion felt real and it did amazing having people go against godzilla"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did and kudos to the writers and actors as this was the first Godzilla movie that I've EVER been invested in the humans and actual story. I've never, ever actually felt any emotion in these kinds of film until this one... and I've never been terrified of. Godzilla until this film. it was so grounded that its appearance truly conveyed feelings of terror and awe and not just felt like a kaiju slugfest"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film! The effects and characters were excellent. Could have been 20 minutes shorter for me, but it was definitely worth seeing."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great action, really nice homage to the originals."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is Godzilla! Phenomenal film, can’t wait for the next installment"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Like how the beginning got viewers to establish a feeling for the prime characters
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot featured a poignant story of a man  wrestling with  a cowardly act that cost the lives of those he could have saved. It tormented him throughout the film.  This was more a drama that happened to have a monster in it.  It was, at time absolutely terrifying."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great pace and ending.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like this film, It reminds me of the 50's Godzilla, but in the 40's. During World War 2. I like it so much. I hope they get other monsters in the sequel like Angurius, Rodan, Mothra, And King Ghidorah. I am hyped in the sequel. And I hope it is canon to King Kong 1933. (The original)."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Beginning is a little slow but pieces together nicely!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing story, well acted and good big monster movie."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was great from start to finish with all the damage Godzilla caused! Loved this new take on him!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is not hyperbole to call Godzilla Minus One the greatest entry in the franchise since its inaugural release.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of THE BEST that Toho has ever put out by far!  Exceedingly impressed with what they did to the king! Great music! Total package is well done.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie made the old fashion way!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a freking great movie!!! Unique story line and character development, Attention to details in the storyline is amazing. Highly recommend this movie, a must see."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I died. I literally died. But the movie convinced me so hard to keep on living that I had to return and rate this fiver stars.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I made an account just to review this movie. This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen and puts current western Hollywood to shame. I cannot praise this movie enough. Congratulations Japan on a masterpiece of a film!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One brings an menacing Godzilla and it shows how terrifying this gigantic monster is. Every character in this movie has a good story arc and whenever a character in the movie has an emotion, you can fell their pain. The plan to take down Godzilla was extremely creative. An absolute watch"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, everything we love about Godzilla! Well done."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece. Who knew Godzilla could bring such heart, passion, and intensity. A must see on the big screen. If this film doesn't get Oscar considerations, the Academy will lose whatever credibility it has left."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this was probably one of the best action movies Ive ever seen. The effects were impeccable. The acting was superb. It had a beautiful and touching storyline, something you would not expect in an action movie like this. Id be willing to go see this more than a few times at the theater because it was money well spent and, just an incredible movie."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE MOVIE WAS INTERTAINING AND EXELENT.   
5  STARS.
WOULD SEE AGAIN."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spanish: Es una de las mejores películas de godzilla que eh visto

English: It's one of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie surpassed my expectations. Truly the best film of 2023 and one of the best Godzilla movies ever made!
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely the  Best movie i see on 2023 and possibly one of the best godzilla movies
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A visual feast that lacks emotional depth and strong character development. Godzilla Minus One forgets the cardinal rule show, don't tell as the film develops its characters mostly through dialogue. Excessive exposition nullifies the impact of emotional moments since the audience is told the emotional state of a character instead of showing us through the actions of a character or through dialogue with subtext. Nevertheless, the eponymous Godzilla is beautifully realized through stunning effects and creative cinematography. If you prefer the power of western storytelling, the plot may not grab your attention, but the well-choreographed action and destructive capabilities of Godzilla will keep you somewhat engaged."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I do not think I have been this surprised and completely blown away impressed than this movie. For anyone worried about the length, the reading subtitles, and the small budget of the film STOP WORRYING AND GO SEE IT!!!! Trust me I had my doubts but this is not something you want to miss and the $8 movie ticket and one gallon of gas you may use up is more than worth it."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie! Great fun! Not perfect - the plot loses credibility about 15 minutes from the end. But great 1950's style retro movie, Sci-FI movie and monster movie. The film also deals with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and mental illness - unusual in a lead character - a brave move.  Symbolism of Godzilla as the nuclear bomb, the Japanese people had to face twice. The movie is perhaps a little more emotional than western audiences are used to. However, still great fun to watch"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Had high hopes going in and Godzilla Minus One exceeded them. More soul and thought than any of the nonsense put out in the Monster Universe. Is among my favourite foreign language films
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The B&W version of this amazing flick is an awesome homage to the King of Monsters. The deffinitive Godzilla presentation.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever made!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"an absolute masterpiece, essential viewing for fans of kaiju and godzilla!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw this in theaters on opening weekend when it released here in Canada, went with my best friend as a way to rekindle our friendship, and BOY DID IT! TOHO has blessed the cinemas with another masterpiece, that easily trumps the Legendary Pictures version of Godzilla! An absolute must see, would definitely watch again!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Took me back to when I was a kid and watched the old Godzilla movies. It had a good story. Had some humor. Not over the top CGI. My 16 year old daughter loved it…..except for the crying kid. Said she annoyed her. lol
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant in every way! The best Godzilla film ever made.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movie ever made
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This film is a must watch all of the characters are compelling in their own way the jokes in this film are funny and Godzilla mwah chefs kiss.Now the only gripe with the film is that the end is really predictable with the fact that the main character who is shown to kamikaze into Godzillas mouth to kill him is alive because he ejects himself at the last minute
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was set in 1945 post WWII.  Although subtitled, it was easy to follow and action-packed.  Took my 13 yr old and he had no issues following along.  We both enjoyed it."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente filme! Muito bem escrito, roteirizado e dirigido! Apesar do baixo orçamento, o filme apresenta uma qualidade maravilhosa! Excelente diversão no cinema!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a lifelong Godzilla fan. I've seen every single Godzilla movie, watched them all in order, literally written a thesis about Godzilla for my degree and did presentations on the franchise... To say I love this franchise is an understatement. 

This... This is the best Godzilla movie that has EVER been made. Ever. This movie is amazing. It has everything you'd expect from a Godzilla movie (it isn't Godzilla if it doesn't have a little bit of ridiculousness and cheesiness, which I LOVED to see). However... it goes so much deeper. The human story was moving and unexpected, showed the real side of PTSD and loss, and actually made me cry more than once (I don't cry at movies). The animation of Godzilla is phenomenal, and the new effect of his nuclear breath was shocking, intimidating, and incredible. 2023 finally allowed for a serious Godzilla movie that does Godzilla, his power, his terror, his majesty, his destruction, and his horror all true justice. Having such a fantastic and moving human story only elevated this movie more. 

My review does this movie no justice. None at all. It is now my favorite movie of my life. Thank you, Japan, for making and sharing such an incredible story with us. This is how Godzilla was always meant to be. Perfection."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,YES! That's what Im talking about! Had the same budjet as There's Something in the Barn and was awesome! There's Something in the Barn was not! That one is awful! Godzilla Minus One clearly had a passionate crew and takes movie making seriously!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The best film I watched this year. I felt obliged to register just to write this review. Master piece.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a budget of $15,000,000, it really goes to show what someone is capable of using for. Best foreign movie I have seen after godzilla 2000. I recommend this movie to anyone, godzilla fan or not"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,absolutely deserve it to see
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it it was very realistic
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute must see!!!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is dull of emotions good story telling and makes you want to participate in the downfall of Godzilla. I wish hollywood would understand and remember how cinema is supposed to be made
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really emotional with decent pacing. Whenever I thought things were getting slow, a CG scene would show up next. The characters are not perfect but they all fill their role. Everything came to a satisfying ending."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, best Godzilla movie I've seen."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Scripted with creativity and heart, taking place in beautiful scenery and sets, engagingly shot and accompanied by a phenomenally dreadful and energetic score, this addition to the franchise delivers lots of moving movements in the storyline as well as drastic action and tension as soon as the infamous lizard himself steps onto the scene. Ryûnosuke Kamiki's performance is shockingly touching, especially during his emotional outbreaks, while Godzilla is designed and written in a successfully horrifying way. The movie starts with a surprisingly strong scene, starring a truly scary juvenile Godzilla and a cast that reacts to him accordingly in authentic panic. The characters are interestingly written, especially the protagonist, and mostly well casted, including Sakura Andô which was a smart choice for her role. Godzilla's writing and design is terrifyingly crafted, sharing some similarities with the ones from the older movies. The atomic breath and following explosion scenes are intense theatrical feasts, with its sound design and visuals. Even though there are such great qualities to offer there are some disappointments as well. A scene which seems to be some sort of an american broadcast with a montage of clips felt really out of place and totally unnecessary, adding nothing new or interesting to the plot which the audience didn't know already. There is also another montage including the main characters passing some time together which could have been handled better, with a tone that would have fit the rest of the movie and a better soundtrack. Now coming to the obvious; the movement animations on the fully grown Godzilla are too often stiff and puppet-like when he doesn't attack or swim. One scene in particular stuck with me, in which the hero flies his plane into the monsters mouth, however Godzilla stays completely frozen and motionless, even with the massive impact. That's a bit of letdown but it essentially doesn't ruin the authenticity of the monster. The effects and the rest of the production are absolutely impressive for the budget of only $15M, nonetheless."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Only downfall was that it's in Japanese!  Great movie
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Banzai！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a HUGE Godzilla fan. The creature was amazing and, hes not the good monster any more. Th storyline was so different and done so well. Highly recommend."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Welll it was one of the greatest Japanese movie ever. And the ending twist was shocking and apparently  it's not over since they show at the end that he's still alive for a sequel
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily worth the price of admission. You have excellently written characters with actual arcs that you come to enjoy and root for. That being said the second half of the movie does drag just a bit. The finale however does make it worth it.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic Movie! Great story and well balanced, not too much screen time for Godzilla and not too much Screen Time of characters! Loved how they kept the feel of the original feel of Godzilla "
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. It's more about how hard it was for the people in this community struggled post World War, then they had to deal with an additional problem of Godzilla. It's also a story about the main character's journey for redemption. Highly recommended."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,What I liked about the movie is when they created a plan to kill Godzilla and it worked and also at the start when it said in 1945 it reminded me of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the bombings and it was tragic especially after the bombings you have to face another threat which was Godzilla and I thought it was sad when buildings were destroyed and they had to keep rebuilding.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I have seen all year! The story, characters, themes, and Godzilla itself was great. I am so happy I decided to watch the movie with my friends. 

If you have not watched, I highly recommend you go watch it!!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"While most Godzilla movies can suffer from it's human cast, Minus One thrives because of them. NOT inspite of them. The themes that created the beloved kaiju are back and come with a bigger gut punch than ever. This is a can't miss for anyone that's a fan of the King of Monsters"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A so adaptation that has been a masterpiece sense it's release with great acting and crafting of Godzilla this is one of the better Godzilla films ever made I appreciate it a lot.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,um filme imperdível para assistir no final de semana um prato pra quem e fã do rei dos monstros ♥️ obrigado toyo a produtora do filme por fazer esse filme maravilhoso me emocionei no final do filme e minha nota para esse é 10/10 então resumindo tudo vá assistir o filme recomendo muito ♥️👑viva ao rei dos monstros (desculpa pelo texto longo)
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"We definitely need more films that aren't made in Hollywood. Japan and South Korea truly are leading the way both in films and TV shows. A new beginning indeed.
Great film by the way!."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"My god, you get Godzilla 2 hours long AND a good story with great actors. The setting right after world war 2 was alsof a great idea. I LOVED this. Thank you Yamazaki-san."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,An outstanding post war drama hidden within an amazing Godzilla film. He's terrifying from the 1st appearance by the way. I'll delve no further as to not ruin it. Just go watch it.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Easy the best Godzilla film in decades!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Compelling character story lines and jaw dropping Kaiju destruction made for a truly captivating movie. Kariko was adorable too!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than expected. Godzilla was awesome
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite what Hollywood says, I was able to enjoy a movie that features people who don't look like me.  Turns out what people enjoy watching is a good story.  Thankfully there are other people producing good moves.  This film was excellent... story, acting, visuals... all superb."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film!! Literally just got out of the cinema in Exeter in the UK
I held off on trailers and spoilers and the film definitely did not disappoint!
A little slow in places but when it kicks in it really kicks in, The final act is astonishing!
I have never watched a movie that utilises silence in such an amazing way."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"We saw it two days ago. As has been said about Jaws (a movie which this one pays homage) ""this would be a really good movie even without {a shark/Godzilla}. The characters were interesting, the movie set a steady pace that never got slow or overwhelming. The effects were great and the monster was terrifying. There was actual menance coming from this depiction, which has been missing for a long time.
Be aware that the movie is subtitled. But it was easy enough to pay attention and still follow the dialogue.
This is an outstanding movie and well worth the acclaim it has been receiving."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most intense watches in decades. Re-watchable movie that can be family fun or great on your own.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. The human characters are also great. A Godzilla movie you must watch.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a huge masterpiece!!! It deserves the praise.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is shockingly amazing
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Emotionally gripping.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I have been a fan of this franchise since I was 5 years old with Godzilla vs. Megalon being my first movie i ever saw.  Godzilla Minus One is just soo different but still keeping that classic Godzilla that utterly destroys in a more maniac crazed creature this time. This one deserves a trilogy easily.  Must see even for general audiences.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the best Godzilla movie of the era !!!!!, Hail to the king of the monsters !!!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice , the best filme ."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla fan or  not, this is a must-see film that hopefully gets nominated for the Oscars. It is not about fantastic CGI effects and a loud, destructive Kaiju monster, but a heartwarming film that also keeps you at the edge of your seat, feeling the emotional pain of the human characters that fight through adversity by digging down deep. Saw it twice within a week since it was slatted to be a limited-time showing. It received 98% ratings from both the critics and audience viewers that it finally was advertised during Sunday's football games and resulted in extending its time in theaters nationally! Go see it and tell your friends, you won't regret it."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie ever made and is easily the best film of the year.  I don't want to add any spoilers because I think it is best going into this film without any background.  All I will say is that is that it subverts any expectations you may have in monster films in general.  Just go see this in the theater now!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Recently, a friend's wild enthusiasm drove him to embark on an 8-hour journey to catch a movie. Whether he's a die-hard franchise fan or just slightly eccentric, I couldn't resist the intrigue. The film in question, ""Godzilla Minus One,"" was slated for a limited release in select theaters, and my friend insisted it was a cinematic gem.

Returning from his trip, he couldn't stop praising this $15 million-budget marvel, claiming it outshone its predecessors. Intrigued, I joined a group of nine for a screening, only 2-hours from home the following weekend. Despite the theater being less than ideal, the film's magnetic pull kept me glued to my seat for the entire two hours.

This unexpected gem didn't rely entirely on explosive special effects. Instead, it unfolded as a gripping narrative, a rare throwback to when stories took precedence. The action, though loud and at times comical, seamlessly wove into the tale of overcoming adversity. ""Godzilla Minus One"" became a story about hitting rock bottom, descending even further, and then summoning the will to rise again.

My friend's insistence that Godzilla symbolizes more than a monstrous entity proved accurate. Godzilla is a metaphor for any catastrophic event, encouraging me to focus on character dynamics rather than awaiting destruction. I found myself emotionally invested, shedding a few tears along the way (I wasn't the only one).

Whether or not you're a Godzilla enthusiast, ""Godzilla Minus One"" deserves the acclaim it's garnered. Take a chance; the worst-case scenario is ten bucks out of pocket and a couple hours of your time. At best, you'll find yourself labouring over the right words for your first ever review, compelled to share the magic.

Chris Yuill
""Godzilla Minus One"" (2023)
5/5

Edit* The film is now showing in my hometown. 12 of us watched it last night. It was even better than the first time and only 15 minutes from home"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was ready for a bad ass Kaiju Monster movie and I got that, but what really hit me was a touching story.

Bravo!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu achei bem legal. Mas as cenas de histórias duram meia hora e a destruição dura 5 minutos, tirando isso, ótimo filme, ótimos atores, otimo roteiro, tudo ta ótimo"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"That was so super fricking AWESOME.
Dare I say my favourite Godzilla film? I do dare.
Godzillas design in this is elite and he was completely bad and badass. Don't get me wrong I love the current Monster verse films but this was something else.

The music in certain scenes was amazing, some music I recognised from Godzilla king of the monsters. Both films used it well.

Quick mention that I really enjoyed the humans in this film. That is a part which has been a let down in some monster verse films. I think the humans in this really helped elevate the film above the monster verse ones for me. I actually cared about the characters."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla move yet amazing how it went from a dark tone to a hopeful tone to a happy tone the CGI sometimes did look a bit cheap but apart from that amazing story, if you are Godzilla fan or not, I would recommend watching it"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Aquesta pelicula es espectacular de principi a fi.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only is this the best Godzilla movie made in my lifetime, but I'm going to recommend it to all of my friends, including the ones who aren't Godzilla fans. The characters are vivid and lifelike you will care about them, which makes the monster scarier. The movie feels shorter than it is because every scene and every shot serves a purpose. Practical effects and CGI blend seamlessly to create something that is simultaneously true to the original Godzilla and thoroughly modern. The story has setup and payoff and a few unexpected moments that are thoroughly earned. I left the theater feeling awed and refreshed."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One has poignant human scenes that hit as hard as Godzilla's atomic heat ray, and I saw this in 4DX so when the heat ray blew up a building: you felt it!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow just wow when the first trailer came out I was really looking forward to it in theaters and man it not disappoint, the story, characters, the destruction, Godzilla himself. I definitely recommend this masterpiece to anyone whether they're a Godzilla fan or not!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film I have ever seen the story is very powerful and Godzilla is terrifying as he should be this firm is a masterpiece. If you're a Godzilla fan you need to see this firm
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and cool action scenes! Godzilla looked both scary and goofy sometimes haha
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Every 10 or so years you get a film that is a must watch in theaters to truly understand the power of the film. This is that movie for this decade. On par with the opening nights of the first Jurassic Park, the first Indiana Jones, and the first Star Wars films. Legendary in every way and an absolutely mind blowing."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been watching Godzilla movies for last 57 years and this is the best movie I've ever watched and first time I cried many times in Godzilla movie.
This movie is based on how to ""Live"" in your life.
Never give up and never die."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"SEE IT IN THEATERS while you can. One of the most surprising and best theater experiences I’ve had in years. I did not have “tearing up at the end of a Godzilla movie” on my bucket list but here we are. The production value, the acting, the directing, the visual effects, all of it is painstakingly laid bare upon the screen. You can feel the handcrafted love in each shot and the passion of their message. I beg everyone who reads this If you can only see one movie in theaters this year make it this one…."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"SEE IT IN THEATERS while you can. I did not have tearing up at the end of a Godzilla movie on my bucket list but here we are. The production value, the acting, the directing, the visual effects... all of it is painstakingly laid bare upon the screen. You can feel the handcrafted love in each shot and the passion of their message. One of the most surprising and best theater experiences Ive had in years.  I beg everyone who reads this SEE IT IN THEATERS as while you can."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best films I’ve seen in a long time. Gut wrenching characters and a truly frightening Godzilla that helped to enhance the humanity that came through in the film. Great to see in theaters.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie yet! The filmakers departed from the usual direction of Godzilla movies by REALLY telling and featuring a parallel story in place of focusing soley on the monster and his destruction. The dialogue between the main characters was a readily believable main theme of the movie supported by the action scenes with Godzilla. You truly became engrossed in the main characters plight and his redemption. Some of the acting was still a bit hokey for us, but that will be the case in mostly all of these Japanese centered movies as seen through the eyes of people foreign to Japan. Excellent script!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Suspenseful and packed with action. Great movie.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It takes Japan to make a people actually want to watch.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie, you truly feel and care about the characters, along with them acknowledging the original movies"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Like nothing I've ever seen attempted in the Godzilla franchise. Bold and tender. Dramatic and quiet. Gorgeous film.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The best thing i seen sense marvel phase one
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a film. Fantastic piece of work and truly one of the best Godzilla movies I've seen. Respectful of the original while still being its own thing. Acting was great, graphics are great, great story line, just an all-around great film."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was phenomenal in every way.  My husband, who is in no way a Godzilla fan but came with me out of curiosity, also loved it! For him it was an excellent historical film and he appreciated the symbolism in Godzilla the monster.  I felt all of those things as well, plus I loved the look of this new Godzilla."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Unlike any Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! The best Godzilla movie.to date.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the special effects!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"this one is an absolute fantastic start of a fresh Godzilla film, someone that puts actual serious stuff Within what makes Godzilla special"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla film in decades!   Wow!   This is how a monster movie should be made.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hollywood has something to learn from this film's team. This was spectacular. On a budget nearly a 10th of what was already being hailed as the best looking film under $100 million, The Creator; this film has done some incredible work. The characters don't feel forced, the drama isn't too schlocky, the action is heart-pounding and the scale is far bigger than some movies with 10 times the budget. The story is well paced and Godzilla is actually terrifying.  I can't imagine how the upcoming Warner Bros film team feels right now as G-1 has set the bar impossibly high for what we can expect from Kaiju fare going forward. This film restored my faith in action movie filmmaking this year."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Saw the color version  opening weekend. The b & w  version let me focus on the story this time. Well worth it to see the film again.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was so good that it felt too short of a film. I loved how it didn't focus solely on the action but the people Godzilla's rampage affected, and once the action began, it had more weight to it rather than just meaningless destruction~ 9/10"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"good script and acting, which is not expected from a monster movie. Creature effects pretty good. love the classic Godzilla roar."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic!!! I am a lifelong Godzilla Fan since I can remember(I'm 53! Now) I have never been so into the human characters as I have been with this one. I teared up a few times, NOT ONE cast member phoned it in"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"👏 Spectacular CGI, top-notch acting, and epic direction make it a must-see! 🎬 and The music? Goosebumps! 🎶🔥"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie aside the original
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely stunning! By far my favorite Godzilla movie.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gripping, heartfelt, moral questions and answers, and an amazing monster movie!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,May be the surprise film of the season.  High quality special effects and a love story about a ragtag family trying to cope with the fire bombing of Japan after WWII and then an indestructible monster.
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the weaker entries in the series.  A bit slow and generally out of touch with what makes a Godzilla movie great.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The fact that they could make such a movie in a low budget of 15 million dollars, people from Disney should just quit their jobs. What an amazing amalgamation of great screenplay, story and low budget but meaningful VFX."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Perfectly enjoyable but I felt a little duped by the 98% rating at the time I went to see it. It's all subtitled so I had to really pay attention, but if it hadn't been I probably would've zoned out a lot more. 🙄"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic all around
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed it. Hard to look away.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best depiction of Godzilla I've ever seen and best movie I saw this year.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla movie I've seen in a long time. You will not be disappointed. Go see this movie!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One carries on the work of its predecessors, once again proving who the king really is! Minus-One is a tragic war drama set in post WWII Japan…with Godzilla, yet it somehow manages to be the best of both genres. Thought provoking, haunting, and even scary, it's a must see for all fans of cinema."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Assisti ontem com esposa e casal de filhos 16 e 17 ,e que filmaço meus amigos"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably one if not the best movie to come out in 2023. A powerful commentary of Japan's experience post World War II. With a shocking 15 million dollar budget this is the movie that shows Hollywood what blockbusters used to be. And can still be.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the absolute best Godzilla movies ever. This movie was amazing. Godzilla was actually scary. The symbolism, characters and story were fantastic. I got chills when the Godzilla theme played."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a Godzilla fan, I loved this movie!  If you’ve never seen a Godzilla film and roll your eyes when you hear “Godzilla,” this is the one Godzilla movie for you to see.  Amazing acting from an outstanding cast, a heartbreaking, moving, and inspiring story, this is not only one of, if not the best Godzilla film ever, it’s one of the best films of the year!  Do not miss out on seeing this in theaters, in IMAX if you can!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A solid monster movie. If this wasn’t a foreign film though and the setting wasn’t unique, it would be a solid 6.5/10 and without the high praise it has gotten. "
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing !!! one of the best movies of 2023 ...
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an absolute delight, Godzilla Minus One is one of the hits of 2023 so far. At its heart it truly is a classic Godzilla movie, from the Godzilla walk and its classic backing track however its the story between the make-shift family that stars as the movies true heart and soul of the movie. The connection between the characters and their history is so gripping and emotional, to the point that its hard to not root for our main cast. Shikishima's story is one of tragedy yet hopefulness, with so many plot points that were littered throughout the movie, payed off in such powerful ways, the character has his flaws which makes him more relatable and you feel the weight behind every decision he must make in the movie. I love that we stayed focused on this make-shift family for the entirety of the film, no side missions, we are always following the next phase of the group. I could ramble on for paragraphs about just how great this movie is. Thank you Japan, you have given us masterpiece in storytelling, acting, character-work and dread, an absolute piece of art."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was not expecting such a complete movie. Went in expecting a monster thriller, left having seen a story-telling delight. No doubt Godzilla is gargantuan, but he wasn't even the biggest part of this movie! Awesome film."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla: Minus One is the Best Godzilla film ever made.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can not believe how much I loved this movie. The fact that there were so many layers to this film and that in a Godzilla film is amazing. I love Godzilla for what it is, but this just blew everything out of the water.

Just pure cinema of the highest quality."
"Dec 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Don't believe the hype. Godzilla movies are not supposed to have 'deep' character exploration  - its ok - but really? OK? The premise is sound & worthy of exploration, but in a Godzilla movie! NO! There were some gaping historical plot holes and it's good enough for someone to tidy it up & get their history right. Like I say, don't believe the hype. Pity."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you have ever seen a Godzilla monster movie on TV as a kid, you will surely love this homage from Toho movies. The drama! The Plan! The Plan B! The Plan B Backup Plan! The wavy-haired scientist! The stodgy Naval captain! The emotionally-wracked failed Kamikaze pilot! The war-torn Tokyo! The wounded warriors volunteering ONE MORE TIME!

There are no plot twists. At. All. But man, what a trip down memory lane! Just pure fun, from beginning to end."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fully, perfectly, and heart hittingly encapsulates the emotions and feelings of post-war Japan; to the point of at times, forcing you to sit and think… and really feel.
Brings a whole new view on the original meaning behind Gojira as a character and pounds it into your face, exactly the way it should be.
My only gripe is the unexplained janky movement of Godzilla at times, almost like he's taking a page of out Shin's book. But it's very easy to overlook that considering the quality of the rest of the film.
Overall, an absolute stunner of a film; by far the best representation of Toho's creation to date."
"Dec 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great Godzilla movie, it had a great story and we get to see who is the ruler of all monsters!"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Blood fantastic, best movie I've seen in years."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely a builder - first 20mins felt like a slowish Japanese re-hash of Jurassic Park, (island and all). You know, the bit where everyones fave T-Rex dino turns up and starts eating folk one half at a time. But slowly you do get to care about the lead character and the rest of the cast, and then (about half way) it gets rather juicy. 
Lots of stomping, chomping, and pointless merciless killing of innocent folks (random ones, and maybe even ones you like); along with general giant monstering about and destruction. Nice satisfying ending - although not really anything unexpected - just Jurassic Park on steroids with an added heat ray. But there's nothing wrong with that. 
Better and certainly more satisfying than most of the other - more monied - studio offerings of late. Well worth watching despite having to tackle the subtitles, which I'm usually one to avoid. To be fair and honest the plot is not very complicated, so you really don't need to read the subtitles too much.
Super catchy orchestrated ""da da da"" Godzilla is coming style theme tune for sure. Stayed in my seat a bit longer for that at the end.

I actually saw this on day of release in UK, and I saw The Shift before it (just as I had some free time). Knowing what I know now, if I'd only had time for one movie - I'd have actually picked The Shift - although there's not too much in it. I just found The Shift more compelling overall."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this film and it was amazing, for anyone who is going to watch this I would strongly reccomend getting ready for the scenes.
It made me cry 5 times. And Im only nine."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"As I long time Godzilla fan seeing this movie was a no brainer. That being said in films like this, the 'human element' is always an issue for me. Minus One succeeded in making me become invested in the humans part of the movie and the storyline that followed, coupled with, quite frankly, a great design and execution of Godzilla itself this is by far one of my favourite Godzilla or Kaiju movies. Here's hoping for a sequel."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies so gave seen in years. Made me realize how lackluster so many Hollywood blockbusters have become. It's really a new classic, not to be missed. It made me cry, and actually gave me chills at points. Hollywood take notes"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wonderfully refreshing take on the very classic story that started it all, with a deeply moving, human story and everything you could possibly want in a monster movie. Godzilla as never been better."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"You don't have to like monster movies to enjoy it, you just have to like good movies. Minus One was fantastic."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever the best movie of 2023
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Good subtitled action flick as the first in a long line of sequels.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of heart and enjoyed the Godzilla action scenes!
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great subtext, acting CGI very good. Very compelling. Nothing to dislike."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is more than a monster movie. It tells about post-war Japan and the difficulties of returning home, loss of community, and being attacked by a missed off monster. Very respectful to the origin story. Will see again."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the most awe inspiring films in recent memory. Beautiful cinematography, great effects in relation to Godzilla and the carnage it delivers. Beautifully done script with a plot not over simplified or complex but enough to feel invested in the outcome of its characters. 

As a life long Godzilla fan, this film has a right to stand alongside the original, if not surpass it."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,What a film. History movies fan will love it. Monster movie fans will love it. Solid story fans will love it. So good and deserves more and more eyes on it.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I am fresh out of Watching this and my gosh did it not disappoint. the Hype is real and this puts the American movies to shame! only with 15million USD Budget and they created this masterpiece. this may be the best movie of 2023 and the best godzilla movie ever to come out. the ending is crazy and the twists and u feel the raw emotions of the characters plud are actually interesting.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a f**king great film!!
"Dec 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too much dialogue for me. But the Godzilla scenes was dope wish it was more. I kind of liked it.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,gorgeous movie with an enthralling human cast that drive the story beautifully
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a remake of an old Japanese horror film and has English subtitles. We were blown away because the backstory makes this a new classic in this genre. I would highly recommend the Theatre due to action and easy to read subtitles
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't think of a better Godzilla movie currently than this one, it's so groundbreaking and powerful. Usually the human story sucks but the in where compels the movie to a level not even the original one could do, this is an eye opener for many and I can't recommend it enough. Such a great movie and it brings back to fear factor for Godzilla that we haven't seen since Shin Godzilla and the original 1954 one. Please go and watch it it's genuinely beats every Hollywood film this year."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never cried watching a Godzilla movie.
The surprise ending got me good 🥹. 
The love interest who was thought to be dead is revealed to be alive."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brutal, ground shaking, heart pounding & terrifying ""Godzilla Minus One"" is simply stunning. 
An edge of your seat & emotional tale during Postwar Japan, with many civilians critical of their government actions, struggling to deal with lost & to leave the war behind them while in search of redemption to escape the nightmares they witnessed, they now have to face another world destroying force. 
Godzilla looked like a love letter to modern & past designs, but the sound design is absolutely brilliant making my seat rumble & when Akira Ifukube original Godzilla Theme kicked in, such a great feeling."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a  fan of the ""original Godzilla"" movie you'll enjoy this movie"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é incrível, eu arriscaria dizer que esse foi o melhor filme de Godzilla, o jeito que eles tratam o japão pós segunda guerra mundial é incrível, as referências ao filme de Godzilla 1954 são incríveis, o Godzilla em si desse filme é maravilhoso sem dúvidas virou uma das minhas versões favoritas do Godzilla, amei."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW. I haven't gone to a single theater to watch a movie since the pandemic and this movie made me do it. This is a movie that everyone will enjoy: fans of Godzilla and new comers. This might be the best movie of the year.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really, really well done!  Great story and characters.  Godzilla smashing things was cool too.  Reminded me of Jurasik Park and Jaws a little bit.  The sub titles were not a problem.  You will cry at the end."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good and sad movie with a semi happy ending. I recommend you to watch it.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"this is without a doubt the best godzilla movie ever made. it sticks to the original idea and premise from decades ago. everybody in this film, every character has a giant part of the story. self reflection about all the circumstances of what this means to them and their future. go see it right now."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie from start to finish!
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"To be honest I've never been a fan of Godzilla. I wasn't very excited to go see this but I was won over within 10 minutes.
I love a good story and that is exactly what this movie gives. The characters were written so beautifully. The acting is great. The CGI is great. The cinematography is stunning. And Godzilla is finally a creature that is capable of utter destruction. 
I think anyone can appreciate this film. It's very possibly the best movie of 2023."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie I've seen all year and will probably be better than anything coming out in the next year as well. I came in expecting another fun but not so great big lizard movie, but was pleasantly surprised by the greatness of this movie. The movie left me speechless walking out of the theater. The problem I always have with movies like this is they don't have meaningful characters and they become the main focus. The characters in this movie are relatable and feel real. The relationship between the main protagonist and Godzilla shows the tenacity of humanity even when in the face of something devastating. That's what makes this a good film is the writing and the overall story, but it doesn't stop there. Godzilla in this is by far the greatest iteration of the character. When I say it makes the humans seem doomed to fail it's an understatement, Godzilla is a truly monstrous presence that seems to be unfazed by anything anyone can throw at it. And that's leaving out the greatest part, THE ATOMIC BLAST is amazing. The most beautiful, devastating, and powerful atomic blast ever seen on screen. The sound cuts out for a second before the blast hits and then you hear the explosion. The suspense it creates even though you know what is coming keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie is amazing, spending money on a movie in theaters is a waste of it's not this one. When it gets a Digital release I will be the first one in line to buy it, and same with a physical release of it gets one."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,These actors deserve Oscars.
"Dec 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fire alarm went off the first 30 minutes of the movie. Need a refund
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie By Far is the Best Godzilla Movie ever. And I believe this is the best movie of 2023. 
Great Story, Great CGi. A overall great movie. The Sub titles really give you the feeling that you traveled across the ocean
Just to go see the movie. 
I would be shocked if this movie does not get nominated for best picture. 
Don't get me wrong. Oppenheimer in my opinion,
is the odds on favorite to win best picture.
That was until I have seen this. 
And for a 15 million dollar Budget. 
Wow. The special effects look perfect.
Wow.
The Cgi looks flawless. 15 million budget. Wow. 
Director Takashi Yamazaki and Toho productions. Did great.
This movie is not only worth 5 stars.
This Movie is worth 5 Excellent stars.
Great story Line 

Toho productions and Director 
Takashi Yamazaki. 
Make this masterpiece for just $15 million dollar budget. Wow. Very impressive and Refreshing.
I enjoyed this movie very much."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Very nice touch on Godzilla movie roots story was absolutely beautiful and stunning did not expect the end which was so good and MC deserved this ending
"Dec 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Why is this movie not in 3D? This is the type of movie I want to see in 3D.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story was amazing , following a ex kamikaze pilot try to over come his biggest regret to be alive, was a amazing story for a Godzilla lover. CGI was amazing."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely entertaining on every level, this embarrasses Hollywood."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Def the Best Godzilla Movie Out there. As a diehard fan, def is the Godzilla movie of the past 70 years of Godzilla. Toho, you've done it again."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Story, Excellent special effects, beats out the American made one's that have poor quality CGI, with little or no plot, just a quick money grab. Two thumbs up for the Japanese made hit. TOHO should retract the rights, they dishonored your property!!!!"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing  - the perfect moive.  The acting was great.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen more than my fair share of Godzilla movies, but this one has to be my absolute favorite. It might be in my top 10 movies of all time. I barely even noticed that it was in Japanese, because the visual storytelling is so good. 100% a must-watch movie."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely the best Godzilla movie ever, rivaled by only the best of the classics, but not only is it one of the best Godzilla movie; it's the best kaiju movie, and one of the best movies I have ever seen. Godzilla minus one is an absolute must see. The human cast is amazing. Their messages of found family is, and self forgiveness are some of the most inspiring. That is all not to say that the namesake himself is not just as spectacular; Godzilla. Godzilla is a true monster. There is no explanation as to why he's here, or why he's the way he is, and there doesn't need to be. Goji is here to destroy, and claim the world as it's own. I admit I same a little lame saying that, but that's what this movie makes it feel like. It is a force of nature, and there is no stopping it. So once more: if you haven't seen this movie yet; GO WATCH IT."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down best movie of the year.  Most terrifying Godzilla ever put on film.  Excellent characters with depth.  Fantastic story.  This film delivers on every level.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film! Devastating Godzilla destruction, emotional human story, and empowering message about the value of each human life"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus-one is the best Godzilla movie for sure. I haven't seen them all, but what I will say is this. In every Godzilla movie when it comes to atomic breath, it's used because it's cool. But in Minus-One it is used to show the destruction and ""God"" part of Godzilla. The movie focuses on the characters and how Godzilla effects them. Not how the characters can effect Godzilla. Overall a great experience that makes you scared of Godzilla again.
9/10"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a top tier movie! I wish America had more movies like this. Great story, characters, action, effects, score, acting. The human story is actually compelling, emotional, and engaging which is so rare for a monster movie and Godzilla is frightening."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,A fantastic godzilla movie. such a fantastic way to end the year with this amazing movie. 👏  this is a must watch. you wont like it if you dont like subtitles. but if you don't mind it. you'll love it
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"The most exhilarating Godzilla rendition of its time explodes off the screen thanks to its beautiful cinematography, unique effects, and pitch perfect script. About as close to a balancing act as possible, Godzilla Minus One never feels like it's cheating its iconic central figure or the humans characters that inhabit the rest of the story. Different themes weaved into the subtext of the movie make it perhaps the most universally resonant monster ever made. This is a must see that will leave viewers moved, devastated, and blown away."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible for a franchise that's lasted 70 years and never stops with greatness
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,You know you have a good Godzilla film when you can feel the terror and destruction that is wrought from the power of a nuclear weapon. Great setting choice as well.
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a tough review for me. I rate 3.5 But My family rates 4.5. For a 15 mil budget the acting, cinematography, CGI and set locales were all fantastic, but as for the onscreen involvement of Godzilla, he was not the main focus. The focus of the movie was the character development and story of the people and their backstory. I was very impressed with the appearance of Godzilla. He looked AMAZING!!! FYI: this is a full subtitle movie. No English dubbing is available."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"No ano em que celebramos os setenta anos do icônico Godzilla, Takashi Yamazaki entrega uma obra cinematográfica excepcional que mergulha nas raízes do filme original de 1954, revitalizando a essência do Rei dos Monstros de maneira magistral. Como diretor, roteirista e responsável pelos efeitos especiais, Yamazaki não apenas homenageia o legado de Godzilla, mas também incorpora elementos narrativos, visuais e sonoros que o elevam a um novo patamar.

A direção de Takashi Yamazaki é uma aula de maestria cinematográfica. Sua habilidade em utilizar recursos visuais para transmitir a intensidade emocional dos personagens é notável. A fotografia do filme não apenas captura a destruição causada por Godzilla, mas também proporciona uma imersão profunda nos traumas pós-Segunda Guerra Mundial. As referências a eventos reais, o contexto político e as situações vivenciadas pelos personagens adicionam uma camada de realismo e robustez à trama, enriquecendo a narrativa de maneira única.

O próprio Godzilla, apresentado de maneira mais ameaçadora e assustadora do que nunca, emerge como o verdadeiro protagonista da destruição. Seu visual imponente e os sons impecáveis que o acompanham criam uma presença palpável, mesmo quando fora de cena. A imponência atinge tal magnitude que sua presença se torna uma espera angustiante, aguardando o momento em que ele ressurgirá para incendiar o Japão mais uma vez, deixando-o em um estado negativo devastador. Gojira se manifesta em um estado frenético e raivoso, lançando todo seu ódio impiedosamente sobre os japoneses, que se veem impotentes diante dessa força de destruição em massa.

A destruição que ele causa, seja demolindo prédios ou aniquilando navios, é retratada de maneira violenta, transmitindo um peso visceral a cada golpe e pisada que ressoam como uma catástrofe iminente. O raio atômico, carregado como um dispositivo nuclear, é uma obra-prima visual, com seu paralelo eloquente com uma explosão atômica, proporcionando uma experiência cinematográfica extraordinária. A carnificina provocada por Godzilla neste longa é avassaladora, ele arrebenta tudo em seu caminho, deixando uma trilha de destruição que eleva a intensidade e a grandiosidade do filme a níveis épicos.

No âmbito humano, o elenco entrega performances impecáveis, mergulhando os espectadores na pele dos personagens e fazendo com que sintam visceralmente os traumas persistentes da guerra. As pessoas são atormentadas por suas decisões, e essa angústia é personificada de maneira brilhante por Ryunosuke Kamiki como Koichi Shikishima. Seu arco emocional, lidando com o conflito de ter sido um piloto kamikaze sobrevivente, é comovente e angustiante, com momentos em que ele expressa sua dor gritando e chorando, buscando desesperadamente um sentido para sua vida.

A adição de Minami Hamabe como Noriko Oishi traz uma dimensão emocional adicional à trama. Noriko, ao aparecer na vida de Shikishima, revela que há algo que vale a pena lutar, ao carregar consigo uma criança órfã dos bombardeios no Japão. Shikishima decide acolher tanto Noriko quanto a criança, encontrando assim um motivo renovado para continuar sua luta. Esses momentos de conexão humana em meio à devastação proporcionam uma profundidade emocional significativa à narrativa.

O elenco como um todo está impecável e épico, transmitindo de maneira convincente a aflição e o desespero de viverem novamente outra crise. Cada ator contribui para a complexidade emocional da história, tornando tanto as crises pessoais quanto as batalhas com Godzilla igualmente intensas. A interação entre os personagens cria uma teia emocional que eleva a trama a patamares mais elevados, garantindo que a experiência do espectador seja não apenas de admiração pela grandiosidade do Rei dos Monstros, mas também de empatia profunda pela resiliência e coragem daqueles que enfrentam não apenas a destruição física, mas também os fantasmas do passado.

A ambientação do filme é um triunfo, ressuscitando o Japão do final dos anos 1940 com detalhes minuciosos. As sequelas visíveis nas cidades, a desorganização pós-guerra e o contexto geopolítico são elementos fortemente integrados à trama. A trilha sonora de Naoki Sato, especialmente com faixas como Fear, Confusion e Resolution, cria uma atmosfera assombrosa que complementa magistralmente as imagens na tela. O uso sábio do tema clássico de Akira Ifukube adiciona uma camada adicional de nostalgia e grandiosidade à experiência.

Em resumo, ""Godzilla Minus One"" (2023) emerge como uma jornada épica e emocional pelos 70 anos do Rei dos Monstros. Sob a direção magistral de Takashi Yamazaki, o filme revitaliza a essência do original de 1954, mergulhando em narrativas envolventes, visuais espetaculares e sonoridades impactantes. O próprio Godzilla assume uma presença ameaçadora e assustadora, com seu visual imponente e sons perfeitos que transcendem a tela. As cenas de destruição, marcadas pela violência e peso visceral, destacam-se, enquanto o raio atômico se torna uma obra-prima visual, culminando em uma carnificina impactante. No âmbito humano, o elenco entrega performances impecáveis, liderados por Ryunosuke Kamiki e Minami Hamabe, explorando os traumas pós-guerra com uma profundidade emocional comovente. A ambientação detalhada do Japão no pós-guerra, a trilha sonora arrebatadora de Naoki Sato e a integração inteligente de elementos históricos adicionam camadas de realismo à trama. ""Godzilla Minus One"" é uma experiência cinematográfica que transcende as expectativas, combinando grandiosidade, emoção e reflexão sobre os 70 anos de legado do Rei dos Monstros."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is THE Godzilla movie to see. Great story, loveable characters, spectacular visual effects. Godzilla looks AMAZING. GO SEE IT."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I cannot tell you how phenomenal this movie is. It is suspenseful and emotional and heartwarming and scary and I love it so much!!
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and storyline. Reminded me of the original but with much better special effects. The subtitles were also better than any dubbing would have been. Highly recommended!
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film.  It was nice to see Godzilla for a lot longer than in the previous movies.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 this movie is a must see! This movie puts all American Godzilla films to shame and shows that quality is always better than quantity.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning. If you consider yourself a Godzilla fan you owe it to yourself to see it. My favorite movie of the year.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie this good.  The post-WWII setting is done very well.  The movie uses heartstring-pulling human drama to pull you in and get you invested in the characters.  It's all so realistic and well done that it's shocking when the giant lizard shows up.  What's Godzilla doing in a historical drama?  The special effects are maybe half a notch below state-of-the-art (although the handling of Godzilla's heat beam is the best I've seen).  Nothing about this movie disappoints.  Perhaps Hollywood should send  some of their movie-makers to Japan for refresher lessons on how to make good movies.  Go see it!
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla I have ever seen. What made it so good was how much we were invested in the main characters. The music was awesome. Production even better. A must see movie. 
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was intense from beggining to the end, THE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER!!!"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Just Wow!!!! Not only is this one of the best Godzilla movies I’ve seen and I have seen them all but just an amazing movie overall!!!
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great return to the original vibe.  Much more interesting human dynamics than the more recent stories.  Scary monster!
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The action and the SFX the movie brought was just incredible
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever. Remarkable story. Cinematography and special effects were just terrific. Sound track is well done.  Even my wife, who hates monsters/horror/scifi said it was a good movie.  So very impressed with how the production team brought this movie together.  Just loved it."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I have been Godzilla fans since we were little kids and we absolutely LOVED this movie. I even brought my mom with us to see it since she was partly to blame for my love of the giant monsters. The cast was great, the story was compelling and Godzilla was a sight to behold"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic monster movie, with the subtext of Japan standing up on its own and casting off the United States, using the power of the people and not the puppet government the people can't trust."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG!!!! One of the greatest Godzilla movies I have ever seen.  It's up there with Shin Godzilla.  LOVE IT!!! Great story line it had me on the edge of my seat. I was scared then very sad.  I cried.  My grandson loved it and he can't wait to go see it again.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just a great Godzilla movie, but an all-around fantastic movie that ranks up there with all-time classics like Jurassic Park and Titanic."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very good and different with no English but the subtitles was good.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, everything was perfect. Loved Godzilla, the story, the actors, very cool 😎"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This is everything I want from a Godzilla movie. Take notes Hollywood.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked that it reminded me of a classic Godzilla movie, but with a storyline/sub-plot.  Being in Japanese with English subtitles added to the feel of a classic Godzilla movie.  Having been a Godzilla fan since being a child in the early 70's, the feeling of nostalgia kept a slight grin on my face during the entire movie.  The tease of a sequel left me excited for the next chapter in the Godzilla saga!!"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved it. It was the most dramatic and high stakes Godzilla movie we've ever seen that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Best international release I've ever seen.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not just a great Godzilla movie. This is a really great film! This movie is awesome. Even if you aren't a Godzilla fan, I highly recommend this movie cause the effects and story are top-notch! Go see this film!"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,It's true. Godzilla Minus One is  well worth it. Great characters. Great Godzilla.  It brings a certain fear back to the Monster and and gives the most relatable people in all the series lifespan.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Strong characters, I actually cared about the human characters. Godzilla had the old Japanese film feel while also still being threatening."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Best Godzilla Movie Of All Time! I'm So Happy That I Got To Watch Such A Great Action Packed Movie In 4DX. It Has A Little Bit Of Everything Love, Betrayal, Sadness, Redemption. All The Characters Were Likeable And The Plot Was Very Good. A Definite Must See! You Won't Be Disappointed!"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. This movie is very professionally made. Not something I would usually like, but it is excellent. It is also a very thinly veiled look into the soul of Japan, post WWII, and the crazy radical nationalists who brought their country to ruin. The producers largely stay away from pointless after-the-fact commentary on the atomic bombs themselves and move to how Japan found itself where it did in late 1945, but at the same time preserving the honor of the ordinary Japanese people, who were disgusted with where their fascist leaders took them. With no one else to help, the spirit of the Japanese people rise to fight a ""real"" monster, as opposed to the false enemy their nationalist government forced them to fight against in WWII. An indictment against pointless self-sacrifice but deeply committed to giving everything you have to save others, their community, and their common welfare is a refreshing theme. This movie says it is not about ""me."" It's about us, with refreshing honesty. Although tastefully done, it is a warning about the rise of radical nationalism today, especially in America. This is an excellent movie for our time, thoughtful, respectful, and deeply Japanese. Plus, the subtitles are easy to read for those who don't speak Japanese."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie! There are a few minor things that prevent it from being a perfect 5 for me, but this is really close to be the Godzilla movie ever!"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest Godzilla movie ever made by far.  Masterpiece of a film! Fantastic character development.  Just flawless.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie of the year! Thank you for doing Godzilla justice. I've been to see this 3 times already and I still want to see it again. This is what good movie feels like. I'd forgotten.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have always disliked Godzilla, much more the American version. I was disappointed when I heard I was being taken to watch it. Seeing subtitles I was worried it would be worse having to read captions, but it did not disappoint in the end.  This movie is amazing at building suspense, and has many twists and turns along with real rollercoasters of emotions,  and was amazing with the GFX and SFX. Don't get me started on the acting, I forgot i was even watching a movie, I thought I was there. I was shaking in my seat, jaw on the ground. This movie is amazing and one of the first Godzilla films I enjoyed. They did amazing with Godzilla and the main character."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Monster film of all time!
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The Godzilla movie I’ve always wanted to see.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid movie, but they could've had a darker ending to shake things up a little."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece for Godzilla fans and a movie of the year contender for everyone else.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"UNTHINKABLE, AMAZING, IMPACTFUL"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best rendition of Godzilla. He was mean! Very well filmed. You have to fight through the over acting otherwise this would have been a solid 5 star movie!
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I have seen. The connection to the characters is very good. They actually have meaning. Godzilla's atomic breath is jaw dropping. So much emotions of anger and sadness. Bravo. Also the guy and girl shouldn't have lived lol.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Godzilla movie will shock you on how good it is.  If you see one Godzilla movie in your lifetime, make it this one."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute triumph and a breath of fresh air. Great nod to the original godzilla with sets, atmosphere and the music. Haven't felt this good about a movie since Lord of the Rings the Fellowship."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"A return to Godzilla's roots in message, music, and awe. This will be remembered as one of the greatest Godzilla movies for years to come."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie of the year.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,best Godzilla movie in a long time!
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,ITS ALL AN EXTENDED METPHOR FOR SURVIVER GUILT IMA CRY
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"A phenomenal film, both in spectacle and in character development and performance.  This movie is an absolute must-see."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wish I hadn't heard plot descriptions from film critics. They should just avoid plot summaries cause it would have been better going into this completely cold. Still, it's a very good movie, possibly top 3 of the year"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film I’ve ever seen.
"Dec 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know why people are hyping this movie so much. The emotional aspect of this movie is important but it's nothing special. If a covers themes that are important and sensitive it does not make it automatically a great movie. I think the emotions in the movie were animated and not always believable and also there were lots of plot holes in the entire movie that made it less enjoyable for me. A typical cliche ending where the protagonist and all the main characters stay alive and well no matter of the odds.
Another problem is how easy it is to know exactly what is going to happen in the next scene. No suspense and no surprises, very disappointing."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a heart as big as its kaiju, this new entry into the Godzilla series breaks all conventions and defines amazing standards for a new era of Toho's original monster while staying true to the series' origins. Though here you connect with the characters in less than 2 hours to the point of tears, both happy and sad. Not to mention a wicked G design that perfectly blends old with new. Here's to 70 more years of Godzilla! ... Minus Color proves that this is not only a landmark monster film but also a true emotional rollercoaster when the shades change."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely incredible, especially with the budget that they had. This movie puts modern Hollywood to shame, and is a must watch for any casual moviegoer."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"While the themes are a bit hamfisted, they are still compelling and nothing overstays int welcome. It is a well balanced and honed film. The Cinematography, SFX, CGI, and Sound are all done brilliantly and confidently. doest make this city destroying threat feel too big to overwhelm an intimate film about PTSD, Survivors guilt, and community. Even if it's a bit shallow, the heart is still there. And you can tell the filmmakers had just as much fun making the film as you will have watching it. Horrifying Kaiju and all."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed that it's only the second non English lang. Godzilla film I've seen and and I want to see more now
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was soo good . This is the first movie a written a review of that i like and love. The movie is amazing, the acting is great , definitely one of my favorite movies."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved everything about it, classic Godzilla movie at its finest"
"Dec 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,You must read subtitles in this one.  The scenes with Godzilla was very well done as well as the destruction.  The story does have emotion and it really hits depending on your sensitivity.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a major sleeper hit. A great callback to the old school, but with a quality drama among the humans. Best I've seen in theaters in some time."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Most monster movies lack plot  not interesting.  Godzilla Minus One had a plot  followed peoples lives and touched your emotions.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,A Godzilla movie with Godzilla front and center but with great acting and a excellent human storyline.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The king of kaijins strikes back, oh my.... amazing."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla films ever.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding.  Great story of Godzilla, but also of Japan right after WWII.  Excellent storytelling.  Highly recommend"
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great character driven monster movie.cried at the end.must see
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, character build (complex storylines) , and great balance of excitement and empathy."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"To keep it short, I was pleasantly surprised with this film; I've only ever seen maybe four other Godzilla movies before seeing this one, and I was blown away. The lighting and visuals are gorgeous, the story is engaging, and I found myself liking every single character we were introduced to - the character development is wonderful. This is more than just a monster movie; this is a tale about the human struggle with PTSD and how it affects not only the life of the inflicted, but of all those around them as well."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down, the best Godzilla movie. Do yourself a favor and go watch this flick!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"a must see! this is definitely the best movie i've seen this year and the movie had less then 15 million dollar budget and puts marvel and others with over 200 million dollar budget to shame! this movie has everything you need in a movie. Drama, action, suspense and a great human story! please do yourself a favor and go watch this movie you wont be disappointed!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla I have seen since the first one.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just absolute jewel of a film ,entertaining."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been a fan of Godzilla since I was a child. This is legitimately one of the best if not the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. One of the few times in a Godzilla movie where I care about the characters and wanted to spend time with them. Everytime Godzilla was on screen I was at the end of my seat because the tension with these characters we cared about was so palpable. I love this movie, and I hope people watch this in theaters."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling at its best!!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first Godzilla set the standard, and Minus One is essentially a remake of the original. Most remakes don't hold a candle to the original, but this movie improves every plot hole, and actually delivers on the terror that the original intended, but couldn't quite reach because of special effects limitations when it was made in 1954. It also delivers more emotional impact from the characters and storyline, and Godzilla is in the film at a higher percentage of playtime than the original. I imagine Eiji Tsuburaya is beaming with joy from the other side at how they brought his original vision to life like he intended it to be. Best Godzilla movie and design to date."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"In this cinematic masterpiece, humans take center stage, with Godzilla serving as a captivating accent. The profound survivor guilt experienced by the protagonist is truly moving. This rendition of Godzilla is a force to be reckoned with—powerful and terrifying. The destruction of Ginza is nothing short of nightmare fuel. In essence, don't miss out on what can be hailed as the most meaningful Godzilla film ever crafted."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing character development! Musical score was immersive, CGI was incredible! Story was captivating, this is how you make a movie!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was so good. Compelling characters, heartwarming storing lines, really thoughtful shorting editing and music. One of the best films I've ever seen."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"certified instant classic, emotional, epic, effects that put American films to shame"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Big ol lizard goes boom boom
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was absolutely amazing I've always loved godzilla and they freaking killed it on this one I haven't been to the movie theaters in years and this was the first I saw and was blown away highly recommend This movie 10/10
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I like how intense it is how cinematic it is I also like how epic it is it's a great movie
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a perfect balance of epic destruction and compelling human drama, Godzilla Minus One is superior to anything Hollywood could produce this year, as it works as a creature feature, war drama, and disaster movie. Go to see this movie, it's raw emotional undertones will rock your world, and it's beautiful message of the value of life will have you on the verge of tears."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not to ostracize those who don't like this movie..  but you have to be a troll, poorly traveled, or just not very smart to not be able to recognize how good this Japanese film is.  You will have to read (the horror!), but the Japanese dialogue and inflection is important to the emotion of the movie.  It's an challenging film about survival, duty and loss... with a big lizard.
The sound is brilliant... as well as the silence when needed.
What they did with less than 15 MILLION is unreal.
This should serve as a wake up call to Hollywood.  We don't need your bloated, expensive product anymore with poorly written characters no one cares about.  How can Han Solo die and you don't care?
Answer: the writing is just that bad... they should have stayed on strike.  Foreign films are up to the challenge of entertaining us and not lecturing us about how bad we are as people."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a less than $15mil budget, haunting music, and showing of the harsh realities of war, this movie surpasses most, of not all, Hollywood produced movies this year. Definitely worth the watch."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best Godzilla movie I have seen. It was so well done, it barely needed to even have Godzilla so the scenes where he shows up is just an added bonus."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"probably the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. loved the story line, the perspective from the Japanese viewpoint of the war and life after."
"Dec 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, not interesting at all, subtitles are Terrible."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece, left the cinema shaking my head, moved and in disbelief at how good it was. Score was absolutely spot on, understated at the right points and high impact when it was demanded. I want to see it again and again!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Great heartfelt moving story. Awesome score and fx. Best Godzilla movie.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This was honestly the best film of the year. Simply breathtaking story telling and just a completely authentic spin on the Godzilla story through the lens of Japanese civilians. Brought me to tears. Had the feel of the original Jaws movie.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,An actual Godzilla movie. Made me cry and had my jaw dropped the entire time. This is what I mean when I tell people I'm a huge fan of the Godzilla franchise. Not the VS Kong bs. (That's a good movie just not true Gman.) Go watch it!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! Best Godzilla ever! Go see it!!! It was so much fun!!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fantastic!!!!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the classic godzilla feel.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The storytelling is remarkable given that the backbone of it is Japan in the immediate wake of World War II. The colors are also beautiful and the acting and lighting is strong. A twist at the end is decent, too. Also, it's impressive how a ship was constructed, which really helped paint a portrait of a key aspect of the Godzilla character.
As good as Gareth Edwards' Godzilla film was, this one is better."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Pure cinema and emotions. Highly recommend that everyone watch this.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Freaking amazing movie the movie was very intense in a good way the story is very good and the time  was sick too this is one of the best Godzilla movies so far. 💪
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie in the franchise.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't even know what to say.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing what they could do with the budget.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing drama with giant monsters, whats not to love?"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie ever, Hollywood with a bigger budget its very short compared with this one, must see!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The monster scenes, the story, the acting, the writing were all top notch. The effects were incredible, Godzilla looks awesome. I've been a monster movie fan, Godzilla in particular for as long as I can remember, and this was one of the best I've seen in a while! I can't believe they did all that on a $15 million budget!!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Favorite movie of the year. 
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"absolutely amazing. emotional, powerful, heroic, honest, courageous, and unforgettable. immensely better than any hollywood godzilla films."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of, if not the best, Godzilla movies ever put out. The monster action is fun, but the human story is really gripping and emotional."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good. The story was decent and Godzilla looked really good most of the time. It paid homage to the original film. If youre a Godzilla fan, Id definitely see it."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely one of the best movies to have come out this year.  In terms of monster movies, one of the freshest in a long series of action packed campiness that has come out in the recent years. The human characters were believable and I could feel their pain and trauma laid out in a way that wasn't forced, especially in the time this takes place in. Godzilla himself was utterly terrifying despite being a tad smaller than his American counterpart.  Bang on job Toho!!

5/5 would and will see again!!"
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,they made a godzilla movie where I care about the human characters that's crazy
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm a big Godzilla fan, so I didn't know what to expect going in... I can be a bit fussy. 
But this caught me completely off guard. Even if this didn't have Godzilla in it, the story and characters were so engrossing, I was lost in their story and moved by their plight. 
But when Godzilla does show up, he's terrifying and menacing! 
This needs to be seen on a big screen with surround sound. Just incredible."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Pure nostalgic fun. Subtitles very easy to follow. Exremely well done. Like good ol' monster movies used to be.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,So fucking good. This movie made me a fan of Godzilla
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I walked out of the theater and immediately knew it was a movie I will be rewatching for the rest of my life.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Love!! I love Godzilla and this one is amazing!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see for g fans .
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the best Godzilla film ever. Just Wow!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,To beat out all the movie houses with a subtitle movie should be a disgrace. This movie was one of the best for 2023.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla move Ive seen. Actual storyline between the humans in the story. Effects look great. Super original take on a classic story. Hoping there may be another one down the road.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best  of 2023. Scary, poignant, thrilling."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing Godzilla movie, where in the Legendary Pictures Godzilla-verse the titans are cool to watch, the people always feel like they're in the way, meanwhile in this movie both Godzilla and the human element are amazing, you get sucked into the main characters story."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute peak of not only Godzilla films but also of Cinema in general!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Seems more realistic than the one with Kong also more original !!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most emotionally terrifying movies I've ever seen. The best Godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie! So much raw emotion from the actors and the soundtrack is phenomenal! So much emotion in a Godzilla film. One of the top movies of 2023, if not the top movie."
"Dec 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,All it is was a 2 hour yap session that didn't make sense I enjoyed Godzilla vs kong way more don't see this
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I would highly recommend this movie.  It is spoken in Japanese with English caption.  It was an excellent storyline.  The special effect was amazing.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great Godzilla movie. As a fan of all the original movies and the newer movies, Godzilla Minus One stands apart as a new retelling of the original 1954 Godzilla."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing I would definitely go see it again ps if you have a D-box theatre near you go see this movie in D-box makes it feel more real.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! Best movie I've seen in a long time. The tension, the plot build, the drama, all building a highly enticing and entertaining storyline."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a classic in the making. This is cinema at its best. This is GODZILLLAAAAAA!
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A towering creative achievement on the level of Jurassic Park (1993) or Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), all on a budget of $15m straight out of Japan. Best movie of 2023."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Its was a great movie
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Gojira ever. Involving characters, poignancy, subtext and surtext on the mistake of the war. Great use of faded color for a period feel with 21st c special effects."
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Great throwback to what a Godzilla movie was all about. While also providing a small glimpse at the aftermath of war.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Super exciting! Checks all the boxes for a Godzilla bonanza and goes above and beyond with an emotional ptsd survival story.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely epic! They did an amazing job with this film.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies. The people in this movie make you care for them and what happens to them. If you don't get a little teary-eyed at the end, you must have a cold heart."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow this movie is really amazing. All the actors were perfect for their role and Godzilla was really something that i didn't expect to see
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite film of 2023. It has everything I wanted as a fan of the genre but strong characters and thebes
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was devastatingly beautiful.  I cried so much.  I cared for the humans and the country.  Godzilla was scary in this film.  This movie has the best atomic breath scene I have ever seen in a Godzilla film.  Brilliant masterpiece.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! Took the wife since she did not grow up with godzilla much. She loved it and so did I.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Godzilla is scary.  It’s not a modern day Godzilla movie, no one is looking to get close to this guy, they’re fighting for their lives from the start. It’s got well paced action, suspense, a good story line with a touch of love and a terrifying Godzilla. It takes place near the end of WWII in Japan and follows the story of a disgraced Kamikaze pilot. Oh, how I loved the pilot’s story. The movie is in Japanese with subtitles, my husband said he hardly noticed and I agree, but I am partial to subtitles. I am not a Godzilla expert, but I enjoy good movies, and this was a fun one to watch."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lotta action. Good story along with the Godzilla focus. It won't win an Oscar, but overall fun movie."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually superb with solid performances all around. Great fun, and a great 70 year tribute!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the Godzilla movies. Gives me everything ioved about the original films with modern day effects. Really enjoyed how the wove the story in this prequel and the characters were compelling as well. Well done!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Happy to say it was the best film I have seen this year.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The human drama makes it feel like a Spielberg film (one of his earlier, better works) but the raging kaiju that is loosed upon an already devastated Tokyo is pure, unadulterated Godzilla!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has been a while to be entertained with a genuine story...GM-1 did that in spades!!

There was a general theme throughout the film, but it wasn't done with such heavy handedness, there was a slow start, build up and then came  the outstanding pay off. 

I wholeheartedly recommend to everyone to see the movie yourself and make your own judgement on the merits presented.

Godzilla has been Reborn!!!!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Originally Posted on LetterBoxd: This is my third time watching this film, and I… I think this has literally become my favorite movie of all time…

I love everything about this film. How traditional it is in story telling.

The elements of the films characters work so well.

Noriko as this element of balance and happiness within Koichi's life. Mr Nobu as the wisely veteraned ex-military specialist. And the Doc and Kid as the kindly side characters, one representing the old generation and the other (kid) representing the new generation. Both treated with respect.

When Godzilla arrives to threaten these characters, you feel the weight of their terror. Largely thanks to Director Takashi Yamazaki, who wrote, directed and led the VFX for the movie! His incredible character writing is what elevates this film from being a good one to being a great one.

This film isn't just good Godzilla action, this is just good storytelling.

I'm about to dive into spoilers so fair warning!

When Noriko presumably dies, everyone feels the weight of her death. She wasn't just a throw away character i. The plot, you actually feel the weight of her death because the characters feel it. And through the characters emotions, Koichi especially, you can feel the air in the room be lost.

This personalizes the fight between Godzilla and Koichi Shikishima, and what makes it so impactful. He's not just fighting to redeem himself anymore, he's fighting to protect what he still has left, and he's even prepared to die for it…

Very heavy stuff.

The ending of the film being happy and Noriko turning out to be okay doesn't undo any of that. And the way Godzilla is Defeated is both thematically satisfying and a book end to the story.

Hear me when I say that the battle between Koichi Shikishima and Godzilla will go down in history as one of if not the most iconic moment in a Godzilla Film. A David and Goliath moment to inspire future generations.

At the end of the day, this film is absolutely worth your time, and everyone who has seen it like you will all agree, this is not just one of the best Godzilla Films ever made, but one of the best Kaiju films ever made. And makes me hopeful for the future of cinema…"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Godzilla movie. Other than the monster's movement seeming a little robotic at times, it was awesome."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Now that's what I call a cinematic masterpiece.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched the movie twice now and was just as amazed the second time.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme é maravilhoso!!!,melhor filme de Godzilla que eu já vi,parabéns Toho"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"After visiting Japan this year, seeing the Hiroshima Memorial Museum & watching Oppenheimer, it really puts things into perspective especially after watching Godzilla. Very well done movie, it’s underrated AND it did so well aesthetically while being on a budget. It was very entertaining and I had no idea how it was going to end. Can’t wait for G Minus 2? Is that the next title? lol"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is finally the Godzilla film I'd been hoping for after so many others had at best fallen short of what I felt was the proper treatment for this franchise, or at worst missed the mark completely. It strikes the difficult balance of achieving a competently compelling human plot and characters, while still delivering on the high intensity action and spectacle that audiences crave from the genre. 

The use of Godzilla as an allegory for the inescapable trauma and PTSD that completely engulfed the Japanese population post WWII was perfectly woven in, and in my opinion paid true homage to the very real human psychological origin and idea behind the creation of the monster itself. 

The cinematography and CGI work was very tastefully done, and had far better visual impact onscreen than many other recent more heavily funded offerings in the genre, proving that a budget is not necessarily a barrier to a true quality product for audiences.

Proving that it's indeed very possible to make a seemingly one dimensional franchise break out of previous limitations, I was overall refreshed and entertained by this entry, and hope to see more from the director and studios responsible. Definitely a worthy offering that stands in contrast to today's current often abysmal menu of theatrical release fare."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. It really showcases the heartfelt emotions and humanity of the characters in a way that I have rarely seen in any other kind of monster movie. Well done!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story brought me to tears. Unlike other monster movies, this one takes time to focus on the value of life. This is now one of my favorite movies."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning film. A breath of fresh air. Hollywood needs to hire directors like this so we can get more amazing films with great plots and characters. Perfect score.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Finaly past 16 years
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a lifetime Godzilla fan. I have seen every Godzilla movie ever made several times. My favorite G movie has always been the original 1954 Gojira, which like Minus One, is in Japanese with English subtitles.  
Minus One may be not only the best ever Godzilla movie, but also one of the best movies for 2023. The Character development is excellent and you really care about their post-war struggles to rebuild a normal life. Godzilla himself is stunningly terrifying in a way not presented since 1954. All I can say is WOW! This is a MUST-SEE, even if you are not a Godzilla fan."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"An extremely well-made and entertaining film that focuses on the characters, emotion, and story rather than repetitive ""Man in suit stomps through a set of miniatures"" action. Godzilla is a literal force of nature here. This is one that MUST be seen on the big screen for the most impact."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"From the plot, to the actors, special fx and score, this makes for an almost perfect Godzilla movie"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this is THE Godzilla film to see! Terrifying, dramatic, jaw dropping, emotional, heartfelt, and more!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with no expectations, oh boy they have made this a moving real love story & redemption. The movie is a love letter to the original Godzilla movies & when Godzilla makes land, it is something that left the entire cinema speechless as their animation goes buck wild & it is visceral! From start to finish, I was invested in to the storyline & in the sad points - you feel for their plight, etc. This was a belter & one which I will be what they do for the next instalment?"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best movie of 2023. Second place isn't even close. The CG is wonky, but good enough. But the story is what matters here. How the people deal with this monster is epic. This movie is about the people, not the monster. And even though the monster is in the majority of the movie, the story of the people still shines through. It's an amazing achievement. Absolutely fantastic."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome nuclear lizard smashes Japan and the people have to come together to take it down. Great human drama amongst the monster mayhem.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I've seen every Godzilla movie made and this one is the best so far.  So much better than the current American Godzilla movies Hollywood should be embarrassed.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMAZING GRIPPING TALE OF FOUND FAMILY! Not really a godzilla fan either, but this iteration of the King of the Monsters was honestly the best version I've been exposed to. The film does such a amazing job in highlighting the human cast and root for them rather thsn the tyrant lizard. Best movie I've seen all year! A definite must-watch!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"That movie was absolutely fantastic, Best Godzilla Film since the original."
"Dec 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am at a loss as to understand why it has got so many fantastic reviews, from amature and professional critics alike??
It is total rubbish, from the monster, who`s eyes are like glazed wallnuts that refuse to move at all. The rediculous anamtronic walk, to the terrible acting or should that be overacting skills of the entire cast. 
Do any of them have any idea of realistic emotional content?? Scream, laugh, cry, speak softly, shudder, sneer, slap, hug, ridicule, console, all in one a line sentence??
I also don`t understand why some of the cgi is pretty good and then in the next scene it is almost none existent? Did they run out of money or skill in this department? 
Please please go and see this just to experience how bad it really is!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storytelling. Up and down emotionally with excellent ending. Godzilla effects were superb
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Japanese Masterpiece.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic visuals, great acting, great pacing, slow enough to develop the characters but never to the point of being boring"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this, it was refreshing to see Godzilla go back to the WW2 roots and have characters that the audience cares about."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest Godzilla Film of all time no doubt. Emotional amd had me on the edge of my seat
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the loud ass bass coming from the Beyonce movie I was still able to be reengaged with the film from the pure perfect acting, spectacles, and writing. This movie is one of the best films of the year and I'm dying to see it again."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down the best movie of 2023 and I can't think of a movie I've seen in the last 2 or 3 years that comes REMOTELY close.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent blend of real characters with engaging arcs and total classic kaiju destruction. Not just a good Godzilla film, but a good film period."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Went in thinking I was going to watch a smash up action monster movie. Left with puffy eyes and a smile on my face. Must watch cinema!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Go watch now!!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Movie of 2023 absolutely my favorite movie in the last 5 years EVER
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,this was probably by far the best Godzilla movie I seen
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing story and character development. Loved it
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla movies ALWAYS need more Godzilla and this one wasn’t any different. This was my favorite Godzilla of all time though. The American versions don’t come close. 
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla fan or not a must see
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,A truly must see. Went in with no expectations and wow!  I may just need to go watch it again.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fan of all godzilla movies, old ones when I was a kid and new ones as an adult.  I really liked G minus one. Very good homage to the og films while not being campy. Fun CGI. Likeable characters. Checks the boxes for monster movie. Glad I saw it in cinema."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of the year regardless what critics and film purest say.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,First Godzilla movie that made me tear up. The families story is tragic and heartwarming. Godzilla has never been so scary. Those eyes!
"Dec 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aggressively mediocre! Maybe I was expecting to much, based on the high audience and critics reviews. Both the acting and the music seemed overwrought. On top of that it was about a half hour to long. It was extremely boring. my wife slept for an hour. If you need a two hour nap, this is the place."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat near the middle and end, I highly recommend watching this! They had the original Godzilla Music which gave me chills! One of the best Godzilla iterations I've ever seen! 10/10"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla moviee
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome story and Godzilla was bad ass!!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,nostalgic feel but also modern at the same time
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s looks like godzilla compare to the other resent movies and the old sound track is back
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"When you compare this movie to previous other Godzilla movies, this one has surprised me. You actually have a story, you care about the characters and supporting cast. Godzilla is a villain and you are rooting for the Humans. This film goes back to it's roots. With a budget of around $15 million, with the visual effects, acting and story, this movie deserves all the praise, support and attention. Definitely a 100/10. A Godzilla film that will be remembered for ages. What a time it is to be a Godzilla fan."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,An original remake that exceeded my expectations!! Really good
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is way better than it has any right to be.  This is the Titanic of monster movies.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible! The best story/character driven Godzilla Movie in years! Breathtaking shots and thrilling music. This movie brought me to tears. 10/10.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great human story with dazzling Godzilla mayhem.
"Dec 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie in the world
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,A must go see in the movie theater! Godzilla taking out its revenge on the humankind that created it. You see a strong heartfelt redemption story as well. You will be rooting for the characters all the way till the end!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"no Americans to mess it up, pure Japanese Godzilla! great sound and visuals, and enough humanity toake.you teary-eyed"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"what a flick! great Godzilla, great effects, characters you care about. just great."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was THE BEST film I have seen in 2023!! This is not simply a great ""Godzilla"" movie but rather a GREAT MOVIE that happens to be a ""Godzilla"" movie! The writing was tight, it was brilliantly acted, a classic redemption story and very much a tear jerker for unexpected but all the right reasons. Parents take your kids to this movie!! This film perfectly and overtly reflects the values of heroism, stead fastness, overcoming incredible adversity, and the power of the common man!  Bring the wife or girlfriend as the love story included within is hard to beat! There is no where to find fault in this movie~and that's RARE!  Just a REAL triumph!! Hollywood you need to take heed and gain the lessons spelled out by this movie that cost a paltry 15 million $$ to make~but has the production value of ANY film made for 10 times that! ! I am SOOOOO glad I made an effort to see this film on the big screen and its goes without saying that this film will find its way into the ""Lionheart Movie Collection"" !
Whether or not you are a fan of ""Godzilla"" go out and SEE THIS FILM while you still can in a movie theater! You WILL thank me, or kick yourself for missing out!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. But this was an evil godzilla. He wasn't helping Japan but rather destroying it. Still would recommend it if you are a Godzilla fan.
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing !!! Best Godzilla movie ever !! Love the Japanese filmmaking !!
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven't been this invested in a movie since End Game. It was amazing. The characters, the growth, redemption and monster destruction was A+. Go see it!!"
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect Godzilla Movie
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perhaps the best Godzilla to date. Some sappiness, but overall very good."
"Dec 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There's reasons to like this throwback. They're pretentious reasons. But reasons nonetheless. Much like this version of Godzilla, GMO is a slow, lumbering, sleepwalking slog."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the story and action scenes. If you dont cry at least once in this movie youre the real monster here not Godzilla
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"So managed to catch an early screening of this film, and while I'm a big fan of the Toho Godzilla films I surprisingly preferred the legendary Godzilla movies, but that my opinion and not what we're talking about. Minus One blow my mind, it's feels like a true  reimagining of the original film, Godzilla is great in every scene, the cgi had an amazing realism that is lost in modern cinema. The best part wasn't even Godzilla it was the people. The story pacing was great even though it slowed near the end for sec. Over all my favourite Godzilla movie and possibly favourite movie of all time.
I can't recommend this any more, a must see movie"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I took my son to see this movie and honestly didn't know anything at all about it, other than that it is a Godzilla movie. I was expecting a fairly mindless monster movie and was totally blown away by what this movie actually is. The original Godzilla movie interwove themes of the anxiety that Japanese people felt over their defeat in WWII, the fact that they were the only people to ever suffer an attack by an atomic weapon, and the betrayal many people felt they had suffered at the hands of Japanese leadership. This movie forefronts all of that, going back to what Godzilla originally was. Godzilla (the monster) is central to the story, as an implacable and all-but unstoppable force, but the centerpiece is a very beautiful and occasionally sad human story. For the first time in a long time, Godzilla the kaiju is actually scary, the people seem very human, and the story is absorbing."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A triumph!! Incredible VFX. The movie itself is stunning to view. The Japanese subtitles don't matter. You still get emotionally attached to these characters and root for them towards the end. Gojira is a cold-blooded monster in this one. He destroys without remorse, It was a joy to watch this film. The first movie I really enjoyed and cried for in years. Give it a chance, you'll like it."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"An engaging storyline in relation to the franchise, greatly cinematic and a lot of throwbacks to the 60's Godzilla movies I grew up with. Great soundtrack as well, incorporating the traditional themes in a symphonic score. We saw it in 4D! Amazing"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Thrilling moments of chaos and disaster set on the backdrop of a very heartfelt human story.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Solo diré que es una obra maestra
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great plot and an incredible Godzilla.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best Godzilla I’ve ever seen
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one wastes no time jumping straight into the action and effectively showing the aftermath of war and it's destruction. Everytime Godzilla is on the screen you can't help but feel an awe of amazement and terror. The human characters are fantastically written and the action sequences are outstanding, this all adds upto one of the best films of the year."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie,  this is more than just a Godzilla movie its really about the characters. You really can feel the emotion and intensity of this film. Watch it with my wife and she is no Godzilla fan, but loved the move and thought it was the best of 2023. I truly agree  with her! Watch it you won't regret it!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One : Plus Two, Subtract a Fraction of Eight    RATING:: A-

So anyway, I kinda got on a bit of a Japanese kick lately because I knew this new Godzilla movie was coming out and I thought, ""I never saw that last one Toho made, Shin Godzilla, I suppose I should look that up."" It was only available on Crunchyroll, an anime streaming service for nerds. I'm certainly not a nerd, but they had a free one week trial.  One week was plenty of time to watch just one Godzilla movie and then cancel the anime channel. No need to waste any more time there, I'm not one of those weird anime people.

After I finished Shin Godzilla I was like, ""Well, I've still got like a week anyway, maybe I'll try some of these weirdo shows with talking bananas and purple hair, just to see and then I'll cancel it."" By the end of the week trial I had watched all kinds of random things from Chainsaw Man, to Sgt. Frog, along with the oddly named, ""That One Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"" and my favorite, ""My Hero Academia."" I was literally in the middle of episode 36 when the trial went out and I was yelling at the tv to let me watch more of this Asian crack!  It didn't listen.  It chided me.  Like that time at Panda Express when I asked for a large cup of orange sauce to go.

So, aside from now contemplating my hair color and life choices, I watched Shin Godzilla from 2016.  It was terrible.  I'd rate it a D.  The online description literally says, ""In the film, politicians struggle with bureaucratic red tape in order to deal with the sudden appearance of a giant monster that evolves whenever it is attacked.""

… Are you serious!? Politicians struggle with bureaucratic red tape? A Godzilla film? That's your opening statement?  I don't know what they were thinking. Who wants to watch politicians do anything, unless it's slowly melting ""Terminator 2"" style into a lake of lava? That film felt like they had to make it or they'd lose their rights to Godzilla, like Fox's last Fantastic Four movie.  A description for a Godzilla film should be like, ""in ancient Shogun Japan, three war-torn Ronin Samurai seek revenge against the newly summoned demon beast, Godzilla, who ravaged their master and village!"" Make him only like 30 feet tall and have all kinds of oni and supernatural things. It shouldn't be, ""Godzilla is sued by the people of Tokyo in this four hour courtroom drama."" Although a Godzilla courtroom drama does sound kinda cool now that I think about it.  Godzilla is up on the stand and the district attorney is grilling him over property damage and Godzilla panics and eats him.  Then that's another charge against him, so he charges up his blue-gamma-blast and the judge tells him he's over-ruled!  This just writes itself.

So, because of the horrible Shin Godzilla, I was a bit hesitant to head out to Godzilla Minus One, but I was bored and wanted to go to the theater and I have an unlimited pass and so I did.  I was very glad I did!  I enjoyed it a lot!  For this 38th Godzilla film, they decided to go back to its roots.  It's set in the late 1940's just after WWII.  It's about a kamikaze pilot who ran from his duty.  He battles his own demons as a result of this choice and has to find his way back to honor.  This is the focus of the film.  So, you may be saying, ""But I thought it was a Godzilla film?!  I thought you mocked the other one for being about politicians!""  Sure, but this one made it interesting, it was much more personal. And a redemption story of a coward pilot is much better than twenty politicians debating whether to setup a special committee to investigate a possible monster attack.  This was a character study with Godzilla representing inner demons of humiliation and dishonor. It worked for me.  If they made a Godzilla movie about me, the beast would represent the regret of eating at Taco Bell for a month straight and what I did to my master bathroom.

That said, it won't work for everyone.  It is Japanese made, not American made.  It is all in Japanese with English subtitles.  It only had a $15 million budget.  It is a period drama.  It harkens back to the original 1954 Godzilla film.  If you are just looking for a big lizard kicking over skyscrapers, this isn't the movie for you. You're probably looking for GodLizzo. If you want a cool Japanese film with a more deeply felt character arc that happens to be set around a big lizard destroying Tokyo and the Pacific, then this is the film for you.

I would recommend seeing it with the proper expectations in place.  It was cool to see it on the big screen with Godzilla huge and angry.  The whole time I was wondering what the Japanese people would have thought if this was the film shown in 1954 theaters.  It would have been a pretty cool reaction.

One of my favorite things was the integration of the original musical score into the Godzilla scenes. When that kicked in, it made my heart smile.  It was a fun time at the theater.  I've seen around 12 of the 28 Godzilla films and this was probably my favorite one."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good. The meanest and most hateful Godzilla ever!! Must see. I loved it!!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Must see in IMAX!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great update from Japan's Toho, the original. Very Japanese, very restrained, campy and respectful. Overall, it's a compelling story with just the right amount of monster."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie and story!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of the year, no joke."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie of all time and I have seen 95% of them all. 
The human element was just done superbly!
My compliments to the director."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie will have you stunned from beginning to end. Easily one of the best movies I've possibly seen this year wow, this is a must watch."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Looking forward to its release in Spain
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went to see the movie this last weekend. It is absolutely the best Japanese Godzilla movie I have seen. The story carries it. The characters are deeply heartfelt and understood. It says things about the Japanese government during the time of WW2 that I felt were insightful. And 'Zilla? Absolutely ferocious and terrifying. I think more than ever before. This is of course NOT ""hero 'Zilla"" this is ""atomic bomb 'Zilla"". And you feel the tension and you feel the intent and heart of the characters also. Its a fantastic film."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This is probably the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. It is what I imagine the original creators would have made if given the technology that we have. If you have to have a reason to start watching movies with subtitles this is the reason.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,A great Godzilla film that's always a great Post-WW2 drama. Emotional and gripping.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie... bored of seeing Hollywood's version of more talking and less Godzilla screentime and most confusing perspective & Protoganist version of Godzilla. This Japanese version has good enough screentime for Zilla, scope for the story and characters and well directed ..it is worth watching.. it's a simple no fuzz movie..actors had a purpose too...."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one is an incredible movie. The story is fantastic, the plot, the effects and everything. It's also incredibly realistic looking way better than the new Godzilla movie coming out. The crazy fact is that Godzilla minus one Had a budget of 15 million and it still insanely realistic. Definitely worth watching"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one 

The hype is everywhere. I am a big fan of Gojira and his all his incarnations. Without spoilers, let's compare where Minus one "" borrowed"" from other blockbusters… 
Jaws 
Star Wars 
War of the Gargantuas 

Lots of unfinished business at the end, loose ends to tie up. What elicited the response of joy from myself was the ""Gojira"" theme that announced the arrival of the big guy. If you listen carefully, it pays homage to "" Mothra"".. 

Fingers crossed for a part 2"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"phenomenal, loved the movie. one of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great stuff.  Harkens back the original versions themes.  The human component is felt.  Every appearance feels purposeful without being over done.  Not the over the top action bonanza that the Kong crossover is
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This is what Godzilla truly is.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. Everything about it was great. The story the design for Godzilla wasn't bad honestly. He kinda scared me in the beginning.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I wish I could give it more stars. This movie was absolutely amazing and is the best movie of 2023. This is a must watch like asap. The plot and the cinematography was incredible I'm not over exaggerating. Go watch now!!!!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"one of the best films of the year, a stunning tale of post war japan with some of the best man vs monster movies ever"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see movie if you are a Godzilla fan. This was the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. It’s on my top 50 movies of all time.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie took Godzilla back to its roots. It was an emotional experience to see Godzilla treated so well by the director. You also felt as if you could experience the emotions of the human characters. Truly a brilliant film.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I just loved this movie. The characters are detailed and truly human. Godzilla was awesome in every minute.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Arguable the best Godzilla movie ever. Got so involved in  the movie I forgot I was reading captioning. Actually had a plot, besides the lizard, and was fun to watch. Best creature yet."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Truly enjoyed this movie.  Have been a Godzilla fan since I was 5.  Almost 5 decades. Love the throwback to the seriousness of the original and reclaim that horror feeling when Godzilla is on scene. Unfortunately he is not on as much as would like.  Almost the hidden Easter eggs through out the movie is quite impressive with respect given to past movies.  
There are a few plot angles that hold me back from giving it 5 stars but in the end it is a Godzilla movie after all and one of the best ever produced."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie since the original. Absolute perfection.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterful film filled with amazing spectacle, high tension, thundering action, heartfelt emotion and just an incredible story. The acting, special effects, music and directing are top tier making it one of the best entries in this legendary Gojira franchise!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie in general, but best monster movie of all time."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, but the movie drags in a couple of screens."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Even though it is in all Japanese, it still has a great plot and emotional storyline."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Highly recommended. The characters are extremely engaging and Godzilla returns to form.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was surprised to experience a heavy-hitting emotional movie that also includes a monster with an atomic heat ray. The focus of the story being immediately during the aftermath of WWII makes for a great origin story of Godzilla alongside characters who are dealing with, not only their country being destroyed, but almost every aspect of their lives needing to be rebuilt. Theres a lot to unpack and quite a few themes that are tackled in a film where I thought I would just be witnessing a giant lizard monster flipping ships and knocking over buildings. 

There is a moment where everything goes silent, and I cant remember the last time Ive been in a crowded theater where it seemed the audience was holding their breath. There were times of cheering, clapping, and Im sure some tears being shed. What more could you want? My only complaint is despite Ryunosuke Kamiki appearing in a few dozen films but his ability to express realistic crying on screen is nearly non-existent. Overall, though, Im quite satisfied and will be enthusiastically recommending this to everyone."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A thoroughly enjoyable and interesting character driven story with all the right nods to the classic Godzilla basics.   Interesting how a Japanese movie with English subtitles, not primarily intended for a US audience, made on a shoestring budget is far better than the vast majority of what's coming out of Hollywood these days."
"Dec 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,I have no idea how people can enjoy this movie. It was absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen…my wife and son all contemplated walking out at several points. The actors overact…nonstop screaming in simple conversations. It is very slow…wife fell asleep (which is why we didn’t leave). I have no idea how critics can applaud this film…strongly disagree. No logic to why Godzilla attacks and just bad dialogue throughout the film. Save your money!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It has been over a week now that I have seen Godzilla Minus One and I am still thinking about it. Easily the best Godzilla film ever made and ranks as one of the best disaster films ever made as well. The storytelling was just spot on and kept you glued from beginning to end. The movie looked amazing and it was on a $15mm budget??? Unbelievable. I cannot wait to see it again. 
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,this changed my life
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It made me cry, it made me stare in awe, but especially, it made me fear for the future of humanity. I've always been a #teamgodzilla for the sake of movie pleasure, but this time I was #teamtokio all the way. What a beautiful writing. What a great director. What a great movie"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up in the 80's, watching Godzilla marathons whenever they came on TV, which wasn't often, but when they did, you can bet I was glued to the TV. Most Godzilla movies were campy, made for kids, so yeah, we didn't care for the plot, we just wanted to see giant monsters fighting. The first scary Godzilla movie that I watched was Godzilla 1985, or as it was called in Japan, The Return of Godzilla. G85 is a direct sequel to the original Godzilla from 1954 and ignores all the movies from the 60's and 70's. It returned Godzilla to its roots, where he's more of a force of nature, not necessarily a hero or villain, so it was a nice change of pace of what I had seen.

 Having seen every Godzilla movie from the Showa and Heisei eras, and some from the Millenium series, I was longing for something more modern, not just a man in a rubber suit. Godzilla 1998 was an utter disappointment. So when WB/Legendary brought us an American Godzilla that was closer to the original, it was what we wanted growing up, an updated Godzilla with today's technology. Yes, it was still a bit campy, but the monsters looked GREAT! We didn't care about the human element, we never have.

That's what makes Toho's Godzilla Minus One special, they've managed to make an AMAZING Godzilla movie where we actually care about the humans. We're rooting for them all and don't want them to get killed by Godzilla. This movie will get you emotional. I'm not crying, you are. The visuals, the sounds, and if you watch it in 4D, oof, even better. I've watched it twice already, and can't wait for it to be released digitally. Might even buy the DVD/BluRay whenever its released."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic! The feel and vibe of the movie reminded me of my childhood. While growing up watching Godzilla movies.  10 out of 10, highly recommend!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must watch in 4-D!
Feels like Godzilla the ride!!! Worth it."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"An emotional tale of grief, loss, grit, love and resolve set in post WW2 Japan. Oh yeah it also has Godzilla in it. This movie rules."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"the human characters are actually engaging for once, and Godzilla himself is incredible"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the Godzilla movie many have been waiting and wishing for! It forsakes the Hollywood depiction of a ""saviour"" and goes all-in on its' traditional Japanese roots of Godzilla as an unstoppable force of nature. Given the budget (~USD$15mil) it is certainly amazing what the production company managed to pull off with both visual and practical effects. Godzilla looks a little janky at times - but it is by no means terrible. 
And the heat(/atomic) breath! This movie nailed it!
If you're happy with reading subtitles or can speak Japanese, then I can't recommend this movie enough. 
I only hope modern Hollywood takes a page out of this book on how to write a compelling story with interesting characters."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up with godzilla, my dad putting the movie monster on our tv for family movie nights are memories I'll cherish. My appreciation for the monster only grew as a learned more about the backstory and why the original film was made. I was so excited to see this film and brought a group with me some who have never seen a Godzilla movie before and some who grew up with the monster like myself. As I watched I looked at my friends faces they were all the same, shocked and on the edge of the seats as they watched. Hands over their mouths as godzilla charges his atomic breath. This movie is for everyone, and a big win for fans who have been here from the start. The film creates new fans and is a masterpiece to us G-fans. Absolutely incredible 10/10!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,this is a great reboot of the original godzilla.  would recommend to any who like monster movies.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The entire movie was  an homage to the original  Godzilla with a fantastic update
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"How often do you watch a movie and it becomes an instant classic? I've been a fan of Godzilla for most my life, introduced to the series by my dad, Godzilla has always been a series filled with Campe, fun monster fights and terrible human plots. In a way that was the Godzilla experience, an uncut gem that was special but never succeeded at holding a narrative, even the best movies in the series never rising above mediocre in story telling.

But Godzilla Minus One, it is the culmination of the entire Godzilla franchise, as if we had only been experiencing the prototypes of the truly worthy creation since 1954. Godzilla Minus One is THE Godzilla Movie, accept no American substitutions, Takashi Yamazaki has bridged the gap that Godzilla has been lacking for so long, a delivered a truly wonderful story to go along with worlds favorite giant monster!

I could not stress enough just how moving of a narrative it is and how unexpected and delighted I was watching it. Of the nearly 20 Godzilla movies I've watched, Godzilla Minus One is the only one that made me cry. I realized in the theater that I wasn't just having a good time, I wasn't just getting a thrill but I was truly moved by a Godzilla movie. That I wasn't putting up with the human plot to get to Godzilla for once.

If you haven't yet, go watch this movie. I haven't touched on the cinematography, or the acting, or music... Etc. But it is easily some of the best in the franchise, the sound design in particular is truly to be commended.

 Takashi Yamazaki is writer and director, to a truly legendary film in Godzilla Minus One. I am incredibly thankful to him and the many other that came together to make this movie, my favorite Godzilla Movie and a truly great film!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Emotional, action packed, exactly what I anticipate from a great Godzilla flick.  If you're a fan of Japanese kaiju films, this one is a definite must see."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The first Godzilla movie where Godzilla is secondary to the human story. Best film I have scene this year.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. SO refreshing. Great story, great writing, great character development and Godzilla was  fantastic in this movie. Will  be watching it again."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun monster times. Nice parallel, non-monster story."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome destruction. Meanest Godzilla ever. 🔥🔥🔥. Japanese Heroes. Bravo Toho.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's truly incredible what was accomplished with this movie. I cannot possibly give it higher praise. Taking into account the budget it's even more amazing, but even setting that aside it's a monumental achievement in storytelling."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is easily the best movie I've seen this year and the best movie that I have seen - bar Top Gun Maverick - in a very long time. I don't have the words to convey how good this movie is, or just how it embarrasses Hollywood and what they put out, but this is easily the best movie that I have seen in a very long while.

I can't believe I'm saying this but this movie has a very real possibility of getting nominated for an Oscar."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best movie I've seen in 2023.  Some of the best CGI I've seen yet, truly showing just how BIG and destructive Godzilla is.  Always trust the Japanese to get the original kaiju Godzilla correct."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing score. Amazing acting. Amazing cinematography. Just overall amazing.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best monster movie. Good human story around it. See what they can do with low budget can still produce great movie
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the story and how it fixed some of the holes in the original Godzilla. Loved Kiochi coming to terms with himself and Tachibana's forgiveness. The special effects were spectacular. Would gladly see at least 12 more times.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED THIS MOVIE EVERYTHING WAS GREAG EVEN THE HUMANS AND GODZILLA WAS NOT WASTED AT ALL JUST GO WATCH THE MOVIE FOR THE CLIFFHANGER
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely awesome - great story,  may be the greatest Godzilla move of them all!  So compelling that I didn't even finish my popcorn."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is absolutely incredible. This movie will make you relate to the characters. It will put on the edge the seat from beginning to end. It’s a must see.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,First kaiju movie that I genuinely loved and not just liked a lot.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"awesome movie, i really liked how toho stepped up their game and made G -1.0, i hope they make  the sequal!."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't get much better than this!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good godzilla movie!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Maybe the best Godzilla movie of all time! See it!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been a Godzilla fan since watching the movies in the 80s. This was not only the best in the series but a new addition to my ""favorite movies"" list. Chef's kiss 🤌🏾"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Better movie than the ones Hollywood and Disney are making lately. This one has a heart/soul. Worth watching!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the coolest looking Godzillas. Not only that but the human story lines didnt feel like they were weighing the movie down.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie in years WOW
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I would definitely rewatch this film over and over again.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is back, baby! I've been a fan of Godzilla since I was a kid in the early 2000s, and I can say that we haven't gotten an exceptional new film since I've been alive. Looks like that's over now, though! The story of our boy Shikishima the failed Kamikaze pilot has to be the best human arc in a Godzilla movie yet. Normally fans complain about the human stories being an annoyance, but this time it nearly steals the show. This is helped by the interesting setting of a battered Japan immediately following their defeat in WWII. The G-Man himself does not disappoint either. I especially loved how they made his breath attack feel so powerful. Walked out of the theater with a big goofy grin on my face and come to find everyone else enjoyed it too. Hope this kindles new interest in the IP. Exceptional!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made !
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Thank you for this masterpiece. I love Godzilla but this movie was on a whole other level. It's always the governments fighting back which is realistic. But I always feel so disconnected from the people. But Minus One I was so engrossed into the lives of these people. First time a Godzilla film made me cry but it was so beautifully crafted. Thank you. Thank you.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went to see this last Friday and all I can say is thus movie was absolutely stunning. For a 15 million dollar budget they did an amazing job with the effects.

The star of the show was the human characters though and the well thought story. They did an amazing job telling a story about the horrors of war and showing the struggles of PTSD. 

Really couldn't recommend this film enough"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It was as a great story and the cgi was well done.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Big G movies I’ve seen in I don’t know how long!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie.  When I was a kid, 40+ years ago, in the summer, they'd have a matinee series of which Godzilla was always one of the movies and that movie was the one I'd never miss.  This brought back all those nostalgic memories.   The Godzilla face, the music, etc...  I seldom  clap at the end of movies, but this one, my 14 year old son and I, yes."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie all around.  So refreshing after seeing so many duds this year.  Dragged my wife to this movie and she ended up loving it as well.  This is really a movie you need to see in the theater.  I don't think it will hold up well streaming at home.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you’re a fan of Godzilla or just fun movies, this one’s a great choice."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn’t realize that Godzilla was a metaphor for WW2 America this whole time.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Glad I watched it in theaters.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I went into this knowing almost nothing about it and was pleasantly surprised. Godzilla was awesome but the story here is great. Didn't know I was going to see a serious film. This movie deserves its praise and then some.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzilla movie ever. old school godzilla. even with subtitles was easy to watch. whole family enjoyed it.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I’ve seen it in color five times now, and this was my first time seeing it without color. Honestly, it is a significant improvement that made it feel like a completely different film. Subtle details became more apparent without color that added more depth and realism to the film as a whole, and I came out feeling far more immersed than I did seeing color in 4DX."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS is the best Godzilla movie ever made. Easily one of the best films of the year as well. The acting, the cinematography, the effects, the EMOTION. Such an incredible film. Cannot recommend this film enough!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well written, fantastic visual effects I also loved the fact the original theme motif for Godzilla was introduced. My son loved it and I will probably watch it a second time."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie with interesting and well-motivated characters.  Understandable human story with a strong emotional arc.  Includes a couple real surprising ""gotcha"" moments, which I've not experienced in movies for a long time. Excellent writing.  First movie I'll probably see more than once in the theatre.  Strong recommend!  Go see this movie and support great storytelling."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Raw emotions, insane VFX for the budget, and an incredible story. I have not been this invested in movie characters since Top Gun Maverick last year. Will go see it again and highly recommend."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie.   Went to go see it with my family, and actually went in thinking it wouldn't be as enjoyable as English released movies, but it was still well worth it.   Having to read through the subtitles didn't take away from the experience.   It had a well thought out and deep story-line and was very inspiring.   Very worth-while even if you are not used to watchin foreign films."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing. Usually a fan of just the monster fighting like in the monster verse Godzilla’s but the story in this was amazing. Loved it! Can’t wait to see the second if they make it.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so stinking good. WOW.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding! Delivers as the giant city crunching Godzilla I've come to love.  Wrapped up beautifully with characters who's struggles don't take away but add to the climatic final confrontation. Brought back the true magic that exist in watching a movie of this caliber on the big screen.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"At the start, it was kinda slow, but, the rest of the movie it was Awesome the human drama was good, the special effects goated, and of course Godzilla himself being iconic and terrifying best movie of Godzilla franchise and best movie of 2023"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just the best monster movie ever, probably one of the top movies ever period. I felt every emotion to its full measure. I'm still buzzing hours after watching!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This is how a Godzilla movie should be made!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is definitely my new favorite Godzilla movie, I especially enjoyed the use of the original Godzilla movie’s soundtrack."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best modern day version of a Godzilla movie in a long time. Storylines was great!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've never been a huge Godzilla fan, wow this movie blew me away. Godzilla is actually scary and inspires dread and the human plot is touching and sad, but also gratifying. There's some good commentary on WW2 Japanese era and their treatment of their soldiers and citizens. The backdrop is a recovering Japan getting basically nuked again by Godzilla and coming together to fight back.

Simple, and very effective. Godzilla also looked great- admittedly at the expense of some other effects in the movie but I'm very okay with the budget being focused on Godzilla and the atomic breath which HITS- every time. Definitely give it a watch wether you like Godzilla movies or not I guarantee most people will be hooked by it."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Really a must see if you’re a die hard Godzilla fan it has amazing action Godzilla is a menace and it’s a full movie that doesn’t have any English dialogue in it (but it does have subtitles) 10/10 a must watch
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,All Time Classic. For 70 years the original has stood as the gold standard. That torch has now been passed. This is a love letter to the original while also being it's own thing. Anyone who has seen the original will catch a lot of key callbacks. This has nothing but respect for it. The human characters are the best in any Kaiju film ever. This feels like Speilberg could have directed this. No character is a throwaway or just blends in. Godzilla is terrifying in this. The CGI is solid also in this. This fixes the only real issue of the original which was it was almost too unrefined and raw for it's own good. See it.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I’ve never experienced a monster movie that has such impactful characters as with this one. Of course, seeing an epic and destructive Godzilla was what I was there for… but I didn’t expect to love the human characters as much as I did. There was so much emotion and depth to the characters that you don’t normally get with a monster movie. In the end, I was rooting for the humans against Godzilla. That is a win."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Classic Godzilla  is back on the big screen. Action was on point. The human emotion  shown is just not touched by American  movies. Moving and tear jerkier
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,A classic. Good story telling with strong replay value.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The atomic bomb memories. Pure sadness and horror. Great direction and production. Simply one of the scariest Godzilla movies💣💥
"Dec 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Maybe I've grown used to immersive games with good plots (like the Fallout series) but I could only give this 3.5 stars. I might be spoiled on movies because of immersive games?

The plot was one of disgrace and redemption, with a touch of exploration of PTSD, so that was nice. The special effects were quite good,

But to me, the ending was predictable. ""....and everything worked out in the end."" You know, that sort of thing.

On the whole it kept my interest, and I won't say the movie was bad, but for all the 5 star, gushing reviews, I guess I expected more.

I will say, keeping the movie in Japanese and subtitling it actually added to the experience. It felt far more authentic that way."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,A absolute masterpiece!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not something I would have seen in the theatres in all likelihood however the reviews for a Japanese language Godzilla film got me curious. This was a fantastic film and not just 'for a Godzilla movie', but period. I highly recommend just about anyone see this, and in a theatre too. One of the best if not the best of 2023 for me."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,A Godzilla movie that would be a great movie even if we cut Godzilla out of the movie. But Godzilla still kicks ass when show up.
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, especially considering it's in Japanese and I had to read subtitles - not that I really mind having to read subtitles, but those movies don't tend to make my top-movies-of-the-year list, if you know what I mean. And really, if it wasn't for my 12 year old nephew wanting to see it, I probably would have missed it. But glad I didn't!

I've no doubt that some will complain about the movie being too long, or not having enough Godzilla action, but what really made this one shine for me personally was the time spent on telling a good story and character development. I really felt like the characters were the main focus here, and Godzilla was a secondary focus, serving as a way to tell a story about honor and shame and redemption and so much more. A great cast, a way better than usual script for a Godzilla movie, beautiful cinematography, and good special effects, all helped make it work. And when we do get to see Godzilla wreaking carnage,  it has even more impact because of the deep emotional impact we can see he has had on the lives of the characters.

Small personal quibbles: Not quite sure why Godzilla had to be even fatter than what I used to refer to as the ""American Godzilla"" from the 1998 film with Matthew Broderick, and I wish he had ate more people, instead of just biting them in half - but then he might have been even fatter, LoL."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. Hollywood needs to take lessons from the Japanese on how to make a movie. This was tense, raw, and immersive."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,My first Godzilla movie and it was a master piece ❤️
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie. Took me back to my childhood because of the type of Godzilla he was, great story as well.. Definitely worth full price admission"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best film of 2023, absolutely blew my mind how they could create such a gripping drama, emotionally and physically striking on such a low budget. True cinematic masterpiece."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie lives up to the word of mouth hype.  Never thought I'd ever shed a tear during a Godzilla movie.  So good and its got giant kiaju!
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing Cinematography, Visual effects, Emotion, story, score. Everything!"
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever. Full stop. Yes, I've seen all of them, most multiple times."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Minus One was the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen in theaters. I liked the characters, the story, and Godzillas design. I will give it five stars"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm very impressed with this Japanese made film. A very good dramatic story taking place along with the king of the monsters attacking. This was more intense and showed people getting killed. Special effects is well done. My only complaint is that from waist down he is noticeably bigger. Godzilla has phat ass. The acting is a little over the top but doesn't hurt the film. Definitely recommend to Godzilla and monster fans.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Prepare to be blown away by this incredible film. I, too, was skeptical when I first booked tickets for Godzilla ""Minus One."" The title alone seemed like a turn off. And as someone who isn't a fan of excessive special effects, I was hesitant to tell my husband about the movie in fear that he may also be put off by it.

But let me tell you, this movie surpassed all of my expectations. Despite its title, which may sound unappealing at first glance, the reviews raved about its brilliance. So with an open mind and high hopes, my husband and I sat down to watch.

And boy, were we blown away. The story of Japan's devastation during World War II and the terrifying presence of Godzilla had us on the edge of our seats. But what truly captivated us was the underlying love story and the courageous kamikaze pilot who fears death.

This is not your typical monster movie filled with over-the-top special effects. Instead, it tastefully combines elements of 1940s nostalgia with 21st century technology to create a truly unique experience. The attention to detail and commitment to staying true to the era is commendable and adds an extra layer of realism to the film.

I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's not just a film you watch and forget about; it's one that stays with you long after the credits roll. So don't miss out on this beautiful masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Hurry and grab your tickets now before they're sold out!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"(BIG SPOILERS) Honestly, I wasn't sure if this movie would be good when i heard it had no dubbing. That opinion changed. New favorite movie, and barely had to focus on the words because the actors/actresses did an amazing. And also godzillasaurus (I think) at the beginning was amazing. And the G-mans new atomic breath is so cool with the explosion. And the C.G.I. is freaking amazing. Also the human characters. Usually in the godzilla movies I've watched well uhhh the humans just weren't entertaining but this movie… that kamikaze plot wad very interesting. And godzilla is not like a usual godzilla… those punches were insanely fast! And the W.W.2 plot was insane. Also that remix of the godzilla theme was so good. Human actors 10/10 
Godzilla 11/10
soundtrack 9/10 
plot 11/10
Overall 98.5/100 
my favorite movie. Ever

(Beat previous favorite movie (Jurassic Park) by a long shot)"

"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was well put together.  With the story of loss a more. Great action as well. Godzilla looked amazing! Re-watch worthy!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The Meanest Godzilla Ever!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've never had such a strong, emotional reaction to a monster movie before. The human story and message were very powerful and Godzilla himself was legitimately frightening to behold."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Effects and sound were fantastic!  Characters were well-rounded and I found myself actually caring about their journey.  The plot dragged in some places, but the action scenes really made up for it.  Great movie overall!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been a huge Godzilla fan since my childhood, and imo, this is the greatest Godzilla film ever made."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,1st Godzilla movie that made me care about the human storyline!  It was all I could do to keep from crying and the classic music took me right to my childhood.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film!!!! Loved the human story! Godzilla is a menace!! Best Godzilla film I’ve ever seen.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best movie of 2023. It was the first Godzilla movie that brought tears to both me and my wife's eyes. LOVED IT!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A true Godzilla masterpiece from the original
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was so good that it actually made me shed a tear
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked it. Thought the old school models and lack of crazy CGI to be a welcome change. Absolutely worth seeing for any Godzilla fan or even a former fan.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! Best movie of the year, possibly."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fabulous. Great story, great character development and phenomenal effects.  It's 2 hours but doesn't feel like 2 hours.  The creators of this movie delivered in every way shape and form."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great Godzilla movie. It is how they should be made. Great story. Fantastically done.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was absolutely great! Great characters and, of course, Godzilla! I didn't give it 5 stars because reading the subtitles took away some of the viewing experience but I'd prefer them to dubbing. It took my two teen boys also and they also thought, ""that was really good!"""
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A really good story. My son and I agreed that the movie being in Japanese with subtitles was a great experience.  This movie was a A+
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"A film that made use of excellent camera angles and shots to give a great feel of the scenes. Music was well used to capture the tone that each scene was giving to the audience. Godzilla truly came off as a terrifying creature that the human protagonists had to find a way to overcome. Most importantly, the human characters had struggles and arcs that I was invested in to seeing through and even got emotional, being moved to tears as events transpired. I recommend this film not because it is a film with Godzilla, but a truly excellent film that overall is an incredible package all the way through."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a triumph beyond belief, absolutely loved literally everything about this movie. See it in IMAX!!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in thinking this was just another Godzilla movie without seeing any trailer or hearing any reviews and wow! It blew me away. I laughed, I cried. It was far more than just a big monster of destruction film. my hat is off to everyone who worked on this masterpiece."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen , and I've seen all of them 100s of times . It was the best movie I have ever seen period !"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Halfway through, I whispered to my friend, “This is the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen. By the end, we were both exclaiming that “Godzilla Minus One” is one of the best movies we seen. Period. A real art piece. Had me in legit tears. Even when you could seen the narrative beats coming a mile away, the tropes were so well executed that the payoffs still ended up being worth the journey. Bravo to the Japanese studio for showing the world how monster movies should be done. Wow."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies yet! So nice having characters to care about  & a plot that kept you on the edge of your seat.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla Movie I Have Ever Seen.  PERFECT!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing experience watching this movie! Definitely exceeded my expectations.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a single moment in that movie are you bored or waiting or anything. Everything from the acting, the action, the cinematography was on point. This movie really set the bar high!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie.  I have seen every Godzilla film from the original 1954 Godzilla to Godzilla V Kong.  This was the best one I have seen to date, HANDS DOWN!!!  The story is amazing and you attach yourself to the characters.  You feel what they feel, you see what they see and you experience what they experience.  The special effects are on par, if not better then any of the Hollywood versions. Godzilla is the best I have EVER seen of him.  Great job, TOHO!!!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,probably movie of the year.  Its not perfect but entertaining.  Good side story of the character you care a little about.  Amazing they did this on a 15 million budget.  There was homage to the old ways of Godzilla.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I went in with HIGH expectations after seeing all the reviews. They were met.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"🚨Godzilla Minus One should sweep the Oscars and win the Academy Award for Best Picture 🚨 

Yes, this is a foreign (Japanese) film with English subtitles but,
Godzilla Minus One is a stunning masterpiece that will leave you breathless if you give it a chance! This gripping and heartfelt film takes us back to the aftermath of World War II, where the legendary monster wreaks havoc on a war-torn Japan.

The film's exquisite cinematography captures the raw emotions of the characters and the sheer terror of Godzilla's presence. The special effects are top-notch, making the monster's appearance all the more terrifying and awe-inspiring.

One of the most striking aspects of the film is its exploration of the human condition in the face of overwhelming adversity. The characters are complex and relatable, and their struggles will resonate with audiences long after the credits roll.

In short, Godzilla Minus One is a must-see film that is a masterclass in stunning visuals, powerful storytelling, and an unforgettable monster to create a truly unforgettable cinematic experience."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Possibly the best Godzilla movie ever. Great story with interesting and likable characters.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story with stunning visual effects. You don't even notice the subtitles after the first few memories. This is a movie you have to see in theaters to fully appreciate.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow been watching Godzilla since i was a kid in the 1970's on basic television back in the day, i have all the G dude's  dvd's from japan and this is the best one yet that makes you think and feel everyones pain  , it is great human story that makes you want to buy another ticket and watch it again"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie since the original 1954 version. Finally, a monster movie where the human characters are interesting and not used for exposition. The movie shows that you do not need a big budget to make a great film"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie Iv seen in recent years. This movie was just amazing plan and simple. The story is well written and Godzilla is chilling to watch in the best way. The pacing is great, and charcuterie development, I actually cared about the characters."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding film with spectacular special effects and a touching story line.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"A harrowing, poignant & emotional triumph for this colossal titan gracing cinema for 70 years."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and well done!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla excellent movie !!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done, Godzilla was definitely scarier than past incarnations. Definitely got my money’s worth."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite film of the year!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a breath of fresh air. I love how it remained true to the originals and provided a message for humanity. One huge message was how war not only affects veterans, but also civilians was extremely powerful. I could go on and on about the rollercoaster of emotions but I might reveal spoilers.

Disney, take note! This is how to make a movie!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen every single Godzilla film multiple, multiple times, and having seen Minus One in the theater twice, all I can say is wow. This film is perfection. The acting is immaculate, the special effects sequences are stunning (that Takao battle!!!), and the emotions are so real. Ranks with the original Gojira as the finest of the franchise."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I’m lost for words, amazing"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The most powerful, most intimate Godzilla movie ever.  Others are popcorn, this was true drama.  Not for the feint of heart - one family had to leave after the first scene."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This film has a great story with great effects for a tiny budget. Well done. There was at least one poorly edited scene at the tail end of the film and a very unnecessary underwater scene which undermines the hero's journey and leaves the story open for continuation. The film would have worked better as a one-off film with an completely resolved ending.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a really good movie and the best use of large scale action I've seen in a long time - way better than Marvel, other Godzilla movies, better than apocalypse movies. Godzilla is 200 feet tall but frightening & devestating on a human level and tightly bound to the inner struggles of the characters.  There were times I said ""Oh my God"" to the devestation or was really moved by the courage, struggle or triumph of the characters.

The writing & direction is the difference.  In many movies of this scale you see CGI robots, monsters or indestructible super heroes knocking over CGI skyscrapers from miles away.  In this movie the writers put a 200' monster down at the level of people and there's geniune suspense & dread in the action.  The shots of huge events like Godzilla's nuclear breath make you feel like you're inside it instead of 3 miles away. 


We really enjoyed this movie. Hopefully Marvel & other studios take note and start producing gripping, involving action movies that leverage CGI instead of what feels like a series of boring demo reels from computer animation studious."
"Dec 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slow at times, but this movie gives you the old age Godzilla vibes"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"An interesting take on Godzilla Minus One -- it works better in some scenes and more poorly in others. Still, it's an interesting experience."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great version of a Godzilla movie!  Evan with subtitles I was hooked.  I could ramble on a variety of thoughts but better off to say go see it and form your own opinion.  Cheers!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve seen all year.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of 2023!!!!  Must see in theater and in Imax!!!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Thoughtful and engaging story with Godzilla!!! A lot of homage paid to the old movies.  The effects weren't overdone and blended into the movie perfectly.  Best movie I saw in the theater this year!!!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic. I wish Hollywood would lean from the success of great movies with great stories.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is film is a must see movie that covers multiple genres from drama to historical to psychological to sci-fi to war, and that's without Godzilla. Enter Godzilla and this becomes the greatest Godzilla movie of all time. 

Go see this movie."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the most beautiful cinematographic masterpieces I've ever seen. Far beyond just a Kaiju movie but it delivers true to the original Godzilla formula on every front while being interesting, fresh, and beautiful as a film."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was one of the best things I've seen this year. I wasn't expecting it to have such a compelling storyline that many other Godzilla movies fail to have. I was invested the whole way through and the CGI looks great! Knowing that this was made on only $15 Million makes it all the more impressive.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie since 1954, which is a very hard thing for me to say since I do love a lot of Godzilla movies. Absolutely amazing, which I think makes this... Godzilla Plus One!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing movie. great acting and directing. best movie of the year. you genuinley care and feel for the human characters. Godzilla does what Godzilla does best look like a beast every sec he's on screen.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"See this movie. Tied with the original Godzilla and Shin Godzilla movies for best movie in franchise. American versions are all grade ""C"" at best, this is grade ""A"". Great story, great acting. great cinematography, great special effects. As one critic said ""it is the first Godzilla movie that made me cry and scared."" You care for the characters, you get invested in the movie. See it."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I rarely want to go and watch a movie with subtitles, but our 23yr old son already saw the movie and said the movie was great. We saw it last night and our son came with my wife and I. The movie was a 10. We loved Gozilla and sure pleasantly surprised that the plot was not cheese like other monsters movies. The movie will hook you into the actor and some surprises at the end. Go See it you will not be disappointed. If you love Godzilla movies you will love this one."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"10/10 everything from the human character, special effects and plot was written beautifully. This is a movie made for godzilla fans. If you find reading too hard don't come watch it, it has subtitles."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie that was definently surprising, something that all godzilla fans should see, a great reboot, and pretty good CGI for japanese movies"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of action from Godzilla
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding achievement!  As many people have been stating, movie has amazing characters and story.  Without great story, movies fail and no amount CGI can save a film.  I am glad that this movie is being recognized for having a wonderful story."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A Movie masterpiece! Highly reccomend!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked how Godzilla was Thicc
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla looked like one can expect from a seamonster, the acting and story were great. Excited for the next chapter"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla and No Hard Feelings were the only movies I enjoyed this year.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie😎😎😎
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great.  The third act had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for the main characters.  It is true what the reviews have been saying about the movie doing a good job of balancing monster mayhem and character development/story.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It's better than some of the $200 MM+ Hollywood epics that have been released. Great visuals and a good storyline. I appreciated the subtitling instead of dubbing.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movies need to be exported now lol don’t sleep on this one. Lots of heart, action, and monster rampage!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautiful story entwined with the complete and utter devastation of a kaiju attack while having the ending of WW2 be the backdrop looming in the shadows. This one felt like the Godzilla films of yesteryear and imo is an absolute must watch for fans of the King.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the heart of Godzilla story. For the budget and what they presented oh my God I was lost in the movie I believe Godzilla was real lot of fun great movie for everyone. This movie should get lots of awards I really did enjoy this film. This is a fun movie for everyone.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"What genius to set the film in the period immediately after World War II.  The themes of survival, perseverance, haunting guilt and redemption were incredibly powerful, all enhanced by seeing it in  Japanese (i.e., undubbed)."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Not only is it a great Godzilla movie; it is also a great movie. Long time Godzilla fans will love it.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,emotionally appealing and great action.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It was one of the best godzilla movies I havr ever seen i am also a really big fan of godzilla it this movie was AWSOME
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It's anything but just another monster movie. GMO had a great story; it was pretty touching and had loveable characters. The only negative is that it was a little slow while they developed a strategy to fight Godzilla if/when he returned.   This movie is a must-see!!!
"Dec 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,very long and boring story---more monster
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,An exhilarating monster movie that has a great human story to match.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action along with a great story line. I love it!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have never been a Godzilla fan, but this movie has turned me into one!  Amazing storytelling on a shoestring budget!  Hollywood needs to take notes."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally believe this is the best Godzilla film ever made. The characters were so real, and believable. This was the first Kaiju movie that has ever made me care for the human characters. It also is an excellent portrayal of post-war Japan, and the tole on it's people."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a lifelong fan of kaiju cinema, I can honestly say this is the best film in the franchise. Amazing characters that you actually care about, amazing pacing, backdrop... and of course, GODZILLA. Such a threatening presence... he's actually scary in this one. Absolutely worth the price of admission"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente película, toma partes de las películas clásicas de Godzilla y nos muestra a Godzilla villano que destruye a la humanidad. Ya hacía falta ver a Godzilla en el roll de malo otra vez. Cinco estrellas, recomendando."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"No words! The best Godzilla movie ever! If you are a Godzilla fan, you must watch this. This has everything!!!!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,All around……Fantastic! 10/10.
"Dec 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie was alright  unfortunately the movie had subtitles which was very irritating but overall 7/10.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is really incredible movie .
It was like a very awesome and amazing movie 
, It is a sirius movie ,no jokes and no funny moment , this movie like  very tenson full movie, i really suggest to watch this movie 🍿🎥"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Haven't seen the original but really enjoyed this movie. Only gripe was Godzillas walk cycle being so slow and robotic like. Despite that, very serious and enjoyable."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only the best movie I've seen in years, but also the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. Movies are not dead. Hollywood is dead. Hollywood movies have Budgets pushing ever closer to half a billion dollars on a regular basis and have absolutely no meaningful story to tell. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with that. Japan constantly proves to be the modern ruler in meaningful story telling. Maybe one day Hollywood will start taking notes."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, awesome directing, recreation of 1940s tokyo, costumes, acting, and character development. Hollywood needs to learn from this film and find their way back to good character development and story telling. 5 stars"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome best Godzilla movie 5 stars
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story was compelling, all of the characters had a role to play and i cared for all of them, Godzilla was a complete force of nature that was devastating. This is a classic already, a must watch for fans of Kaiju and those who want a heart wrenching story. See it in theaters if you can, the power of the destruction is insane on the silver screen."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Granted, you pretty much have to be a Godzilla fan to go to a Godzilla movie, but this was a great onereally less about the G-man, more about postwar Japan and the Japanese psyche. A little corny in places, but would definitely see again."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely top notch. Godzilla is horrifying.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is visually beautiful - one might even call it spectacular in the way it portrays post-war Japan (and related naval machinery) in its decay and rebirth of Tokyo. This is not your 1960's campy Saturday afternoon matinee portrayal of Godzilla movie but instead a dark and though-provoking spin on this age old story.  The use of Akira Ifukube's classic Godzilla soundtrack in places is a nice touch too. And consider staying through the final credits for an auditory omen.  :-)
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I would’ve loved the film without Godzilla!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Just finished Godzilla Minus One. Did not expect to get emotional during a Kaiju film yet this is cinematically probably one of the best films ive ever seen. 12/10 highly recommend to everyone.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The best godzilla movie ever. I will go back and see it again.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I have seen in years!!! Best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. Amazing monster. Epic story. 
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie. well written, acted and Godzilla was rightfully OP!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie now non spoiler but it’s not about Godzilla now he does come out but more about a soldier also being tissues. And be prepare to cry
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla may not quite match the eye candy and spectacle of other recent Godzillas. But what it does have is a story actually worth watching.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Classic Godzilla meets modern day effects without all the overused Hollywood formulas. Truly fresh and compelling. Direction, cinematography, casting, dialogue ... all just spot on."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It was absolutely amazing. From beginning to end. Heartfelt and full of action. My family and I enjoyed it. Especially the soundtrack!! GODZILLA!!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Light years ahead of many Godzilla movies/series especially Monarch. The human story is serious (not silly) and grounded. You actually care about the characters. US productions take note and learn what compelling writing looks and sounds like.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has Godzilla soundtrack, Godzilla destruction and Godzilla himself"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great story with a lot of great special effects.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Watch it in the theaters before you miss out! A must watch.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla - King of the Monsters...King of the Cinema! Truly epic in all the right ways. Believe the hype. This is a brilliant masterpiece of monstrous proportions. This one will be talked about for years. Long live the King.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I have seen. This was definitely the movie of the year. It balances fighting to heart felt emotions perfectly. This movie was a 10/10. This puts all the American Godzilla films to shame. Explosions were better then Openheimer. I can't express enough how well this movie did. Please watch in theaters and support this film as it definitely sets a new standard.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute emotional rollercoaster. It hits you with so many emotional and realistic human moments while showcasing the power of Godzilla amidst the chaos. Went twice because it was so emotionally gripping and because this Godzilla seems to me to be way different than any Godzilla that has stepped on the Silver screen. Bravo! Absolutely amazing👏🏻 💯 will buy the movie when it comes out on BluRay.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla was actually a scary monster in this movie
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is phenomenal, I would have never believed a Godzilla movie is capable of establishing this level of dramatic tension."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie from beginning to end. Final inesperado la volvería a ver
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of the year!! Nothing else comes close!
Fun, exciting, 2 hours of pure entertainment!!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,fantastic movie. I hope that it will get a sequel.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"undoubtedly, the best Godzilla movie ever. they absolutely killed it in this Godzilla movie."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was nostalgic and had a great story line. Excellent movie.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing the story was so well built had me on the edge of my seat. Real tear jerker at times.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,15 million dollar budget. I can't believe that it's was so good. Every time you saw Godzilla on screen you felt dread. Godzilla looks so creepy. I actually care about the human characters when I watch a monster verse Godzilla movie I like them but I don't care for the human stories but I actually cried for them. Good action watch the movie now
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It's the first monster movie I've seen where the human story behind it was the best part.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought I was cold in the theater, but I was just shivering in anticipation and dread. The reviews were spot on, and the audience applauded at the end."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Who knew, a compelling story, well-acted could be this good?  Go for the giant rubber lizard.  Stay for the cool retro story!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER. Looking at their budget to make this movie is really impressive The CGI was really good and pretty much everything about the movie is good. Really good work.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best Godzilla movies. Overall, this is a great movie. The acting was great, the story was great, and Godzilla was great. The King of the Monsters had my undivided attention. My favorite movie for 2023!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was truly impressed with this film! Thanks to careful pacing, thoughtful writing, and brilliant acting, characters feel like real people with genuine emotions rather than archetypes cast to fill a role. Godzilla's face needed some extra care; his eyes were always wide open and his mouth had a permanent smile, which was distracting at times. However, that's honestly the only critique I have for this otherwise refreshing film."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a bit of a military/naval history nerd, and this movie was better than I could have ever hoped. The ships that appear in the movie are accurate for the types of ship they are, all of the warships are ships that actually survived the war, and the named former captain is of one of the warships famed for surviving numerous engagements with little-to-no damage or casualties - which is thematically appropriate to the end of the movie.

Besides all that, it is emotionally powerful and visually spectacular, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie by far an emotional roller coaster, and post WW2 setting that allows you to connect with the cast"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,best. film. to. ever. exist.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie too date.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! This one, unlike others focuses on a character, with Godzilla as the antagonist."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie ever!!
I laughed, I cried, I feared for everyone on that screen. Godzilla was a force to be reckoned with! Absolute must see!!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was such a big surprise.  I've never felt so connected to characters in a Godzilla movie before.  The movie took it time and did a great job building up the main character's arc and I truly felt invested in all the characters in the movie.  Their version of Gozilla brings back memories of the Gozilla I watched as a kid.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well written storyline and easy to follow along.
No bad characters, you feel so connected with them.
No build up nor dragging the first appearance of Godzilla.
Amazing music.
Low budget of $15M so some CGI is a bit cheap but overall is still looks beautifully done."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Crazy Godzilla movie! Godzilla was bodying everything!! I enjoyed this movie a lot, will he back for a second movie?!? Hmm"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A truly anticipated movie of the year Director. Yamazaki brought the fear of the root of a franchise and a new reign of terror.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. Great story, likeable intriguing characters, great Godzilla action with superb special effects."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film this is a must watch
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The tears this movie made me shed was unreal. The pure raw emotion in the acting alone can eclipse the countless amount of movies that have come out this year. There are not enough words alone to describe this masterpiece. If there is any takeaway, anything at all to say there is one reason why Godzilla is considered royalty in cinema, the proof is in this movie."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The human drama is amplified amidst Godzilla's ominous might.  A must-see!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The film was great. A more realistic and grounded godzilla. Real tear jerker at the end. My nephew cried so hard at the end when he saw noriko.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing movie with a great mix of emotion and history along with good fiction storytelling.  Best movie in 2023, in multiple aspects."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow what a great movie! Definitely recommend.

"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,As a long time Godzilla fan I absolutely enjoyed this over the others. A must watch!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Might be the best Godzilla movie ever, maybe even better than the first one. The human story of Godzilla has always been a constant struggle in Godzilla movies over the years, but Minus One absolutely delivers.
If you're one to not watch subtitled movies, please make an exception for this movie."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great classic touch amazing story and action theme
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla Movie ever!!! The big G didn’t have to be in it for it to be amazing. The actors really made this movie great. Godzilla is so much more than a monster but an icon that can represent nearly anything that shows both the worst and best of humanity
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Godzilla. A must see.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,very good graphics.  and good acting too.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Cinema. The best movie I've ever seen.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"No wokey, jokey, hokey. No girl power, just raw war movie. Great Godzilla movie and you will cry for Godzilla and the people."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I cried at the end. Great human story and then add the king of monsters.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie. Well paced, cared about every character. Godzilla is a menace and a sight to behold in this. Incredible sound design and sense of scale. Truly a work of art, especially on a small budget of $15 million USD. Highly reccomend."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and good actors.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect.. just.. perfect.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not a monster movie but a human one. The visual and audio effects were amazing, but the cast performance is what makes this movie feel so real. The subtitles are well done and easy to follow without missing anything. Most lines were only 2-6 words.. Go see this film in theatre before its too late! I saw it in IMAX and it was worth it!"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome homage to the Godzilla of old.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This is what a Godzilla movie should be.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Throughly enjoyed it, reminiscent of 1954 original."

"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR.  DON'T MISS IT.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I love anything Godzilla. It was good!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This was great film filled with the old Godzilla movies I grew up watching.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie definitely deserves its #1 spot at the box office. One of, if not the BEST Godzilla movie ever."
"Dec 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This one is more of a human story than lizard story. But you get to see a lot of Godzilla, who lives forever."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been watching Godzilla and Kaiju movies for over 5 decades. Best description I've heard for the the film as follows; ""Godzilla Minus One is not a great Godzilla film. It's a great film that has Godzilla in it."" 
It's not a 'feel good' film. It's not an action film. You won't cheer. You shouldn't cheer. It's an allegory for the absolutely horrible things humans experience, endure, and overcome. 
Oh ... and it has the greatest movie monster in cinematic history in it. Perfectly demonstrating why Godzilla is the greatest monster in cinematic history."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Different perspective than most Godzilla movies. Jurassic Park-like scenes of people being munched or squashed. Great acting and special effects. Highly recommended!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything was amazing. Plot, acting, sound design and music. Design and use of the Godzilla character. As someone who has since nearly all the Godzilla films going back to the first from 1954, this is probably the best film and rendition of the character to date"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Maybe the best Godzilla movie ever. The story was fantastic.  Godzillas design was extremely wonderful and my favorite version ever.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Calling all Godzilla fan The King himself has return!!!!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily one of the top 3 movies of the year, I never thought I would say that about Godzilla."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Just what you would expect from a Godzilla movie with wonderful effects and a nice storyline.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent film.  A true triumph for everyone involved.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. New take on the Godzilla origins. Must see on big screen.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an emotionally complex movie that had me near tears of joy at the end. I left the movie feeling rejuvenated and full of delight. One of the best movies I've seen in awhile. Fresh content and story plot
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie I watched all year, you feel the high stakes of the situation and get really invested in the story of the characters. Really incredible the budget was only 15 million."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very pleasant film if you don't mind reading subtitles or sitting through 2 hours of film. Good characters, action and soundtrack! Would recommend."
"Dec 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great story and character development. Monster was amazing. Wish i didn't have to read the entire movie.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,truly an amazing film with character and heart that Hollywood is incapable of making nowadays.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a darn great movie. This was a GODZILLA MOVIE!
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing work of art and drama.  Will definitely have you sobbing and cheering at the same time.   Incredible what they did with the budget of just half the episode of She hulk.   Couldn't rave more about this movie.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved. Go in with no expectations of past iterations and be pleasantly surprised . Great watch.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Highly entertaining film for monster movie lovers.
Good mix of action and drama. Glad I watched it."
"Dec 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was alright, they didn't really do anything different from the Godzilla movies everyone disliked so I don't know why this one was reviewed so highly."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this was. Definitely one of the best movies of the year.
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is absolutely the best Godzilla movie ever made. This is on another level. The acting was powerful and gripping. The movie is haunting, terrifying, and tragic. This is why we go to the movies."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"usually the weakpoint of godzilla movies are when the human characters are on screen, but this one was very different.

both the godzilla and human elements of the stories could have been isolated movies and been compelling 10/10 wonderful movie"
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding performances by the cast. Godzilla is at his most awesome and menacing.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Focus on plot, character development, and impact of atomic devastation in post WWII Japan."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing... great Godzilla and great story
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! A new fresh take on Godzilla! The human story was very well written. If there's ever a Godzilla movie to see it is this one!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't usually like subtitles. However, this one was greatly done and the movie was action. Packed and feasible. it had a good stor a plot and very entertaining."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the only way storytelling should be done. To care about the action and overall plot you need to care about the character and to do that requires character development. This is a masterpiece.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST MONSTER MOVIE !!!!!!   GODIZILLA!!!!!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best godzilla film in the series. A true spectacle to behold and return to form. It will also have you caring deeply for the humans this time around.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie talkers should be executed
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved it, definitely a different take on Godzilla"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent prequel and storyline! The use of some of the original aspects of original Godzilla films (no spoilers) took it over the top for me! Two thumbs up!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. What a fantastic piece of cinema. Although it doesn't really mean much considering I've only seen the MonsterVerse Godzilla movies before this, this is easily my favorite. Godzilla is menacing and scary, and unlike the MonsterVerse movies, the human characters are just as good, especially the main character. He has plenty of development throughout, and you actually care about him and the other characters. This movie is perfect in my eyes, and because of that, it's my second favorite movie of the year, just behind Oppenheimer, although those two are switching all the time. Overall, this film is a masterpiece, and a must-see in theaters, before its limited run runs out."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,had a very good storyline
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece. Best action movie of the year.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever created! Balance of actually likable characters and terrific Godzilla action add to an incredibly entertaining story that has to be one of the best films of the year!
"Dec 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I expected so much, and was very disappointed.  The story was good, but disjointed.  Some of effects seemed almost ""cheesy"" to me.  The ending, however, was the best part."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Good update of a classic legend.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh my goodness this movie changed my whole entire life. There has not a single movie that has moved me more than this film. You won't believe it when I say how much this movie has changed me. It has significantly altered my life. After sitting through this two hour film, I happened to get a raise at my workplace. I got a promotion yesterday morning when I walked into the building. I was baptized at my local church. My birthday went well 
and I celebrated it early this year in honor of the Godzilla."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of those ""greatest movie of all time"" contenders. Everything about Godzilla is phenomenal. It's an experience. Love, respect, admiration. A monumental masterpiece. And I had ZERO interest going in. Hollywood, take notes."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,You can't call yourself a Godzilla fan if you don't see this movie.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film to date.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie - the combination of action and emotion was something I wasn't expecting but certainly found fitting. I wasn't expecting to shed tears but all well worth it, I think. It captures Godzilla in his perfect, unpredictable, nature. Mind you, the staccato movements remind me of the earlier movies, but it didn't deter from his capabilities at all. If anything, fit the timeline and felt like an ode to..  Don't sleep on this movie, especially if you're a kaiju fan."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Cinematic Masterpiece
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was the perfect combination of everything you could want in a Godzilla film. It had memorable characters, good CGI, an interesting plot, fun moments, and an authentic representation of real Japanese tragedy. It took me a while to understand the timeline of the movie at the beginning, but once I got settled it was absolutely phenomenal."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,So good. it's amazing and it truly made me cry
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fan-damn-tastic! I went in expecting a lot and got more than I expected. It's hard to find a Godzilla picture with a great story, but this one delivers, great writing and directing, I'm giving away nothing, best movie of the year by far, you will not be disappointed."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Going on my list of one of the best war movies ever made. A beautifully executed metaphor of post WW2 Japan, this is a about a lot more than Kaiju."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was an okay film, maybe a genre/type I'm just not too keen on. Ending was good but I found myself not caring enough throughout, maybe not into Japanese acting. Movie looks really good given the tiny budget. A rated R would have made this a 3.5 stars"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is Toho Studios best Godzilla film ever made. Great human story, great acting the baddest, coolest Godzilla on screen. A definite must see!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is the perfect starter movie to introduce you to the Godzilla universe. This artful, moving, yet digestible movie is simple enough for viewers of all ages to enjoy. For its $15 Million budget, this movie's effects look phenomenal, and Marvel should take notes! As for the story and themes, I didn't expect it to be so well-rounded and so much more than just the Godzilla monster. The portrayal of survivors' guilt is gut-wrenchingly realistic, and the grief the characters experience is painful to watch (in the best way). This movie brings a much more human perspective to the Godzilla phenomenon. This is the first Godzilla movie of any kind that I've seen in its entirety, and if all Godzilla movies are as good as this one was, I better start watching ASAP!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely outstanding film.  Wonderful screenplay, outstanding acting and overall great story.  I had goosebumps leaving the theater."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Classic monster movie gold
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Total surprise! Well made
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"wow.  action, romance, tragic heroes, redemption... and a cliff hanger.  

a MUCH deeper movie than any of the current Godzilla/Kong flix.   Don't get me wrong - they're good too but this one is seriously Oscar worthy!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great entertainment with some surprises regarding post WWII conditions in Japan, commentary on Japanese culture and societal expectations, acknowledgement of PTSD and more. Godzilla looks great, action scenes deliver and acting raises the bar ... on Godzilla movies : ) Compliments to TOHO for a welcome addition to the franchise!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Film was great. Has a film festival vibe. This movie gives a lot of energy towards the 1950s classic. I was moved.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely stunning monster movie bringing back the original creation.  It was a joy to watch with a love story running in parallel.  Godzilla is the all time best!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla yet! Awesome directing and great focus on the human fight for survival!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies i have ever watchex
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This is hands down one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a perfect showcase of the indomitable human spirit and brought me to tears on more than one occasion. I felt immersed in the film in a way I previously didn't think was possible from a Godzilla movie. A must watch in my opinion.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, a Godzilla movie I liked with characters that I actually cared about. "
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"An outstanding and memorable addition to the Toho Godzilla legacy. Compelling characters, a tense, nail-biter plot, and special effects far beyond its $15M budget make this a must watch. G Fans and people who know nothing about Godzilla alike will love this film. Intense action and serious adult themes of wartime trauma mean this one isn't for young kids, but it will be a long-lasting favorite for years to come. Absolutely one of the best movies of the year, if not the decade."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! Not what I was expecting, but it’s  masterful.!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,movie exceeded my expectations. the scenes with godzilla were horrifying and stellar. he never overstayed his welcome. the narrative really pushed you to care about the characters and get invested. havent been emotional about a movie in a very long time. would reccomend
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing original film!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the movie of the year.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is the best monster movie of all time. Solid plot and take-home message. Godzilla was terrifyingly fantastic as a villain, I felt myself deeply rooting against him for the first time of my life. I typically like to see more monster, less people, but it was not the case for this film. Outstanding."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie did not show enough Godzilla for me majority of the movie spent on dialog of family  I was hoping the finale would at least be a long battle showing him at one point he let out  his Godzilla scream that was silent
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best Godzilla film!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie I throughly enjoyed from bringing to end. I couldn’t have asked for a better movie. Thank you.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It’s great, made me cry."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie in years!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie and definitely movie of the year.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic kaiju eiga. Great for all audience tastes.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023! It's a must watch for monster fans
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed feeling like you were there with Godzilla and the usual excitement when the battles take place.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was hesitant to see this in a theater due to the subtitles. I'm so glad I did as the subtitles didn't distract me at all. This has a moving storyline and a wonderful cast of characters that kept me engaged. The cinematography is spectacular, and the special effects are on point. The weaving of the action with the acting is a tribute to the best of what I love about an old movie story telling rarely seen in today's releases. I encourage all who enjoy a good storyline to see this movie as it is far more than a Godzilla movie, it's the birth of a new day in the franchise."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yo...The Godzilla effects were out of this world. However; this movie was utterly trash. Honestly; I don't see how this movie is getting all the good reviews. What you get is 40 mins of trash followed by 30 seconds of Godzilla followed by another 50 mins of trash followed by 40 seconds of Godzilla. Rinse and repeat.
   The movie is mainly about some punk ass kamikaze pilot (understandably) who failed to oconduct his duty in WWII (love story included) and now seeks redemption by being a kamikaze pilot to kill Godzilla. He kind of failed at the kamikaze part again.
  I am a Godzilla fan but this mofo put my wife to sleep with me almost right behind her. I should have went to see the Marvels instead...F#$# this movie"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Loved the story!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a good movie and had good characters.  The movie had many good moments.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest movie known to man onm🗣️🗣️🗣️
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better then expected!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Almost certainly movie of the year. For the first time in a while, the human characters are ACTUALLY more compelling than the monster, and I mean that as a genuine compliment. Not to sleep on Godzilla himself, who is as fun as ever. Must see, for sure."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen, one of the BEST movies I've ever seen! It's that good!! AMAZING!!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,A cinematic masterpiece that’ll go down as probably one of if not the best Godzilla movie of all time. Character development was excellent and storyline was compelling and kept you interested the whole time. Coming from growing up watching the originally Godzilla and current and past movies. This is without a doubt in my top 3 if not top. Legendary and Warner Brothers take notes on how to make a proper film by watching this.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie
Great storyline"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Movie I've seen awhile hands down!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm telling you that this movie has earned every bit of praise it is getting.  A powerful a human drama. Not a war movie, a WWII story about survival in post apocalyptic Japan where their country lost everything and is back to ""zero.""  Not a monster movie, a monster story how the additional devastation from Godzilla took Japan down another notch from zero to ""minus one."""
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen all Godzilla movies (except for some animated ones). I saw the American version of Godzilla with Raymond Burr in the early 1960's. That's 50 years of reflection, all the good and the bad. My favorite is Gojira, but this movie has me rethinking that, perhaps for sentimental reasons, I'm not sure. Nevertheless, this has the best plot of any, Toho or otherwise. The characters are compelling, and Gojira (I prefer the Japanese name) is a frightening force of nature. Recommended 100%"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Riveting. Godzilla is majestic in this film.  It's brilliant.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid movie, a real throwback to the original Godzilla movies so prevalent on Saturday afternoon TV growing up."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, slow in parts but this makes the peaks hit even harder."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didn't realize it was a remake of the original but once I accepted that it was pretty good. The closed caption was easy to follow because sentences were short and to the point. Great action!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Whole storyline excellent  easy to follow great ending.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best Japanese Godzilla film yet and I have watched them all. I grew up in the 70s.
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't know how this movie got such a high rating, it was okay, not a bad movie but not great like the ratings have it. It was okay is what I'll describe as. It's okay. Not the best Godzilla movie, not the worst Godzilla movie, it's just okay."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The hype is real. If you grew up watching Godzilla movies then this is a no brainer. 
Twinges of nostalgia throughout the movie and as many people have said this one you actually care about the humans and their stories in this movie. How did they do such a good job with such a low budget when Disney and WB and the rest are putting out dog !+ time and time again with hundreds of millions of dollar budgets?
I loved it. Many have said its the best movie of the year. I have no argument against that opinion. Go see it!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Ive got to say Godzilla Minus One is a great and respectful retelling of the OG 1954 Godzilla film. The Creature effects were excellent. Great story. Wonderful actors.  Japanese with English subs. Definitely worth seeing.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,another Godzilla masterpiece
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good but a little thrown off by some pieces of this movie....but overall not bad...best Godzilla movie in a while before we do the King Kong thing
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"An ode to Japanese culture through & through.  The music, the story, I forgot film can be an art.  And what movie brought me this profound joy... a Godzilla movie.  Take some notes Hollywood."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great watch! Really enjoyed the character development,  story , and found myself cheering for the main characters! Godzilla is very menacing and menancing. Best blast breath effect ever....Best godzilla move ever!!!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible action thriller that everyone should see. Some of the acting can be slightly exaggerated, but that is just nitpicking a real gem of a movie."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a real throwback Godzilla movie, and not like the American versions of Godzilla. Almost like a remake of the original from way back in the day. Story is a little slow but characters have real depth to them. Godzilla parts are outstanding and well worth the price of admission."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great sounds and music alike original Godzilla movie loud a good monster movie
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"love this movie is a amazing Godzilla movie.
people with cellphone in theaters are a kind of downer. movie theater company should be more tight with the cellphone rules."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was amazing seeing the g man in action as if was the 1954 movie, absolutely amazing and the CGI is peak, i literally have goo all over my screen just typing this, amazing movie 👍👍👍"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spectaculary Decieving, fun, wild, and real"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best ever from Toho.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla movie after godzilla 1954 and best movie of the year
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie I've seen all year. From the first island scene you're taken away to a world beyond yours.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie this year and the only Godzilla movie where the plot and characters are fantastic. Love it.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've seen in a while, and my favorite this year! Take notes, Hollywood! This is how you not only make a good movie or in this case, a good Godzilla movie, but the story element and the human are relatable and grounded, not to mention the music really makes this film hit hard. And for a film with a budget of 15 million dollars that isn't overspend or overproduced or calling out fans to f off or hating them, it still looks outstanding while respecting their fanbase. 

It is rare nowadays to make me feel for human cast but they did, since it's set after the ww2 and it's them experience post war trauma, just like the original 1954 but with modern technology and take (and the good modern that isn't just there to pander to sacrifice story). The only problem I have is that this isn't in a lot of theaters for people to see it, because they would've loved this.

I recommend this film not only for Godzilla fans, but anyone who want to see an actual good movie with a well written story. If you have problem that your theater near you don't screen it, find a theater that has it and plan a trip just to see it. 

Or the safer rought is to wait until DVD or streaming, but only time will tell."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Certainly a great Godzilla movie, but a pretty solid movie too."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a perfect experience on big screen, the ost, vfx, plot, all in this movie is so divine and much more.

Thanks for all in this movie Takashi Yamasaki, this is an 10/10"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great movie! The storyline was a little slow but the battle sequences with Godzilla absolutely made up for it. I am abog fan of the old Godzilla so this was right up my alley. Way better than any of the Hollywood Godzilla movies!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"So refreshing to see rendition of Godzilla that hasn’t been overplayed. Great story arc of a Kamikaze pilot dealing with his own demons on top of a classic fan pleasing ending. Also, this had the most badass version of Godzillas heat ray I’ve seen to date."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2023 by far! Great story, great visual effects, with all the emotions you get in a fantastic movie. Reading the subtitles and following the movie was the easiest I've experienced in watching a foreign film.  I am definitely going to watch it again."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely Brilliant !!!  This is a very human story that just happens to have Godzilla in it.  The writing is spot on as are the performances, direction, cinematography,  costumes, and sound.  You will become involved in these characters.  The storyline will suck you in from the first frame and keep you involved till the end credits.  This is not your typical monster movie.  Go see this film while it's still in theaters."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 way better than all the other godzilla movies. This is what they should strive for.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Live action anime. This was incredible to watch. The sound effects of his atomic attack is sick. Great story.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,So good that I would have watched if Godzilla wasnt in it.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Im gonna need Minus Two
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing film, so much done with so little budget. the emotions of the actors and the impact of the effects really had impact."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen, the human story was engaging, and the cinematography was the better than any of the American Godzilla movies"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"if you are a fan of Godzilla, this a must see. The directing was top notch. Imagine that, humans adding to the storyline of a monster movie."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie since 1954
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, just wow. Wonderful, first Godzilla movie ever where I wanted the main characters to survive, the effects were breathtaking at points. The story telling was wonderful. The characters were perfectly developed, and the arc of the main character was one of the best I’ve ever seen. Every scene with Godzilla was treat, and absolutely epic. One of the best films of the year. "
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the graphics , the story line and overall the emotion the production  put in this movie is incredible."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. You come for Godzilla action and leave with a remarkable story with lovable characters. intense action, drama amd a powerful ending."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent and deeply moving film. Possibly my favorite this year!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies of the year ! Simply excellent. Must watch
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm blown away. I can't remember the last time I saw something legitimately good in theaters.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Ive never been so invested in the story of a monster movie before.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible visual effects despite the low budget. Godzilla Minus One exceeded my expectations with compelling character development, original music, and one ominous big fat monster!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see for all fans of the Godzilla franchise.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible storytelling, the characters felt real and relatable even without a good understanding of the cultural nuances or historical significance. That is to say that even without the addition of Godzilla, the characters themselves convey a story of hopelessness, perseverance, and a truly human perspective on the world they are experiencing. More movies like these need to be made, and hopefully with the same passion and patience for storytelling."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Could watch this movie multiple times instant classic!!!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,easily the most powerful movie I've watched all year. don't go in expecting cheesy popcorn mindless entertainment. this is not your typical monster movie blockbuster. it still has some riveting scenes and watching it in 4DX is definitely worth it!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Not what I expected but I loved it.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,godzilla is a very cool monster
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the story, the graphics, and the roars were fantastic."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023. Gripping story. Strong Characters. Must see if you like science fiction. You won’t be disappointed.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus 1 is some sort of heritage style B-movie. The character-driven film nods subtly in appreciation at Hollywood, while remaining an homage to mid-20th century Japanese popular cinema. I especially appreciate how the story tellers eschew reliance on special effects or the emotions fear, anger, and aggression to garner attention. Instead, they kept me engaged with charming characters, thoughtful costuming, and well-crafted mise en scène. A classic monster movie; and an 8 of 10 overall."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautifully filmed movie with stunning visuals and action sequences. This movie is a must see for both Godzilla lovers and those who are new to the franchise.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great story about humanity, and finding purpose in the wake of tragedy, to make a better future. All wrapped up in compelling acting, great set design, and a beautifully terrifying monster. Cannot recommend this highly enough."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Poignant post-war story of life after tragedy. Classic Godzilla provides the symbolic challenge to overcome, illustrating the beast that persists after the trauma of war.  Courage, survival, found families and forgiveness triumph  in this latest take on an old favorite."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful film, good to see godzilla going back to its roots. I Can't fault this one, some of the best characters i have ever seen in film, and all equalliy likable and important."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,A pleasure to see the King.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Stunning visuals. Classic score.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprisingly heartwarming with a fun plot!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of the 1954 original Godzilla film, you will love this film!!!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great movie.  However, in the beginning there is a place where the film slows down a bit for backstory and you have to get thru it to see all past that point.  If you make it past that point, it ramps up pretty quickly and continues being what we all love, Godzilla stomping the world..."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"In spite of an incredibly small budget (15 million) the film makers have managed to turn this movie into an instant classic. It's an emotional rollercoaster that had me rooting for humanity and that's no easy task these days. The special effects aren't great in some places, but when a movie is so well written they don't have to be. I would suggest Hollywood film makers head over to Japan at their earliest convenience and re-learn how to make movies that are cringe-free and watchable."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The nostalgia was heavy, so good. Even the human story was really good."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"If this movie doesn't Win an Oscar, I quit cinema. Period.

This is not just a monster movie, this is a War Film. Pure perfection from start to finish, I just can't believe how good this film was. I got tears by the end of the film.

Absolutely outstanding."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't believe this movie made me cry. So much heart and brilliant ending.  Best random end of the year surprise of 2023.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One was superb. A great storyline with magnificent effects, lighting, sound, scale shots, camera angles, and realistic props. A perfect cast with a nostalgic and incredible score that really compliments the mood of the film. A heartfelt and emotional film that is captivating to someone who is not familiar with Godzilla, but a perfect film for the hardcore Godzilla fan. 10 out 10. A timeless masterpiece."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I brought my two sons to see this movie and all of us thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was great to see a movie that had a great story and keep you invested with the characters. If you have a chance to see this movie, see it now. It's worth it."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I cried. The movie was really good. The human story was just a s captivating as the monsters story and how it all tied in together was magnificent!  I want a copy of this when it’s available. All of the actors were incredible.   The cinematography was awe inspiring. The only thing I didn’t like was Godzilla looked like he had thick chicken feet that just hurt when he walked. I know it was supposed to be dramatic effect but that part didn’t work for me but he’s still the scary colossal monster that we all know.  Great job!  I hope the story continues.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite Godzilla movie
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Has to be top 3 Godzilla movies I’ve ever seen
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,So much heart and action. A shockingly emotional and earnest film you’ll be surprised at how much you’ll experience watching a Godzilla film. Loved it!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning! The story is so beautiful and heartbreaking and just epic! A true Godzilla masterpiece. A truly breathtaking movie.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Moving human stories with beautifully shot monster scenes. Great score. One of the best movies I've seen in years! Highly recommend
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best stories of the year. Some may not enjoy the subtitles, others may feel Godzilla was not needed to interrupt the incredible human story, but I enjoyed it. The first Godzilla in a decade where the human story was incredible. The struggle, the loss, the pain, the forgiveness, the hope, all of it...sensational!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing dramatic scenes that drew you in to the characters and well timed action scenes. It felt realistic in a way past films missed not because of big budget, but good story, acting, and relatability."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made. Engaging from start to finish. Great story. It offers a little of everything for everyone. Godzilla is not messing around this time. Two thumbs way up! 
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Can a Godzilla movie make you cry? Yes it can.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't believe I saw a Godzilla movie where I actually gave a fuck about the human characters.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I would never expect to tear up in a Godzilla movie! A must watch.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I've seen this film 3 times now taking different friends to see it. we all have loved it. it's a great character drama with compelling characters and arcs. Godzilla is a true monster and leaves you in awe and terror at his destruction. An amazing mix of powerful storytelling and monster horror/thriller
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kicks ass with a message
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simply a masterpiece, and in my opinion, the best Godzilla film ever made. In past Godzilla films, the human characters add minimally to the story, however in Minus One, the people's plot points are what drive the story. 

It excellently builds suspense, especially with the ""Big-G"" on screen. I will not go into any story spoilers, because you just HAVE to see it yourself. 

If you've been a fan for your whole life, or have never even heard of Godzilla, you will still love it. There is something for everyone. See it on the best and biggest screen possible. Absolutely worth the time!"
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,It wasn't Godzilla.  He looks nothing like Godzilla
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the slight anime influence. Honestly, one of the best movies this year."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and well put together storyline.  Best Godzilla movie in the franchise.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Best movie I've seen all year long. Great writing and action scenes.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute thrill fest from start to finish. The first five minutes had chills shivering down my spine. A fun movie for casual viewers, and an amazing must-watch for Godzilla fans."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Real, heartfelt human characters.   Godzilla is a straight up terror.  Unlike most kaiju movies, you actually care about the people in danger.     A nice reset on what a Godzilla movie can and should be."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and characters.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The surprise of the year.  I went into this expecting some good monster action, but the human side of this movie was incredible and really emotional and deep.  The movie could've worked on its own with any other villain substituting for Godzilla.  The human story was that good..... BUT Godzilla is as EPIC as he/she has ever been in this movie too.  The RT rating is true.  Go see this movie.... See this movie on the biggest screen yo can find!!!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie all around! Good backstory, special effects, acting, and perfect length."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not sure I got the purpose of this one. Ive watched all Godzilla movies. This was so unrealistic.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,very good movie.  great story of redemption.
"Dec 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"the movie is not in English, and I don't like to read the subtitles as the movie is going on, I will miss on what's going on in the movie to stop and read the subtitles all the time, so not for me !"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done.  Just like the classic Godzilla, only better made."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow wow wow go see it then youll get it
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,More than expected and it was the first time I was rooting for humanity to survive. They used reality type of trap that can destroy the monster. I admit I had a slight tear jerk from the overwhelming emotions it pulled out of me.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was incredible. I was skeptical about watching a movie with subtitles not know Japanese, but it didn't affect the movie at all. It was everything you want in a Godzilla movie: suspenseful, scary, dramatic, emotional, funny, and extremely well done. Highly, highly recommend."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is definitely a triumph masterpiece of destruction I like the 2014 American version of Godzilla but Minus One is really thrilling and really great human drama and the terror about the war and bombs and the vfx looks really outstanding and the sound is really fantastic.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The amount of times my jaw dropped, mouth wide open in the middle of the theatre… like wow. Insane film, the story line and character development was JUST as good as the action. I don’t know which I enjoyed more!! You’ll laugh, cry, smile, clutch your seat, all that. What a ride man I think I wanna go see it again! Can’t wait for the sequel heard it’s already confirmed! ***not a big deal at all, but only thing that through me off was when the toddler crying sounded like a newborn baby fresh out the wound 😂😂😂 if you watch you’ll see what I’m talking bout lol it just made me chuckle"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year. Easily.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good acting by the Japanese cast.  Good story.  Was a throwback to the first few Toho Godzilla movies.  Tail swipe, thermonuclear blast, and, finally, they played the iconic Godzilla theme towards the end.  Best Godzilla movie since Godzilla v. Monster Zero."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent take on the Big G! Retro and contemporary at the same time. Thoroughly enjoyed the story and the human characters. For once the humans are actually engaging and not just monster fodder, though many are stomped on by Godzilla! A must see!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla Movie to date
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the story and loved the action
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I was a big Godzilla movie fan as a young boy but wouldn't have guessed that I would still be a fan 50 years later! This movie is great on so many levels and I won't spoil anything because it needs to be seen and experienced first hand on the big screen. Best Godzilla movie yet made! IMHO
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just watched Godzilla Minus 1 in 4DX at the Regal on Union Square 
Review
4DX-The seats rocked and rolled and threw me around like I was a twig . Steam  in your face and your feet get zapped.
It was a blast 
The movie without all the gizmos , so-so.
The last 20 minutes were really good.

People werent ready for the 4DX features, and the special effects kicked in their soda and popcorn went flying haha"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite movie of 2023. What they did with a 15M USD budget is phenomenal. 
It reminded me of my experience watching Top gun, sitting at the edge of my seat.

This is a perfect mix of characters you care for, Godzilla and action. 

Even as a non-Godzilla fan I would be surprised if you do not like it. It is just a great movie overall.

Watch it in the cinema if you can! And if you can, choose a theater with a great sound system!"
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing movie. It had a plot and you are invested in the characters. It was worth it. I will be seeing it again.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Magnificent! The characters were actually more engrossing than Godzilla. Couple them with the amazing special effects and storyline and you a winner.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic! Loved every second of it, as a long time Godzilla fan this is everything I could have wanted! And it has actual good human characters."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Second only to the original Gojira (1954).  Thrilling, absorbing, and emotional throughout. This is also the most terrifying Godzilla (even scarier than Shin).  I've seen it three times and it just keeps getting better somehow.  SKREE-ONK!"
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great melodramatic Japanese story, but only a few Godzilla appearances."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding character development and engaging story. This is a refreshing success in an otherwise disappointing year.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen 
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprisingly a really great film.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun. The vintage feel and action sequences with the classic Godzilla score were amazing. Saw it 2 days ago in iMax and am already wanting to see it again! My only criticism was the ending—I think they could have gone different directions for better results.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"in a year full of insanely expensive, shallow, and forgettable hollywood blockbusters, it's so exciting to see one that doesn't skip out on the great characters, impactful themes, strong acting and sharp writing. yes, this movie has great godzilla action - the effects, visuals, audio, and especially godzilla's design are all impressive, to the point that the movie is genuinely scary at times. but the humanity behind this movie is its biggest strength. thematically, i loved what the film says about how we find meaning in our lives, especially when tragedy strikes and we don't know where to go. the family dynamic is excellent and the camaraderie among the minesweeper crew make this movie a joy to watch, while koichi's journey dealing with ptsd and survivor's guilt give the movie a great emotional core. even side characters like the youngest member of the minesweeper crew, koichi's neighbor, and the mechanic have nuance.

this movie is proof to me that audiences aren't sick of blockbusters per se, but they're sick of bad, mediocre, and (as i said earlier) forgettable ones. this is certainly not one of them, and one of my favorites i've seen in a while."
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was good in delivering fun kaiju action, while also looking into the rebuilding of Japan post-WWII. It was filled with action, emotion, and feel good moments after hair raising displays of power by the titular Godzilla."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,The movie resembled the older films of Godzilla. We rad the story then and we read it today. It was good.
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I watched this yesterday with my Family. We all enjoyed this film. We all clapped and cheered at the end of the movie with everyone else! Must see and we will watch it again!
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was excellent. I saw it in screenx which definitely added to the cinematics and the overall experience. It definitely feels like a return to the older Godzilla movies where Godzilla is more of the villain. Overall definitely one of the best Godzilla movies to come out in recent years
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The monster highlights the humanity needed to rebuild Japan, or any nation for that matter, after World War II. Surprisingly human for a monster movie."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie good screen time balance between humans and monster
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fantastic. The story was awesome. The cinematography was excellent. An emotional and epic rollercoaster.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The story was engaging and the characters were believable.  The monster himself was good!! Overall a great fun ride!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest movie I have ever seen in my opinion is better than 1900s Godzilla
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,100 stars easy !!!!!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bit over explanation combined with awkward Japanese acting was bit minus point for me, but overall story was good and action scenes were intense. Can't believe they made this 15M"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie because I love Godzilla in this movie like this is the way first time in a long time that Godzilla is the villain I love this movie so much please make a part 2.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is drama first and Godzilla movie second.  For the first time you get to like and root for the human characters in a monster flick.  Who would have thought you can give a good script to a movie in this genre?
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film, maybe my favorite Godzilla."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sweet, sensitive, heart warming and FUN!  Loved this film!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story is amazing and I LOVE GODZILLA. The actors and actresses in this movie were phenomenal. I would have liked the monster to move more natural then robotic when. he walked into Gonzo, but still was amazing. And I am watching the movie again. Will the introduce Angriurs? I hope so! Next up Godzilla x Kong The New Empire can't wait! #godzillafan4life"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maybe the best Godzilla movie ever.  Spectacular special effects, plus a solid back story.  Even great music to back up some very suspenseful scenes."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best film I've seen all year. Shows you don't need 500mil to make a phenomenal movie. Emotional, great takes on previous films, and overall well done."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,A great monster flick. Classic Godzilla vibes and even cooler when seen on Screen X at the Marcus Ridge Cinema.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla ever!!! Great story
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie of the year.  epic and amazing.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Engaging story + a killer Godzilla!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Godzilla movie with an actual human plot! One that had me tearing up once or twice, no less!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it. Characters were amazing.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The fear that Godzilla showed me in the 80s resurfaced. This is a great movie
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Even though I couldn't understand a word they said the characters made you understand how they felt 🫥
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it the action and fighting and the graphics were amazing.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It doesn't matter if you're a Godzilla fan or not. It doesn't matter if you're slightly turned of by subtitles. The story, the pacing, the characters, the acting, the cinematography, the musical score, the special effects, and the direction all work in tandem to make this movie a hidden gem for western countries, and probably the best movie of the year.

This movie isn't just a monster movie. It's a human drama that tackles the questions of what happens to people when subjected to war, and tragedy on a grand scale. The movie tackles the questions of what it means to be a family, a nation, what is honor, and how to find redemption.

It's the only movie I've seen this year that left a lasting impression. It's been a week since I've seen it and I'm still thinking about it. Thanks to an extended theater run in North America, I will definitely view it again."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good mix of drama & action, I liked it. Godzilla was angry! He's a hater!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story and cast. Really emotional and Godzilla is horrifying.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is mostly a backdrop for this movie, but f*** it you aren't watching it for him anyway. For once, you are watching it for the humans, that you can't help but root for and get attached to. This is a beautiful movie about people who have nothing, fighting for survival, gathering to fight a common threat. But perhaps more importantly, it's about survivors guilt and heart. I won't spoil anything, but I am still crying even after getting home and typing this."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best movie of the year. A throwback to amazing storytelling and a flawed heroes journey. All that and the scariest Godzilla ever put to screen. Probably the first film since the first film I found myself rooting for the people and not Godzilla. 9.5 out of 10 from me and now my favorite of all the Godzilla movies.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The is a great film that makes you care about the characters before all craziness starts to happen.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,rally rikicng grat movie............. lovd it
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It takes a lot for me to actually go to the movies, versus waiting for streaming. The reviews of my beloved franchise for Minus one were spot on. Can't wait to go again tonight! Excellent story line, acting and overall fantastic cinema!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The quintessential Godzilla film. It doesn't matter if you've never seen Godzilla before or if you've seen every prior film, you should see this movie."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was full of heart and great monster effects. It won't be the same on the small screen. Gotta see this in theaters.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Certainly, an unexpected surprise.  This is a story of redemption with loads of emotion.  You'll see PTSD, guilt and grief during wartime.  The character development here was off the charts terrific, and arguably some of the best since, yes, the original Star Wars.  There wasn't one character in this movie that you didn't have some emotion tied to, really well done there.  

Obviously this is a Godzilla movie, however this is more of a character developmental story of our main protagonist.  This was really well done on all aspects.

My lone holdup, being a foreign movie, was the language barrier however, as long as you can read subtitles well, the emotion and communication with each scene was not an issue.

The story was great, but if I can find one minor issue with the movie would be that it should have kept some decisions rather than potentially sequel baiting or keeping the emotion tied to specific characters more permanent.  If you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Elsewise, if you can consider this a standalone movie, this was great."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible. It's a throwback to the original Godzilla movie format but with an awesome story and better effects.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it...story was Great and the FX lived up to the hype I had read.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best movie ever when I was a little kid my first watching all Godzilla movie I wish I can make monster movie of mine too is Because I'm a good artist and I will make it hard
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"A near-perfect movie. Great balance between the human element and the horror that is the king of the kaiju. Nearly brought to tears and I would rate this film equal to, if not slightly better than the 1954 original."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie yet!  It's so rare you actually care about the Human element in a Kaiju film, but they nailed it!  Then Godzilla shows up and it's even better!   His design is the best to date.  How they did this on a $15 million budget is beyond me!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw it in just Japanese on IMAX 4D in Shinjuku on Nov 17th then with English subtitles on Dec 7th 8n Ashburn, VA. Loved it. Great musical score and great story working with the aftermath of WWII. It is a true honor to say it carries the torch of the original 1954 Toho film well. Good cast and dialog. Godzilla had an amazing design and was ferocious."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like Godzilla, sci-fi, war, action, or thriller, this is a must-watch film. Even though it's in Japanese, it is a film worth watching you wont be dissapointed. Better than 99% of Hollywood movies these days."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Puts the american versions to shame.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a good movie I hope one day it is dubbed in English. It brings back the good old days five of the old Godzilla movies.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im a godzilla fan, and i absolutely the idea of the of 1954 film not Godzilla vs Kaijus but Godzilla vs Humans, and even the cgi is hella perfect, and i love the new idea of the charging up the atomic breath. this is the best godzilla movie for my opinion."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"First time ever rating a movie 
Felt I had to let people know the Movie is Amazing from human story to Godzilla it truly is a must see on the Big Screen"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very good Godzilla movie, the best Japan has produced. It actually managed to make you care for the human characters where no other film has done aside from the original 50s film and Shin Godzilla and with Shin I don't think it was done as well as this movie. Godzilla looks gorgeous, his design was a mashup between the classic design and the Legendary one. If I had to nitpick, the pacing could have been a little tighter and I wasn't wild about [[[BIG ENDING SPOILER INCOMING]]] Noriko's survival, I think it slightly cheapens the main characters ending, it should have ended in my opinion with him coming back to get his daughter and him and her aunt hugging and crying, but I'm a sucker for more somber, melancholy endings. lol"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,AWESOME!  Took me back to childhood!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,What was done with this movie that no other Godzilla movie has ever been able to do is how a story should be told!! It makes you feel for the characters and the aftermath of war and disaster. Godzilla is a TRUE VILLIAN in this movie. It's such a refreshing take to actually see him be the creature to fear!! I cannot say enough about how awesome it is to see a movie with a budget of $15 MILLION absolutely wow you with the effects! 10/10
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Engaging character story. Great CGI. You'd never believe it's a $15 million budget movie. Looks like a true blockbuster.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow definitely get to the theaters to see this masterpiece. Great story, great Godzilla, great actor. You definitely ride an emotional roller coaster in this one. Can't wait to see it again!!!!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Needs to lose 10 min of drag but other than that an absolutely great movie.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I went in not watching anything about it. I'm buying it once it's available. Bring tissues.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the few giant monster movies where I didn't wish the humans would die so we could get to the monsters story quicker. You could tweak this movie to remove the supernatural monster and there is still an interesting plot and interesting characters. Surprisingly evenhanded, with the atom bomb and USA as ""Mr Not Appearing In This Film"" both are the invisible villains who are implied to have set the sea monster off. Godzilla himself acts mindlessly, but gets more powerful the more he is attacked, suggesting he is acting out of pain, like the Shin Godzilla. I dropped a star because it felt like the cinematography could have been better, and the fire effect should have been improved."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw it last night and was reminded how a good movie goes. The visuals were excellent, the actors were fantastic, the pacing felt great, and the thought that went into everything is felt. I would say it's the best movie of 2023, and probably in my top ten movies of all time"
"Dec 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Script couldve been better. Ending was too picturesque.
"Dec 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cheap, B-Movie. I couldn't find nothing good in it. Don't watch it. Is not worth it"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla Movie I’ve ever seen. Absolutely unbelievable. 20/10
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved everything about this film, a must go see over and over movie! 100% Godzilla Authentic"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Not just s good Godzilla movie but a very good movie. Period. Very suspenseful and one of the few monster movies where you care about the human characters.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really AMAZING MOVIE, as a Godzilla fan myself this movie was intense, awesome and I loved every second of it, this definitely deserves the Certified Fresh🥳"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Just an awesome movie
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023.  Best Godzilla movie too.  Because I'm a long time Godzilla fan the soundtrack added a lot to the movie by using godzilla themes for the past.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie lives up to all the reviews. Hollywood needs to be taking lessons, this is how you make a great movie."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"There have been many versions of the Godzilla mythology, but, in my opinion, Godzilla Minus One is one of the best I've seen. It's a Japanese-language film, and it's surprisingly explicit in its critique of various aspects of Japan's approach to its past history in wartime. It's commentary on war and nuclear power, symbolised by the post-war emergence of Godzilla, is powerful. And the themes of loss, survival, and hope add emotional depth.

The story focuses primarily on Sosaku Tachibana, a fighter pilot, who has managed to avoid his fate as a kamikaze pilot by avoiding action altogether. At one point in the film, it is noticed that his plane hasn't been damaged. The guilt of not fulfilling his orders, including not defending his colleagues against Godzilla early in the story, haunts him, and his internal struggles with this are constantly present as the story unfolds.

The other characters are also well-developed and very relatable, bringing a sense of stability in the middle of the chaos. This adds a deeply human element to the story, which focuses more on the humans than the action and special effects, giving us a reason to empathise with and care about these characters rather than just seeking the thrills that come with this genre.

Having said that, though, the visual effects in Godzilla Minus One are stunning and bring Godzilla, a very intimidating monster, to life with realism and fine detail. And the action sequences are intense and exciting. Godzilla really feels powerful and destructive as it goes on its rampages.

Some viewers may find the plot a bit predictable. But the Godzilla mythology is well-embedded among many filmgoers, so that may increase the sense of predictability. And occasionally, it is obvious that CGI has been used, so there are moments when things seem a bit artificial. And there is not much humour to lighten the relentless sadness and fear of the storyline.

If you are a fan of monster movies and action films, and especially of the Godzilla story, go and see Godzilla Minus One. It delivers what it promises when it comes to spectacular visuals and intense action. The explicit exploration of themes of war and loss is handled well."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bit of a slow start imo, but once you get through it and start to actually build attachment to the characters and their storylines you get engulfed in this thrilling plot that invokes a plethora of emotions from fear and sadness all the way to duty and patriotism. A great execution that goes beyond the scope of its predecessors and touches on deep rooted topics of Japanese 20th century culture and the effects that war had on both the mind and body of the country and its people. Haven't sat on it for too long yet, but as of right now it stands as my favorite rendition of the franchise ever."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,it was phenomenal and worth every moment spent watching it
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie Ive ever seen. Honestly my top movie I have seen all year. It was so refreshing good i cant wait to see if they will make another.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily best movie of the year.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a fantastic godzilla movie. The characters weren't annoying or uninteresting. It had a great godzilla design and this movie really showed that staying close to the original moive works 5/5 go watch NOW!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The score is incredible, every scene was visually impressive, its themes are poignant, impactful and thoughtfully woven throughout the entire film. 

TLDR: So nice I saw it twice."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This really is one of and possibly the best Godzilla movie ever made. This is not your save the Earth Godzilla, this is a murderous, rampaging, beast of destruction. The visuals and affects are amazing. The sound is amazing. The story and acting are amazing. You really need to go out and see this in the theater. To make this movie on the budget they had is incredible. It stands up to anything Hollywood could make with 20 times the money. The story is well told, emotional, full of surprises and twists. I highly recommend this movie not only to Godzilla fans but anyone looking for a great theater experience and a great movie to watch."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent character driven story. Not only is it the best Godzilla movie, but it’s one of the greatest monster movies of all time l & my favorite movie of the year. It’s a must see!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"An old school Godzilla movie, with way more heart to it than you'd expect."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I fell like it has been years since I really really enjoyed a new movie. They did a great job!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie blew my expectations off the roof! What an incredible story and performance, had me at the edge of my seat!!! Go watch, I promise you won't be disappointed!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Over it was a good movie
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie ever. Two stories,respect the origins of original Godzilla, good use of CGI and nostalgic scale  scene models."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've just returned home from my first viewing, and I can't wait to share my thoughts. The story follows a veteran of war as he overcomes survivors guilt and realizes through his found family and Japan's new struggle against Godzilla his life has meaning and the importance of mankind's persistence in the face of adversity. TOHO proves less is more by returning Godzilla to his antagonistic roots as a standalone terror with its eyes set on Japan. No other monsters needed. A worthy and wonderful franchise entry by writer/director Takashi Yamazaki. The film paves the way for a bright future of TOHO Godzilla content. The pacing of the film can be a little inconsistent at times, however this hardly detracts from the glorious monster action and touching human storyline that make ""Godzilla Minus One"" one of the greatest entries in the franchise to date. Coming in at #3 on my list of all time favorite Godzilla movies, I happily give it a 4.5/5!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. The visual effects was spectacular and great acting 10/10 go watch it now in theaters for the best sound system.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Hollywood needs to learn something. Tell good stories give heart to your characters and it will do well. This movie is a perfect example of old-school storytelling very well done and definitely worth watching.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one brings back the routes of the atomic horror that is Godzilla but with a different perspective. Unlike 54 which focuses on the effects of nuclear warfare and shin which focuses more on the critique of the many restrictions Japan has against threats, Shin focuses on the main character heavily with heavy messaging of regret, trauma, and how some may overcome it as well as how it always lurks within us with Godzilla being the symbol of that. A beautiful story that will forever resonate with us like 1954."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am 61 years old and seen all Godzilla movies, this one is different due to the fact that plot was well written, and Godzilla is cool. So, this makes it in the top Godzilla movie in series. The Japanese know how to make a Godzilla movie. Will Entertain."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched twice now. I think it might be the best Godzilla film ever made.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great special effects. We loved it! Im looking forward to a follow up movie!
"Dec 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,Godzilla Minus One blends its monster destruction with surprisingly captivating characters resulting in one of the King of the Monsters' finest cinematic outings!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic film, that reminds you what getting lost in the world of a movie should be like. Great story, compelling characters, and emotional stakes, all come together, as the titular monster, fills you with both awe and dread. The ""minus one"" aspect of the movie is just as important, as the portrayal of a struggling nation plays an important factor, in the developing relationships. A must watch, for fans of the genre and anyone who can appreciate a well written story."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, go see it."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent drama, screen play & ofcourse reloading G"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seen this movie 1st time in XD and 2nd time in IMAX. Might be, not only my best Godzilla theatrical experience, but may also be my favorite movie of 2023!!!!!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie, from the musicians, acting, story line, and if course Godzilla himself. Japan bringing back the small budget movie with a giant impact."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing kaiju film! Great story and characters
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie exceeded expectations, solid monster film with nice drama and cgi."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One was very entertaining and I really enjoyed it. It was a very intense and violent/graphic film compared to the other Godzilla films that I have seen. I really recommend it.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,A relief and step up from the routine formula of big monster movies of Hollywood.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"it had all the feel and thrill of the original and 
is a great monster movie!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't think anything would be better than Killers of the Flower Moon, but boy was I wrong. Japan has the best film of the year and I think I need to watch it again. Movie of the year right here."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film. I watch it on 12/1. The story is well paced, Godzilla is genuinely terrifying. The visuals, and audio are great. The characters and their actors are wonderful. Go see this movie!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"From start to finish, I was engrossed with all of the characters. Godzilla is a force of nightmares, and an uniting force by those still recovering from their on going struggles. It's rare for the human characters in a Godzilla movie to carry so strongly, but everyone in the cast here does. A stunning remake of the orginal Godzilla film that does everything perfect."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and human interest!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,OG Godzilla is back! Every scene with Godzilla was tense and had me reeling from everything going on. The acting was some of the best I've ever seen in a Godzilla film! Can't wait to get it for my collection
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really intense, action, emotionally moving entry! Pays fantastic homage to the original, classic godzilla entries.  Highly recommend. Right away you realize this is not the typical godzilla movie."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a fresh retake of the origins of Godzillas story. It is a great rendition 
, the plot and story telling is a breath of fresh air and it makes you sit at the edge of your seat. Its a great movie!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Possibly the best Godzilla movie ever. Highly recommend watching this one.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was excellent!
it was horrifying, brutal, heartwarming, terrifying and heartbreaking all in the span of two hours. 
I'm going to be buying it when it comes out for sale."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a fan of the old Godzilla movies where he was the main villain, I can't tell you how amazing this film is. The story is amazing, the characters are interesting, the post world we 2 setting is probably the best idea of the movie and Godzilla himself is at his best. 10/10 highly recommend that you watch it."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,best of the entire series
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Holy F*** that was a good movie! Like... wow.... that was not a campy by the numbers kaiju movie. That was one of the smartest most captivating, most emotionally intense gripping stories I've ever seen. I had feels at a Godzilla movie! That is not a sentence that was meant to exist!"
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie ever made. The actors were amazing and the story was heartfelt. I even teared up at the end.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It has heart it has a good story great acting and Godzilla best movie of the year just go see it what more could you ask for.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,First time seeing a Godzilla movie where I wasn't annoyed by the human story. Very emotional story about guilt and PTSD and learning to forgive yourself. Also Godzilla fux sh*t up.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"9/10 great cast full of talented actors, awesome score, I shed a tear at the end. Must see in Imax or Dolby for the surround sound."
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS is the Godzilla movie I always imagined. Fking awesome!
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It's amazing what actually story telling can do. This movie single handedly showed what an actual Godzilla movie can be when it's not watered down & run this some garbage marketing filter. I'd say maybe Hollywood would take notes but that's not happening any time this century. SOOOO worth seeing.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Not overhyped at all!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece. As an 80s kid, this was imo the very best Godzilla I have seen, the wholesome yet heartbreaking character development was absolutely amazing. Love this, and now I want more!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,20 out 10 stars!! that's all. go watch it!! #1 Godzilla movie ever!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great movie! All the main human characters had lives that were well fleshed out to make an interesting story. Godzilla was used more as a metaphor than just a monster just stomping around. But when he does appear, whoa, what great special effects. This movie has really raised the bar for future Godzilla movies."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I’ve ever seen! 
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Emotional and destructive at the same time. definitely a contender for movie of the year!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Toho at their best. A true Godzilla movie. Felt like I was watching Godzilla for the first time even though I've grown up watching everything from. The 1950s classic to the animated series and even the Matthew Broderick flop and the most recent train-wreck from legendary. Loved this movie!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was truly awesome!  One of the best representation of Godzilla  in a film if not the best since the original!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not just an excellent Godzilla movie, but also an incredible take on a WWII movie.

The story of how a kamikaze pilot comes with ""failing"" his mission, coming home to be called a coward and ""the reason the Axis lost the war"".

Then finding a reason to live, and a purpose beyond just war.

It also expands the Godzilla mythos in a new and interesting way."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is, easily, the best film of the franchise, and I'm hoping present and future screenwriters took notes.

To make the title character not the star was a bold move, but it paid off. The storytelling of Japan regrouping from WWII and the human condition is so phenomenal and compelling that, at one point, I forgot I was watching a Godzilla movie, but that's a TOHO for you.

I can't wait for a sequel. I need a sequel."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece. This is The Dark Knight of kaiju films. The story was great and well acted. Godzilla was at his brutal best. I loved the orginal score too. Go see this in the theater before it leaves soon. A+
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"As others have said, if you remove Godzilla and just keep in the human parts - post-war devastation, survivor's guilt, blame, war traumatized people, with amazing characters, you get this year's best movie.    Now add in Godzilla - awesome.   But even people who aren't Godzilla/monster fans will love this.    So, so good."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece. This is The Dark Knight of kaiju films. The story was great and well acted. Godzilla was at his brutal best. I loved the orginal score too. Go see this in the theater before it leaves soon. A+
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I have seen in years, also the best Godzilla movie.  Great plot, characters, Toho is awesome!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme de monstro é bom de mais.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I went with my family and all of us were impressed !! great movie!!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Sincere acting.  Great special effects.  Magnificent storyline which kept me on the edge of my seat and in tears simultaneously
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is now the best Godzilla movie ever made.  It is full of action while paying homage, and being more faithful to, the original film series.  It goes to show you don't need to ""Americanize"" already good movies and stories for it to hit with American audiences."
"Dec 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,I went in expecting a lot given the rotten tomatoes rating. I think it needs to be caveated.  If you liked the original Godzilla this is a remake of that first movie basically or a new origin story. This isn't a fun monster fighting monster movie. It was 90% all human story and maybe 10% monster. The effects were OK.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow a really really nice godzilla movie . Every godzilla screen time is amazing 🙏🏾 story worthy of seeing again and again .
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hollywood needs to take notes! movie was amazing..im going to see it a second time. It was soooo well written, you actually care about the characters, visual fx look totally real!!!! Hands down best Godzilla movie EVER...and best movie ive seen in i dont know how many years!!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The storytelling was actually amazing in this one, scenes where beautiful and an amazing score. Would definitely recommend, best Godzilla film by far!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even if you took the Big Guy out, it would be an amazing period piece about immediate postwar Japan (1945 to 1947, the original was set in 1954 after Japan was starting to rebuild), the devastation of Tokyo, and survivors guilt, without excusing Japan's wartime actions. And then they made Godzilla the most horrifying he's ever been, while scaling him back down to the original movie size. He's not so big humans are beneath his notice, he notices and absolutely hates them. It's an excellent drama. It's an excellent horror movie. And it's an excellent Godzilla monster movie. Highly recommend."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maybe best Godzilla movie of the all. One part Kaiju, one part Ozu."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great job by the screen writers.   Finally a monster movie where the monster is not buddies with some scientists or secretly in love with a human  (King Kong ice skating in Central park was about as silly as it gets in any movie ever).   The writers actually let a monster be scary and not have a ""soft"" spot for the puny humans.  The story was also thought provoking as well given the history of Japan for individual self sacrifice and questions about what a country should expect from the citizens.  This is not just a movie for monster movie junkies.  Hollywood should take notes on how it should be done.  One question.  How did they make that little girl cry on cue?   She is too young to take direction and those were some real tears.  Maybe I don't want to know...."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is what movies should be. A perfect blend between spectacle and story! This is a film that not only takes Godzilla back to his roots as a post-war allegory but expands upon those ideas in beautiful and unexpected ways. Godzilla Minus One is such a compelling human drama that it would still be a fantastic movie without Godzilla even being present, and yet we are blessed with some of the most incredible and thrilling Godzilla-monster action we have seen to date! After 5 viewings, the film is still incredibly impactful and resonant. I love it!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen this year. No one does Godzilla better than Toho
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of the year by far. Felt like a teenager at the theatre again. I'm probably going to watch it again this week. Bravo Japan. That was a masterpiece and it's even more impressive it was so good despite a lower budget
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent. On par with Shin Godzilla, a must see for die hard kaiju fans."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a really good film. It wasn't overly complex but it knew the 5 or 6 beats it wanted to hit and it nailed them. Also, and not something I usually notice, but I felt like the sound editing was great."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie. It had a great storyline, the monster was awesome. But don’t bring little children. It’s in subtitles and kinda scary for the young ones."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulous storytelling very engaging.  Best movie I have seen in a long time.  A must see for any movie-goer.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I expected!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie!!!!! If you’re a fan of Godzilla, this movie is a must see."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is amazing to think that a 70 year old movie franchise has delivered us the best Feature in it's long run since the 1954 Original. This is the movie that I have waited for, a serious dramatic ""what if"" that treats every aspect of the situation seriously. The acting is top shelf, the effects are on-point (save a few dodgy shots of boats in the water, but all is forgiven when Goji appears) and the script...THE SCRIPT!!! 

It should be a no brainer but having a great script to tie all the Monster Mayhem together and make us FEEL for the characters is exactly the ticket.

I've seen the movie three times now, and each screening's audience has been bigger than the last.

Long Live The King!!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must-see film. You cheer for every human character in the film; there is so much emotion. The effects on Godzilla are amazing, and he feels like an angry embodiment of war. Its a remake of the original, but pulls in elements from all eras of the franchise. The originals plot beats, Monster Island, Ghidorah's creation plot, and Legendaries animations."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I watched in 2023. Will definitely watch again or own it if on iTunes for purchase.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning movie! You will be engaged the entire time, you will cheer and you will cry."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was nice that Toho didn't personify Godzilla Minus One like Legendary has in the monsterverse version. This movie was about a giant monster with an animal instinct trying to destroy/kill people, not a bumbling sentient being with a sense of humanity at its core. 
By definition, a monster is frightening and Godzilla Minus One was just that. The monsterverse Godzilla is sort of a savior to humanity. Legendary's version fights ill intended creatures and any sort of damage is collateral whereas Minus One is hell bent on destruction.
I enjoy both of them but I prefer the mean Toho Godzilla (Minus One) over the tame Legendary Godzilla. I've seen all of the G movies though the decades, this one is (IMO) by far, the best."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great monster movie and moving drama story for post WWII Japanese flick. Even one of my family members who is not a fan of subtitled movies, and monster movies besides that, really liked it."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing addition to the Godzilla Legend.  The human parts are heartfelt and meaningful.  Godzilla feels like an unstoppable force of destruction.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie absolutely nailed dragged my girlfriend along she hates Kaiju movies and enjoyed it
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Possibly the best movie I've seen in 2023. A wonderful story line, good amount of action, solid acting, and still that feel of original Toho Godzilla. You know a movie is good when you dont even realize you're reading sub-titles the entire time. So much better than the Hollywood Godzilla garbage we've been given the past few years. Can't wait for the next one!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is awesome it was so good and my opinion the best movie of 2023 hands down
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was AWESOME! It was not only a great Gozilla movie, it was a genuinely good film. It gave a great look at post WWII Japan from the perspective of the Japanese themselves. Solid characters, solid story, and decent VFX make this well worth seeing. I would LOVE for Hollywood to take some pointers from this and give us more films like this. If you like disaster flicks and historical dramas, then you will definitely enjoy this."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I've been in love with Godzilla for over 30 years. This is my first experience seeing one straight from Japan in IMAX. Thank you for the story and the nuance. May Godzilla live forever.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into this movie knowing that it would be great, and that I'd get the Godzilla action I was looking for. What I didn't know is that I'd leave the movie having that wish fulfilled along with eyes full of tears from the wonderfully portrayed human element in the movie. This is a masterpiece in storytelling. The ability to take a 70 year old franchise, reboot it and make it better than it's ever been is a feat. On my list of favorite movies of all time"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent story with very good acting & visual effects!!!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It was one of the best movies I have seen in years. So well made and the characters were amazing.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The action was incredible. Godzilla was very scary. The music was perfect!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie! You really feel the anguish of the main human character,  and the main, main character, Godzilla, is simply awesome. The movie says something about humans, which is what Godzilla is really about. It is a much better story and movie than the Hollywood version (but I'll still go see those Godzilla movies, too)."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A horrifyingly personal match between humanity and monster. It captures beats and imagery from the '54 version but tells a unique story that will hold well over time. Aspects have been adapted to add hope and utter despair.
"Dec 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I admit the movie was good special effects, the story setting and telling but there is one thing. Is nothing new when it comes to how the people of japan have to react to the coming of Godzilla. 
As for the lead character with a redemption theme story is nothing new in few of the Godzilla franchise. 

But I think Shin Godzilla was more of a better movie, due to taking risk and you care for the people of japan just like Minus One but it was different also as you do care of the evolution of Godzilla in Shin. What will happen next especially the way it ended and sadly to say we will never get the sequel it deserves. 

Godzilla Minus One is a pass the time movie which you will watch here and there."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Still in awe of what I saw. From the visuals to the score to the amazing story line.
Not just an amazing Godzilla movie. An amazing movie period."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"i saw the movie with my friend, and all i have to say is are mouths were open the entire movie. this movie is not just the best godzilla movie but the best movie i've seen"
"Dec 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,The CGI is the only noteworthy aspect of this film. This movie lacks complexity. The personality of the characters are under developed so it was difficult to feel any emotion for their tragedies or triumphs. The scenes in which Godzilla is causing destruction are short lived and were not dramatic enough to leave a lasting impression. Overall a very lackluster movie.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Taking it back to its roots but with an unbelievable focus on the resilient human spirit. Incredibly well written with massive VFX & suspenseful battles. The sound editing emphasizes the emotional impact.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A modern day masterpiece! I do not often recommend movies but I would recommend this one! It was one of those movies where it can be described as “perfect” or even “near perfect”. The last movie that impacted me so strongly after I left was Infinity War by Marvel Studios… Godzilla Minus One puts Hollywood to shame!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Extraordinary. The building of characters in a Godzilla movie low key kinda sounds far fetched. But the character arks are absolutely flawless and you want every person to triumph. The Godzilla monster was absolutely stunning visually. Can’t recommend this roller coaster of emotions in a Godzilla movie enough. 
"Dec 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Other than the truly outstanding and perhaps unprecedented special effects, this is a VERY BAD film made by morons. Absolutely CRINGEWORTHY acting, script, story line. I've never seen more horrible actors in one film. Do not believe the hype. Think for yourselves. I seriously question the authenticity of the ENDLESS five star reviews all saying the same thing. I believe the entire Japanese cast and production team posted rave reviews for their own film with the help of Google translate. You've been warned. Proceed at your own risk. Prepare to cringe like never before. The film is a MESS. I left thinking, ""What did I just watch?"" I wanted to like it, but they all let me down. Kudos to the monster design and SFX brilliant team."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great movie.  Do not let the subtitles stop you from seeing this movie.  They do not get in the way at all.  This is by far the best Godzilla movie ever and isn't like the cheesie ones before this.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes, it is true, this is the first ever Godzilla movie I have ever seen, and oh my god, what a f***ing fantastic movie. I did not expect to love this movie at this level. This was honestly a spur of the moment movie for me. I'd seen everyone talking about this movie, the amazing ratings, so I booked a ticket, which I actually got for free, and man oh man this was so worth using my free ticket. Everything about this movie was amazing. From the very beginning of the movie I was just hooked. I had no idea what to expect throughout the entire movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I don't know if this story is another repeat of previous Godzilla films or not, but all I'm going to say is that the story is fantastic, so well written. The line delivery from the cast was amazing, those performances, top tier. The score, the cinematography, the visuals, all of them just top tier, especially for a movie about Godzilla. Overall this movie was amazing, I loved it, easily one of the best 2023 movies and I would easily nominate this movie for the Oscar of Best International Film, no question there."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw it tonight with my neice. I grew up on the old heisei godzillas, then ADORED the monsterverse made by legendary, and this movie is just a sublime mix of both (largely heisei). The use of the original godzilla themes was nostalgic but not cringey, and the terror I felt for the characters was great. A godzilla movie made me elated for its human characters. That's incredible!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked this take on this movie.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film!!!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST GODZILLA FILM EVER!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One, is a great addition to the Godzilla franchise a contrast to WB's Godzilla films. This is very reminiscent of the early Godzilla films. I would say the writing is phenomenal and beautifully written. The CG is a little lacking and Godzilla is a bit stiff but the story and acting are fantastic. I would say it is worth seeing if you are a fan of Godzilla or just a good story."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have two Godzilla Tattoo's, 4 Movie posters, 4 original set photos signed by the original cast, have over 20 Godzilla art pieces so I believe I have a good opinion when it comes to Godzilla films. This film is the best over the last 70 years. It is an absolute must see. Act 2 does get a little slow for my liking but the pacing allows you to like the characters even more. Usually I root for Godzilla this movie made me flip. Best human Characters in a Godzilla film. Which makes the ending that much more sweet.  Should be Awarded best foreign film."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is epic in so many ways. Godzilla looks amazing. The story is riveting. The soundtrack is awesome. Definitely see this on the big screen
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE TERROR. THE SORROW. THE DESTRUCTION. THE CRYING. Easily top 5 Godzilla movie, and honestly this probably tops my personal list. Bringing Godzilla back to basics, he’s the King of Monsters yes, but he’s the embodiment of pure chaos. Takashi Yamazaki brings the original Kaiju back to basics, at Godzillas core, it is the catalyst of destruction, it ruins peoples lives, the macabre of everyone’s fear, something unpredictable and uncontrollable. I love it. As much as Americans want to heroize the King of Monsters, at the end of the day Godzilla is a force of destructive nature that unapologetically reeks terror on the land. With that depiction of Godzilla done correctly like it is here, you’re not going to have anything less of a top tier Godzilla cinematic experience. What adds on to greatness of this film, is the powerful story. Yes this is yet another retelling of the origin, but the film grounds you with the people, you know they have survived a terrible event of biblical proportions, you feel for them, you feel their trauma. It shows the perseverance of man and your chosen family. This film even manages to squeeze in some laughs, in terms of range and tone, everything is perfectly balanced in my opinion. The actors are great in showing their trauma, love, and fear. Great cast all around. The cgi is stunning, they went with the modern Godzilla look but succeed in showing the battle damage he endures, the close up shots are mega detailed, the attention to detail for the in sea shots are amazing, but what takes the cake is the atomic breathe, in recent memory I can’t remember Godzilla’s beam being that damn disastrous. Along with an awesome soundtrack (and the euphoria of hearing Godzilla’s theme at THE MOST appropriate times) the cinematography is easily the best in any of the live action Godzilla movies (even better than GvK which is fantastic in it’s own right). If you’re a Godzilla fan, or even just a movie monster fan, you have no reason to check this movie out. It checks all the boxes and then some in terms of what makes Godzilla great. "

"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie completely 💩 one all of Hollywood’s blockbuster’s released this year. It’s big, intense, and exciting despite the 15 million budget while also being emotional with characters you care about. WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"BEST MOVIE of the YEAR!  WOW!  SO different.  Did not expect a serious and super realistic new take on the old Godzilla story.  Great cinematography!
And the depiction of the Japanese, recently defeated in WW2, seemed very true.  Best Godzilla movie ever.  And I had grown weary of them so did not expect this gem.  The almost unanimous 99% reviews, by movie critics and general audience, were surprising, but turned out well deserved.  
It has English Subtitles, so be prepared for some reading, no problem if you speak Japanese.   
Saw it 12.5.23, at 'lertn AMC.  
Givin it max  5 stars.
Might see it again.... and again."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie did a great job on showing the unity and heart of people coming together defend themselves in a common enemy. Godzilla is a villain that has no mercy in this film and you see how his destruction affects the people in his path. The ending of the film had me feeling emotional, excited, and thrilled. Overall the film was really great!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was amazing, the best Godzilla movie to date. The acting was amazing, and the story was great. It was great to hear Godzilla's theme music used to perfection it really helped highlight certain emotions in scenes. It's nice to see the Japanese still know how to make a great movie. Hollywood should take notes and stop putting out the same predictable, woke, garbage over and over. Godzilla 10/10."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever! Refreshing! Full of emotion.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Back to the classic formula only with a much more frightening G!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One takes the focus away from the giant monster, and shows us the value of human life. Having just the right amount of giant lizard, this film is a beautiful marriage of classic Godzilla horror with a new and refreshing take."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The story holds your attention the entire time! The action is compelling and the characters are both relatable and respectable in a way that is truly stunning you'll be actively rooting for them.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent, moving story with it without Godzilla.  But Godzilla himself is extremely impressive and genuinely frightening and awe inspiring."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It slowed some, but it was very good to watch, monster, war, drama, love story, revenge...a little of everything! Yes- close captioned works against typical theater, still a good movie, the idiots who give it 0 or 1 star--- Yet refuse to watch it until English dubbed are low IQ"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best iteration of Godzilla!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down amazing and breathtaking.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen this year what a great story with Godzilla sprinkled in
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was really enjoyable. A film in the spirit of the original. Characters you care about, not just CGI background. Good enough to see more than once!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This is hands down the best movie Ive seen all year. Best in a long time. The story and characters are so compelling. I was drawn in right away and loved the acting. So many great performances. It felt like an old classic at times. I was blown away. Really really well done!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,First timers be warned it’s a beautiful callback to the classics.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A great character-driven monster movie!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, felt like I was 12 years old on a Saturday afternoon."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great filmmaking and strong, committed cast.  It's Godzilla 1947 Japan, a period piece with AAA period detail thruout.  It's also Godzilla-noir; The main character struggles over and over with survivor guilt from WWII.  It's nothing like the more up-beat, Westernized Legendary Godzilla with the Monarch over-story.  Where the Monarch Godzilla is more dramatic and imaginative, Godzilla 1947 is more about honoring Godzilla as an artistic Japanese creation.  At the end, after Godzilla's takedown, all the sailors salute Godzilla.  

It's great filmmaking; the script took three years to write.  The inevitable Godzilla takedown is a collaborative effort of de-commissioned Japanese naval sailors, a voluntary group of citizens working against impossible odds.  (An even greater, positive, collaborative group effort can be seen in the great Chinese film, The Wandering Earth (Netflix).  The script took three years to write.  It's basically a non-ironic re-make of Godzilla (1954) re-imagined with better plot, better human characters and better VFX. 

It's too long (124 mins).  Cutting 20-25 minutes would have helped it do better at the box office.  It's also a Toho film 

Washington Post:  ""Top Gun Maverick and this Godzilla show us there's an audience for movies which combine concise and creative action with emotionally resonant human characters.""  Yes as in the best of the Legendary Monarch Godzillas, the balance also works here.

Film Stage:  ""It's willing to stay in the quiet anguish of several characters for uncomfortable lengths of time so the ultimate release is all the sweeter.""

Empire:  ""A refreshingly humanist and nostalgic reboot of the iconic monster franchise, Takashi Yamazaki's Godzilla Minus One takes the atomic lizard back to his post-war roots, while making the most of the director's background in animation and VFX direction through convincing, tactile and classic design work."""
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had such an amazing story, which had me crying at times! Godzilla was absolutely terrifying I think this might be the best one ever made!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything in this movie works perfectly. Takashi Yamasaki's cinematography is astonishing and memorizing. Kamiki Ryunosuke's acting is truly worthy of an Oscar as you can feel the intensity and emotion in his character. Godzilla is one of, if not the best antagonist in 2023 as Godzilla leaves no mercy for anyone. The only issue that I had was the fact that since it was made in Japan, the movie needed subtitles to translate it into English and the translations distracted me from being able to fully watch everything around the film. Overall though, it is a great film that has some of the best conflict and possibly the best third act ever."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"About as good as I think you can make a Godzilla movie.  Extremely Japanese, and my Japanese wife who's never seen a Godzilla movie in her life loved it.  I also loved it.  I don't think you have to understand Japanese culture or have seen past Godzilla movies to appreciate it, but it likely helps."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie.  subtitles didn't bother me at all.  really loved the character development.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unbelievable how great this movie is! Most of the time (looking at you, Hollywood), we could care less about the human characters in monster/Godzilla movies; however, ""Godzilla Minus One,"" gives us characters to root for and a monster that is truly scary and fearsome. I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say GO SEE IT IN A MOVIE THEATER NOW!!?"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie to date and of 2023!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't like this movie. I LOVED IT! Story lines have now improved in the Godzilla franchise. Shows you can have a Godzilla movie without Godzilla there all the time. Not for the ones who don't have an attention span.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very pleasant surprise for a monster movie indeed, from the fantastic acting to the special effects this is one of the best movies I've seen this year! The only down side to this movie is that the second half drags a bit but overall this movie delivers, a must go see in theaters for sure!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is the clearest example of how to make a beautiful film with a small budget. Could be a lock for the Visual Effects Oscar. The story is balanced, and the characters are real enough to root for. The simple film is straight forward and back to basics which is why it works overall. This is what great films look like."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whoa! How is a Godzilla movie this good?!? Incredible. Run don't walk, for sure. Theater experience of the year."
"Dec 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Went to the Imax to see it....very very good Godzilla movie. Excellent effects and a great human storyline to boot!
Better than so many other wannabee Godzilla movies!!!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece! With gripping characters and a terrifying Godzilla, all wrapped up in a powerful story about redemption, the sanctity of life and the triumph of the human spirit, Minus One is easily among the best entries in the franchise as well as the entire kaiju genre."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It was probably the best Godzilla movie ever made. It reminded me of being a kid in the 70s watching the old B&W Godzilla movies on Saturday afternoons.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked their use of the original music from the original 1st GODZILLA in 1954! Godzilla ended up being everything he was before but clearer & meaner! Well done, guys...didnt disappoint!👏👍💚"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Very human story. Not typical big monster schlock.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, so much emotion."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Please make more of these
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece is literally an understatement…. I've never been a huge fan of Godzilla but this movie absolutely changed my mind. I will be showing my children this movie when they get older. There was nothing they could've added or taken away to make this movie any better….. wow just wow.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"instant classic, right up there with the original 1954 masterpiece (love the ode to 1956 american version with the newscasters)  everything you want from a classic Godzilla film"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"One part Jurassic Park, one part Jaws, one part Oppenheimer, one part Dunkirk. This is an outstanding movie that will have you emotionally invested into it. The characters you are rooting for their success and well being. Godzilla is scary and a real threat in this movie. Music score if phenomenal, building tension and seriousness with the absent of music at times. Must see movie in the biggest theater with a good sound system."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect encapsulation of the allegory that is Godzilla. Nothing Legendary has done has made me care for the human characters. This movie made me care by making the human drama and the lessons hidden there in the focus of the film. In a time when too many movies are focusing on CGI over storytelling, this film is a standout masterpiece."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning and magnificent. A really great storyline that is entrancing,  which is more about post- WWII Japan than about Godzilla. I loved it!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla fans are eating good lately and I'm loving it
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year and best Godzilla to date
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cinema, really makes you appreciate the human characters and Godzilla is a side-plot but it all comes together and gives Godzilla his screen time where he shines."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie.  Simple but really good and emotional story.  Didn’t think I’d get that in a Godzilla movie but I really enjoyed it.  The right amount of Godzilla in the movie and he was the terrifying monster he’s supposed to be.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dark, Intense, Awesome."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Sound design and story are peak
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Es la mejor película de Godzilla que vi en años es la mejor asta superando la original
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is pretty good and the Godzilla in this one is scary.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Almost the best Godzilla movie after the original 1954 Gojira and about equal to 2016's Shin Gojira. Blows all the others away, including ALL of Legendary's 'Monsterverse' offerings!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I came out of the movie theater thinking WOW. This movie is the first Godzilla movie that has focused on the heart and the plot of the story instead of the action and special effects, I wouldn't change a thing about the plot. The movie also has a sense of redemption both for the characters and world war 2 Japanese culture. This movie is JAWS with Japanese soldiers. Even though the ending was slightly predictable and the C.G.I. of the Godzilla was a little sketchy at times, I was still impressed. This movie is very sad and intense. There were some scenes where my heart was pounding and my fingernails were digging into my legs. I think that this is a great movie; must see!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I was thoroughly impressed and moved by this movie and the acting. It leaves you with an emotional attachment to the characters which makes it so great. I won’t be surprised if it gets nominated for something big.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it would be a good movie, and then it was 10x better than what I anticipated! I really hope they make a sequel and I hope this goes to streaming soon so I can watch it over and over! Definitely a must watch, best film of 2023 by far!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película, se mantiene los aspectos oscuros y históricos de este gran personaje, la historia esta muy hecha sin dejar de lado la temática del terror que es ver a Godzilla....Buena película si se las recomiendo ver mas de 1 vez."
"Dec 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fellow movie goers, BEWARE. This redundant addition to the Godzilla franchise is one of the worst movies I've ever seen recommended by RT and I'm afraid there might be some kind of shady action here. I can't imagine anyone not insulted by this hot mess. Where I can see benefits from this movie is teaching aspiring film students what NOT to do. Let's start at the beginning. Unlike its cousin the surreal RODAN (1956), Yamazaki breaks the first rule of monster moviemaking by showing him in the opening scene. In the same scene, the hero gets a chance to fire a 40 mm gun at Big G, but doesn't. Why? After this 10-minute scene we get a lot of ""who cares"" screenwriting, trying desperately to bring human gravity to what is essentially an over-the-top thrill ride MONSTER MOVIE. Really? Seeing a movie like this makes one appreciate Spielberg's human touch in his classic ""Jaws."" All the scenes are too long, ploddingly paced and the screenwriting is cliche, boring and wildly predictable. The film looks like it's been blown up from 16 mm and the special effects still make Big G look like a guy in a rubber suit. Aside from names like Kurosawa and Ozu, maybe Japan should stick to building great cars and leave the monster genre to the young at heart."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best modern day Godzilla to date, reall hard to fathom that it had a $15 million budget. The story is very well done with historical context thrown in. They do a great job with making you emotionally invested In the characters, and obviously Godzilla. He's also the most powerful and ruthless Godzilla we've ever seen!!!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I heard really good things but I didn’t expect this movie to be so amazing! Great story and fantastic acting and directing!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made the VFX WAS AMAZING the shots at Godzilla in water amazing the human storyline amazing we need more Godzilla Toho films every 3-4 years I give it a rating 10/10
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I cannot give this movie enough praise. From beginning to end this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. It's a must see!!
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I took my wife, who is Thai, and my son to the movie and we loved it! My son loves kanji movies, whereas I have never been a huge fan of them in my life. My son is 9 years-old and I am 53 years-old. My only complaint of the movie is that it is slightly melodramatic in a few scenes. Nonetheless, we loved it. We saw it in IMAX, also, which I recommend."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best Godzilla movie. The focus on story and the horror of Godzilla rather than spectacle was a smart decision. For the first time in this franchise I truly experienced the terror of Godzilla.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was very close story of  first  GODZILLA movie.
I like it."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is most definitely one of the best movies of the year and in the godzilla franchise.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, loved it."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im not a movie, no at all critic, haha, but godzilla minus one is more than a godzilla movie. Also, it refreshed the original 1954 movie SO well, that personally not many movies now adays can remake a original like minus one did to the 1954 movie. im only 23 haha its a deeper meaning behind it. You can find some flaws, but what movie has no flaws? To me, this movie was everything good and right."
"Dec 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Possibly the scariest Godzilla monster, ever.  The human drama was compelling in the beginning but turned into a long painful slog toward by the end.  Seriously, Koichi's ham-handed ugly crying near the end made me want to puke, as did a couple of the act three plot twists.  The scenes with the monster though are pretty great, especially the attack on Tokyo.  It was *brilliant* to bring the original music back, that was a great touch.  One question though?  Why do they continue making Godzilla's head so small now?  He looks like a gym-bunny, all roided out.  Part of what makes G so scary, to me at least, is his intelligence.  Give the big lizard a more representative head size!"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen a lot of Godzilla movies since I was a kid from the bad to the horribly good to the great. This is a great popcorn movie with some very good Godzilla scenes in it. Some predictable parts but that comes with the territory. This is still a monster movie so what the audience is mainly salivating for is good CGI lots of good scary monster shots, lots of destruction and getting strong/decent human characters is just a plus so I think this movie checked all the boxes. 👍👍"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought it was great! Saw some CGI that wasn't quite right, but still good."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The most against I've ever been for a Godzilla. Shows how devastating this Godzilla is and scary he can be. Yamasaki's vision came together greatly.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Please make sure you see this movie. It will be a travesty if this movie doesn't have multiple Oscar nominations. Best Picture and Best Foreign Film, at a minimum. The Writing is exceptional, The Acting beyond professional, the special effects were exactly what this 70 year series needed. Take your teenagers to this movie and introduce them to the original (OG) Kaiju."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Refreshing Take on the Kaiju Genre

Unlike recent Hollywood Godzilla films, which often prioritize spectacle over substance, Godzilla Minus One takes a more grounded approach. The film is set in post-war Japan, a time of great hardship and uncertainty. Godzilla's arrival is not just a disaster, but also a symbol of the nation's trauma and resilience.

This focus on human drama elevates the film above your average monster movie. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and their struggles are genuinely affecting. We see the impact of Godzilla's destruction on their lives, both physically and emotionally."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first Godzilla that made me care about the humans more than the monster.  Added points for the WW2 tech accuracy, Takao, Yukikaze, Hibiki and J7W reveal :D"
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Just finished watching Godzilla Minus One.  This movie is so good that I felt compelled to sign up with Rotten tomatoes to provide a 5 stars rating reviews. A good story well told.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was amazing 100/10 so film is the greatest godzilla film on them planet better then the American films. godzilla minus one has amazing VFX and Cgi and it is truly a film to watch!!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Raw,Primal and Agonizingly Brilliant!"
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great take on the King of Monsters. Really explores the metaphorical love-hate relationship the Japanese have with Godzilla. The most touching and moving of the entire franchise. The setting in post -war Japan is spectacular and adds a special context to story. Great to see in original version as seen in Japan!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Saw this movie 2 times in a Regal RPX screen.  This is in my top favorites list of 2023.  Such a good movie.  Thank you Toho.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,So much more than a simple Godzilla movie. Ran me through the emotional roller coaster and I loved every minute of it.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this one. Best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. I've seen all of them. Full Japanese cast with subtitles, no English, but just emotive and expressive in their performances."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made. You will cry and you will be in awe of this movie. GO WATCH.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a glorious return of live-action Godzilla to the hands of actual Japanese filmmakers. This film is about so much more than Godzilla, using the aftermath of WWII as a powerful backdrop and exploring deeply personal and emotional moments with our small cast of characters. It's got the action and the beautiful, jaw-dropping destruction you'd expect from our kaiju friend, but it doesn't get so caught up in the fanfare that it loses touch. The CGI, while not quite seamless, is incredibly impressive given the film's tiny budget. Some of the acting and dialogue are a little over the top for my taste, but it's definitely a bit of a cultural thing. Overall, this is a great return or introduction to Godzilla for anyone who loves a great story, beautifully written characters, and a little monster mashing."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Godzilla movie, I haven't been to theaters in a while but this movie made me go back and it was worth it."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,What an amazing movie 💯
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the action and suspense and story line.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much like Shin Godzilla before it, Godzilla Minus One seeks a return to the solo-monster horror roots of the franchise. While Shin Godzilla served as a critique of a bureaucracy unable to respond adequately to crisis, Minus One aims for a more personal story of survivor's guilt and trauma, and pulls it off exceptionally well. 

Godzilla, being so large, steals the screen whenever it's around, and its mere presence is enough to cause catastrophic loss of life without it even intending such devastation. Once again a manifestation of the horror of atomic warfare, the creature is once again re-imagined, and doesn't suffer for having a lesser height than its American counterpart.

All in all, Godzilla Minus One elevates itself above being ""just"" a giant monster movie, and manages to craft a touching and dramatic personal story amidst a country struggling with its identity."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever 👍🏼👍🏼
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've loved Godzilla movies since I was a kid.  The recent US adaptations were entertaining but still lacked something that made the original 1954 movie so effective.  This movie captures the magic of the original and then some.  Behind the special effects and musical score is a great story and character development.  You begin to feel for the characters as they try to adjust to post-war life and deal with the appearance of a giant monster.  This makes Godzilla more ""scary"" because you see it from the perspective of the people.  It feels a bit more like a horror movie than the US monster-verse movies."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is a riveting and captivating film that redefines the boundaries of the classic monster genre. This cinematic masterpiece, directed by visionary filmmakers, seamlessly blends cutting-edge CGI with a compelling narrative, delivering an unforgettable experience for both die-hard fans and newcomers alike.

The movie sets a new standard for storytelling within the monster universe, skillfully crafting a storyline that delves deep into the emotional core of its characters while maintaining the awe-inspiring spectacle of colossal creatures battling it out on the big screen. The character development is exceptional, offering a poignant exploration of humanity's resilience in the face of unimaginable devastation.

One of the most striking aspects of ""Godzilla Minus One"" is its breathtaking visual effects. The meticulous attention to detail in bringing these legendary monsters to life is nothing short of astonishing. Every roar, every thunderous footstep, and every destructive clash between titans feels incredibly realistic, immersing the audience into the heart of the action.

Moreover, the film's musical score deserves immense praise for enhancing the overall atmosphere and intensifying the emotional impact of each scene. The soundtrack perfectly complements the on-screen spectacle, creating a symphony of epic proportions that resonates long after the credits roll.

In addition to its technical brilliance, ""Godzilla Minus One"" successfully balances adrenaline-pumping action sequences with moments of genuine depth and introspection. It explores themes of sacrifice, bravery, and the indomitable human spirit, making it a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant cinematic journey.

Overall, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is a tour de force in the realm of monster movies, setting a new benchmark for the genre. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and powerful performances, this film is an absolute must-watch that will leave audiences exhilarated and moved in equal measure."
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a good old Godzilla film by Toho. Solid acting and solid action.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Sleeper!!! Awesome period maybe the best Godzilla movie ever!!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"You absolutely NEED to see this movie it was absolutely the best thing I've watched in the last 5 years, the action sequences are spectacular and the soundtrack is truly goodly YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE THIS MOOVIE"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Really great blend of classic Godzilla action and a human story.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The move is just incredible. From the visual effects to the music to the human story, it is just……….Beautiful"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolutely fantastic, breathtaking and emotional film."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,As a Godzilla Fan since the 90s this is pure gold Godzilla is a Menace from Start to finish. Human element was the best over EVER SEEN. You actually gave a damn especially with it begin post world war 2 you see everything and I couldn't be happier for THE REBIRTH OF THE KING OF THE MONSTERS GODZILLA
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Enjoyable, exciting and a very good human story as well!!!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One thoroughly defied my expectations. Every single scene feels weighty and impactful (not just the ones that feature the titular monster destroying Tokyo). 

I never once found myself impatiently wishing for the real action to begin, because the movie actually gave me reasons to be invested in the characters. It's an excellently crafted experience. The themes permeate all throughout the storytelling, the characters are relatable and well written, Godzilla is terrifying, the performances can be heart-wrenching, and it is just incredibly evident that the director, Takashi Yamazaki, had a real vision for this movie. Anyone that worked on this film absolutely deserves to be proud of their work.

It's great and I'm eagerly awaiting whatever Takashi Yamazaki does next."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie in a long time. Not just a masterpiece monster movie, but a great story and characters. Go see it now and on IMAX if you can!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film as far as story. Truly a great film by TOHO and can't wait for the next film in this series.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the Godzilla franchise ever since the first Godzilla movie came out. This film was phenomenal and deserved all five stars. A must see movie before 2024
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Toho once again shows us how a truly substantial and beautifully written and compelling movie in Kaiju cinema can be! Takashi Yamazaki clearly shows dedication and excellent film direction with his characters and plot, which are both easy to follow. Godzilla, in over 7 years since Shin Godzilla, has once again showed brutality and a dark atmosphere to the original Godzilla film. While the characters and the overall tie to the original film is clearly showing, I do wish that a certain character had a bit different character arc. I also wished for a little bit more destruction to Japan, nonetheless, Minus 1 is a must watch for any new or old Gojira fan!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie, it feels so refreshing not to see agendas, politics and Wokeness, just a pure human story with an amazing horror element in form of THE BEST GODZILLA the world has ever seen."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, Great film! If you can support this type of movie!

Fist of all im not a 'Godzilla/Monster' fan, i remeber watching the campy 'man in a suit' smashing modles as a kid and never really got in to it. More recent big budget movies like Kong/Godzilla didnt do much to spark my intrest. However this one is well done and with a reported budget of 15million it makes just about all the recent movie budget seem completely unreasonable!"
"Dec 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Look it's fine, not great. For me I don't think I could pick up on the metaphors or essence of some cultural aspects"
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the movie but not enough of GODZILLA and it was too easy to kill him. I was happy to see more ocean battles, but not enough land battles.  But in all the best TOHO MOVIE yet."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only an excellent monster movie, also just a very good movie. Look, pictures, the music and how it is used. Great movie!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wife and I saw Godzilla Minus One the first weekend and totally recommend it. It really is the best Godzilla film ever made, from a human and dramatic standpoint.

The film is not really about the monster, it's about the people struggling to survive in post-war Japan. There are heartbreaking moments that don't have anything to do with Godzilla.

The monster isn't in most of the film, but when it appears, good god. The effects are amazing. This isn't a guy in a rubber suit kicking toy cars around. There are some moments when Godzilla is attacking warships that just took my breath away.  And this film was made for $15M?  It raises the question, how did Hollywood lose the ability to make compelling films on a budget?

It had some nice touches, like the US allowing Japan to re-arm some of their ships to deal with the menace, and post-war tension between the US and the Soviets comes in to play.  It's not a monster movie, it's more like, what if Godzilla happened in the real world, at the tail end of World War II?

There's a heartbreaking moment, where a former Admiral addresses a room full of emotionally scarred combat vets, trying to raise enough volunteers to fight the monster.  These people are all emotional wrecks, completely exhausted, defeated, and for many, with their families destroyed, but somehow have to pull themselves together to meet this new challenge.  It's a very compelling scene and would work in a variety of genres, not just monster films.

It's just a really good film. Like Scorsese had done a monster film.  Go see it!

My understanding is that there will be a competing Godzilla film released next year, and there's some kind of contractual thing where they both can't be in theaters at the same time.  So end of December 2023 Godzilla Minus One has to leave theaters.

The real tragedy is that this film is popular, and theaters could really use the business."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The best film I've seen this year by far!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was incredibly well-balanced. The action is captivating, the emotional journey of the protagonist is engaging and relatable, and the effects (although wonky at moments) are absolutely stunning."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I give it 4 & half only because Godzilla didnt have as much screen time as I wanted, but thats just me loving the monster. Its a good touching drama story plus the action scenes, totally worth it! And the ending, WOW! No regrets and it wont be for you either! Im glad I saw it on the big screen. Thank you again Godzilla creators!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a good movie--but not great.  Upfront I am not a huge Godzilla fan but this was very well done.  It has subtitles and while I typically HATE subtitles they actually improve this movie and it would been worse if it had been done in English.

Unlike the other Godzilla movies I have seen in the past, they made the characters compelling (something their competitors the Marvels, New Hunger Games, and Wish failed to do).  

I have pity for the failed and flawed male lead (definitely not a Mary Sue).  My heart went out to the female lead as well.  Both of them have compelling character arcs.  Their goals and life choices are logically consistent with how they were presented by the director.  Moreover the director presented traditional Japanese culture in a thoughtful way without unnecessary negative commentary. 

This is a Godzilla movie so do not expect to see accuracy in science; this is meant to be fun not technically accurate.  If you demand technical accuracy this is not the movie for you. 

In sum this is a fun and novel twist on an old tale that did not need to ""Current Day"" the story.

Well worth your time."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect, a work of art if you ask me."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This move was so good if you can watch it in IMAX you will not regret it
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was well made. Even though watched the movie in Japanese with subtitles, the main theme and story was easy to follow. Many plot setups had good pay off at the end. The monster was shown as scary and had real consequences for that world. The special effects were good. WW2 backdrop for the movie made in more interesting where the weaponry was limited. Overall must watch."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I still can't believe what a magnificent film this is — it's the first time in 50 years that I loved the characters and wanted them to defeat Godzilla, who is truly terrifying. I was rooting for them all, and actually cried twice! Themes of anti-war, loss, self-forgiveness, family — and a country joining together for a cause they believe in — all of that is here, plus a spectacular monster! We all cheered and applauded at the end. Thank you Takashi Yamazaki and the wonderful cast."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was great.  Although Godzilla only had a few moments in the movie overall, his presence was felt in every scene.  The attention was set mainly on the human cast, and you end up building a connection to the actors, and begin wanting them to be okay.  It probably the first Godzilla movie where I enjoyed the human story as much as the monster story."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie captures the spirit of the Japanese original and is the best Kajui movie in decades.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was movie was not what I was expecting. They managed to make a Godzilla movie, and give it a heart wrenching story dealing with a lot of heavy themes. This is the best Godzilla movie ever made. Best movie aside from Oppenheimer so far."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The underlying story was fantastic, with Godzilla thrown in :) Was well done all around, got the right amount of Titan scenes and a very well put together post WWII story."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incrível, por mais que eu ame o Legendary Gojira, esse filme foi uma obra prima !!!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie I have seen since I watch the original (staring Raymond Burr) with my dad back when I was in my single digits.  That they made this a story with a human protagonist on the hero's journey, with the monster Godzilla driving the action, was refreshing, brillant."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into this thinking it was going to be like those old B Godzilla movies with the bad dubbing. I hadn't watched any trailers or read any reviews. And WOW. This was not at all what I expected. It was a roller coaster ride from start to finish. I only wish it had been in 3D because Godzilla was big, realistic and terrifying! One of the best movies I have seen all year."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Expectations were met as a fan of monster movies. Loved the setting and character development. I'm personally not much for subtitles however worth it. Atomic breath was incredible!! Recommend seeing it in theaters for sure!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been watching Godzilla (and things like Ultraman) since I was a kid. I think I saw my first Godzilla film on Bob Wilkin's ""Creature Features"" on Channel 2 out of San Francisco. I know I saw Godzilla vs the Smog Monster (Hedorah) in a drive through theater which probably was around late 1972 as it took a while to get to the U.S.

Anyway, I can say this is, hands down, the BEST Godzilla film. However, a caveat to that is what makes it so good is BECAUSE it is a reboot. This is how you 'reboot' a film. You take the essence of the original story(ies) and repurpose it. This wasn't a blatant nostalgia-est like the last 3 crap Star Wars films. This was them using the tropes perfectly. The scientist with the weird hair, the hardened old soldier, the stern military guy (with no neck) and on and on. It was perfect.

I like to say the people my age have Star Wars music in our DNA. Well listening to the music shows I have Kaiju in the blood as well. The music was almost a character itself. Plus, there is so much I can say about this but won't for space reason. I will say this is one of the few Godzilla films I've ever seen where the human story is just as good as watching Godzilla do his thing.  AND THERE WAS NO ANNOYING KID SIDEKICK!  Thank the Maker.

Go see this film right now!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen all the Godzilla movies, I have watched the recent ones with avid fascination of the overly explosive and cheesy plotlines and soaked in every monster fight, rooting for Godzilla, mourning for Mothra…Godzilla Minus One made me almost hate Godzilla! This movie was heart wrenching and humane, barely breathing in some parts. The budget of this movie was 15 million dollars and it's worth is well over that.The best Godzilla movie I have ever seen, something that will not be surpassed. Rooting for the unseen is what makes a director, the absolute best. I will see anything he puts out from now on."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Mwa perfection🥇10/10 W
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's difficult for me to explain how much raw joy this movie made me feel. It's been a long time since a Godzilla film made me care about the people it followed. Shin Godzilla had the perfect approach where it was less about individuals and more about how a government would handle a kaiju situation, while Godzilla Minus One focuses hard on a small group of people, it also makes you want to stay with that group.

The movie has a perfect blend of classic Godzilla, terrifying in its raw power and primal motivations, while also showing you a tale of redemption, honor, grief, and love.

If you've ignored most Godzilla's thinking, they were campy schlock (I'm looking at you 2014, 2019, 2021) you wouldn't be wrong but please do not pass on Godzilla Minus One!

*This movie does not treat the audience like idiots, nor does it have the feeling of smirking at its intelligence, truly perfect."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,THE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best made and handsome productions in the Toho franchise of Godzilla.
The story centered more on one man and his experience s of being in WW2. Godzilla was the catalyst for the film.
On a modest budget the film did capture the grandiose feel of  a larger film, but it's the limited use of Godzilla himself that achieved this effect. 
And while exceptional in it's use, it didn't have the over all scale of a Hollywood production. Maybe that's better, maybe that's worst. It's kind of how scifi fans compare the difference in the Star Wars franchise and  the Star Trek franchise.
Less is more, more or less."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing! The best Godzilla movie since the first one!!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Film’s character development and monster appearances hit every single beat that not only recall the classic Godzilla films but also remind us the human element behind the shock and awe. Godzilla fans should rejoice!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movie in years. You actually care about the human characters.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,An incredible 70th Anniversary for Godzilla.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can we just let TOHO do all Godzilla movies from now on? Because (Shocker) they seem to understand how to do a Godzilla movie more than what Hollywood has been attempting to do for more than 30 years. For the first time in a long time, I'm actually caring for the human characters in a Godzilla movie."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one truly captures not only the nuclear aftermath of WWII but also the determination of the Japanese people/culture. Japan suffered a devastating loss and the fight against a force of nature such as Godzilla creates another war (also with nuclear repercussions) for the nation. The character connections felt genuine and even though Godzilla only had about 40% of the screen time, it created an atmosphere of fear but also a stage for the human cast to shine. Best film of 2023, well done Toho"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic Godzilla movie that connects you with the human characters. It has intense and emotional scenes, making it a great Kaiju film. Godzilla's action scenes were at a whole other level, especially considering the 15 million dollar budget. I would definitely watch this film multiple times."""
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I would have laughed a few times if I wasn’t already crying throughout the whole entire movie…
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie in the last 40 years without question and it is not even close. Godzilla Minus One is one of those films that just makes you appreciate storytelling and stays far away from all the political nonsense that is being forced by movie studios today. Godzilla Minus One is an instant classic as director Yamazaki knew the assignment and delivered BIG TIME bringing back the Kaiju King aka Godzilla. This is the Godzilla you've been waiting for and it was spectacularly done on a small budget.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 movie this was really good and cinematic
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had all but given up on monster movies until I saw Godzilla Minus One! Godzilla Minus One brought back my passion for monster movies and has proven one thing, no one does it better than the Japanese when it comes to Godzilla, their true creation! This is an absolute must see and it is an instant classic. In my opinion, one of the best monster movies ever made and one of the best Godzilla movies ever made.  This movie truly pays homage to the original Godzilla movies!
The story-line was very well crafted and tied very nicely together to fit the general story of Godzilla.  The characters were very well developed. All the emotion, suspense and thrill you would expect to see in a film like this were there. 
If you are one of those people that has lost your zest for monster movies, and you are looking for the magic that the classic Godzilla movies of old had, then Godzilla Minus One will definitely bring you back from the depths of the Sea of Japan to love Godzilla movies all over again!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla: Minus One 
9.75/10
Because it was later, I was tired and felt like falling asleep before the movie started. But Godzilla from the movie woke me up! The rest was history. The Japanese will always make Godzilla's attacks feel personal. Godzilla represents America to Japan."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful story
Epic action
Epic score"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie is Worth The Hype and then some. No Politics, No Woke Agendas, Just Straight Story and Action."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was Epic! It was sensational! It was exactly what Godzilla should be like.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"the acting, the sound, the scope, all breathtaking. see this on the biggest screen you can!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far the best movie of the entire franchise, better yet I strongly believe is the movie of the year, great story, characters, effects and our King Godzilla is just phenomenal 100/100"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely more than just a Godzilla movie, had a deeper story intertwined with it."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a departure from other Godzilla movies.  Very surprising.  Great character development.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movie in 2023. You could feel the massive destruction Godzilla did with great sound and visual effect!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best modern Godzilla film.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"After almost 70 years, Toho studios show that they still have great, compelling stories to tell in their Godzilla series. Godzilla Minus One was a fantastic film that recalls the big G's origins from the 1954 film, an anti-war parable of a creature mutated by nuclear radiation. The story is well filmed, terrifically acted, it has great cinematography, a rousing score, and impressive special effects. For a film that was made for about 15 million, it looks significantly more expensive. While the bulk of the film focuses on the story and human characters, this aspect is so well done and keeps you engaged, so that when Godzilla actually shows up, it has greater impact. What you get is an emotional, compelling, thrilling story about regret, survivor's guilt, PTSD, redemption, and what it means to be a family. Not only is this one of the best Godzilla films ever made, it's also one of the best films of the year. Godzilla Minus One is a stunning achievement."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,totally enjoyed the movie besides having to read sub titles the whole time.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"You really have to admire the attention to detail. From the original tanks, never mind if only two units ever saw the light of day, to the fighter planes, again, only two were made, to the original destroyer(the only survivor of its line & given to Taiwan) and the heavy cruiser(in real life, ignobly sunk as a target ship by the Brits)."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This isn't the standard Godzilla film with which we are familiar. All the hype is legit. Anyone can enjoy this film, it transcends what it is. Enjoy it on a big screen while you can."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Old School perfection, even shed a tear or two, a human story, but with the King, with a blast never to be forgotten, Tokyo will never be the same or will you after seeing this movie 5++++ Oscar material no joke"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, I *might* gave preferred a taaad more Godzilla screen time.
    Maybe not though, it's possible that in this case less is more, and the time spent on character development was more helpful than more screen time for G.
   My sensibilities may be skewed from too much ""Hollywood"" CGI Godzilla action overload- 
Sure did like the ""guy in the suit"" vibe on this one more than the straight-up CGI vibe tho.
   Also-hat's off for Toho making this for 10% of the typical crappy Hollywood versions👍
  Really didn't mind the subtitles, either.
Might need to go again, this time in Imax instead of the ""projection on the sidewalls"" theater, that gimmick didn't do much for me, at least on this movie. Might be better on a space opera sci-fi film."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the reason alone I started a RT account and what was missing from Oppenheimer, primal fear in the face of nuclear power. This film recaptured the missing elements of previous Godzilla films that inspire both fear and awe. The incredible storytelling of guilt, passion, and redemption was done by incredible actors. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the intense action and drama. This is a film worthy to return and share at home."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is AMAZING! From beginning to end. The best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Much more than I expected!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Possibly one of the best movies I’ve seen! Easily top 3. The character development, the emotional impact, even Godzilla, who wasn’t really the main storyline IMO! But  the story telling. Magnificent!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It's shocking that I had so much emotion invested in a creature feature.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,A practically flawless film in every way.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year for me. You feel actual attachment to the characters and it's the first time I've been absolutely terrified of Godzilla in a film
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece that holds your attention the entire 2 hours. Great story overall and the sound design for Godzilla is out of this world. Obsessed.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Twas’ nice to see the amazing advancement of Godzilla films and the touching human aspect especially in this movie. Outstanding and highly recommended to Godzilla lovers. Best in IMAX.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The story was a lot more emotional than I expected. I loved all the characters and was definitely invested in them. Hope the director makes a sequel!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie. Godzilla is King
This movie kicks ass"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I've ever seen and possibly THE best Godzilla film out there. Every aspect of this movie delivers: the acting, writing, camerawork, use of lighting, sound, and lack of sound - ALL of it comes together to create an incredible film that anyone can enjoy. Godzilla fans are rewarded with the use of - as well as the subversion of - tropes that are staple to the franchise. Familiarity with the series isn't needed to appreciate this film, but it can certainly enrich it. Every second of screen time is used to its fullest, the human story is compelling and evocative, and the balance of tension, dread, and relief are expertly handled. I have never before experienced a film monster or creature that so effectively instilled a sense of fear and visceral threat. Godzilla appears as every bit the metaphor he was originally intended to be, enriching the human narrative while encapsulating the totality and indiscriminate, animal nature of atomic warfare. The original creative team would have been so proud and so honored by this work. An excellent addition to a 70 year old franchise. And when that iconic theme finally drops? Chills. Whether you've seen all the films or none at all, do yourself a favor and see this one."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is so much more than a monster movie. At it's core lies tragedy and loss on a nuclear level in a post war torn Japan. If you find yourself rooting for the humans it's perfectly okay. Godzilla minus one is a perfect way to celebrate 70 years of Toho/Japan and of course Godzilla.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best of them all.  Often the human story in the movies is the weakest part.  That is not the case here.  10/10.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Really really really really really good movie
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal. This is the Godzilla film I’ve wanted to see my whole life. I suggest seeing it on the biggest screen  possible. I saw it in IMAX at the Metreon in SF, and the visuals and sound knocked my socks off. This felt like a passion project. The acting was sensational, characters you care about, and the pacing perfect. And you see so much of Godzilla. I’ve never seen destruction of this scale portrayed so beautifully. You can see it all, up close, with nothing spared. I was floored by the execution. I stand firm that this is the best Godzilla film ever made. The bar is now set and I can’t recommend it enough. 5 stars"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fantastic movie all around. Seeing Godzilla and being actually scared of him is something you don't see anymore. There's a scene in this where 4 men are in a small boat when Godzilla shows up. It reminded me of a scene from Jaws. The sound effects blew me away and it has such a great score. I cannot believe this movie only cost 15 million dollars! Go see it.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautifully written and directed film.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Harkens back to the original!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome! I can't wait to buy the Ultra 4K Blu-Ray Disc!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the BEST Godzilla movie I have seen as an adult.  I expected a good to great movie, but this movie is just awesome.  They deliver what you want from Godzilla intertwined with a story with characters you actually care about in an epic drama spanning a period of years.  Please make sequels, but don't rush them and meet the bar you've set with this one!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Crazy. Great story to go with it and Godzilla goes insane
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Story! Best Movie of the year!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow such a good film! I enjoyed every single second of this film. I got so emotional so many times. I was able to held back my tears but the final scene caught me off guard and I was just...yeah my tears were running. One big thing I love about the film is that it doesn't feel like Godzilla was CGI at all. I heard that it was CGI but it looks so good that it makes me believed that it wasn't lol. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, highly recommended this film.

I went to watch the film a second time. I love it so much. I took my sister with me and she said she really enjoyed the film. I really love this film, it was emotional and the characters were interesting to me as well. This movie makes everything seems so right because I've seen other Godzilla films and this was one of the best of all time among all those films. Go watch it! Let's support this film together!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"After seeing the early reviews, I had to go see Godzilla Minus one.  INCREDIBLE movie,  great with great effects, but at the end of the day it was all about the story and the characters!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Magnificent!  Hearing the classic Ifukube themes was a real thrill.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of the Year, hands down! Possibly best Godzilla ever. Character development is top notch. Unbelievable they made this with only $15 million."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"FANTASTIC! Saw in 4DX with friends and we had a blast with this one. An actual good script with really endearing characters you actually root for, an intense story in a crazy setting... and of course Godzilla himself is just SCARY. 

If you don't see this in the theaters you will MISS OUT. It was meant for the big screen.

10/10 Better than any Hollywood trash I've seen in years(except Oppenheimer)"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Huge Godzilla fan…and for years. Movie was outstanding. Loved the story, especially the ending. Will see it many times."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The all time best Godzilla film. Phenomenal acting, outstanding writing, sensational effects. A top 100 movie."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great plot, great visuals, great Godzilla film!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent film that finds the humanity within the monsters!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been watching Godzilla since I was a kid. I think this is the best Godzilla by far. I can't say enough good things. Great plot, great effects, enjoyable characters and a good view for the historically illiterate I to post WW2 Japan. 
Did USA nuke tests create this monster?
Yamazaki Does a great job without pointing a bloody finger 
Se it."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved the story of this film. Much better than the other modern Godzilla films
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even thou it was in Japanese w subtitles, the movie was 
Awesome!! Best true to original Godzilla to date. With a heartwarming storyline"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It's such a great movie.  Stayed true to the old movies just enough to have fun.  The two hours flew by.  So glad I seen it in a theater.  I highly recommend this one.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest Godzilla movies to date. A treat to watch from start to finish.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so dope, probably going to go see it again in theaters before I cant."
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Besides the dead eyes of the monster this creature looked far better than the American version the oddity is that the Mat Brodrick version cost of 200 million more yet lacked everything. This was entertaining for what it was at just 16 million just wow.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"a masterpiece Godzilla movie, brilliant"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie really does a great job of portraying how the original Godzilla movies were while tying it in with modern effects and top tier storytelling. I thought Godzilla 2014 was really good, but this one blows it out of the water."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was legit awesome recommend to all Godzilla lover. Hollywood take notes please
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the best movie I’ve seen all year. A very interesting concept of a kamikaze pilot who did not fulfill his mission is Post WWII Japan.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"9/10.  92/100. |
Surprised the shit out of me. The story especially. I didn't think a Godzilla movie could have this good of a story and characters. Especially considering the main character is a Kamikazi Pilot. Yet here we are. 
And don't get me started on that SCORE. The OG SCORE! It hits so hard at the theater during 2 distinct moments, and I'm still feeling the joy from it.


Sort of a weird theater experience too, but only in the sense that before this, my father and I also watched ""Silent Night"". So we watch 2 movies at the theater where either little to no talking/English is spoken.


I know some people ain't gonna like it, but I hope this eventual ""trilogy"" or ""franchise"" is put into a deal with the Monster Verse. This Godzilla or Gojira will be an awesome addition to that universe and for Kong and Godzilla to go up against."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic. The best Godzilla movie I've ever seen.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must see for the big screen for new and returning fans of the franchise. This movie encapsulates fear in the face of insurmountable odds and the faint glimmer of hope in the darkest times. For the first time, Godzilla is finally portrayed as terrifying. I am not usually a proponent of seeing new films in theaters, but you're sorely missing out if you let this movie run without seeing it once. Having Godzilla's roar echo through your chest is absolute perfection."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!  The best Godzilla movie I have seen to date!  It felt authentic if that makes sense.  I loved the story lines and the special effects had a natural feel to them.  It's just a great film to watch.
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good human story with some fun Godzilla action
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One just embarrassed Hollywood!

It would be a tragedy if you didnt watch it because you think you need to be a Godzilla fan to enjoy it.

Im happy to say that this was not only a fantastic Godzilla movie, but also an absurdly good movie just in general. One of the best Ive ever seen.

I never thought I would see a Godzilla movie with this good of a story and, believe it or not, actually really good human characters that you will actually enjoy as much as Godzilla.

The story was emotional, hit on really good themes and even had some great funny parts without being overly jokey like Marvel is now.

And THEN you add Godzilla. Holy crap!! He has never looked this good or been this angry! And there is a LOT of him too!!

And Japan did this for only 15 MILLION dollars!!

Absolutely puts Hollywood to shame!!

And for my Catholic friends, did I mention it promotes good values and is completely clean, except for maybe a couple minor curses?

As a Godzilla fan since I was a kid, I couldn't be happier. I didn't think a Godzilla movie this good on so many levels was possible.

Easily the best movie of 2023 and the best Godzilla ever by a LOT!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,A fresh emotional entry to the Godzilla universe!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite Godzilla movies of all time. An excellent human plot to go along with an incredible Godzilla movie.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I am not one who runs out to see Godzilla movies but I will tell everyone to run out and see this one! Easily one of the best movies of the year! It's a must see with a great story and Godzilla is out to destroy without a care in the world. If you can see it on the biggest screen possible
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and special effects!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this film. greatest story around Godzilla ever made!! first time I was rooting for the humans.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Old school Godzilla feel! Best human plot combined with one of the best Godszillas!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A monster movie where you actually care and feel for the human characters. That alone deserves an award, but Godzilla Minus One doesn't stop there. Incredible destruction scenes, captivating narrative, stunning visuals, emotional moments and everything you could ask for from a Godzilla film, all within a budget of 15 million that makes Hollywood look like a money laundering scheme.

Not just the best Godzilla film to date, this may be one of my favorite films of all time. I'd give it six stars, but I'd have to... Minus One."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"very emotional. great graphics. the human part didn't take away from how awesome godzilla is. 
one of the best movies I've seen and by far one of the best godzilla movies."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"good gorilla movie, if yourbfan you'll love it."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The absolute best retelling ever🤟🤟
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,💘Godzilla Minus one 10/10 AMAZING Godzilla Birthday happy 70th 💘
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you were yearning for a good old-fashioned Kaiju movie without political correctness and wokeness this is one.
The audio SFX is great or I should say just right; not overmodulated or overcompressed for the most part. VFX was great too.
The storyline had something for everyone. It was fun and enjoyable."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute must see! This is one of those movies you leave the theater totally blown away
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely recommend if you're a Godzilla fan!  Awesome movie!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Every single thing that made the original 1954 film great, from the beautifully written characters with interesting back story, 
to the intense drama, and yes awesome monster destruction, is ALL perfectly captured here. I once said that Shin Godzilla was the greatest Godzilla film since the original. I think its just been dethroned."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved this film ! Top notch writing and directing ! Godzilla is back !!!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Amazing!!! Nostalgia at its finest ! I will be going again !!!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2023. The sequel to Oppenheimer we all needed.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies I have ever seen. One of the best movies I’ve seen! This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing performances, great effects, and strong acting from well developed characters. oh yeah, and a big and mean Godzilla."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film has it all!  If I read it correctly, the budget was $15 million??? If so it was well spent.  It’s kind of funny when you see studios spend over $200 million and the cgi looks worse.  Great film and has heart!!!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"What can I say about this masterpiece of kaiju cinema? I was left speechless when the credits rolled, hell even after. This film has everything a monster movie lover needs and then some. In addition to the truly horrifying presentation of Godzilla and the destruction he wreaks, there is a very human story that tugs at the heart and captures all kinds of emotions amazingly. Hope, despair, love, fear, an astounding amount of emotion can be found here and the actors display them excellently. The original soundtrack is also an unexpected treat. While the movie makes use of the classic Ifukube theme, much of the movie makes use of original compositions by Naoki Sato. These inspire such vivid feelings of helplessness, an overwhelming power hellbent on the destruction of whatever stands in its way. And on the other hand, tracks like Resolution raise you up, filling you with hope as the characters are determined to fight and beat this godly force. The effects are amazing as well, giving us one of the best looking Godzilla movies to date. While returning to his more classic look as opposed to the charred visage of Shingoji, this Minusgoji is still one of the most terrifying incarnations of the lizard with piercing eyes and tremendously physical performances of strength. All together, this isn't just a perfect Godzilla film. It's also one of the best films of the entire year. Another win for Goji."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best film I’ve seen in a minute. Definitely recommend to see in theaters. Cannot wait for the second one. Fingers crossed.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Instant classic, near-perfect movie. Must watch."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie since the original. I knew the special effects would blow me away but I had no idea the story would be so strong. The dialogue was wonderful, the acting terrific, this movie should be nominated for an Oscar as best picture of the year. You could take this story about a coward's redemption, with it's war is not glorious undertones, eliminate Godzilla altogether and have a tremendous film left. It's a Godzilla film but it's also a human story about life and how precious it is."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story and cinematography!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was incredible that all I need to say
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This. This is the monster we all know. Would give 10/5 if I could.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla ever! Best special effects (without using CGI). Good balance between story and action. Loved that the action took place in the day time.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the action, didn't mind the subtitles. It was definitely worth seeing."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This is NOT a monster movie!!!  It's a story about redemption that happens to have a monster in it :)  Great movie and I loved seeing them recreate some scenes from the original Godzilla along with some of the original theme song!!!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's just incredible from start to finish. Story, acting, Godzilla & all the action. What an amazing latest installment to a 70 year old franchise. If I could give it 6 stars, I would."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down best Godzilla in a long time. I never usually get invested in the characters but this one did it so well. Must see!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was incredible, all the feels of the classic Godzilla with new technology. The story was absolutely beautiful and I walked out satisfied and longing for more."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece, and is very Impressive for it's low budget. If you are a Godzilla fan, this is a must see. The movie take during/around world war 2, and is supposed to be like the original. The story is great, the human characters are built well, the movie looks amazing, and it might make you cry a little in some scenes. The best part of this movie is probably Godzilla, he not only feels like a god but also is a true monster like in the first movie. America is only mentioned in this film and never appears on screen, but it makes the whole plot of the movie much better. Overall, this is a just about perfect movie, and a dream come true for many Godzilla fans."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,A loving tribute to the original movie.  Well done.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"' This is a Spoiler Free review '  How good was this movie?  Ask yourself, when is the last time you went to a theater and at the end of the movie the audience broke out into applause?  The pacing was excellent. In a remarkably short time frame they did so much character development.  Every main character was well rooted and extremely believable.  You couldn't help but feel their joys and sorrows throughout the movie.  The action sequences were perfectly timed, well organized, never dragged out for the sake of some cheap gratuitous violence or shock.  It all fit together so well, I can't think of a single point where the movie dragged.  The setup and payoff were so well done and so satisfying.  Partway in my friend was looking at his phone, I was kinda like wft!  After the movie I found out it was because of his watch.  It monitors his heart rate and it posted an alert basically asking him if he was ok because his heart rate was so high.  Yea, the movie was that kind of edge of your seat exciting.  This was clearly patterned after the original 1954 Gojira original.  And no offense intended to the award winning cinematic masterpiece that the original was, but I think this might have been better than even that.  Go See This!!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Many scenes played homage to the orginals films. The model/toy trains and tanks, were perfect. Thank you, ToHo!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Best Years of Our Lives meets Jaws meets Top Gun meets Godzilla. It was absolutely wonderful. Heart, soul, and monster stomping action."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie,  better than the American versions. Classic!!!!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,just watch it he big lizard :3
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute must see movie. An engaging post war recovery story mixed with a giant monster flick. Characters were very well written to the point you dread any time Godzilla shows up as his presence will inevitably place them in jeopardy. I've never been frightened during a Kaiju movie before but the sense of menace this one inspires is truly awe inspiring. Don't let this leave theaters without seeing it.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. This is a true Godzilla movie. Captures the essence of the first Godzilla movies from the 50’s. Godzilla was what he’s supposed to be…TERRIFYING!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story is compelling, the computer graphics are superior to a man in a suit.    I believe that it is the perfect prequal for an existing 70-year series.  It made me cry. 

I think that it is Foreign Movie of the Year."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally a Godzilla movie with GOOD CHARACTERS. It's a must watch if you're interested in this genre. And for a low budget film, it blows my mind with what they were able to do. Great character archs, please go see."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is hands down the best Godzilla movie and my personal favorite. I wouldn't go as to far to say this is the best movie ever made, but 10/10 as far as Godzilla movies go. This is an absolute must watch for anyone, not just Godzilla fans. The only small nitpick I could even say is there are some scenes where the animation feels a bit stiff.  I can understand majority of people not wanting to sit through a subtitled movie, but if you are one of those people, please just give it a chance."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can’t say I’ve ever really been a fan of Godzilla, but my god has that changed! This is everything a Godzilla movie should be. From the writing, acting, special effects, character development, the score, it’s all perfect. The sound design is so immersive and awesome you feel like you’re right there with the main characters. I was mesmerized throughout the whole film not only with the incredible action sequences and godzillas awesome heat ray, but with the characters we get to spend time with in between. Both honestly equally riveting. I didn’t want anyone to die! Even the random patrons in the background. And that’s because our main characters are so fleshed out they make you feel and really sit with the fact that Japan just finished WW2 and now they have a giant monster terrorizing their country and you just can’t imagine what that’s like. But they’re all willing to fight and sacrifice for their families and a better future for Japan. It was awesome. Highly recommend. The first time we see the heat ray Godzilla has, WOW!! One of the coolest things I’ve ever seen on film. "
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watching this piece of extraordinary Japanese filmmaking is the closest I've gotten to the spine tingling delight I received when as a young boy I first saw the original ‘50s Godzilla film on TV. But unlike the Americanized, Raymond Burr-ized genesis of the franchise, this astounding film draws you in with deep emotions delving into the tragedy that was post-war Japan in the immediate aftermath of WWII. The characters really matter - for the first time in a Kaiju movie - and make you care about how to defeat the ‘nuclearized' Big Bad, which in this case is the scariest Godzilla ever witnessed onscreen. Icing on the cake are the music nods to the original, especially the excitement of the march-like musical accompaniment to the creative, 1940's-era efforts to put a stop to the seemingly unstoppable creature at the end. Bravo!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie! You know its a great movie, when it makes you love the characters."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the storyline, this was a sophisticated exploration of postwar Japans state of mind after World War II. Godzilla was a commonality of experience, and the movie explores the call to action each must answer. Im a history student, so the story was very important to follow, even if Im a kaiju fan."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Took my whole family and we all enjoyed it! 11/10! Always, and forever! Long live the King!"
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever.  Brilliant.
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies in recent memory
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good. An excellent balance between the kaiju mayhem and destruction we expect from a Godzilla movie and human drama and characters we care about. Would not be surprised if this joins people's top ten movies of the year, or at the very least, top three Godzilla movies. I know it has made both lists for me. See it in theaters if you have the chance to. You won't regret it."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not expect this movie to be excellent. The story telling and characters were well written. I will go see it again, it's that good."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzilla he is poggers
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute must-see, even if you're not a Godzilla fan. As a Godzilla fan however, you're absolutely going to love this. Feels very reminiscent of the original movie."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The Best Godzilla movie period!
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding! Far exceeding my expectations. The writing, directing, cinematography, sound, were top shelf. Story does matter. Well done! Ultra screen with Dolby Atmos will not disappoint."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing. I saw it in 4dx which I HIGHLY recommend. Great story and graphics. This, in my opinion, is the best in the franchise. 10000/10"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,A masterpiece with or without the monster. I could not believe the level of greatness I was witnessing and will see it several times over.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,If Steven Spielberg made a Godzilla movie…. Godzilla is intense and the movie has soul. Even teared up at the end 🥹
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best movie in the history of the franchise.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,a blockbuster masterpiece.  The best Christmas gift ever. thank you godzilla!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I love watching this movie.  Best Godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a Godzilla fan 10/10 go see this movie.  If you are not a Godzilla fan 10/10 go see this movie, seriously.  Godzilla Minus 1 is an a well made film that honors the original 1956 release.  Similar to the original, the movie is about human characters dealing with the insanity of a giant monster attacking and laying waste to their homeland.  In Minus 1 they are real people you can connect with which shows quality writing considering it takes place in 1940's defeated Japan.  This is what sets it apart from the recent Hollywood Godzilla releases where the humans detract from the film every second they are on the screen.  Minus 1 in contrast has real people experiencing extreme conditions following the war.  The pain Shikishima deals with connects with the the audience.  He is a flawed man dealing with losing everything it is hard not to feel for him.  Yes this is a monster movie and the humans are adding to the overall film.  The monster scenes are shot well the special effects are well done.  Sound and music score are excellent as well.  See this in a good theater with a good sound system.  
The only caveat is for some people it is in Japanese, and with subtitles.  Even so give it a chance, after a while you don't even realize you are reading them as you get engrossed in the film.  Considering the lack of quality films in the theaters lately, this one stands out.  Is it perfect?  No, I would never say that.  But it sure is worth your time and money to go see it."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far the best Godzilla movie I've experienced. A real story with characters you care about and terrific special effects. Closest comparison to me was, Jaws. Recommend you see it in a theater to enjoy the full experience."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've seen in theaters in YEARS. I was fully invested in the human story and blown away by the scenes with Godzilla. Hands down, this is now my favorite Godzilla movie to date. The musical score was spot on as well. You could hear a pin drop during the quiet moments of the film, and it was a fully packed theater. 10 out of 10."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie since the very first IMHO.  This movie was made for the price of a single A lister's pay for a single movie in Hollywood and is easily 10x better.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It is absolutely a Blockbuster movie! Shows the pain and suffering and death of people at the hands of Godzilla! Everything for me was absolutely perfect. I watch Godzilla in 1962 with King Kong and I loved it then. This is a can't miss movie thoroughly enjoyed it and it was absolutely spectacular
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Movie I've ever seen let alone the best Godzilla movie. At times Godzilla looked stiff and other times he moved too fast and those are my only two gripes about the movie. The characters are amazing defiantly a more story driven movie than any other Godzilla movie, If you like horror, giant monster action, interesting charters and the original Godzilla 1954 movie you'll love this movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I have seen in years. Great film.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm 68 and watching Godzilla movies for my entire life.  This is certainly my new favorite.  I will see it again in the theaters.  Excellent!!!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie- the human driven parts were sometimes the best parts and even after spoiling it for myself in advance the movie made me tear up anyways. Disclaimer to parents: while the movie should be appropriate for teens and up (there are heavy themes of loss) one of the trailers affixed to this film is dirty.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It's the best Godzilla movie I've seen so far for both the special effecst and the human story surrounding it
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely incredible! Not just great as a godzilla movie but an amazing just in general! The compelling post war story, the emotion the characters potray and make you feel. The conflict they portray both internal and physical.  You are engaged and invested the whole time. It is by far my favorite godzilla film to date and my favorite design for the kaiju. I hope there is more to come and it remains at this caliber."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just a Kaiju movie. The characters are all very compelling. Amazing special effects. And such a beautiful homage to Ishiro Honda's original vision. Best movie I've seen in a long, long time."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, just wow!! What a great Godzilla flick the best one I’ve seen. Perfect mixture of drama, action, and mushiness. Loved it!!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best Godzilla movie ever, brings the malice of Godzilla, showing the humanity of post-war Japan struggling with the destruction from the Americans, and the desolation of the war-torn regions.  Hopefully this can spawn a new sequel, and it doesn't even need any other Titans, this Godzilla is the only thing the world needs"
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not worth watching. Few good scenes, bad actors, no plot at all. Maybe good for the fans of the classic godzilla but not good for all the others"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Now, that is one hell of a good movie! I thought I was going in to watch just another Kaiju movie in an endless slew of monster movies. But no! They had to make it a tear-jerker story. How dare they pull a fast one on me? I felt something genuine for the main character's plight and those immediately around him."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Simply in the top 3 movies of the year. Here’s why: Godzilla isn’t the hero but the bad guy and you route for the characters. Said characters have depth passion and the courage to make the hardest choices.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the story was really compelling with the kamikaze pilot not being able to do his duty during the war and attempting redemption. All of the characters were very likable. Plus, I’ve always been a Godzilla fan and it was great to see a Japanese version again. My husband would have preferred if it were dubbed but it didn’t matter to me. It was easy to follow the text. "
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Dramatic. Plenty of action. Great Story Telling. What more could you want? 10/10!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action from the very beginning.  Interesting, never bored.  Can't wait for next movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was very good, I love the background music, It sounds like an orchestra, the drama was good,"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so AMAZING! Watching Godzilla chase the humans on the boat was intense. the focus on humanity, between the lead and his ghosts of regret, the natural relationship with his roommate and adopted child, the metaphors of the war, ptsd, building back only to be brought down, the classic score mixed with modern score was near perfection!  Watching this made me feel like a kid playing with my toys back in the day, but now as an adult I can see the horror that comes with the devastation. Several times I watched in awe at what Godzilla can do and the devastation he causes to citizens. I didn't like the short arms or the way he walked on land but I understood this is classic toho Godzilla. And though the cgi on land during sunny daylight was noticeable, it can't be faulted with such a low budget. It excelled at night and in the water. Overall, this movie was beautifully done!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" stands out as an exceptional addition to the Godzilla franchise, earning a resounding 9/10 in my assessment. Shikishima's performance as a kamikaze pilot adds depth to the film, showcasing his versatility in portraying a range of emotions. The connection between Shikishima and Noriko adds a human touch to the storyline.

The film introduces Godzilla in a compelling way, with a notable power-up that sets the stage for an intense narrative. Scenes of destruction, including a powerful event in Ginza, deliver the expected Godzilla spectacle. Tachibana's role, transitioning from an Odo Island survivor to Shikishima's ally, adds an intriguing layer to the plot.

""Godzilla Minus One"" skillfully plays with audience expectations, maintaining viewer engagement in the characters' journeys. The supporting cast, including Noba, the captain, and the kid, significantly contributes to the overall narrative.

What distinguishes this Godzilla installment is its meticulous attention to character development and exploration of post-war themes. Shikishima's internal struggle and the film's exploration of life after war elevate it beyond typical monster movie fare. The music scoring, featuring both original compositions and nostalgic Ifukube moments, enhances the emotional resonance of the story.

The climax, involving a daring plan to confront Godzilla, is executed with precision. The film's creativity shines through in the use of unique elements during the battle.

In conclusion, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is a standout Godzilla film that combines monster mayhem with thought-provoking character arcs. The hints at the end leave room for future narratives. Without diving into specifics, I strongly recommend this movie as the best Godzilla experience I've encountered. It's truly an amazing cinematic journey that both Godzilla enthusiasts and general audiences should not miss.

Spoilers and here's my spoiler review!!!


""Godzilla Minus One"" is an absolute triumph, earning a solid 9/10 in my book. Shikishima's portrayal as the conflicted kamikaze pilot adds depth to the film, showcasing his range in expressing emotions from fear to triumph. The dynamic between him and Noriko is compelling, adding a human touch to the Godzilla narrative.

The power-up of Godzilla, with menacing dorsal spines and the imminent threat of his devastating beam, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The destruction of Ginza and the subsequent scenes, including the powerful explosion, deliver the expected Godzilla spectacle. Tachibana's evolution from a survivor on Odo Island to Shikishima's reluctant ally adds an intriguing layer to the storyline.

The film cleverly toys with our expectations, especially regarding Tachibana's escape pod, keeping the audience engaged in the characters' fates. The supporting cast, including Noba, the captain, and the kid, contribute significantly to the overall narrative.

What sets this Godzilla installment apart is the meticulous attention to character development and the exploration of post-war trauma. Shikishima's internal struggle, combined with the poignant themes of choosing to live after the horrors of war, elevates the film beyond typical monster movie fare. The music scoring, featuring both original compositions and nostalgic Ifukube moments, enhances the emotional resonance of the story.

The climax, involving a daring plan to sink Godzilla and the subsequent showdown, is executed with precision. The use of freon bubbles and CO2 balloons adds a unique twist to the battle, showcasing the creativity in the film's storytelling.

The finale delivers an unexpected emotional punch, challenging our perceptions of sacrifice and survival. The salute as Godzilla's body disintegrates is a powerful visual moment, reinforcing the themes of the film.

In the end, ""Godzilla Minus One"" stands out as a standout Godzilla film, blending monster mayhem with thought-provoking character arcs. The flash of Godzilla sinking, starting to regenerate, hints at the potential for future narratives. This movie not only pays homage to the iconic franchise but also pushes its boundaries, making it a must-watch for both Godzilla enthusiasts and those seeking a deeper cinematic experience."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Possibly the best Godzilla film ever. Very well written and acted.
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have already seen this movie three times in two weeks. I have seen Godzilla movies throughout my entire life. This is by far the best Godzilla I have ever seen. It actually has a story behind it. Heck I even cried in a Godzilla movie that never happened to me. I have to tell you if you haven’t seen it please go and tell your friends. This movie needs more word of mouth as it is simply one of the best movies of the year and should be recognized as not just a Godzilla movie, but a great movie. I’ll urge you to see it before it. Heads back to Japan. It will not be stream able so go see it in the theaters I promise you won’t be disappointed."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story was great, and the graphics were excellent!!  - Movie is a must see !! 4DX Theatre recommended."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Chilling & Thrilling! The Movie had me on the edge of my seat every time Godzilla showed up on Screen and The Story was very compelling. Definitely something to check out if you're a BIG Godzilla Fan & if you haven't seen a Japanese Godzilla Film this is also a perfect place to start! Highly Recommend! 👍
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"When we talk about the historical presence of Godzilla, we talk about his beginnings. This movie is full of intense suspense and emotional dialogue. From great visual's to immense sound, Godzilla Minus One is a true gem among all Godzilla and Kaiju movies. What you need to know is that this doesn't just base Godzilla in a world war 2 time period, it's the restart of his new era. This movie is so good, with characters you can enjoy to follow along and feel for. Something most Godzilla movies don't have. Then you got Godzilla himself, a mean, nasty and scary force of nature, that's out for blood and terrorizes the country of Japan alone. See it if you can, you won't be disappointed."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked all the action on the movie
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even without the Godzilla scenes, the human drama was good.
This film made me cheer for the human side, which I rarely do in a Godzilla film. It's primarily because of how well-written the human characters are, and made me care for them and their struggles.
Every time Godzilla appears, he is very threatening, and the cinematography makes him scary from a human perspective."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was a masterpiece. The way the music of Godzilla was perfect. The story line of the humans was perfect unlike the new movies.The way Godzilla was introduced in the start of the movie was so good, the way he's introduced as a big scary monster was so good wanted to jump out my seat!Overall you won't regret watching this masterclass of a movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Best Godzilla Movie in All Time, A Must-See!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is ""I may or may not have teared up in a couple of scenes"" good . Tackling themes of PTSD, found family, redemption and Japan coming to terms with losing WW2, it's one of the best films of the year. 🦎 I'm so happy I watched it at the cinema."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was absolutely phenomenal, especially in IMAX format!  So much action and heart!  Proof that a well developed story and a monster action can co-exist!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,i absolutly loved this movie! seeing godzilla gave me chills with these dead eyes he had. the characters and story were well made and i enjoyed watching them interact and develop. the visuals were stunning and on paar with the legendary movies. deffenetly worth watching
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen every Gojira Movie many times over.  I've seen every monster movie produced in Japan.  This is by far the best one ever made, by far. Good Character development, great story going back to it's roots.  I had to watch this in every way possible, imax, 4Dbox, and XD AMAZING!!!"
"Dec 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worthy of a watch, but not worthy of the hype. At times the plot survived on coincidence and the decision-making of the characters was questionable. In the final chapter of the movie, there was a complete indescribable lack of urgency that only existed to help drive the plot. The acting was, well, acting. The CGI was really impressive. While weak at times, the general story kept my interest. If anything, this is a lesson for Hollywood in how to make a decent movie without spending the GDP of a small country."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is a masterpiece. This film is a towering achievement in tokasatsu cinema. For fans of Kaiju films (Japanese monster movies) this film tops the list of must-see cinema. For those who are not monster movie fans, this film has such a heartfelt, moving plot, that you will not be bored when Godzilla isn't on screen. This film has the best characters I've seen in a monster movie since the original godzilla film ""Gojira"" of 1954.

Like other great films, this movie bends genres a little bit. This film is a monster movie, but it's also a family drama, a tale of surviving war. This movie bends several genres of film into one, emotional story that makes the human characters incredibly engaging, and Godzilla seem down right evil. In many Godzilla films, we find ourselves rooting for Godzilla. Not this time... In this film, there comes a moment where it becomes clear that Godzilla has to be stopped. There is a point where Godzilla's malevolence is so clearly a threat to our characters, that you actively root for his defeat.

Please go see this film in Japanese with English subtitles. I saw this film yesterday and I plan to see it again before the week is through. 10/10 Greatest monster movie ever made."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 Best movie of 2023!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic! I would highly recommend it as an entry point for newcomers to Godzilla. A real emotional story that truly shows the devastating impact Godzilla has on the lives of humans beyond buildings being destroyed. This is an excellent disaster film on top of being a giant monster movie.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far the best Godzilla film I've ever seen and it's not even close. The only thing that could have made this film any better, if it was in English. Even with the subtitles, the movie was easy to follow. This is the Gold Standard of how Monster movies should be made."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Movie I've seen since 2020.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has it all. Great action sequences, Characters you care about, a emotional story, and freaking GODZILLA as his best. Best Godzilla movie hands down."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see if you're a Godzilla fan! Easily the best since the original.

 Remain Blessed and be updated, don't make the same mistake as I did."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal film. Maybe the best Godzilla ever.  The Ginza sequence is amazing. Great characters you actually care about. Great storytelling.  Badass finale.  Score was excellent too.  I'll be watching this multiple times in theaters
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been a Godzilla fan since I was eight years old. This is the greatest Godzilla movie I've ever seen (And I've seen them all). Hollywood better take notice because this movie puts all of the bloated 200 Million Dollar Hollywood Godzilla movies to shame. It goes without saying Godzilla Minus One delivers on the Special Effects and Creature Carnage levels but it was a refreshing surprise that it also had such a compelling story, great characters and amazing actor performances. Looking forward to future Toho Godzilla sequels. Do yourself a favor and see this one in the theater! Enjoy!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an incredible achievement - they made me care about a Godzilla movie. Great characters, fantastic acting, and surprisingly good cgi totally won me over."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This was incredible. Godzilla is a true monster in this. Not friendly and not ambivalent. He hates everything and I love it. I want to experience this movie over and over.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Full of action with a nice story line!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Once again Toho has shown us how Godzilla was meant to be! I have nothing but amazing words for this movie and I already can't wait to both go see it again next week and for a hopeful sequel!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie in decades. The visuals were done well on a mere $15 million budget from Toho. Instead of portraying Earth's savior like in the American versions, Godzilla goes back to his roots as a terrifying menace for the citizens of Japan. What really separates this movie from all other kaiju films is the human storyline. Instead of dealing with science fictional topics such as aliens or creating a basic story with forgettable characters, Godzilla Minus One gives us characters with solid backgrounds and throughout the movie you build an emotional connection with almost every one of them. They also tackle very difficult subjects to talk openly about in society,such as PTSD, survivor's guilt and depression. Overall Godzilla Minus One is a mixture of the original 1954 film with a tone and character arc similar to Jaws, while also mixing in tidbits of Jurassic Park. All bias towards the Godzilla films we grew up watching put to the side, this could very well be the greatest kaiju movie of all time."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Refreshing. Some plain good cinema
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla film, because it has a good solid believable plot and characters with depth.  Godzilla is terrifying, but serves as the catalyst for the Koichi Shikishima confronting his own war trauma and guilt and cowardice, leading to his redemption."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"(See on biggest scene!)To be clear I have not seen every Godzilla nor foreign film. This is not only my favorite Godzilla movie I've seen but this is my favorite foreign film I've seen. It action packed, it felt genuinely terrifying at points, and the drama between the human characters is incredibly well written to the point where I got misty eyed multiple times. Go see this movie in IMAX, the sound alone is worth seeing it on the biggest scene possible."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, it made me care about the characters, and Godzilla was actually almost scary. There was great tension. Must see movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a surprisingly emotional movie, and the focus is on recovering from the war. Time is spent exploring the motives of the characters and it even has a surprise ending. I thought it an excellent movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, such an amazing movie.  The Director did a fantastic job.  How they did so much with such a low budget - puts many of the latest marvel movies to shame.  A great mix of drama, a love story and then the mahem that Godzilla brings.  One of the scariest Godzilla movies out there."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"No Spoilers!

My favorite Godzilla Film by far! To be fair I haven't yet seen Shin Godzilla, but I'm extra motivated to now. 

Minus One hits on so many levels and really brings back the magic of the film medium. 

The alternate history (Post WWII) setting in Japan is very much real and alive in the story and you are immediately pulled into the struggles of the recently defeated Empire, with their own unique cultural and material hardships as experienced through the fantastic cast of compelling characters. There are multiple moments where I had realizations that I'm not used to seeing these stories on film the post WWII Japan stories and struggles. 

This movie is heartfelt and thematically rich. 

And the monster....truly a monster and a ""Force of nature"" is a good way to describe him. They did re-shoot some of the scenes of the first film, but also added some new tricks and fresh ideas with innovative moments. I especially like that some of the movement of Godzilla seemed to be an homage to the original suit movement and it totally worked. At other times he does move in a much more menacing and agile way. He's fierce. 

The score worked amazingly and whereas I'm usually like a corpse watching movies...I actually had some reactions to scenes with this one because it was super easy to react in concern or celebration for the characters. 

This thing is epic and gripping and I haven't ruled out a second viewing this coming weekend."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only reason I gave a 4.5/5 rather than a 5/5 is the occasional over-the-top Japanese acting made me laugh during serious moments throughout the movie. Other than that slight detail this is hands down one of the best, if not THE best Godzilla movies I've ever seen."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"real characters, real emotions... and monsters!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best films I've seen all year. The story touches your heart while the action elevates it. Expertly balanced with humor, the film also avoids 99% of the pitfalls, shortcuts, assumptions, and story holes that sink most films of this genre. And that atomic breath ... oh my!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw it in Japan and was blown away. I don't understand why Toho didn't market Minus One as a remake of the original film, which it is. They've updated the metaphor and it really works. This is at center a human drama with Godzilla there to represent war and regret and guilt and it really works."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Out of the 21 Godzilla films I have seen, this is the best one. A problem with most Godzilla films is that all their human story’s suck! Even some newer American ones. But this one’s human story is great! I’m glad Toho waited until they could really do CGI great because it paid off! Over all it is a great movie and I’d recommend this movie to everyone it’s just that great. I saw it at my local B&B and I’m going to see it again at IMAX"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great I would go to my grandparents house as a kid and would watch the original movies. To see it done with modern technology this movie is very awesome. You definitely cant get this one confused with the other Godzilla movies that out now it stand on it own legs and Im all here for it
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I have seen in a long time!  Such compelling historical and national narrative, great character development, fascinating creativity, and excellent action scenes.  I had forgotten that movies can move you this much.  Must see!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"My goodness. One of the best films I've seen in a while. Even apart from the Godzilla part, the story and character progression was so captivating. Then the Godzilla part of it was awesome. His atomic breath hit like never before…it was just awesome. I'm actually going to use this movie to incentive my son by telling him, ""If you read more then you will read faster. And when you read faster, you can watch Godzilla Minus One."""
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,A WWII movie meets Godzilla. Dark and gritty and exciting. Great characters. One of the best movies of the year. I was totally blown away.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie deserves Oscars. The whole film is not following Hollywood' s formula, yet still amazingly well made. A must see film for 2023!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Never have I seen a Godzilla movie have such a well written and heart wrenching human story element. Usually when you watch these movies your expecting the humans to be the most boring part but for once the humans are the ones that carry this film. This movie had heavy themes and shocking moments that recreate the impact that the original 1954 movie brought when it first released. This is the original Godzilla from 1954 brought to the modern age.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie for sure
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing. The story and character development are top notch. Godzilla is just the icing on the cake. Highly recommend.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Was great!! Definitely worth my $. Whole family had great time.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome going back to its roots of Godzilla and how powerfull he is every godzilla fan shold see this
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the most beautifully written movies ever made, it's a masterpiece, and is the best monster movie of all time. As an American I can confidently say we don't know wtf we're doing and we can't write movies obviously."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. Best movie of 2023!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow!!! Godzilla minus one Blue BooM!!
☄️🔥😍💯🦖"
"Dec 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good cinema, but in original it's a Japaniese, and I don't think about it when bought tickets in cinema =)"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of, if not the best films of 2023. Do yourself a favour. Watch it. Go to a cinema and watch it."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far if not the greatest Godzilla film of all time. It's basically what a movie needs to be, it isn't needlessly 'woke' like Disney's recent films have been. It's emotional, it's frightening, and it reminds us that Godzilla is indeed the king of the monsters. Fantastic film! Definitely Oscar-worthy."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie i have ever seen.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect Godzilla movie. The big guy is terrifying and destructive - a true monster. And the film has a moving human story at its heart. Worth the trip to the cinema.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal movie. Has a great human story and the Godzilla scene were A+!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Instant classic from the birthplace of Godzilla!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"More than just a monster flick, this film has you caring for the human characters and leaves you awestruck during the fantastically crafted Godzilla scenes."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie Was Amazing! For A 15 Million Dollar Budget, Toho For Sure Deserves A Pat On The Back! I Didn't Mind The Movie Being In Japanese, And Godzilla's Design Was Great! The Humans Backstories Were Quite Cool, And It Went Pretty Deep. Overall Rating, 4 Out Of 5, Spectacular!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Most of the poor reviews Are complaining  about having to read subtiles . Do people not understand this is a Japanese film not an American one? As an American i found it to be the best action movie ive seen in years. Minus 1 Godzilla is a terrifying force, the storyline is engaging and the the characters have substance.  Godzilla minus 1 is a fantastisk homoge to the original its too bad the people giving it low scores Are not intelligent enough to realize its originally made in JAPAN and its a Wonder they can type since apperently they cant read ."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Superb story from start to finish.  Best movie of the year.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely incredible. Fully lived up to expectations.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie ! the story and special effects great. Only 15mil to make it wow
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla Movie I've seen by far for a budget of 15milli. They do really good job with the storytelling and actually care about the humans in the movie.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a fun Godzilla film.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the Godzilla movie that I've wanted to see with a somber tone reminiscent of the 54 movie. The music, cinematography and story kept me engrossed in the film. I rarely do to the movies to see a movie twice but this is the exception. I couldn't recommend it higher."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,the best Godzilla movie 🎥🎥🎥🎥🍿 I have ever seen.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,If a sequel can be this well written and maybe a bigger budget then I'll be there
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"There’s so much old school Godzilla movie making here. Made me think I was watching an old Japanese monster film. I enjoyed the story, characters, and the big fella himself. He’s not altruistic Godzilla, he’s a human stomping, ship sinking, building dropping, feared king of monsters. Fun!!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! Just wow! This is the Godzilla movie I've been waiting for. Don't get me wrong, I've loved the latest string of American made Godzilla/ Kong movies. But this movie had it all. A great story, a Godzilla to rival the old school Godzillas, and the sounds and music that I've been waiting for. Just amazing. I'd say this is a must see movie!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Rootin' -  Tootin'.  Must See.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome. I hope they are upgrading and rebooting the franchise
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Different take on a classic. Ground level human experience to the unstoppable devastation that is Godzilla. Emotional & frightening- a great thrill ride!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! I don't even know how to describe it! We were s engaged from beginning to end. A perfect night at the cinema!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie definitely deserves the praise. Memorable characters, simple yet engaging plot, great setting, pacing. Plus Godzilla is in it!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,English subtitles did not detract from the movie. It was great ! Took my grandson and gave it a thumbs up!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"after watching this, I completely forgot about the other past 3-4 Hollywood Godzilla movies they've released in the past 10yrs. they set the bar sp high with this movie with only 15mil budget! I think I'm going to re watch this and also buy the 4kBD once it comes out"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great message great story telling.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One was awesome! I have to say it has become one of my favorite Godzilla movies! This is coming from a guy who has seen every Godzilla multiple times.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"In the canon of kaiju films, this ranks right at the top! Not just of Godzilla films, but a really good movie period. The writing, acting, directing, effects, cinematography and soundtrack are all top notch!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Best storyline
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was entertaining, and it's GODZILLA! It's meant to be a bit silly. Solid story about the effects of WW2 on Japan from a personal viewpoint."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie was awesome. Gojira rocks. I love that they show him as a younger Gojira. Best picture of 2023. The only thing I thought was lame was the little girls crying. it sounded more like a newborn baby, not a three year old.  it was pretty cool to actually see him eat people."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie. Not just a great Godzilla movie, a great movie. Great plot, character development, cinematography, and (in the rather over the top Japanese style), acting. Godzilla in some ways is a secondary actor in his own movie. It's the people you care about."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible! All-around great Godzilla movie-absolutely one of the best ever!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Better people section than other Godzilla movies & an excellent companion for Godzilla's parts to Shin Godzilla.  Worth a visit to the theatre and to purchase special editions that release.
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A sequel to Shin Godzilla, this was not. The acting was not great most of the time, with but a few actors doing a decent job. The characters could have been pretty good, but their arcs never paid off in a way I felt satisfied by. Godzilla was not around in much, and I know thats often the case in these movies. However, the REALLY good entries do a great job of keeping Godzilla present in your mind, and as a source of tension while he isnt on screen. SPOILERS: Godzilla was too fast and nimble. Godzilla was surprisingly small for some reason (maybe to make it more believable that hed be so fast and nimble?). The movie was too long with too many scenes with characters I didnt find very compelling. The child probably could have been erased from the script, to cut some fat off the runtime AND make the character motivations a bit stronger. SPOILER END
I heard in a director interview that the goal was to make the scariest Godzilla yet, but I was underwhelmed by the design choices for the creature. And if they were trying to make the movie itself the scariest yet, I wish more inspiration had been taken from Shin Godzillas visual style. 
The best part of the movie was definitely the music. I just wish it hadnt been wasted on this film as it did most of the heavy lifting. I understand its a very Japanese film, made for Japan. So I hope Japanese audiences enjoyed it, and I hope the true fans of the Godzilla franchise got something they wanted out of this one, but I was disappointed the whole way through."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome movie. love the action and human story.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a fantastic movie. One the best story driven Godzilla movies ever made in my humble opinion. Amazing effects even for a Godzilla movie. It is a period piece that takes place in post WW2 Japan. This is where some disconnect happens with American audiences. I am of Japanese decent and my parents experienced post WW2 Japan. There were many heart felt scenes that demonstrated suffering with Japanese cultural sensibilities that struck a chord with me that left others around me in the audience audibly snickering. If you lack empathy for those suffering with PTSD and survivors guilt in other cultures that are not your own, then this movie is NOT for you. Because it is the primary motivation of the main character throughout this movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. There was definitely a few key mistakes in storytelling but man they definitely set the standard for monster movies
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One was amazing! Amazing special effects (especially considering the budget), great writing (this is a monster movie with an actually engaging and well-written plot), great music, etc.
This is a wonderful example of what monster movies should be like!
Best Godzilla movie I've seen!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie, but the acting was laughable.  The best actor in the entire movie was a toss up between Godzilla and the Akkiko the baby.  Everyone else was terrible.  Good plot, good effects, and a nice throwback to the original Godzilla movies I grew up watching in the 1970’s"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, set in post WW2 Japan with characters you really care about. Add fantastic sound design and awesome effects, along with classic Japanese style and you have a winner. 10/10 would go see again."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Without question, the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen!! With only a 15 million dollars budget, Hollywood should be ashamed!!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Hollywood might want to shelf it's upcoming Godzilla movies. Japan just proved that the genre belongs to them. Outstanding!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"What Maverick is to Top Gun, Godzilla Minus One is to the original Godzilla lore."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline and twist in plot
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One - One of the best movies I've seen this year. Did not think this movie would hit me in the feels like this. Very well directed movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen every Godzilla movie and this is the absolute best, and may possibly be the best movie I've see all year. It's the only Godzilla movie that ever made me cry, and the only Godzilla movie to ever terrify my adult daughter. Even my non-Godzilla fan wife commented on how good it was."
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With Monarch and Godzilla x Kong, what's the point of this they could've at least created an English dub just like how we make Spanish dubs."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is absolutely the best shot, written, and also has the best VFX of any monster movie ever. Got chills every time Godzilla was on screen, but the human characters… my GOD the human characters. Such a beautiful story between them that got me tearing up and hoping the best for all of them. Truly a ground breaking film and o r of the best of the year."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla is back. The movie captures the devastation in Japan after World War 2. Then portrays Godzilla as an unstoppable terror wreaking havoc on a recovering land. The characters and acting are top notch.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever! This is what Godzilla is truly meant to be, a force of nature killing everything in its way. Very good movie!!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Makes you forget everything they did to Korea and china.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely one of the greatest movies to ever come out recently, with the insanely small for a godzilla movie budget of just 15 million, the team makes sure to use every last penny wisely, the effects are stellar, the story is amazing, the performances are near perfect, and many other things
Godzilla Minus One is a must see for godzilla fans that aren't expecting the drivel that Warner shoves down our throats"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was fucking Insane, Far more better than Legendary Godzilla"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best. Godzilla. Movie. Ever. 10/10 stars. Spectacular special effects. Terrific soundtrack. And, get this, an actual story. Well written. Well acted. Just amazing. I will be going to see it again, this time in IMAX, next weekend."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a MUST SEE!!!!! Whether you are a Godzilla fan or not this movie was incredible from start to finish. Another incredible movie is 'Shin Godzilla'(2016) if you are looking to scratch the itch after seeing this masterpiece 🔥💯
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"A really good take on the classic kaiju! Good characters and drama and action. Wish it had more of the big G himself, but over, it was a nice film."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely astonishing. Beautifully written and shot with tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Might be the best movie I have seen this year.  I hope it gets nominated for best foreign film
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the badass and awesome and very disturbing 
I love this pure nightmare B-Movie Kaiju Godzilla"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Definition of a Godzilla movie 10/10
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome Godzilla movie!! Go out and see this in theaters!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One - Just INCREDIBLE...not only a great Godzilla movie but a damn fine movie overall. Solid character development, emotional story, and special effects are superb to the point where you're not seeing CG but a great and believable movie. The realism in the Godzilla ocean scenes is top notch and the emotions you feel on the human side run deeper than an ocean trench. It lived up to all of the hype from the Japanese reviews and more. Not even in the same category as the U.S. Monsterverse. Go see it!!!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very sad movie and was horrifying to watch all those people die in that movie but me and my dad enjoyed the movie in all and it was more than a horror movie scarier than rated-r it's more like rated-H for horrifying but again in all it was probably the best movie I've seen so far and it was a deep and real movie and definitely deserves 100% rotten tomatoes and was way better than and most of the movies this year.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've watched, loved, and rewatched every Godzilla movie since I was a kid in the 70's and this is by far my favorite chapter. It will be absolutely criminal if Takashi Yamazaki isnt allowed to grace us with future Godzilla movies because this is now the new gold standard. This is a must see movie, and not just because you like monsters. The human story is the very best part of this movie, Yamazaki is a master of his craft."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Story, Characters, and score! Japan never disappoints with its Godzilla films. Go experience it in theaters now!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exceptional spectacular fairytale threading into historical reality. Thoroughly enjoyable, sit back and let it flow over you."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Ishiro Honda would be proud. It's a story about the horrors of war and how it affects the everyday person. That was something Honda-san was very passionate about as we see with the first Godzilla.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Toho proves once again that they are the only ones who understand Godzilla.  A compelling drama with great actors and Godzilla is everything he should be.  I hope Legendary is taking notes.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I lived in Japan for 15 years and I'm sure i've seen every Godzilla movie ever made but was never truly frightened of the giant or genuinely cared about the characters until seeing this great movie. The story is redemptive and gut-wrenching (warning baby Akiko will make you cry).   I recommend  seeing this movie at IMAX, the action scenes sound is awesome"
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"to much story line, made it boring, but the monster action was good.."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I've been watching Godzilla movies since the 70's This has to be the best one hands down!!! 💯
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Well worth seeing again!!!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an immersive experience, filled with much emotion, and detail."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is a compelling post WWII Japan period piece that could stand on its own two legs without the titular character. Kaiju fans fear not as  the king of monsters cements his place on the throne.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yamasaki's reimagining of Godzilla as allegory for personal and collective wartime trauma is a worthy companion to Honda's original classic. 

There's enough spectacle for casual kaiju fans, compelling characters for those who aren't, and plenty of thematic weight for those who want it. Yamazaki threads a tight needle and succeeds in making one of the franchise; as well as of the genre all together."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you require your special effects and acting perfect to western standards, this movie isn't for you.  It has a ridiculously lumbering and ""thick"" Godzilla, and bad ""overacting"".  That being said, if you loved the original Japanese Godzilla movies, as corny as they were, you'll love this.   It shares a lot in common with the original Godzilla movie.   Despite it's foreign sensibilities that some western audiences my find lacking, their are some surprisingly deep and resonate themes at play--like the shame and trauma of a soldier for instance.     It's a Godzilla movie, so don't expect every aspect to be logical--like how long it would have taken to attach all those tugboat lines to the warships during the climax.  lol.   My only complaint  was they broadcast the twist in the ending a bit too much, and I would have preferred the less happy version of the ending.   ...but overall loved it."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the acting and the plot was a different take. It's easily the best Godzilla Movie, I've every watched. I wish Hollywood would learn something from this and start producing quality movies again. They won't of course. That would be too much like right for them."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another Absolute Masterpiece from Toho Studios. Comparable to the original in terms of story and the modern effects are of high quality, better than most movies that have come out this year. As a die-hard Godzilla fan I thoroughly enjoyed this film and absolutely loved how the beloved character was remastered for today's audience. I HIGHLY Recommend this film!"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie of the year? Loved every scene almost cried, perfect movie"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One stands as an unparalleled masterpiece, redefining the landscape of monster movies. In this cinematic triumph, Writer-Director Takashi Yamazaki delivers a modern moviemaking masterclass, surpassing any Godzilla or monster film emanating from Hollywood since JAWS. TOHO Films, under Yamazaki's helm, has elevated the genre exponentially. This is not just a Godzilla movie; it's a testament to the potential of genuine character development and storytelling in the colossal world of kaiju. Hollywood should reflect on the profound impact achievable through true moviemaking artistry. Don't miss out on the cinematic event of the holiday season; gather everyone and experience it on the grandest screen available!"""
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline along with action. Best Godzilla movie I have seen!
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie was Amazing. Originally went to see it cause its Godzilla but as the movie went on I was pulling for the human characters. The story is also amazing Best movie of 2023 for me.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am absolutely blown away , this masterpiece is the greatest Godzilla movie ever made , and I am a fan of about 50 years, This is an epic triumph !"
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,just go watch it dude this movie was fucking amazing
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible doesn't even begin to cover it. What a Godzilla movie should be. So much meaning to it.
"Dec 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not perfect, but it was a really good film, for a Godzilla movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very heavy film with a lot of heart. It'll make you cry and fist pump. Audience clapped for this film in a big way. With a budget of only 15 million, Hollywood take notes. All hail the king!!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely incredible!!! A true masterpiece! I was blown away by the storyline, character development, animation… wow!!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great take/reboot of the Toho series. At times it may have seemed slow but then picks right back up to keep going!! A must see for any fan of Godzilla!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Rivals the very first Godzilla movie from 1954
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the entirety of this movie. The Human story was not filler. The return of the old Godzilla music was a flashback to my childhood. And Godzilla himself was a monster. He was a return to original concept of the bombings in Japan.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Maybe the best Godzilla movie
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla movie is best of movie I've ever seen... I didn't think the one would make me cry.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"complete awesomeness of a movie. one of the best movies I have seen in years, ranked # 1 for me in all Godzilla movies"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Might be the best movie I've seen all year if not longer. Amazing action, story, effects, grit, and all balanced beautifully. Very well done"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie.Of.The.Year. Instant classic just puts every other Godzilla movie to shame.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie of the year, i don't know how you can even top this one - Perfection!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was slightly too long by 15-20 minutes. My only complaint. Otherwise, it was the best movie of the year."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow!!! what a film, great story, and action  scenes were epic. Go see!!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I first became a fan of Godzilla in 2014, when director Gareth Edwards directed the aptly titled ""Godzilla."" I remember the crowd cheering when the MUTOs head was taken off by Godzilla's heat ray. So imagine my excitement when I hear Director Gareth Edwards had seen this movie and revealed his thought, and it was of envy. He wished he had made a movie as good as this one. Let me tell you folks, he's not wrong, because this may be the best since the original, which is my personal favorite. 
The 1954 ""Gojira"" became my favorite Godzilla as soon as I saw it, and has never been contested... until now. ""Godzilla: Minus One"" is most definitely the best since the original, but is the only one that stands to rival it in quality, heart, narrative, acting and themes. Godzilla himself is at his most brutal and violent in this movie, targeting individuals with intent. The devastating effects of Godzilla's rampages are both an awe and terror to behold. Also, let's not forget the modest budget that was less than $15 million, yet the film achieves fantastic visuals and set design.  I was immersed in this heartfelt, somber, yet hopeful story. I've seen this film twice over now, and I recommend everyone to see this film in the cinema as many times as you can, not only because it's amazing, but we need to support amazing films such as this in a time where $300 million plus movies are delivering us subpar quality. 

In short, ""Godzilla: Minus One"" is a spectacular blockbuster, and my favorite movie of the year."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, definitely one for fans of the franchise. Only take away, would have liked to see more of Godzilla."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, surprisingly moving and never dull, this stands heads and (gigantic, deadly) tails above any attempt at the series by Hollywood. Toho knows what makes these movies work, and it hits the stride, with only a few cliches to bog down scatted moments. Highly recommended!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I was absolutely blown away by this movie. The best Gojira movie for me personally.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Biggest, Baddest, Scariest monster ever.  Shots of a fire-bombed and destroyed Tokyo post WW2 was very good. Sailors and soldiers had angst on losing the war; wanted to make it up by doing away with Godzilla. Great acting & story."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies I've seen. The human story was compelling and, like always, we could always see more of the monster. BUT.....when we had Godzilla on the  screen, we got Godzilla.  This is the best Godzilla I've seen.  He looked amazing in this movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie yet! It was terrorizing, beautiful and sad all at the same time! "
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie from Toho. Post-World War Two Japan had nothing then with the advent of Godzilla it goes from 0 to minus one.

This movie reached back to Godzillas roots. It evokes the first movie in theme. Godzilla is a force of destruction. The human story is compelling. Normally in a Kaiju movie I want way less human story and far more monster action. That was not a factor in this film. 

A wonderful film, probably the best of the most recent Toho movies."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely stunning start to finish, a must watch for Godzilla fans!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely best Godzilla film of all time! I cried twice. Everything about the movie was so beautifully put together. Every main character was likable and Godzilla truly represents the apocalypse. Well done, TOHO! A true classic masterpiece! Go see this film!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Thank you Toho for providing us with a profound story about the will to live along with the giant monster smashing.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic storytelling. Easily the best Godzilla movie to have ever been made. 
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The levels of detail and the characters pulled me in so completely I forgot I was reading subtitles. Hooray for the experience, a true mega monster classic ."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,About 20 minutes too long but it was great. Good sound design.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not go into this ""creature feature"" expecting the beautiful exhilarating, dramatic film that I saw. What a beautifully written wonderfully acted, masterfully directed movie. A must see! One of the years best films."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"While Godzilla was the undisputed star, the story of a young soldier and his found family was gripping and the way that the entire movie called back to the old Godzilla movies- chef's kiss!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow. This is what a Godzilla movie should be and more of what Godzilla movies were back in the day. Loved the human side of the story as well. It proves that you dont need to spend 100 million to tell a great Godzilla story.
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Godzilla Minus One is Godzilla Minus Godzilla
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I've ever seen!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best monster film I've ever seen. Focused on the human and historical story rather than on the monster. The audience actually clapped at the end of the film. Feel good without being cheesy.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved everything about it! Must be seen in original language and in a large theatre. We saw it in Regal RPX.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awe-inspiring special effects, fantastic musical score, excellent look at the effects of war on the human psyche and a nation, and, last but not least, an incredible Godzilla."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the greatest that Godzilla has ever looked ! A must see for both old, and new fans alike alongside those who want a good start to the Godzilla franchise as a whole would recommend to any if they want a good time with friends or family"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely worth your time and money. Go see this movie. Never have I felt my heart pump during the lizard action scenes but also felt tears welling up in my eyes over the human elements as I have in this movie. Go see this movie, ASAP!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, so much depth and emotion that makes this film work. The visual effects speak for itself."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brilliant. A Godzilla movie that actually focuses on story and characters while still delivering on heart pounding, spellbinding action."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perhaps the best in the entire franchise since the 1954 original.  I was both surprised and deeply moved by the intricate and powerful human storyline; usually the people in Godzilla movies are little more than point-and-scream fodder, or play out soap opera tropes in what is basically padding between scenes of rampage and destruction.  In Godzilla Minus One, the characters are faced with constant struggle but manage to endure, and there was nary a dry face by the time the credits rolled. Another great aspect of this movie is the ground-view perspective of Godzilla's attack against the cities.  They're well-rendered to be absolutely terrifying.  I went into this movie fearing the franchise had run its course, and there was no way to make it fresh and vibrant after 70 years...but Toho Studios has delivered an incredible masterpiece, and one that I plan to see over and over."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever, including original.  American directors please watch this to know how to make a Godzilla movie.  They got everything right, the story, special effects and for us fan boys the King is awesome.   
For folks that are not Godzilla fans, I can't say as that is a concept that I cannot fathom."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally brought me to tears at the end! 10/10
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I decided to go along with two friends who are huge Godzilla groupies. They love the big lizard! We went to an early show on Sunday morning. I won't talk about the 40 minutes of hoopla one has to sit through at Regal theaters...ugh. The movie was not what I expected. The backdrop is right after WWII. You seemingly are taken into a Tokyo devastated from the allied bombing. The story is immersive and compelling. You like the characters. The time period is amazing. The sets & special effects all add to the story telling. This is the best movie I have seen all year! I'm really glad I went. I was not expecting it to be this good!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"So solid as a story, screenplay, character arcs - we want more of this type of writing!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining. Never saw the first one, heard a lot of bad press about it. Good remake."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"WOW, I did not expect the emotional rollercoaster ride with an old fashion monster movie.  A true modernization of a classic, while keeping to it's roots...loved it!!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a big fan from both Ultraman and Godzilla, this Godzilla movie is so intense and emotional. I'm gonna watch one more times tomorrow."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of Best Godzilla movies I have ever seen. The story was incredible with drama and action. The Special effects is Top notch, The acting was so good, and Godzilla looks so badass. This movie deserves 10/10"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a masterclass Godzilla movie. It had a great story with a human element that didn't feel unnecessary, fantastic special effects and a Godzilla that was on 100% demon time. See it on the biggest screen possible."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in a long time. The characters are actually enjoyable, the story is very realistic, and everything is just perfect. After 7 years Toho gives us another great Japanese Godzilla film."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so F***ing epic. Best Godzilla movie out to this day. It was intense from start to finish. End of movie, audience clap type of vibe. Recommend watching this moooovie. (Yeah baby!!! Much better than what Hollywood has been crapping out."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally the best movie I've seen in a long time, hands down best Godzilla one for sure. The cgi may have looked like he crawled out of Dragon Wars from '06, but holy hell is this a testament to how little that affects the movie when everything else is perfect! This should really be taught to the bigger budget directors..."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla films to date!  It's dark, gritty, emotional, and Godzilla is more terrifying than ever before!  Just like how it was in the original film from 1954.  I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it yet."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hey, you are just a Godzilla movie, How come you make me cry?  
 Yeah, the human side story was so emotional and touching. Moreover, to my surprise, the special effects were awesome for this low-budget movie. The acting was impressive and every single detail was put together correctly to make this masterpiece.
 If you are tired of watching boring American monster movies, this is the one for you. If you are tired of American love stories, this is the one for you. It is worth 10 American movies together."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing Experience, stunning and gives you an amazing sense of despair to overcome. Definitely an earned ending!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie, intense"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a beautiful movie about courage in the midst of trauma, fear, and grief. The acting, directing, and cinematography combine for a powerful movie experience. Our entire family loved it."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,nearly a perfect movie!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie must watch
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is incredible. Can't believe it only cost 15M to make. Godzilla is like this rampaging angry injured animal that does not have peace.  His war is never over.  

For a split second I thought they were breaking the rules of Godzilla and he was eating people.  But then he shows that he has no care whatsoever to eat someone and only wants to kill people and destroy stuff.  And if there was any doubt he shows it again. 

Beautiful, horrible  destruction. He is so bloodthirsty that he doesn't think and is hyper focused at times. 

There is no marvel move bullcrap. No annoying comedy relief sidekick. No string of quippy one liners during action sequences. No one sided politically motivated preaching. 

Just the undeniable truth that war is a totally horrible thing and all lives matter. No one is disposable."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best - if not the best movie of 2023 - Godzilla Minus One. This movie contains many layers - historical, culturally, romantically, and last but not least the best monster and Godzilla movie of all time. With a budget of only 15 million, Godzilla Minus One looks more like the best 220 million Marvel movie. This is better than most Marvel movies. The pacing of the movie is fantastic. Lots of action sequences that tie perfectly into the story line like pairing your best chocolate and red wine. The surround sound makes you feel like you are in the midst of the action. My daughter - age 6 - was frightened but excited by the sheer magnitude of Godzilla's force. She wants to see it again. This is one bad monster. Move over John Wick - there is a new Sheriff in town. See it on IMAX."
"Dec 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Can't go wrong with a Godzilla movie. A little slow in the beginning but I thought the movie was awesome
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,There's not much I can add that others have not already said. It's an excellent movie and you should go out of your way to see it.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever! My one minor nitpick is the rationale for US not being involved in the fight at all, as not wanting to rachet up tensions with the USSR. I get why, as it wanted to focus on the Japanese aspect of the movie, but the movie was set in 1945-1947 or 48 in the middle of the American occupation of Japan when the US already had tens of thousands of troops stationed there and with Gen. MacArthur's occupation HQ smack in the middle of Tokyo.  Think the US would've at least sent up a few fighters to harass Big G...  Also, Japan was demilitarized at the time with no army or navy.  However, I can get pass the minor historical nitpick and just enjoy the awesomeness of the movie!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very refreshing to see Godzilla return as a tragic character that embodies the emotion and struggles of post-war Japan.  This seems to be the perfect mix of human characters that you actually care about, story development, and great action scenes without going over the top.  I have seen every Godzilla film at least 3 times, and this one is now right up with Godzilla (1954), Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, and Shin Godzilla (unpopular opinion, but it's one of my favorites). Do yourself a favor and see it while it's still in theatres."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow the best Godzilla Film I have ever seen.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent. Truly amongst the best, if not the very best, Godzilla movie. Inventive, fresh take on godzilla, but more importantly, an often unseen (in the US at least) look at life in Japan after the war, and what it did to the people there. First Godzilla movie in a long time I really cared about the characters and wanted to see them not only survive, but have a happy ending."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"First off, I'm not a Godzilla fan and not a fan of subtitles and I don't write reviews. I feel this one needs some exposer since it's so good and I'm worried people will miss out.  This year's movie releases have been so bad I hadn't even gone to the theater in 2023. I heard a ton of buzz about this movie and decided to give it a chance. I have watched some classic subtitled Japanese movies like 7 Samurai and it was worth the watch but I'm generally not a fan of subtitles.

Back to the point, ""Godzilla Minus One"" was a great flick. I decided to see it in the theater because I've never seen a Godzilla movie on the big screen and I thought the subtitles would be easier to read. I was right. The theater sounds and the big screen made it heart pumping. I don't remember the last time I'd felt an actual adrenaline rush watching a film. The subtitles were much easier to keep up with also and didn't feel like a slog keeping up with the dialog. There was young girl with her dad sitting near me and she did have trouble keeping up with the subtitles so keep that in mind if you're taking your kids and they're maybe not the fastest readers.

I think I might have liked the history aspect a little better than the monster but again, I'm not a Godzilla fan. There's a very good love/history story that's integral to the plot. I use the word ""history"" a little loosely since it's modified a bit but generally it's correct and would be helpful to know the basics prior to watching the movie. The Monster is just a force of nature in early postwar Japan and the effects were great. I've heard they're practical effects but I don't know if that's true. I couldn't really tell so if they are practical effects they did a great job and generally looked better than what Hollywood has been pushing out for the last few years. Plus, you actually get to see the monster in good light doing things. Not cut shots and in the dark to try and make him scary but save money on the effects.

I'd really recommend seeing this. It's so different than the Hollywood Godzilla movies it's worth it just to see how it's interpreted by the nation that created him."
"Dec 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fine.  On the plus side, the visual effects were pretty good most of the time (esp. considering the small budget), and Godzilla was scary and had personality.  The immediate post-war setting of this film lends the metaphor of Godzilla more weight, and it has an overall uplifting message while being critical of government.   

Unfortunately, the human element of the story was excessively melodramatic, the movie hides information from you to generate fake tension that none of the characters themselves feel (because they know something you don't), and plot contrivances abound with characters inexplicably finding each other in chaotic crowded locations that make no sense.

It was a completely fine movie, but I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Was blown away. The Ginza scene was one of the best I’ve seen in any movie. The score and story were fantastic. Definitely worth the price of admission!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"First Godzilla movie I have watched where I was not hoping that it would kill off all of the main characters. Go figure, it is possible to create a Godzilla movie without including a bunch of annoying characters who you want dead. If this movie cost 15 million to make as it is reported, than Hollywood is wasting buckets of money on the garbage they have been spewing out for the past decade. Highly recommend it though you will leave with a renewed appreciation for just how bad such projects as Apple's Monarch: Legacy of Monsters truly is."
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was all in subtitles - terrible story!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow this might be one of the top movies of 2023.  Outstanding story, character development, and Godzilla is epic."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing! Bettered any expectations I had!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever made.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie you've ever watched. Exactly what you hope for when you watch a film like this. The massive and explosive action scenes take your breath away and are only matched by the truly compelling story of a man, and a nation, grappling with the reality of a world post war. This movie does it all. And in a budget of $15 million? Hollywood should take notice! You could make 16 of these films for the cost of one ""the marvels""…"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a life long Godzilla fan I can easily say this is one of the greatest Godzilla movies to come out. Absolutely breath taking visuals, interesting characters, and a phenomenal monster movie. Non-Godzilla fans could watch this movie and enjoy it, it is a brilliant film."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla film ever tbh. This movie is worthy of getting movie of the year.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This is definitely a movie that perfectly represents Godzilla as a walking nuclear disaster.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I was surprised to find out that this is the classic actor in a rubber suit!  Great story line from the monster genre and going classic to post WW2 story line.  Recommend to see this in the theater the feeling of the movie.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a masterpiece. Nearly everything about it was flawless. The story, the characters, the acting, the special effects, and Godzilla himself. The best movie I have seen in 2023, and one of the best overall films I've seen in the last five years. Few films have moved me emotionally like this one. Film is supposed to touch us on an emotional level, and this movie did that and more."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a great movie! They did a superb job in depicting a very ominous and unsettling Godzilla.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was entertained the whole time, great character story and monster movie as well!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't know what to expect and it was refreshing to see a movie with character development and humility. You see the desire to stick to the original look of the monster.

The one thing I felt was missing was inner motivation of Godzilla, it serves as an instrument, a metaphore.

Really recommend it."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a solid after WWII movie with Godzilla in it.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film truly understands what makes Godzilla a scary destructive monster. A movie that for the first time, makes huge explosions and destruction feel heavy hitting unlike every Michael Bay film ever made. The stakes of this film are genuinely felt by the audience and the characters are realistic. 
The film sadly contains some flaws but they can really be boiled down to timing issues that take away from the stakes and inconsistencies in how Nuclear bombs work. Overall this film understands what it needs to be, and delivers.My favorite Godzilla film by far."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story development, great character development, wonderful acting, classic ""Godzilla"" score....there is nothing NOT to like about this movie!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maybe the best Godzilla movie ever and I've seen them all!
The Human Story, is the best ever in a Godzila movie (or best since the original). 
I was in pain with the lead character all movie. Amazing."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing. I've been a fan for 25 years now and seen all the movies, been a life long fan of the franchise. absolutely solid addition to the franchise!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,human characters are excellent & actually ADD to the movie making it compelling instead of detracting from it.. Godzilla is a BEAST & is takes no prisoners.. he is the MONSTER & it’s awesome!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie 10/10 i like the story and godzilla's look is amazing can't wait for a sequel
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies! And the human story was amazing. Pus Godzilla was terrifying!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great throw back to Godzilla's grumpy days! The feel and the look was so similar to a horror movie, Godzilla was so menacing and angry, a great allegory for the time. I was glad to share this cinematic story with my younger brothers"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Making a Godzilla movie the creates emotional involvement is no small feat, but this movie succeeds. I mainly went because of the wide array of positive reactions, and I wasn't disappointed. Tremendous effects, but a very human heart. Good flick; reminds me of the original."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,it is one of the best movie ever made and the best movie of the year.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent and even intense in parts. Acting was really good and the story was a lot smarter than the last 2 monsterverse movies. If you like godzilla at all, you will love this movie. I have seen it twice already with my kids who also loved it."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A godzilla masterpiece
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was the best Godzilla movie yet!  My only complaint is that it wasnt in English.  I was ok with it but my 8 yr old, who is a Godzilla fanatic, isnt that fast of a reader so I dont think he followed along too much but he did say he really liked it."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One (2023) is a great kaiju film, and a worthy addition to the Godzilla franchise. It is a respectful and nostalgic tribute to the original Godzilla film, and also a fresh and modern take on the genre. It has a strong and emotional story, a likable and relatable cast, a majestic and menacing Godzilla, and a stunning and realistic visual effects. It is a film that appeals to both fans and newcomers of Godzilla, and it is a film that celebrates the 70th anniversary of the franchise. It is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, and it is a film that will make you feel a range of emotions, from fear and awe, to sadness and joy. It is a film that will make you think and feel, and it is a film that will make you appreciate the king of monsters"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Lovely film with a big scary monster!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Human characters were compelling and well-developed. Loved the post WWII Tokyo setting and the characters struggling to cope with the shame of listing the war and the struggle to rebuild and move forward. Also Godzilla was a truly terrifying force off nature (THOSE ATOMUC BLASTS 🤯). Only negative was that I would have liked a little more of Godzilla destroying Tokyo, but what you get is truly win done. "
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie but guest in the theater were loud and would not stop talking
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I guess you could call me a G-fan. And if you too are a G-fan, then you too must watch this movie.

Of the 38 Godzilla films out there (Japanese + US), I've seen 36, but I own them all and have for a while now. Most G-fans know Shin Godzilla (2016) was a high point for the TOHO Godzilla films. We really wanted to see a sequel come off of that reboot for the franchise. Well TOHO had other ideas and decided to make Minus One instead. 

This film plus Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire sort of makes up the 70th anniversary of the Godzilla franchise. Along with the Apple TV+ MonsterVerse series.

This movie had a significantly smaller budget than you're used to, not only for a Godzilla movie, but for movies in general. $15 million is difficult to fathom in modern times. And for the most part, the movie looks very competent. Shin Godzilla (2016) had set the standard for Japanese Godzilla film effects, but Minus One bests it.

This film also has a much smaller scope than you're used to for a Godzilla film, but for me was a good point. Arguably when of the best human stories ever for a G-entry. This also go well with a miniscule budget, and this time you actually care for the protagonists.

At 2 hours 10 minutes, this exceeds the typical kaiju sweet spot of 90 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes. There were some quiet/dialog scenes that dragged a little for me and for the first 2 thirds most events were fairly predictable. What I was NOT expecting were developments that came in the third act, which I will not spoil.

The score utilizing the iconic OG Godzilla theme is off the chain. Most of the movie is not booming loud, but scenes featuring the original theme blew me away sonically and then some.

As a nice chaser, if you are also a G-fan of the Legendary Pictures MonsterVerse movie, I would also recommend the Apple TV+ Monarch: Legacy of Monsters series.

"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolutely wonderful blend of emotion, cgi, and weight this film brought. Absolutely recommend for anyone, not just long time Godzilla fans."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just like the original Godzilla, this movie explores the horrors of war. Unlike most Godzilla films, it has amazing human characters that allow the story to flourish. I LOVE how scary they made Godzilla, a must watch for any kaiju fan."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One really surprised me.  I've never been a huge fan of Godzilla movies or that genre.  However, I may rewatch some of the older Godzilla movies thanks to Minus One.  This movie was excellent. It was a highly enjoyable experience.  I like that the movie explored a couple of interesting themes, besides mayhem and destruction - which was also fun.  The Godzilla monster also looked incredibly epic."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece

This is what Godzilla is in the minds of so many fans"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went expecting a good old campy monster stomp and in the old tradition, and instead I got an intensely emotional human-focused story about the Japanese experience of defeat after WWII, survivor's guilt, a chance for redemption, and the choice to live.  The story was set in the ruins of Japan after WWII, when their country had been largely destroyed but their society had not, and it used the experiences of a failed kamakaze pilot as a proxy for the entire nation's struggle to redefine duty and purpose in the new era.  The existential threat of Godzilla was a chance to prove that Japan's people could stand on their own, even against a creature that clearly represented echoes of the country's very real nuclear trauma.  One of the most satisfying parts of the film was the very clear character arc that the main protagonist goes through, which included sensitively portrayed moments of PTSD and the importance of relationships in recovery and life purpose.  I cannot praise the writing, casting, and acting highly enough, this was without a doubt the best film I have seen in a very long time.  Both my buddy and I got up from our seats teary-eyed.

There are five things that potential viewers should keep in mind: 
1) This a Japanese film about Japanese people having an experience in a distinctly Japanese historical and cultural context.  It's not diverse, it generally doesn't have an agenda, and it does not apologize for the story it is telling.  If you need your stories steeped in caveats and humble acknowledgements of tribal land, the patriarchy, imperialism, or whatever else occupies people these days, this is not your cup of tea.  It's a serious story about realistic people, not a university kumbaya session.
2) The version of the film I saw, and to my knowledge the only one, was in Japanese with English subtitles.  This doesn't bother me at all, I would rather have the real acting and voices with subtitles any day of the week.  Some people don't feel the same, though, so if you really can't handle subtitles then this may not be for you.  Although I really suggest you put in the effort so you can watch The Seven Samurai and The Hidden Fortress...
3) The budget for this film was not large, and if you're expecting special effects on par with a $250 million USD Disney blowout you're going to be disappointed.  It was obvious that nearly every wide shot, especially the ships, was entirely CGI.  If you're a stickler for the most believable visuals and any doubt of realism ruins your experience, that might be a deal killer.  That said, because the special effects existed in service to the plot and not as the centerpiece of the film, they were absolutely good enough.  Hollywood take note, if your writing and acting is good, you don't need to spend the GDP of a small country on asset creation and rendering.
4) In certain parts of the film they made liberal use of low-frequency sound to amp up the drama and anxiety of a scene.  Legit strategy, but it seemed a little overused sometimes where I felt silence would have been better.  On the other hand, it made the silent parts of the film more impactful by contrast, so maybe they made the right choice.
5) This story is far better if you have some understanding of Japan's experience in the prior century leading up to WWII so you understand the context.  If you're interested in that, I recommend you take a look at Dan Carlin's Supernova in the East episodes, part of the Hardcore History podcast.  If you're willing to put 30+ hours into the learning process, you will be rewarded with a great appreciation for what Japanese people went through and the forces shaping Japanese thought in that period."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far and away the best version of the Godzilla franchise that I have seen in a very long time. In fact, even better than the 1950's classic original. The key is the wonderful human element added. The plot is just as much about one man's redemption as it is about Godzilla on a rampage. Another original aspect is the timeline. This version of Godzilla is post World War 2 in a devastated Japan. What an original plotline, a Kamikaze pilot loses his nerve, (and who could blame him) and guides his plane to a repair facility on an island claiming mechanical failure with the plane. Then Godzilla appears on the island and starts squashing the solders like bugs. This haunts the pilot and causes his own personal war. 
    Now let's talk about the monster! I love this version of Godzilla. This is not a version that wants to protect humans, this Godzilla wants to squash humans and cause general destruction and chaos. An evil fiend indeed, like a mindless zombie who just wants to feed, Godzilla just wants to destroy. Fantastic effects as well. Very realistic in the destruction scenes. 
    How Godzilla was eventually rid of is one of the more original ideas in this type of genre.  The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is mainly I thought the pilot played by Ryunosuke Kamiki had a serious case of William Shatner overacting. 
  Otherwise, the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen! Could save the franchise."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was genuinely terrifying, not only was it one of the first godzilla movies where we actually cared about the main characters who aren't giant lizard monsters, but it provided one of the best casts of characters I have seen in a new movie in a while. It goes to show that with good writing, good acting, and a good message, a low budget cannot stand in the way of a good movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. While I didn't think the ending was that believable with some of the characters, it made me happy that it happened anyway."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is this how movies are in Japan? I have to look more into that, it reminds me of movies made back in the 80s, when they spawned beloved franchises they are failing to remake 40 years later."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in to this thinking most movies suck and Godzilla Minus One has to be at least average if nothing else. Boy, was I wrong I felt fear and realism and impending doom that I could not escape from. For the entire movie. The people factor felt right and real for once. The heat ray attack, It had everyone in the theater gasping and speaking ""Holy cow"" the first time we see it and we laughed at the insanity of its power every time after. Great movie and I al planning to see it again here just two days removed from the first viewing!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This is easily one of the best Godzilla movies since the original. I have been a life long fan of Godzilla. I have seen them all. Even the '97....thing. No other Godzilla to date tugged on my emotions like this one. The Big G has not looked better or more menacing. I hope everyone gets the opportunity to go see it.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Man this movie was intense. The human subplot to this movie will get you!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really great. With a more character focused story, its really brings out the horror and scale of Godzilla, bringing it back to its roots. With amazing action and a heartfelt story it is easily the best Godzilla movie since King of the monsters."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie was amazing.  The characters were well developed and their back stories were compelling.  You almost forget you are watching a Godzilla Movie.  The fact that the movie was made for 15 Million dollars is testimony to good story telling.  Not that the effects were lacking.  They were everything you wanted in a Godzilla movie!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was fabulous.  Not only was it a monster movie, but it was one that focused on depth of character of the key people.  It had a great storyline and was exceptionally well written.  I really felt for the characters and it seemed like I was there in the movie with them.  This was the best movie I have seen in years.  Highly recommended."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie!  Saw it twice opening weekend.  Great storyline and the subtitles were timed perfectly. My only concern is why Noriko was the only one with radiation signs and not Shikishima, when he had more exposure.  We really enjoyed the movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bare bones review to avoid spoilers: I normally dislike romance/human drama in my Kaiju films, but Godzilla -1 made me actually care about these people.  The humans were definitely the center of the film, Godzilla seemed very much the B plot unless he was actively stomping around and, wow, on the one hand the model on land seemed very clunky, little to no mobility with teeny tiny arms... but on the other it had PRESENCE.  Like, yes, Godzilla can't do a backflip and is walking with a train dangling from his mouth like a dog's chewtoy, but that slow forward momentum was UNSTOPPABLE.

And, as previously stated, the humans and their own internal struggles are the heart of this movie.  I especially loved the Doctor who came up with the plan to stop Godzilla (which seems very pie-in-the-sky but MOVIE LOGIC) because he reminded me of my Uncle."
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was disappointed because Godzilla was only in it for a very short time and he was not the focus. IT was a war character drama. Godzilla could have been swapped with any monster or enemy. There's no lore or personality for Godzilla.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Def the best Godzilla movie
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING MOVIE!!!! Definitely a must watch! It is in subtitles but if you’ve watched anime then you should be fine!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla to date! Loved it . Highly reccomend .
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie that made me care about the human characters while giving me a good solid dose of Godzilla in his original force of destruction mode.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best thus far, way better that the American version not always about monster fight, a little bit of drama, romance and action, suspense great story to the movie"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! Proper Godzilla! I have to admit to being a massive Godzilla fan since the 80s and maybe I love this movie because it really takes us back with the original origin story. I feel the more current monster-verse American Godzilla movies are good, but this is just back to roots proper Godzilla. It has incredible sound and it is a very good human story. I hope we see more Japanese Godzilla and a wider theatrical release in the future so more folks can experience this masterpiece!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great monster movie, that really got me excited to see Godzilla every time he is on screen and has me caring for the people and their struggles of what they are facing within and the environment around them during this crisis. And the theme of Godzilla is still stuck on my mind."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A return to the glory days of Godzilla. Recapturing the feel and look of the Big G. A chef's kiss to the original 1954 movie. Be prepared to enjoy a cast of characters that embody a post war Japan. A riveting addition to the Godzilla franchise.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie I wish there was more Godzilla and less love story but really liked the movie moved at a good pace and Godzilla looked awesome
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, great story"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the realio dealio
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"""A movie to be experienced, not watched"" , great story, cast and cgi.  In an tense moment in the movie, audio disappears, the audience is dead quiet too as they are riveted by Godzilla -1.0"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such an awesome movie, Godzilla was truly terrifying!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,My only regret is not seeing it in IMAX the first time. Compelling story and human characters that you get attached to.  Godzilla presents himself as essentially the atomic bomb made into a monster. Incredible imagery and sound design.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Well paced. Great acting. Awesome action. True to the original Godzilla. I loved the movie!
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was nostalgic at least but man was that a poor excuse for a story line and it was so slow to get any traction
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far one the best films this year! Great action great story, I was crying, laughing, cheering, in shock. A rollercoaster of emotions with an awesome payoff. This movie is a must watch and for sure movie of the year."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this is the best Godzilla movie yet. Great pacing, great acting, great characters, good balance of humor. Godzilla’s time on the screen surely did not disappoint."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's probably the best movie in theaters in about 5 to 10 years this movie is something that you will probably want to see more than once more than twice  probably 5 times if you can IMAX is a must it will have you on the edge of your seat the build up to the climax is the equivalent of marvels phases 1,2,3 to infinity war and endgame in just 2 hours instead of years you will probably feel an obligation to both watch it multiple times and tell everyone you know to see it multiple times if people knew how good this movie was it would make more than infinity war and endgame combined and it deserves to, I am begging you to go watch this do yourself the favor, you will probably tell everyone the same thing"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Powerful emotional movie. Really encapsulates Godzilla being a metaphor for war, and all the difficult decisions soldiers and civilians have to face during wartime. Really strong story about family, honor, and the sanctity of life. The only modern Godzilla movie worth watching."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,They made me love and care for the Characters in a monster movie. I did not expect this much feels. Well done! I can re watch this movie multiple times!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing story, great reboot to a classic character. By far my favorite Godzilla and Atomic Breath"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Long time Godzilla fan here, and I have to say this movie was a surprise for me.  It was a wonderful mix of human drama and perseverance in the face of a new and terrifying threat.  My hats off to the director, cast and crew for bringing me back to my childhood and the wonderment and awe that is Godzilla!!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the franchise and have watched most of the movies. This was definitely a modern take on the monster. I was glued to the screen from the first moment. I even took my girlfriend who I thought wouldn't like it. She cried multiple times in the movie and never stopped watching.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!! BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR HANDS DOWN NO EXCEPTIONS!!!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than anything Hollywood has put out in years. Weird how I could relate to the characters even though none of them look like me (which is what Hollywood thinks has to be in every movie). Just make a movie and a cohesive story and you will succeed.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best godzilla footage I've seen
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Toho Godzilla movie I've seen. Way better than Shin Godzilla. The human characters were great.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this is the movie of the year. I have never seen a Godzilla movie before, and I went with my dad, who has seen every single one several times. It was extremely enjoyable."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I JUST WATCHED GODZILLA MINUS ONE IN 4DX WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO HATES ""WAR TIME MOVIES"" AND EVEN SHE GAVE THE MOVIE A 9 OUT OF 10!!

 I THINK IT'S THE BEST MOVIE THIS YEAR AND ONE OF THE TOP 5 KAIJU  FILMS OF ALL TIME!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great film. Not just a good Godzilla film, but an overall enjoyable experience. The characters and storyline drew you in as audience member, and you couldn't help but root for them. We'll put together, suspenseful and thrilling."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the human aspect and Godzilla is just a force of nature.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw this as a group of 3 men aged 16, 45, 55. Full price tickets at an OK theater with food & drinks, all regular adult prices. Godzilla Minus One is easily one of the most fun popcorn movies in recent years. It is teriffic fun to see Godzilla stomp his way across the big screen in big, earthshaking Dolby surround, but this movie is actually a good movie in its own right. I cared about the characters and rooted for them. The writing, acting and special effects were three or five cuts ABOVE the CGI ""content"" flushing out of the Mouse House. Tons of destructable models and old school rubber suit stuff. Fun to watch, and technically well done. Godzilla was a monster of a main character in his own movie, not an afterthought. We got to see him in (seriously) terriffying full size, in good light, with full body shots and close-ups. Just awesome. The movie was just over 2 hrs long, in Japanese with English subtitles. We were hooked in the first few minutes, time flew by, and the subtitles were fine to watch. Bottom line: Godzilla Minus One is a popcorn movie worth every penny. No hidden agenda BS, no politics, and every full price ticket supports all the great people at Toho who made this masterpiece on a shoestring budget with just sweat equity and a love for Godzilla movies. Loved every minute, will pay full price to see this again with my grown kids later this month, in an MX sound theater if possible. Go to the theater with a friend, and have a great time. Encourage people to make great movies like this again."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,True to origins - excellent plot - well done!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute genre defining masterpiece. Will make you cry, will make you feel fear. Grabs a hold of you in the beginning and takes you on a ride. Go see this movie. You may never see another like it in this lifetime."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute cinema. Thought it was going to be just another cheesy monster movie, and while yes Godzilla is definitely the reason I saw it, the human characters gave the story so much weight. There's meaningful character growth in multiple characters that are dealing with themes of PTSD, survivors guilt, acceptance, forgiveness, loss, hope, despair. This movie will make you feel feelings. It's also a legit disaster movie and is not afraid to pull any punches. People die. Horribly. And those that don't have to deal with that fact. There are many parallels with the original Gojira, but visually updated for 2023 without looking like a video game. Not a depressing movie at all, but at the same time if you go into it expecting the cheesy camp from some earlier Godzilla titles you are in for a rude awakening. Highly recommended. Go see it as soon as you can."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved almost every aspect of this.  Godzilla was actually rendered in a way that his presence really was menacing. Setting it in post-WWII Japan was a great choice. The backstory of the main character was compelling, and I was totally engrossed even when Godzilla was no where to be found."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2024!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best adaptation of Godzilla! This movie is a rollercoaster of emotions that will have you wanting more!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"So so good!
Not the typical Godzilla movie.
Great story line, outstanding acting.
Hope its nominated for the Japanese production"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla film I've seen! The story, the action, and the horror! It all blends in so well!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the last three Godzilla movies. Please make more Godzilla movies like this
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is one of the year's finest blockbuster films and quite possibly the best ""Godzilla"" film I have ever seen. This is a movie that understands how to create an emotional attachment to characters and thus raises the stakes when the action is going down. Speaking of the action, it is some of the most spectacular stuff you can see in a theater in 2023. This movie is pure entertainment and has plenty of heart and a good story. To me, it feels like it captures the soul of the original film and flourishes it with modern-day special effects, and it reminded me a lot of the 2005 ""King Kong"" film in that way. Overall, this is a thrill ride that has plenty of moments to wow the audience, while also remembering to tell a genuinely engaging human story."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie EVER!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla is back in true form wonderful movie
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen and it's because of the attention to detail in building the characters through important emotional moments. Their journeys are everything. The film is also a great vision of postwar Japan that movie audiences rarely get to see. American audiences might have objected to seeing the devastation that the Japanese people had endured as a result of American attacks on their homeland, but in this new century we're in now, everyone loves Japan and we're ready to see their story. Godzilla itself is a kind of avatar of nature enacting vengeance for violence against the natural world in this genre, but but this film also uses the monster to help the audience to empathize with Japanese victims of war. All the moments are well-earned, the monster is truly furious and terrifying, effects and cinematography are great, and there's also an adorable baby. I highly recommend this movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Minus One is the biggest experience I had with a Godzilla movie. Everything is outstanding beautiful and also very tragic. It's about the human will to face the worst possible situation happening at the worst time possible. The characters are awesome with deepness reflecting the horrors that the Japanese people lived through post WW2 Embodiment by the creature that is tearing everything apart and criticizing both the Japanese and US government decisions smartly. even if you are not a Godzilla fan this is a MUST WATCH.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down the best Godzilla movie ever. It clicks on all cylinders - story, acting, direction and SFX. The Japanese monster movies have always had a subtext of the national trauma of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By setting this story at the end of the war and making the central character a traumatized Japanese soldier the film moves the subtext to the front brilliantly. And for the first time I can remember, the monster itself is terrifying. Kudos to Toho Studios for making a film light years ahead of anything else they have ever done."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Possibly the best Godzilla movie ever. Saw it with my fiance, we both cried. 15/10."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is brilliantly done. Absolutely no fault can be found with it. This is not just a monster movie. The script is a truly deep and well written story. I certainly hope that they don’t cave and dub because the subtitles is part of the perfection. A not to the origin of this monsters history. 
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"For watching godzilla movies all my life, this one has the most impact and story driven I have seen, you can feel the fear from the people with godzilla. The redemption and chemistry with the characters. The action was not lacking and bringing back the musical score to top it all off brings it in."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very emotional thrilling rollercoaster
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was not only a great Godzilla movie, this was a great movie period. Even non Godzilla fans could find enjoyment from this movie. This is one of the best installments in the franchise since its birth. To the core, the movie is a human story and one that adds so much emotion that is usually missing from most Godzilla movies. What a phenomenal film!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One had a profound and lasting effect on me. The film was undeniably remarkable, as it skillfully demonstrated Toho's mastery in crafting a truly terrifying Godzilla. However, what truly set it apart was its ability to evoke deep emotions through its use of disturbing imagery and heartfelt moments. This combination of expertly crafted horror and genuine emotional connection made the film a truly unforgettable experience."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a truly great movie, much less the best Godzilla movie ever. Believe the hype on the one!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie of all time!!!!!!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,the best Godzilla movie Japan ever put together!
"Dec 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, really loud action. If watching make sure you are prepared to read the subtitles, the entire movie is subtitled/translated but overall a good movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you appreciate the original Godzilla you will love this movie, but even someone new to the King will have a blast."
"Dec 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,Godzilla Minus One does an excellent job at balancing its character focus with the Godzilla action and carnage.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely one of the best movies to come out this year! Simple storyline that made sense, great characters, and really well made even though it had a very small budget. It's in Japanese and has English subtitles, which I was not aware of, but wasn't an issue for me. It might be difficult to enjoy if you're not a fast reader."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie by far👍🏼. Godzilla was terrifying in every scene he was in. Great pacing and character development. Definitely buying this movie when it comes out on blue ray.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great throwback to the 1954 original
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Thank you Toho!!! Best Godzilla movie ever!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heart and spectacle done right. Great story and effects. Works as a monster movie, works as a WWII period piece. Fantastic movie experience."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was spectacular.  I have never seen a Godzilla movie where I really cared about the people so much.  Usually the story was only Godzilla, but this was different.  The main characters shame, sadness, rejection and pain all turns around and he has a redemption in the end! The Godzilla scenes in the water were just amazing.  In some places Godzilla did look like a man in a suit, but in most places it looked so good that you were awestruck!  I loved this movie!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best godzilla movie I've ever seen and surprisingly, it's for the exact reason tht usully bogs down most godzilla movies (especially the American ones). This movie genuinely has the best human story of any godzilla movie I've ever seen we also checked it out in cinemar's new D-box seats and while fun (in a movie like this) it is not worth an extra $10+per ticket."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal movie for Godzilla fans! 

Brought all the aspects of the original Godzilla movies and more. Made him terrifying once again, packed with big explosions along with a great plot. I'm satisfied see if/how this storyline continues. 

I highly recommend watching!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies out there even the the American version ones and Im a big Godzilla movie fan.  I highly suggest this film for not only die heart fans but also novice.  This is a great intro movie for the general audience.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie since 1954. I actually cared about the human story! All characters had a compelling story and arc. Godzilla was angry and scary. Post war Japan focus on the trauma of war made this movie an original. Japanese Godzilla movies are the best!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the Godzilla movie I've been waiting for. Finally the story and characters have as big an impact as the greatest monster ever. I was completely in awe of the scope and heart of this film. More than once I shed a tear, and more than once I found myself scared for the residents of Ginza and Tokyo. 

Additionally, Godzilla himself was epic. There were so many things done well. The detail was incredible. From his epic power up sequences to the close ups on his face and body, never before has he looked so incredible.

I cannot recommend this movie enough. Even if you don't like Godzilla or monster movies, you will find yourself loving this. Remember studios, characters and story matter."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Japanese film! If you love good storytelling, acting, and action… this one is for you! "
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The roar the OG music the destruction Godzilla that's a 9 for other for me it's ten some I can't understand stand subtitles learn how to read 😂
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Where it all started. Well done and yes, I cried"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down the BEST.  This movie was so good.  So fun.  It was like going to the movies.  Brilliant.  Enchanting.  I forgot time and space. A must see.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Not really a Godzilla fan usually but wow. Homage to the original look and feel. CGI usage even kept to limitations on how Godzilla moved and acted. Very well done.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its got a great classic monster vibe. Great story, excellent acting, and amazing effects! If youre a true Godzilla fan you HAVE to it!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A true return to form with Godzilla as a terrifying force of nature and genuinely likable human protagonists. Godzilla Minus one accomplishes what few kaiju films have, making the audience care and root for the human cast while enjoying the spectacle of mass destruction."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is fantastic. The action is spectacular, the acting is great and I really loved the story. It was nice to watch a movie that cared about the characters and the complications they faced from this truly terrifying unstoppable monster attacking just after such a demoralizing war. Its movies like this that remind us how awesome the theater experience can be. This is an old fashioned popcorn movie at its finest."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I saw this movie tonight and it is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion and the best movie of the year
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, you actually feel like Godzilla was a real monster and villain of the film. The acting and story of the film was fantastic. The way they laid out the story made you emotionally and sympathetically attached to the characters of post WW2 Japan."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the best movie of the year and the best in the franchise.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen 4 movies this year: John Wick 4, Sound of Freedom, Oppenheimer, and Godzilla Minus One. This one was the best out all 4. Its crazy this only had a production budget of 15 million USD. You could take anyone to see this movie and they would enjoy it. The acting is superb, no woke agenda, just pure, fun, entertainment. Something I don't see very often. The strength of the human spirit to not give up in what are seemingly insurmountable odds shines through in this movie. You will leave feeling satisfied, and motivated to take on your own Godzilla. 

5/5, go see it!"
"Dec 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just saw it and I am sorry but that movie is overrated. Visuals are good so is the sound. But the story out right silly at times. And the japanese style overacting is in full force. I guess the bar is really low these days. Not one major character 
dies. The fake-out death is telegraphed. And again the acting at times is anime level childish  3/5 IMO"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,subtitles only but its ok
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best Godzilla film in a long time. as a pure Godzilla film probably the best since Godzilla 1954. Go see this film in the theatres!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,best Godzilla movie ever!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never in my life have I felt a need to promote a movie let alone leave a review for one. This is truly a masterpiece! I've seen it twice in the theater and could see it again, and again. The story telling, the emotional pull, the actors, the music, THE GODZILLA, are pure perfection! The best Godzilla movie ever made is an understatement! Beautiful work!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Classic destruction Godzilla (vs. savior Godzilla). Felt a lot like a reimagining of the original movie from the 50s. Even though I went for Godzilla, they did a great job making not actually care about the drama amongst the (literal in comparison) little people. Fantastic movie, I’m seeing it again!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome monster movie! Great story and new visuals.  Must see if a godzilla fan.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome Godzilla entry with a terrifying monster, incredible effects and a cast you actually care about. Highly recommended."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is what a GODZILLA film should be , human characters that are beautifully written and you care for. A 10 outta 10 right up there with the 54 Original 🥳"
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is so overrated. The movie is more about a kamikaze pilot overcoming his PTSD than it is about Godzilla. Godzilla is barely in the movie. If this movie was made 10-20 years ago I would be impressed. Godzilla was a mechanical robot or someone's old granny who could only take one step at a time. The only fluid movement was when he was in the water. This movie was horrible!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Came in to the movie expecting a normal monster movie. Was surprise how invested I got into the human characters. Great writing and filming, love this movie."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven't seen a more beautiful movie than Jurassic Park, and that's saying a lot."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie that captivates you from beginning to end. A human story that delivers just enough to keep it going. A must see in a Dolby sound auditorium. The visuals were fantastic all around. 10 Star film
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and bad ass zilla w some of the old school touches
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well written story. Visually appealing. Love the old call backs to ""Gojira"" such as the music. Any fan of the older Godzilla movies will enjoy this one a lot."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Such a fun ride. Good character development, great cinematography, historical relevance, and truly creative"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was  spectacular from the start to finish.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the movie of the year for  me. Amazing story and action combined into an great film
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"we were totally blown away that someone was able to make a movie this amazing, with great characters and an amazing story all for 15 million. Hollywood needs to learn something from this movie! we absolutely loved it!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie blew me away. The story telling, character development/story arc, etc. all lived up to the hype. Must see and hope they continue with this story/universe as I can't get enough"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A film that faithfully honors the original 1954 Godzilla while adding a deeply compelling human story about a person experiencing the horror of World War II and the monster that emerged from it.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had a great mix of giant monster action and a compelling human story. One of the best Godzilla movies that I've seen in years. Not just mindless action, but a great movie all around. The Monsterverse is great but nobody does Godzilla better than his original Japanese creators."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Terrifying Amazing!!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action movie.  Glad to have another series of Godzilla
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,May all our wars be over.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storytelling and the visuals were still amazing with a 15 million budget.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Artistic, emotional, OSCAR WORTHY! This film is beyond great! What's the icing on the cake? The KING OF THE MONSTERS! Godzilla!

Performances were beautiful, the monsters scenes were amazing, and the story was unmatched. 

Thank you, TOHO!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm telling you best pic of 2023. I had to kill 2 hours waiting for my kid, so saw this reluctantly. It was 10/10 best movie I've seen this year. The performance by the main actor brought me to tears multiple times. Amazing!!!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great monster movie with a poignant human redemption story. Even after 70 years, this franchise manages to reinvent itself in impressive ways."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movies with good character development.  You really get to caring about the main characters. It's quite an emotional rollercoaster.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie I really enjoyed it from the beginning till the end. Great plot and very complete mixing nostalgia and the old school feeling of Godzilla. Love it!!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A Masterpeice! Go see it! Brilliant storytelling and filmmaking!  You won't be disappointed!
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Not too campy. Good human interest and the monster scenes are great. Great reboot.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie! It is way more than just another Godzilla movie. The movie intertwines a lot of stories related to post war Japan around the threat of Godzilla. The Japanese language version with subtitles was very appropriate, and gave a great flavor to the movie. I rate it as the best Godzilla movie I've seen. At the end of the movie....everyone in the theatre applauded, which is reallly something for a foreign language movie reaction from an American audience!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A harrowing tale enveloped in themes of foreboding death and surviors guilt.

While the monster is villainous and threatening the true antagonist is a perfect balance of self doubt and worthiness. 

An amazing movie that must be seen in a theater ironically for a scene with no sound that will loom with you well after the credits roll"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with a great story and lots of Godzilla!  Will definitely be seeing it again.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an absolute epic movie. One of those movies you buy, and add to the collection so you can watch it again in a year. The graphics, the acting, and the suspense, were amazing. I left the movie still talking about it. Go see it!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,wow. truly a masterpiece
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much! This movie wasn't JUST a monster movie--it was a personal glimpse into the lives of the Japanese people following the 2d World War, and follows a man with PTSD, through his guilt to his eventual redemption.  It has everything a great movie has--action, suspense, romance, and a unique story. Hollywood used to make good movies, but they have wrecked every franchise I used to love. If they have a brain cell left, they need to learn from this movie. If they don't, Hollywood is done, and nobody is going to miss them."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent but not perfect Godzilla movie. The 3 big surprise reveals at the end were actually pretty predictable but the early post-WW2 reconstruction setting was interesting and the human characters were as compelling as Big G himself.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"""This movie was an incredible achievement in film!! Great Acting, Action and incredible story that pays off with an epic conclusion!! If you only attend one film before the end of the year.  It should be this one!!"""
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing better than modern day Godzilla movies
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only the best Godzilla movie I ever saw, but the best monster movie - period! The kind of Godzilla film I never thought was possible! Great story, great visuals and sound, and amazing acting and directing! Highly recommend!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"First monster movie I've seen where you want the human characters to live, the MCs trauma is painful and gripping, and Godzilla himself is a terror to everyone. Overall it's the second favorite movie of the year."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Add this to the monster-horror with emotional story and incredible character along with Jaws. Addresses survivors' guilty, trauma and the lasting impacts of war in such a heart-rending way while also supplying action and terror with an amazing rendition of Godzilla."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,La pelicula me parecio bien (no la e visto)
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great characters, great special effects, great movie!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Now this is how you make a movie… low budget high returns and the most important part is there is no fu**in message or woke ideology and that's a good thing
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The film perfectly balances the human and monster moments.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic! It had good acting, a great story, a good soundtrack, and incredible special effects! I highly recommend going to see it! This is definitely a modernized approach to the Godzilla saga and SO much better than the American versions!"
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One captures the essence of the original series, offering a visually stunning portrayal of the iconic monster. The attention to detail in Godzilla’s design is commendable, and the stellar acting performances elevate the film to new heights. A nostalgic and thrilling experience for fans of the legendary creature."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen almost all the godzilla movies....up until today Shin Godzilla was up on my favorite list. Godzilla Minus One IS  the best one ever made. The perfect story, perfect design...beautiful film!!!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie to see in the Theaters.  Well paced and great human story.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining. The human story is relatable and touching overcast by a larger than life epic story of people facing off against a force of nature.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best movie I’ve seen this year. One of those movies you just need to see in an IMAX or 4DX theatre.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although the movie has a lot of dramatic dialogue, it still gave all Godzilla fans a taste of the King of the Monsters"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome Godzilla Film, great homage to the original 1954 Gorjira"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome classic Godzilla movie! Riveting characters too!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Just wow! I am not even a Kaiju movie fan and I loved this.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has to be THE best Godzilla movie ever! The sound, the pacing, the lighting in every shot is top notch.  We get to see the destruction in a wide shot and it shows how scarry this beast can actually be.  When the spirit of the movie is allowed to shine without anything else in its way, you get a fantastic move like this.  You could watch this in your home, but the theater is where this movie shines.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE! you will become a fan of the genre the moment the credits roll.  10 out of 5."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the movie, and was pleasantly surprised there was a storyline and character development, not just 120 minutes of smashing and roaring!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Brilliant acting. One of the BEST films I’ve seen I a long time.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie !!! The story was so compelling and Godzilla himself was exactly how he should be. The movie does pay homage to the original and its all so well done.  I really hope it comes back in theatres here in the U.S.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Godzilla was the backdrop of a human story of a people rebuilding after WW2. Best Godzilla movie to date!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie remastered for the modern audience. Takes a heartfelt look into post-war Japan and the struggles of Japanese citizens to find a semblance of normalcy. When our characters found a sense of happiness Godzilla shows back up into the picture to destroy the lives of thousands of people. We get to watch the struggle of never leaving the war zone and needing to put your life on the line to wanting to live for your family. Our characters have heartfelt moments with a glimpse into our humanity. Out of more than 35 movies to Godzillas name this is by far one of the best stories out to screen.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie period!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a masterpiece. it would make you want to watch it again! if you weren't a godzilla fan before well this one can help with that. it has scenes that will sure get a laugh out of you before the big man comes around, the acting is so good you will cry."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent film. The story line was nice not too mushy.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"At $15 Million this tops any $200m blockbuster this year. With a less is more approach to storytelling with a human focus this is probably the best Godzilla film in the 70 year franchise. This is a film fans and a general movie goer could appreciate. It’s not a non-stop Marvel CGI action fest, but when the action does start it is exciting. Amazing visuals and tense action make this a must to see in the largest format theater you can, with 4DX and IMAX making this an incredible experience that only a cinema can deliver."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The perfect Godzilla movie!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Is perfect I loved it
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic origin story!  Excellent effects, great acting! Couldn't ask for more!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie! Hollywood should take notes on how to create a monster movie from this. The human element and characters made you feel what they were feeling. You actually care for them and what happens to them. Characters are flawed and not the unlikeable, perfect, invincible, strong characters that Hollywood seems to be pumping out lately. There is actual tension when Godzilla shows up due to these stakes. Unlike Hollywood Godzilla movies, the focus is not just on the monster alone and special effects galore. There is an actual good story here. There are people that you care about in the film that you get attached to. The characters are actually likeable and relatable throughout."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Godzilla movie from a life long Godzilla fan.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story. Godzilla its self at times looked a bit goofy, but overall very good action and the ray blast from Godzilla was epic."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was better than I excepted it to be and I already had high expectations, it was an amazing movie with plenty of emotions and action"
"Dec 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A great homage to the 1954 original with its own uniques twist in its story. Characters are well written and ties in nicely with the story and makes Godzilla all the more horrifying. That said, acting is a little over done at time. CGI is excellent for most of the film. There are some cheesy stylistic choices that make me favor the legendary Godzilla over this one, but those are far and view between. Overall, great film to see in IMAX."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!!! I cried so much!  The way you get so emotionally attached to the characters! The actors where fantastic! Must see in IMAX!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yamazaki has created the greatest Godzilla film known to date. The cast is amazing, Godzilla is terrifying, and the story is amazing. Overall, a great film."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never thought I'd rave about a story in a Godzilla movie, but here we are. The first movie in the Toho series in a long time where I've actually cared about what the humans are doing. Great action sequences, memorable characters, and probably the best on screen Godzilla in the franchise. Shin Godzilla had some incredible sequences, but Minus One tops every single one.

This movie rivals the original for me and I do not say that lightly. I truly hope Toho continues on from this movie to spawn a new era of Godzilla!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A true Godzilla film that is even better than the original! Takashi Yamazaki did a splendid job delivering an emotional story with such great actors! You will be inspired!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow just watched it and such an emotional movie. Who would have guess that from a Godzilla movie. Probably the best Godzilla made and this Godzilla was scary
"Dec 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,No indication that the entire movie would have subtitles. Not suitable for kids that cant read that fast!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story, CGI, and balance of monster to human elements worked amazingly with this movie. One of the best Godzilla movies I've seen and I'm pretty sure I've seen almost all of them."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I have seen every single Godzilla film ever made. This is not just one of the best Godzilla movies ever made but one of the best films of the year. Gut wrenching film with nods to the originals and some breathe taking moments. Go see this movie!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"We love the Toho approach to Godzilla and this is one of their best. The WW2 Japanese setting was unique, and the battles against the Big G had real stakes in the outcome."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Not just a monster movie
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This definitely is the best Godzilla movie of all of them!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Chunky Godzilla, but he killed the st out everyone!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla minus one is another great remake of the Godzilla franchise. The plot and character development fell nicely into place. Recommend 10/10 must see for entertainment.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. The story and acting were very good. Didn't mind reading the subtitles at all. Godzilla was terrifying
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Man this movie is number 1 in the best movie of 2023 that I want watch it for a second time because it’s that great of a movie.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good acting, Awesome Atomic Breath. Buh Buh Buh Buh."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is absolutely fantastic. 
They give you characters that you actually care about, deal with themes of loss, grief, and guilt (particularly survivor guilt) in a powerful way, and the effects are absolutely first rate. The fact that anyone could make a film this good for only $15 million is unbelievable. 
The movie is a period piece taking place right after the end of World War 2, and transforms the theme of the original Gojira (1954) from a story about the horrors of atomic weapons into a story about the horrors of war in general.
Definitely see this movie on the big screen if you can. It's well worth it."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie (I don't mean that as great-for-a-godzilla-film). With actual investment into its characters, the movie creates an excellent balance of character development, plot, and the titular monster. Legendary needs to look toward this movie and see why people will always go to the classic model (answer: it's a great blend of storytelling and balance). One of the best films of 2023 easily."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the BEST movies I’ve seen in the last year!!! Acting was excellent and Godzilla was scary mean!!! Hope they make a sequel 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla to date. Even the story was great.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Even got misty eyed. I was totally invested in all the characters. This was more than just a GODZILLA movie. Best one yet! 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Quite possibly better than even the original 1954 classic. Godzilla is brutally frightening and the story puts real stakes for our human characters. Godzilla is best when he is an allegory and this hits it out of the park.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow what a movie. Great post war storyline, and for a production budget of 15m it was just amazing. If you are a Godzilla fan, its a must see at the theaters."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome!!! So much better than what Hollywood pumps out. You actually care about the characters and what happens to them. Great storyline!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It made me cry,laugh,frustrated,relieved uncomfortable and yet comfortable at the same time. This was prime cinematography and just prime OG Godzilla it took me back to the feeling when I first watched it with my dad when I was about 4. Was it the best movie of the year to some yes but definitely not to all but over all its 1 of my favorite movie of all time this was amazing just hope the give us a little more Godzilla next time"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"if you are a Godzilla fan, this one is a definite must see."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Liked: Everything
Disliked: Nothing"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great plot, great characters. Monster looked awesome. Lots of drama A+."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best movie Ive seen in a long time. There was nothing in this movie I didnt like. I was on the edge of my seat
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A very well acted reimagining of the classic Godzilla story
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible, good writing, great story and characters. Couple of clunky Godzilla moments but with the low budget I find that still impressive. Hopefully with the success, then next movies will have a higher budget"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is honestly one of the best movies I’ve seen in a very long time, go see this in IMAX if you can before it leaves theaters. Please keep this in theaters longer AMC, I’ll buy more tickets I promise!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,If with having to read  subtitles the entire movie. It was phenomenal!!!! A must see!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Great story, effects. One of the best Godzilla movies ever"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I am very surprised how much I liked it. I totally approve of yet another Godzilla remake. -)
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The perfect Godzilla movie.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a Top Tier Movie, LIke Real. dont spoil just recommend, This is the best film ive seen since the Matrix so many years ago. I cant believe a monster flick could be so good!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome kaiju movie with not only plenty of action and special effects but also a well done human drama surrounding it.  The only detractor for me was the somewhat stilted way that Godzilla was animated when hes walking but otherwise it was absolutely a fun ride with several emotional moments.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this version… it’s awesome
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was absolutely amazing. puts anything hollyweird has made recently to shame.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"70 years have been building to this. Minus One stands as not only the best Godzilla film, but likely the best in the genre. All elements in this film come together in perfect harmony, from the animation (so good at times you'd swear Godzilla was real) to the music to the outstanding cast. The writing is what really makes this movie. Godzilla action is always fun, that's why this franchise has survived for 70 years, but all previous films have suffered from characters who are boring. (and in some cases, downright hateful) Minus One doesn't have that problem. The characters are very well written, and the story with them is fantastic. They grow and face their challenges that mirror the larger conflict of Godzillas rampage. The story tackles grief, PTSD, survivors guilt, and forgiveness in a moving tale that can bring audiences to tears.
Do not miss what I can honestly say is the best movie of the year. See Godzilla on the biggest screen you can and enjoy the ride"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The storytelling and the pacing of the movie kept everyone focused.  And the correct Godzilla to  human interest screen time ratio. But most importantly, Godzilla is the villain once again."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla is great but you find yourself really caring for the lead charachters and the family and relationships. You become invested with these charachters which clearly defines Godzilla as the villian in this and you want to see his demise for their safety.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best films in 2023 hands down, I really like the approach that was taken with this film and the message it delivers about national pride, the horrors of war and the effects on its people. If you are even contemplating seeing this film do yourself a favor and go see it."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved it, maybe the best of all the Godzilla movies"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely the best Godzilla movie of all time! At first it does the hardest thing to pull off in a Godzilla movie and you actually care about the human characters. The throwbacks to the 50s original with soundtrack and plot points are blended in seamlessly. I saw it in an MXC theater and it is the loudest film I have ever heard sounded as if Godzilla actually roared in my face. It also has horror movie aspects mixed with heartbreaking moments. 
An instant classic!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great….stop making me rate
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie with great acting, visuals, and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat, despite how much Godzilla tends to be absent on the screen. Definitely worth the price of admission, and then some."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie, Human story is so good, which is usually the downfall of kaiju movies. 10/10. Go see it so we can get more of these."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie in color, it was even better without color, it reminded me of a Kurosawa film. Highly recommend!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bringing Godzilla back to its roots, loved it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great to have TOHO back in control. A great amount of heart and mayhem. A fun ride as Godzilla comes off as terrifying and menacing.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"70 years later and Toho still knows how to make a phenomenal Godzilla film. I imagine the way the 1954 version of Godzilla left a lasting, on the edge of your seat impression to audiences for the first time, this film will provoke the same reaction."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Generally, you can separate the Godzilla movies into several categories… the eras in which they were produced, the American/Japanese films, etc.  I tend to divide them up into categories in which Godzilla is the ""hero"" (often the films where he battles other kaiju) and the ones in which Godzilla is a threatening presence. In the latter category, the original 1954 film will always be at the top.  Shin Godzilla (2016) was an interesting entry, and brought a sense of horror with the political commentary, but my two favorites after the original are still Godzilla Returns (1984) and Godzilla Minus One (2023).  Minus One's human interest story was full of heart, and truly moving, with themes of shame, guilt, forgiveness, redemption, and ultimately, life. And this incarnation of Godzilla was terrifying.  Definitely in my top five Godzilla films."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie Ive seen
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,There where  well deserved applause at the end.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is definitely one of the best movies of 2023. It's absolutely a must watch movie!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie yet
"Dec 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was ok. i was probably expecting more. it was too much of a drama and plot unlike a typical Godzilla movie.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, everything except for one moment in the ending was perfect, so willing to forgive that tidbit. Perfect movie overall and I’m not even a Godzilla fan, I took my kid to see it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wonderful retelling of a story thats been told before but with less heart and style. This is a first rate movie, not just a first rate Godzilla movie."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies ever made. The special effects, music, story and acting were all top notch."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent film  harkens back to the original 1954 film
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I have seen this year. The monster in the movie is actually not Godzilla. 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Japanese Godzilla Movie!! Plot and Special Effects on Par with Excellent equal to or somewhat better than Shin Godzilla., Toho best be making its sequel."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"beautiful story, well portrayed"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent, very much like the old Godzilla movies, all about the story but not skimping on Godzilla himself, playing music at just the right parts and not needlessly and you can actually hear the dialog. Hollywood better take notice as this is how a movie should be done, 10 out of 10."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is one of the greatest Godzilla films ever made. It delivers all the exciting, intense & visually stunning monster action along with an equally compelling human story. The characters are likeable & fleshed out & the emotional core is strong. Go see this one!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing number one Godzilla movie
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"So, first of all....The only Godzilla movies I have seen is the one from 2014...king of the monsters....and godzilla vs. kong. They were okay.

This movie blew my mind on all spectrums. I went to go see it with my 60 year old dad.

Right after the movie ended, I looked to my dad, and asked him how it was.

With a straight face..he said, ""Oh yea, by far the best Godzilla of all time. Easily.""

I hope this gets movie of the year...because it 100% deserves it."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie period. The Legendary Godzilla crew needs to take a page from them on how to develop characters and add to the tense situations. 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Brought back memories of the original Godzilla movie including the soundtrack.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily one of the best Big G movies ever!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was one of the best films I’ve seen all year. Easily a Top 3 Godzilla film for me along with the original from 1954 and Shin Godzilla.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was incredible. Such great storytelling. Amazing characters development and such a real representation of what it would be like if Godzilla was real. I laughed, I cried, and I even got scared. This was epic!!! 100%"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie in years. Much better than the Monster Verse.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, just wow. What a great movie that was. Everything from the story, to the acting, to the cinematography, to Godzilla himself, to his moves, to the plan to take him down, to the lessons taught in this movie. I could go on & on, this was not only a great Godzilla movie, but just a great movie period. If you're on the fence about going to watch this, please go!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A thrilling period picture. Refresh yourself on this franchise.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was time for Godzilla back to Japan. Love movies from Japan.  The cinematography and actions scenes are incredible.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever! See it. 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is phenomenal
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent! One of the best movies of the year. Good stories bring people together!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"First off, it was beautiful and shot in a retro style, making it look like not just the characters but the actual film belonged in the days just before the first Godzilla movie. It's also one of the only kaiju movies that made me care much about the human soap opera. The characters are written and acted with depth, and the film explores the theme of sacrifice on both a personal and a cultural level. It's not just a good kaiju movie. It's a good movie for anybody who reads subtitles."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is so good!! Great action sequences, well developed characters that I genuinely cared about. Saw it in 4DX and the effects really enhanced the experience. Definitely gonna see this a few times!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing! I never thought I would care so much about the human story in a Godzilla film, but there were times it made me tear up."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is an amazing movie bringing back how Godzilla was original portrayed in 1954. The classic Godzilla music and the roar from a pervious incarnation give us fans a little nod. I can't put into words how good this movie is.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great origin story, human story, and special effects."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie!!  This is probably the most well written Godzilla film to have come out in a long time.  Its plot base and development of the characters are well written and  established.  Depressing and sad at times also.  This is a human driven story with Godzilla as the attraction.  You care about what happens to the character and the people.   Godzilla is NOT a hero in this film!  He is an angry pissed off force of nature.  When Godzilla shows up he doesn't mess around.  For a low budget movie (cost is a reported 15 million) the visual and special effects are top notch.  The movie is by no means perfect, but this comes pretty close.   Disney should be embarrassed with their 200-300 million plus flop films that was released recently.   This is movie is an overall great movie in general!  Even if you are not a Godzilla or Kaiju fan,  this will appeal to the wider general audiences."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best of the best. Best Godzilla movie made
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw it early Saturday morning but wanted to sit on my thoughts and see how I felt after some time. Hot dang, this movie is amazing! Of the Godzilla films that I have seen, this is definitely top tier in my opinion. To start off, the story is truly captivating, heartfelt and told so well. It had a perfectly paced build with a satisfying climax and conclusion. Another positive is that even though it is a foreign film and it had subtitles, it caused me to have to pay even closer attention to it which made me appreciate the film that much more. At no point was I bored or wanting it to end but on the contrary it kept me invested and wanting more.  With only a budget of $15 million, this film used it effectively. Did it have its flaws? Yes at moments however they made it work and put out an amazing film. I am going to rate this film a 9.5 out of 10."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A Godzilla film with heart.  The first Japanese Godzilla film I’ve seen in the theater.  I hope Toho releases another Kaiju film sooner rather than later.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,How Godzilla was meant for the big screen.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went to see Godzilla with my son on opening night. We both loved it .. a nice balance of a human central story some monster mayhem. I'm also 50 and he's 19, so it definitely appealed to both our different age groups."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the Best Godzilla movie ever made! And thats not hyperbole. Ive never been more emotionally invested in a Godzilla movie than this one. They made Godzilla scary and malevolent again but also he still felt like an animal trying to survive. Even reading subtitles, I felt for all the characters and didnt want anything to happen to anyone."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Horrifying and tenseful. Full of clever references to the original 1954 movie.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding job! I was very impressed.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I admit, I'm a long time Godzilla fan. This movie has a great plot, characters you care about, and is just a fun romp. My wife, who isn't a huge Godzilla fan, loved the movie too. It's the best movie I have seen in a long time."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is arguably one of the best Godzilla films. Not only does it bring Godzilla back to its roots regarding the post-World War nuclear metaphor, it also creates a stirring narrative about national (and individual) trauma. This, paired with incredibly stirring characters, a cohesive plot, and riveting musical score, Godzilla Minus One is the Godzilla film many have been waiting for."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had been waiting to this for one full year and was not disappointed. This Godzilla film fully explored the human angle and employed very skilled actors to take the audience in. There are moments that will shock you and will make you cry. The sheer devastating affect upon the people is overwhelming. The director is more than just a director wearing the hats of director, special effects creator, and writer. This guy knew exactly how to make this film, and this film most certainly rival the lassie of all classics, the original Gidzilla, King of the Monsters. This is not a ""monster"" movie. It is a movie where people have been brought down to their knees, and then pushed into the ground... and how they respond to those circumstances. Dramatic, terrifying, exhilarating, and oddly realistic, you should see this film."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was great to see Toho make a great movie, even with a different take on the Godzilla story."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top 3 Godzilla films of all time! Unlike the American versions, the human story was engaging, emotional, and believable. All of the action scenes featuring Godzilla were amazingly done, also considering the much smaller film budget compared to the US franchise. I absolutely loved it and will be seeing it again in theaters. Please go out and see this on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. Thank you TOHO"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this movie last night in IMAX and it is now my absolute favorite Godzilla movie. The story is very well done and I actually cared about the characters.  I normally root for Godzilla, but in this time I was torn.  It was an emotional rollercoaster.  The graphics are incredible for a 15 million budget. This movie is more than graphics.  I feel that our criticism of graphics in movies has led ""hollywood"" to think that is all we want for entertainment.  This movie is so much more than graphics.  It has a storyline we can invest in, characters we care about, lots of action for entertainment, a very good music score and the best iteration of Godzilla to date.  For me it checked off all the boxes.  One of it not the best movie I have seen in years."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down the best movie of the year...
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,An entertaining retelling of Godzilla complete with a t-rex like godzilla that munches people a la og Jurassic Park style.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic Toho remake of the classic!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a Godzilla fan, this could be the best Godzilla movie ever created.  If you are not a fan of Godzilla, it still has the entertainment of a classic disaster movie where you care about the characters and how they surive."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,first time watching a Japanese Godzilla film and loved it. the story was great and sad. Godzilla was awesome and evil!!! would love to see a sequel with this story.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Not your typical monster movie! More of a character development redemption war movie than a straight up action action monster flick but the special effects and fight scenes might be the best Ive ever seen in any movie. Interesting plot but some of the acting was a little stilted otherwise this would rate 5 stars for me. But it was worth the price and an entertaining movie.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a big Godzilla fan to start off, the films usually try to introduce the film to bland characters and a boring premise. This movie is different in the way the characters are more emotional and have reason to be cared for. Godzilla is also menacing and actually scary at times, good movie to enjoy if you want action and drama."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"That film was amazing, it felt like remake of original film hell it's better then both Shin Godzilla and original Godzilla film."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was Amazing! As a long time Godzilla fan this one really blew me away I highly recommend if you have the money to watch it in 4DX because it's such a blast!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun.  I was really surprised by how good this movie is.  Go see it.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"best Godzilla movie. best movie of the year.
this is cinema. must watch!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie!! 
Human story done right 
And Godzilla doing what Godzilla should be doing.
Wrecking everything in his path!!! 
What a great back to basics movie!! Hopefully all the other production companies take note, what you can do with a 15million budget !!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie, story-wise, that has been made!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"New origin story in 1940s Japan, great movie! Come for the giant monster, stay for character driven drama!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Has a good love story but kind off silly
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautifully shot tragedy, grounded in historical fiction. At times it feels like you're watching Dunkirk or Oppenheimer. Often Godzilla movies leave you feeling impatient to get past the human-centric side of the story. That was not the case with Minus One. Its heartfelt characters elevated this film from spectacle to existential. It has been a long time since someone was able to fully and deftly capture the allegory for the horrors of war, that is Godzilla."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ever since the short 30 second teaser came out in July, I've been hooked on this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out. Now after already seeing it twice, all I can say is that this movie is a masterpiece. Godzilla in this movie was genuinely terrifying and really brought back the vibes of the 1954 original. The human characters were perfectly written and Takashi Yamazaki really makes you care about them, and whenever Godzilla is on screen you fear for the humans because you don't know if and when Godzilla could kill them. Yamazaki's Godzilla Minus One is easily in contention for movie of the year and is an instant classic."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a powerful and deeply moving war drama that happens to have Godzilla in it. The characterization and storytelling are handled masterfully by director Takashi Yamazaki, and his complete vision comes across beautifully. The concept feels wholly unique within the existing Godzilla franchise, as well as within the modern cinematic landscape. This movie showcases some of the franchise's most endearing characters, incredible visual effects, and potent commentary on the human condition. All of this on a budget of $15,000,000. Unbelievable!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great acting, even if I had to read subtitles, you could read the emotions on their face and actions.
Special effects were good and wouldn't be surprised in the least if it used both practical and CGI effects well together."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Exceptional character development and great Godzilla destruction.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"My vote for one of the best Godzilla movie I've seen. Hollywood please take notes, this small budget film ($15m) easily beat all of yours."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute masterpiece
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. I grew up watching Godzilla movies. Good story. Great special effects
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I despise subtitles. But I will make an exception for Godzilla Minus One. The movies was so good that I also suspended my love for the campiness of the older movies. I can not wait to see the movie again and I think it should win some awards. I hope this movie nails the billion dollar mark.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a FUN movie in classic Godzilla form.  First G movie where the MONSTER didn't seem to have a SOFTER side at all.  This was just a relentless DESTROYER.  Great depth and emotional twists unusual for G movies.  Not sure that it would be a movie that the uninitiated would find compelling.  Movie TITLE strange, even when you look up the explanation must just be a JAPANESE things"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I could see the obvious progress of quality from ""Shin-Godzilla"" and other Legendary's Godzilla series. It's no doubt thanks to all new creators' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand ""Godzilla"". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno's work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn't catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the music, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a ""real"" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was just a well-made movie. Its not just a good Godzilla movie and a good monster movie, but it had a great story with great characters you get attached to. I highly recommend I can see anyone enjoying this."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. An emotional rumination on war and trauma. See if you like Godzilla or even if you do not.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked that it wasnt just a monster movie.  It has a good story line.  Didnt really like having to read subtitles.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An incredible story reminding us of the origin of this iconic character. I wished there was slightly more on screen time for Godzilla, but it would have taken away from the human elements to this amazing story. This is a must watch for any film lover."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A breath of fresh air amidst all the cookie cutter comic hero, politically motivated, and regurgitated remakes of stories once loved. There is the obvious elephant in the room  in concerns to how the war came to an end but was done in a way to not cheaply push ideals onto new and younger Godzilla fans by simply displaying the disconnect of the value of life from world leaders to the everyday lower class person struggling to get by. Having spent some time in Japan personally and was able to admire how the Japanese people hold values such as honor and respect above all, it was great seeing how someone may have survivor's guilt when failing to carry out a Kamikaze attack and how the people's perspective could change and evolve to value their lives and neighbor's lives above the honor of duty. This perspective ultimately changing in the end with them willing to sacrifice themself when forced to come together to face a devastating threat such as Godzilla. The movie was perfectly shot and edited to pay homage to the original films and just knocked it out of the park in every aspect from the model  and even the movement of the monster as he destroyed the city. *Chef's kiss* The effects and animation was fantastic blurring the lines between practical and computer generated imagery. I saw the film in the new and expensive theaters in 4DX where the seats violently jerked and rocked while air and water misted over us with flashing lights on the flanks to simulate explosions and gunfire so let's just say I got ultimate Godzilla experience. If you're looking to take the kids to see a movie of which you can actually enjoy with them, look no further. This movie is must see in my book and if I'm being honest would trade more of Hollywood for what Japan has to offer. Go see it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Feels like Sunday afternoon Godzilla when I was a kid in the 80s! The characters are unforgettable and when Godzilla appears he's shockingly destructive. The best Godzilla film in years.  Go see it with the biggest group of people you can!  A MUST SEE!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Compassionate non monster storyline plays well off the monster moments. A more serious tone. Godzilla is a step up visually from previous versions. Destruction on a macro level and from an individual point of view is refreshing. Music kicked butt! Must see on IMAX if you can. The sound plays a big part in this movie. Will see again.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The film only ran for 3 days in Germany. I love this film and I want to see more.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great writing, wonderful movie"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. I was actually afraid of this Godzilla…not hokey. Good plot, a lot of substance! Great visuals!  Best ever Godzilla!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It looks like perfect movie I like it 👍
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"We all agreed this is a great way to reboot the original. Very true to the story and yet a deeper human element to the plight of the Japanese people and their families post WWII being ripped apart. Plus it has a expanded scientific evaluation of the new terrible threat of Gojira and since it is the ""first"" movie he is down scaled in size.

The attention to detail is staggering in this film and the soundtrack is incredible and gives a huge nod to the score of the classic it represents. The acting is good, very good in some areas and despite a few drags in the script it is a remarkable movie.

Also I will say this, the CGI isn't top of the notch but it looks a heck of a lot more realistic than the new Aquaman that is coming out that looks borderline cartoon."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although I am not a fan of subtitles, this movie held my interest.  It had a good storyline in addition to the monster."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla fan or not, go see this movie. A serious WW2 drama with deep characters and story lines…..and of course Godzilla. This is the movie we always wanted. The 🐐"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2023, can't go wrong with Godzilla!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece. Scorsese, Nolan; step aside. This is the best film of the year"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best Godzilla movie ever, a great balance between the human screentime and Godzilla’s screen time helped. Just like in Toho’s previous installment, “Shin Godzilla”, they made the King of the Monsters something terrifying. There was one scene that looked like a high blood pressure drug commercial but it’s unlikely anyone would care. 10/10 Must watch. Maybe even twice."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're looking for the best Godzilla film, look no further.  Perhaps in time, after repeated viewings or as the film stands the test of time, my opinion on its position in the franchise may change, but for now, this is it.  The best."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is how you do a Godzilla movie, The characters and story were so well done, Godzilla minus one is a masterpiece."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is really interesting.
You'll want to see it again and again.
You want to talk to someone.
This is a movie, right?"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie that not only looked good but also delivered a performance like no other from it's actors.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Other than the very last moment, there is nothing i would change about this movie and even that is a nit pick. Forget the Godzilla in the title, this is easily one of the most universal, affecting, and impactful human dramas in many years. This is a movie that makes you cheer, cry, and tremble. Every last one of the main characters is compelling and relatable. Hollywood has lost its way so i am glad that Japan can come around and show us yanks how to make fantastic, touching cinema again, even on a relatively shoestring budget, you don't see that anywhere on screen. The effects are wonderful and the acting is even better. The Godzilla scenes ARE great, but the story scenes with the characters were so good, i was almost a bit relieved when there wasn't an action scene. Congratulations, Toho Studios and Japan for this unexpected gem of a film i will happily watch multiple times in cinema. Watch it in the biggest theater with the best sound you can. The music is absolutely perfect."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A true masterpiece of movie making, just sensational the score, the acting, the visual effects just incredible. After horrible movies like THE MARFAILS and THE FLUSH it's great to finally get a movie that leaves me happy when I leave the theatre. I would go as far as saying Perfect."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,More than just a Godzilla movie .
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well done Godzilla movie.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,戦闘機「震電」に乗り込んだ敷島とゴジラのタイマンバトルはかっこよすぎて何度でも見たい
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Normally you would say, remember, this is a Godzilla movie so excuse such and such, this is not the case here. If you manage to pull yourself out of the incredible acting, you would say, I can't believe this quality is in a Godzilla movie."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely beautiful and inspiring/uplifting. I really needed a movie like this. I can only hope it'll inspire others as well.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Godzilla Minus one is the best movie from all Godzilla series from any type of  monsters movies. 
Yamazaki's work as director and also as screenwriter did marvelous work. With drama, tension and sadness and destruction. 
Differently watch this movie on cinema highly recommended."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film. Finally a Kaiju/horror film where you can actually sympathize with the characters and care whether they die or not.

Godzilla was perfectly done. It's refreshing to see a Godzilla film where it/he/she acts as a main antagonist and is simply a ravenous destructive beast. It was truly terrifying."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A monster movie that brought tears to my eyes. The human toll is so great it nothing short of horrifying
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow this was a breath of fresh air! I'm so happy seeing Japanese cinema putting out a great Godzilla movie like this :) Cinema has been stale lately.... so it was nice going to the cinemas to watch something good! This story touched my heart :3 Go Japanese cinema
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The most invigorating Godzilla film to date! In a moment of confusion, Godzilla emerges as the guiding light, leading everyone back to a cinematic nirvana. 
A stellar 5-star experience! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla was the best ever no words can describe truly on how amazing it was
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was bloody awesome  it was probably the best Godzilla movie i have ever seen as a Godzilla fan and i highly recommend watching it🦖
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down the best Godzilla movie ever made. Probably the best IMAX experience I’ve ever had.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Amazing story telling. Amazing cinematography. This is true Godzilla
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A Godzilla movie with heart
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Even with it just carrying subtitles throughout the movie. It was just so good and Godzilla was no disappointment. Great movie…
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down one of, if not the best, Godzilla movies I have ever seen. The movie makes sure to get right into the monster action, while also having a compelling story with wonderful and very likeable characters.

Though, I do recommend that you get some tissues when you see this movie. Because it's an emotional rollercoaster, in all the right ways."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"10/10 An absolute triumph of storytelling and action seamlessly weaved together. Monster movies are not allowed to be this good, but “Godzilla-1” is truly an exception to the rule. I even forgot that the movie was in another language! Don’t miss this."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie and Ive seen them all.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was good af
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal….  What a beautiful movie!!  Plot twist, action, depth… Godzilla Minus One had it all.  Watched it in theaters with my wife and our three early teenage kids, everyone absolutely loved it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute phenomenal movie. The human characters were emotional and actually interesting- you care for them. This film shows the  heartbreak and destruction caused by Godzilla. Japan nails it again as America tries its best-but doesn't come close-to proper Godzilla films such as this.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible! Best monster movie ever! I've seen a lot and this one will surprise you as it has a great story with humans that'll show emotion, laughter and love. The action….wow just wow the scenes with Godzilla were crazy in a destructive way but visually impressive, it's hard to believe it's not a Hollywood blockbuster as this movie has that feel and really deserves a Godzilla size pat on the back for an amazing job what's been produced with this film…wow!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, everything I always wanted Godzilla movies to be , great story line and acting and monster action!!! Great job Toho!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this film was Oscar caliber entertainment! Acting, directing, screeplay, sound, special effects, all of it was top of the line! If the lead actor doesnt get a best actor nomination, it will be a travesty! I'm so glad they did subtitles and not dubbed to English or it would have diminished the whole acting and storytelling of the film. Absolutely one of the best films of the year! If you had told me I'd be teary eyed and gently sobbing at a Godzilla movie, I would have laughed at you, but there I was at the end...and I was not the only one in the theater. I've sat in shock at what I just witnessed at few movies, including Parasite and Saltburn and now I can add Godzilla Minus One to that list. The only complaint would be I don't think they can ever top it, if that can be a complaint. Godzilla Minus One...I went to watch a giant monster and got an actual masterpiece of storytelling. 10/10"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best godzilla movies ever. I hope its a tie in to the ones they're doing now and the monarch series 🙏
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is how it’s done! Good job Japan movie industry! See this Hollywood? This is how you make a movie and it only cost 15 million to make and yet it’s better than any of the 100+ million dollar movies you guys have released. This is a big plus for Godzilla minus 1
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film. ToHo killed this. Everything was well done. Worth seeing again.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One blew all my expectations away — what an incredible film! It. Freaking. Rules! It isn't just an amazing Godzilla film, but one of the best films of the year! This truly puts Hollywood's versions of Godzilla to shame. I'm by no means a Godzilla expert, but this was easily the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen! I haven't seen an audience this excited and visibly satisfied by a movie in quite some time! This film showcases how to make the perfect Godzilla picture with a compelling human ensemble and breathtaking action that's savoured from start to finish.  Plus, it truly takes Godzilla back to being a truly horrifying monster! (And has the coolest use of the Atomic Breath I've ever seen!)

The action is incredible and brutal, and the VFX work is insanely good. I also really loved the cinematography and the killer sound design. Plus, the score is excellent and uses Akira Ifukube's iconic Godzilla theme to great effect.

But the reason this film stands out is because of its combination of great storytelling mixed with great technical achievements. There's reason to care about the characters and a deeply emotional side to this film that makes the monster even more haunting. This is a monster film where the human conflict is just as compelling, if not more so, than the tremendous action sequences. I loved the exploration of the traumas of war and cultural destruction in Japan following WWII, and the ways the characters connected to these themes made for such a strong emotional core. This film has the perfect blend of massive monster mayhem and compelling human drama that really worked. It's so good that you could remove Godzilla from the film and still have a great film. This is a moving, thoughtful Japanese character drama set in post-war Japan that also happens to have a giant horrific monster in it. People are gonna talk about Godzilla Minus One's amazing production and filmmaking, but what surprised me the most was the script. Every character has an arc and serves a purpose, and there are no wasted beats. There are so many great dilemmas and dramatic questions. Also a perfect example of using the monster as a greater metaphor. The result is a thrilling epic that feels grounded and meaningful, and so, so good. 

Godzilla Minus One is a nigh-masterpiece. Not only is Godzilla terrifying again, but the film itself is a powerful drama with some daunting imagery, plenty of emotional moments, sound design to rock the theatre, and a moving character study on post-war guilt and PTSD. It's a genuinely exciting, riveting, emotional disaster flick, delivering drama you care about and thunderous action spectacle. See Minus One on the loudest, biggest screen you can possibly find and enjoy the ride — it's incredible!

(I gotta add… it's like Act One is Jurassic Park, Act Two is Jaws, and Act Three is Dunkirk. Just such an awesome movie!)"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"If your a monster universe lover its 6 stars, if you like Godzilla its a five star.  If you like a good movie its min. 4  star.   5 out of 5 roars."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was such a great movie. The last few years of the Hollywood Godzilla movies often focused on the human stories that really weren't so interesting and made you want Godzilla on screen all the time. This movies' human story along with a great Godzilla hit the right balance and was surprisingly moving.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One in 4DX was so so amazing the best movie of the year!!! Director Takahshi Yamazaki really know how to make this movie perfect!!
Gojira is always the strongest Kaiju!!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever! I didn’t mind reading the subtitles either!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a longtime fan of Godzilla movies, from the earlier films to the modern era, I have been part of a fanbase that has endured both gems and dumpster fires, but I can honestly say this is the best of the modern series started from the 2010s . The IP has the Hollywood-produced Godzilla film of 2014 to thank for the renewed interest that convinced both Japanese and American studios to release a series of new movies, with now three of them playing with the reboot concept. As far as Japanese produced live action theatrical movies, this is the second one after Shin Godzilla in 2016. 

While Shin Godzilla was an interesting and engaging film set in present-day Japan, using the 2011 Tsunami and nuclear disaster as the backdrop, one could definitely feel the Evangelion-inspired direction from Hideki Anno. It even included the same music from the Evangelion composer, Shiro Sagisu. It had an almost exhausting plot that is dialog-heavy that meshes the human suffering, trials and failures along with the politics of managing a situation if such an event were to happen in reality. Although flawed, it is a decent Godzilla film with plenty of over-the-top monster action coupled with a solution that might be possible to pull off in the real world.

Godzilla Minus Zero uses WWII and the start of Postwar Japan as the setting, just as the Japanese faced defeat at the hands of the US, we follow the story of a Kamikaze pilot who must deal with his situation when he chooses to neglect his duty, not willing to die for something he sees as pointless. As he chose not to die, he feels that ""his war is not over,"" and this message is what drives his story. 

His path crosses the famous monster at a relatively early stage of its development, and is described as a dinosaur-like monster, which was interesting to see. The events that follow our small group of characters is a series of highly relatable human struggles as the Japanese citizens try to recover from the war but are faced with another threat in Godzilla. The familiar origin story from previous films of island-based nuclear testing causing mutations in Godzilla is the main cause for its massive size and abilities, including the heat/atomic breath and regenerative properties.

The movie is smart enough to give a very plausible method of defeating the monster, even though we as an audience know it will work in the end, the way it is presented seems possible with the WWII technology of the time. There is some doubt on if it will actually work against the monste, even up until the end of the film. We even get cameos of some famous Japanese warships, so fans of naval history, Kancolle or Azur Lane might get a kick out of that, like I did.

The CGI effects were mostly believable since we're past the point of a man in a rubber suit the play the part of Godzilla. The design and some of the effects of this version of Godzilla reminded me of the 2014 movie, along with some Shin Godzilla elements. This is probably the best Godzilla has looked in any of the modern movies. Godzilla takes up just enough screen time so that you're not bored out of your mind seeing the monster destroy countless buildings, which doesn't actually happen as much as you'd think. Also, we get to see the creature clearly enough, so it's not completely shrouded in mystery.  Regarding Godzilla's attacks, the famous atomic breath is seen as highly devastating, equal to that of an atomic bomb explosion, that is actually used sparingly, and the effects that are presented when Godzilla uses it were impressive. 

Overall, as someone who has seen most of the modern live-action Godzilla movies, this one was the most enjoyable with a believable plot and highly relatable characters. It takes the human element of people struggling to survive in a postwar environment coupled with the unknown threat of a seemingly invincible monster. It is brilliantly directed with actors that truly convey the weight of their situation that never crosses the line of something superhuman to overcome the threat in Godzilla. Using subtle visual effects, excellent cinematography, a smart script along with some of the classic soundtrack of the old Godzilla movies, it does feel like this movie could have been made in the same period as those old movies. There's no attempt to go overboard and give the audience sensory overload to convince them what they are watching is a good film, like with modern superhero movies.

As a Godzilla movie, it is probably the best and out of all the movies this year in 2023, this is one of the best, if not THE best."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece, not just an incredible Godzilla movie but an incredible science fiction film. The plot is dramatic, you connect to the characters, and the action, the action is something else. The destruction caused by Godzilla is done in such a way that feels realistic but doesn't scale back on Godzilla's power. Godzilla comes across as force of nature. Overall, no complaints if I'm not nitpicking."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Arguably, if not, the best Godzilla movie hands down. This will take you on such an emotional journey, and the give you a sinister feeling of when, and what Godzilla will do next to the people of Japan in its most vulnerable state after WW2 is over. Go support this movie! Toho knocked it out the park with this one."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing film from start to finish. Keeps you engaged with all the main cast and Godzilla is terrifying. Highly recommend to those not familiar with Godzilla as a fresh beginning. Will be watching again!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an absolutely incredible movie! I love every aspect of what was done with this. Godzilla's new look and horrifying temperament made for one terrifying big screen experience. The music was very well done  But there were also plenty of moments that had very heavy atmosphere where there was no background music or ambient sound to distract you from what was on screen. In the aftermath of all of godzilla's destruction the lingering silence was very eerie. The way they did his voice and overall temperament, In this case aggression towards mankind was incredible. The way Godzilla developed throughout the movie as a result of atomic radiation was amazing to see.  Some of the aerial scenes from an airplane perspective had me just about jumping out of my seat as godzilla was snapping his jaws at the pilot. I watched this twice in the d box at megaplex and both times felt like this was almost like a ride and a movie because the seats would move in conjunction with the waves affecting the boats on screen. Because this is a foreign film I do not know any of the actors but the entire cabsolutely nailed it and did a fantastic job. In some godzilla movies the human element leaves much to be desired that is certainly not the case in this masterpiece of a movie. This is probably the best godzilla movie I've ever seen and I have seen them all.  If you're looking for a fun thrilling movie I highly recommend you go see this while it's in the movie theater to enjoy it and all of its majesty on the big screen!!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with great story and monster action
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Shin Godzilla is good, this one is even better"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best godzilla movies to date..y wife enjoy it as well and she doesn't like this kind of stuff.  go see this movie before it out of the theater.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A renew on the classic Godzilla, this movie was so much fun ngl, was not boring also the lady next to me had hella snacks, like this lady brought the whole dollar tree candys, she passed like 6 different types of gummies, offered every chocolate dollar tree offers and legit opened a brand new pack of baby wipes and she didnt even have a baby. Once movie finished I was expecting a mess around due to how much snacks she had , but nah, this lady was respectful and it surprised me how much snacks fit in her Louis Vuitton purse. What a great lady she was. Movie was great, my neighbor was great, dollar tree snacks smack 100% and she also gave my kids a pokemon boost pack? I dont know much about pokemon but the kids liked it. If youre the lady who was sitting next to me and youre reading this, I am thankful for people like you."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,a good remake of the very first Japanese movie!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It takes Godzilla back to his roots of tearing up Japan
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie. It's brutal, horrifying, gripping, and heart wrenching."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVED IT. CLASSIC GODZILLA! Plus a genuinely heart warming story.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Top 3 movie this year
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!!! A must see for any Godzilla fan!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hes BAAAAAAACK!

Story action Godzilla! If I had three thumbs they would all be up! Go see it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic side movie to the original Godzilla. USA has mostly lost the art of the cinema other than a few directors. Happy to see Japan can show us what cinema should look like. Take lessons America.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was thrilled to see an action-packed movie with a genuine soul. The visual effects looked consistently good.

One of the best films I've seen all year."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never thought I would gove a movie a 100%, but this is just perfection. Best movie of the year by far. Excellent, really excellent writing. Godzilla's design is awesome also."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily one of the best, if not the best, Godzilla movie I've ever seen. Not only are of the scenes with the Big G amazing but the Humans characters are just phenomenal. This is one of the only monster movies I've seen where every time the monster is on screen I'm genuinely terrified for what's going to happen to our main cast."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie to watch. Good storyline. A throwback to what movies were. Greatly enjoyed the characters and overall movie. 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,2023 movie of the year!   Beautiful characters and terrifying monster
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably my new favorite Godzilla movie to date. Had a blast watching it. Simply incredible
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,great story and visuals is entertaining
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see movie if you are Godzilla fan. The action was epic.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not your typical repeat of every Hollywood script. Well written, incredibly well-acted, and totally engaging. Yes, you have to read subtitles... but even my 14 y/o son said it was the best move he has seen this year."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,HELL FREAKN YES!!!! GO SEE IT GO SEE IT GO SEE IT!!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was surprised by how absorbed I got into this film. And was impressed with literally every actor on the screen. What a rare treat. I also think Hollywood should take a lesson from this movie: The special effects are tasteful and do not try to become the story. They compliment the story. Well done.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Oh man this was the highlight of my year. Such a great story and the action and cg were great. No part of the runtime is waisted and I hope this gets a sequel.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best monster movies always have compelling characters and people-level conflict at their heart, and this one is really beautifully thought-out, written, and acted. The story of a ""failed"" kamikaze pilot isn't one I've seen really in any media, and he makes for a fascinating center of a movie about how to go on living after calamity. The decision to have all the big action setpieces in sunny broad daylight is a bold one (and a nice foil to the 2014 Godzilla) that mostly works, but it does mean all the CGI....looks like CGI."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,10 out of 10 would recommend
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,WOW A GODZILLA WITH AN EASY TO FOLLOW HUMAN STORY AND LOTS OF GODZILLA ACTION THROUGH OUT THE WHOLE STORY. CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS FOR ANOTHER ACTUALLY GOOD GODZILLA MOVIE.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is pretty much perfect.  The story here is unique and compelling, with post-World War II Japan being the perfect setting for this thoughtful and intense kaiju film.  The movie also does a great job of balancing a human storyline against the ferocity of Godzilla, and never shies away from giving the big lizard plenty of screentime.  The only aspect of this movie that may be considered a negative by some is that it is a pure Japanese language film, with only English subtitles; given the subject matter here, however, I felt that this was a brilliant choice that really added to the experience of the film.  This is hands down the best Godzilla movie that I have ever watched, and just a really great film overall.  I'd highly recommend it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla at his badassiest
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just got out the movie theater and this movie is epic, Godzilla was terrifying every time he showed up, and for once I didn't mind the human stories (well Toho's human stories are always decent to good).  Can't wait to get this on DVD or streaming because there were a ton of scene's I quickly wanted to rewind haha.  I've only seen 2 movies this year, and both were 5/5.  Awesome job Toho!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow. What a great movie.  No message or agenda.   Humans showing emotions.   This looks better at 15 million dollar budget that Captain marvel at 300 million.  Probably the most fun I have had at the movies all year.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best movie I've seen in years. My son and I saw it Thursday. Tomorrow I'm taking my wife and daughter to see it also. Even though they aren't into the monster verse like us they will enjoy the movie. My new favorite Godzilla!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie , super fun! It was so cool and chilling and emotionally hits hard. Strongly recommended"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,great job with the movie. Loved it!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, godzilla himself was a beast, human characters where great too 👍🏼"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great characters 
Great story
Great pacing 
Sound is amazing 
Terror and tension all there 
The movie is shot so well if you took the Godzilla out of it
Scenes look so grounded"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must watch. Finally, a truly powerful and menacing godzilla "
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie all around. Even if it didn't have Godzilla in it I'd have enjoyed it.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is an absolute modern day masterpiece. It's like all of what the original thrills the audiences of the first Godzilla films must have felt... but somehow masterfully transfigured into the modern world.. I'm not the hugest Godzilla fan or know much about it but I felt like I was there in the first time people saw the monster tearing apart the world.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"If this movie doesnt win best picture they should retire the academy Beautifully done, poignant and emotional at times, great characters, the story kept you emotionally committed and Godzilla was scary as hell, menacing. Hollywood cant do this Toho is the true masters of the franchise and its set for sequels"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Arguably one of the best films of 2023 and possibly the best of the entire Godzilla franchise.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic movie. First Godzilla movie in a long time that I actually was rooting for the humans. The human parts were compelling and emotional. The monster parts for terrifying.

I caution that those with PTSD be prepared, especially if you have survivor 's guilt, like myself.

Fully love this movie, in spite of that."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, like watching the og movies when I was a kid. Even my dad was freaking out"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a dream come true.  Having heard many great things about this film, I just couldn't wait to see it. And having done so now, it has far exceeded my expectations. It is a love letter to the original 1954 Japanese film 'Gojira', which in itself is a classic. 70 years later, TOHO has now made that classic into a 2023 Masterpiece. This is an amazing post-war story, one of tragedy, love, and loss. The main characters are believable and you feel their anguish and pain. It's a very smart, clever film that will grab you and not let you go. The audio and soundtrack is perfect. The sets and special effects are nothing short of astonishing - the best we've seen. This is a tremendous movie, and the best part is that it's a Godzilla film for the ages. Not only is it the Best Godzilla film we are likely to ever see, but it's also one of the best monster films ever made."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was definitely one of the best movies of 2023. Japan knows what they are doing. The movie was so good telling the story of the side effects of war and the story of Japan's side of World War II. Tying it in with the sci fi of Godzilla was just a perfect match up for a great film. The story was filled with emotion and incredible moments and storytelling. Which why I can say this was definitely one of the best movies of the  year.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever!!!!!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The Godzilla movie everyone has wanted.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is hands down the best Godzilla movie yet. This period piece finally gives us a human story with emotions in which we dread to see Godzilla. Everytime he arrives on scene we are filled with excitement at his power but dread at what he may do. We want the characters we follow to survive in a way I haven't felt before in other kaiju films.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a master piece. Just 15 million dollars can make this? It was a really emotional, and thrilling movie. You don't even need to be a Godzilla fan to like this movie. You will love it. And that's a ganranted."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal from beginning to end. Captivating story and excellent execution!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only Godzilla story that invokes the same feeling as the original. A near perfect modern recreation with its own small twists. Likable characters, stellar action moments, and meaningful messages. Stayed faithful to the franchise the entire time. The only downside for myself was the theater we watched at showed this on one of their worst projectors, definitely wish I could have seen this IMAX if I knew it was this good."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was nothing less than INCREDIBLE!!! A absolute must watch regardless of if you are a Godzilla fan or someone getting to experience a Godzilla movie for the first time. Not only was Godzilla an absolute beast, but the story of the movie with the humans was absolutely perfect. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very dark and true to the original godzilla I like how ruthless he is
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie that takes Godzilla to the next level and sets the bar for future movies!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Makes you remember how terrifying godzilla can be visually stunning and great compelling characters. A must watch in IMAX
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies if not the best movie of 2023, the raw nature force of Godzilla is truly terrifying on the big screen. The story telling is top notch and the roller coaster of emotions felt throughout leaves you on the edge of your seat as the great cast makes you feel for them especially the main character."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Aside from some translation issues regarding aircraft it was a great film. I enjoyed the human drama along with the monster parts. It was well done and one of the best Godzilla movies I have seen in a while. Considering I liked Shin Godzilla that says a lot.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute perfection.
"Dec 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is one of the best Godzilla movies ever made! I should know. I've been watching Godzilla movies since I was five years old. It's essentially a reimagined version of the first Godzilla film released in 1954. 

This is a Japanese movie with English subtitles that kicks things off at the end of World War II in war-torn Tokyo. The plot is definitely man vs. monster. This is not a multi-monster extravaganza and Godzilla is not a good guy this time around. Facing impossible odds, our protagonists (Japanese Navy veterans and civilians) employ science and ingenuity to take on a seemingly invincible, radioactive creature from the deep. 

I'll admit, the film drags at times between battles and attacks, but a good plot means you can't have non-stop action or the audience would be exhausted. What will really blow your mind is that this film was made on a shoestring budget of only $15 million. I guess when you have a good story, you don't need $200 million in CGI and special effects. Directors and Producers all over Hollywood need to take a good look in the mirror and question how much money it actually takes to deliver a movie with a good story.

""Godzilla Minus One"" should definitely be in the running for best foreign film at the Oscars. I loved it and I think you will too. I give this film 3 1/2 stars out of 5."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The story was amazing and so were the portrayers. Good screen time for the big G. Loved it
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,There aren’t any describable words that I can possibly use.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely Awesome!  Edge of your seat movie, deep story line, every emotional"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I could see some who just wanted mindless action might not like the pacing. I thought Minus One did what it's predecessors have all failed to do, it offered up a compelling story for it's human characters, I was invested in their stories, I cared if they lived or died. Godzilla looked great and by far the best atomic breath of any Godzilla movie. Don't let the subtitles scare you off, you want the theater experience for this one!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've always been a Godzilla fan, but I can honestly say this is the first Godzilla movie that actually tells a really good story."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down, movie of the year. This movie had everything. I was expecting a cheezy monster movie, but it was a spectacular vision of the plight of two young people devoted to each other in the midst of a disaster movie."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece of emotional storytelling!

Wonderful characters, action, and music! This is what cinema should be! ✨"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Masterclass of a film. A brilliant reimagining of a beloved classic, and one of the rare instances of a Godzilla film having great human protagonists. The stakes were high, the visuals were outstanding, Godzilla was menacing, and the acting was top notch. An absolute love letter to the franchise and its fans. To think this film was created on a budget of $15 million. Not a dime wasted."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is an emotionally impactful human drama set against the backdrop of a devastated post-WW2 Japan and the emergence of an existential threat in the form of Godzilla. 

Godzilla Minus One is focused on a young soldier wracked with guilt over his actions during the war. His struggle to accept LIFE and allow himself to love again is very moving.  Godzilla is the threat to those he cares about but also the opportunity to resolve his crisis, assuage his feelings of guilt and redeem himself.

The special effects are impressive despite an almost unbelievably small budget. There is a reality to the devastation that was never achieved post the original film. Add to it that one CARES about the characters.

The score is very affecting and unusual for a Godzilla film. There were wonderful callbacks to Ifukube's score to the original (earlier) films too.

Artfully directed, well written, earnestedly acted by a convincing ensemble cast...this is, surprisingly, one of the best movies of the year."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film that leaves you wanting more. The build up of the human story is the driving force behind the movie, and Godzilla is a force to be reckoned with. You almost don’t want it to show up but when it does, it’s horrifying and intense. Great film, the best this year."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"the story, characters, and even the introduction of godzilla were perfect. No hopefully american media can learn from this masterpiece."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very well-crafted and powerful film that rivals the original ""Gojira"" in excellence. An epic war drama with Godzilla serving to further drive an already-compelling story with truly fleshed-out characters. The film never loses pace, whether or not Godzilla is on screen, and the film is shot so as to keep the viewer constantly mesmerized by what is happening on-screen. You can tell that the cast and crew set out to craft a very powerful film that has much to say on the themes of life, perseverance and the quest for identity in a changing world. This is truly a film that is sure to be enjoyed by both casual moviegoers and fans of the franchise."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Huge Godzilla fan. This movie ex exceeded all expectations. Must See. Looking forward to what's coming next.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla was actually scary, humans weren't boring, what's not to love?"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla has always been a cinema icon, but this film has took him back to his roots. A very compelling story with a great cast and some very suspenseful scenes that had me on my toes. Didn't think Godzilla could be scary but they made it happen, it's a must see for any fan of the franchise or even any fan of monster flicks."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is truly one best if not the best movie in the whole franchise.  A true masterpiece, eith a great plot along with human characters you actually care about. Godzilla returns to his original villain ways, and looks amazing!. Go watch this Godzilla flick, you won't regret it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic. I came into the movie with moderate expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Great pacing, I actually cared about the human characters and their stories. I highly recommend. Top 3 Godzilla Movies of all time."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a Lifetime Godzilla fan, this had to be the best Godzilla fill ever, period! Even out doing the 1954 original that started it all. This movie has everything. Excitement, Horror and even great Heartfelt Human moments. You will find yourself rooting for the people involved and caring about what they are going through. Something the American Godzilla films can never do. This is hands down a MUST WATCH movie for everyone, as you do not even have to be a Godzilla Fan to appreciate this film."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down one of if not the best Godzilla movie ever made. Mt son and I absolutely loved it.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Traditional style Godzilla movie, but with an element of unmatched character and story development. I consider this the best movie of the last 20 years. If you like Godzilla then don't hesitate to see this movie immediately."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! It was a human story with a monster in it!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Like other viewers said the movie was terrifying yet awesome!  Highly recommended!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing!! The best Godzilla movie in recent history!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever made and really great sub plot
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzillia movie in a long time must see for any godzilla fan
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie in Decades!! 
Poor Green guy, why won't humans stop picking on him!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Possibly the best Godzilla movie. However, even better this is more than a great 'monster movie.' This is a great movie, the best I've seen this year!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Breathtaking.
Wonderful story with great effects and action.
I would have liked to see a little more destruction from Godzilla, but that's something I find with every Godzilla movie.
The time that is used to show the destruction caused by Godzilla is top-notch; immaculately choreographed with some awesome, in the classical sense, camera angles, sounds, and visual effects that were very engrossing.
More importantly though, the characters and their stories were the most engrossing of any Godzilla or other monster movie film I'd seen, and I really grew to like all of them. 
5/5 stars"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The acting, writing, editing, cinematography, visual effects were all top tier. Easily one of the best films in years."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A Godzilla movie where I actually care about the characters? What is this dark magic?
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up watching Godzilla so I had to go see it. Me & my husband went to go see it. OMG by far the best Godzilla movie, the acting is great. If you're a fan of Godzilla you will love this movie."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great strategy for the cgi and phenomenal story to make sure Godzilla's screentime counts. Have to give credit to the acting as well. The pain, anger, self-conflict was very accurately portrayed."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a wonderful story with characters I cared about. I was so absorbed in the movie I didn't even notice I was reading the subtitles. I cried at the end. When do you ever cry at a godzilla movie?
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A phenomenal story and journey. You feel every explosion and roar. Fights were epic and the human story was compelling. The ONLY thing I knock it for is the at-times wonky animation.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing the story was amazing I wish it had more Godzilla
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"ok, not exactly at 5 stars, but damn close. The subtitles at first annoyed me .but then it was actually better than dubbing in the words. The only reason it's not 5 stars is not enough Godzilla, and I like Godzilla more as a good Godzilla as opposed to a bad one.  Fighting another Kaju is the best, but im nitpicking  .it's was flipping GEEAT!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is possibly the best movie I have ever seen.  It was a flawless film that even my dad loved.  This is definitely movie of the year in my opinion and the best Godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,f’ing awesome remake. 
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic script, acting, and visuals. Best Godzilla movie of all time."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best movie I've seen in a theater in years. Hollywood really needs to get it together.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie to date!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see!!! Awesome movie!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Toho has brought new life to this new entry of the Godzilla franchise. It takes some of the best parts of previous movies and makes something new. I’ve been a fan of Godzilla movies for years, and the acting, story, and special effects are the best I have ever seen. If you have never seen a Godzilla film, this one is a masterpiece to start with."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A completely different take on Godzilla movies that has substance at its core anchored by human intracacies and story telling that connect you to the movie through heart-wrenching story that is complemented artfully with Godzilla as a backdrop adding action, thrills, and symbolic meaning. It's a substantive movie that is worth the watch."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story with tension and a great pay off.  It is unbelievable how good Godzilla looked on a $15M budget.  Godzilla's atomic breath is truly atomic!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Experienced this in 4DX.  While my theater didn't take advantage of all the scents it could've, the well timed motion, action was beyond awesome.  Fyi don't bother woth snacks. The movie itself was well done, realistic setting for bringing WW2 era vibe.  The subtitles were barely noticeable , and the acting was done so well I forgot I was reading it.  Its simplified script was beyond successful in using actors expressively without having much dialogue or backstory to sustain it.  It was not as campy as the ones in the past, and I was impressed with their creation of the monster - while far fetched at times, it did not appear CGI or a rubber suit. I left still not understanding Godzillas motivation or origination and the Title had to be explained to me.....they were being clever and vague on the battle score.....I think no matter what format you see it in...it's a great flick."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Now THAT'S a Godzilla film! Superb!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. TOHO produced another great Godzilla movie. That wasnt just a monster movie. But a movie about people recovering from more war and their own struggles dealing with it.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great special effects. Human story was though-provoking
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie excellent graphics for this group of Godzilla movie
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Godzilla might win an Oscar! The acting, cinematography, and direction were great.  Dealt with timeless themes about survival, loss, family, courage, and sacrifice. Godzilla is the proverbial dragon come to destroy an already destroyed kingdom. Can you slay the dragon in spite of your fear?  Must it come with the ultimate sacrifice? Good movie."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Top tier Godzilla and quite possibly the best movie ever made.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. A creative turn for the Godzilla franchise dealing with a post World War 2 Japan. The story focuses on a Kamikaze pilot that let fear keep him from doing his duty. Godzilla becomes his  chance for redemption. Definitely going to see it again
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Simply the best movie of 2023 and 2024 probably the best film of my lifetime and I’m only 33 years
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Still in shock as I’m writing this. One of the best Godzilla movies ever made, and my favorite movie of the year. Every character is unforgettable and has their moment to shine. Godzilla is terrifying, loud, and awesome. The score is dreadfully intense, and the visuals are fantastic for a movie with a tenth of the budget that many big American films are made with. I didn’t think Toho would do it again so soon after Shin Godzilla, but Godzilla Minus One is an instant masterpiece."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really brings the vibe of classic Godzilla movies, and the story between the characters is enjoyable. OG music also gave me goosebumps. I can only pray this is the beginning of more movies to come"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent storyline & the effects were awesome! Loved the original godzilla score!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quite possibly perfect. A perfect movie, not just a perfect Godzilla movie."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The plot in this movie was absolutely breath taking. At first I didn’t think I would like it due to the subtitles but the amount of work that went into this movie was unreal. I was amazed that it topped Godzilla vs king ghidora even though there was no monster for Godzilla to go up against and it was just him vs the humans. Really loved the thought that went into the plot. I actually connected with the characters which is not the usual for action movies. The acting was also fantastic. That level of storytelling and emotion in an action movie is something that has been lacking. Loved it!!! Must watch again. And paired it with the 4DX for the extra experience.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fantastic movie with great music, a most menacing Godzilla, with good acting and great callbacks to older Godzilla movies. It was the most emotional of all G movies in my opinion, which is a good thing."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was fun from beginning to end. And low key..  the acting was great.  Super super worth it.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,As a Godzilla fan I would have to say that this movie is absolutely fantastic!!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, old school storyline. Lots of practical effects, minimal CGI was well integrated. Great acting. I don't want the humans to die, unlike in all the US versions of Godzilla!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I came to see what has been by far the best 2023 movie. I've seen all year. The emotional feeling from start to finish really said something about this story. My top Godzilla film by far and the subtitles was a joy and a better experience in Japanese.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent humanist themes of redemption and fighting for what life is truly about.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"As someone who has seen all godzilla movies across all eras, this movie is ranked amongst the top 4."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!! Movie of the year!!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,4DX and this movie are a combo made in heaven. This was my first 4DX experience and Godzilla Minus One has made me a believer.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Monster looked amazing, wouldn’t have guessed the budget so small. The ptsd displayed by the main character was very believable"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely incredible. I plan on seeing it again in theaters.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing experience in IMAX!  The way the movie is shot is beautiful and immersive.  Loved the human story and really shows a part of post WW2 Japan and the scars of war.  Loved that G man was basically a personification of the nuclear devastation.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Together with Shin Godzilla, TOHO brings back the original premise of 1954 Godzilla to a global audience: A human centric story where the citizens work together to have a fighting chance against Godzilla, a walking unstoppable monster that brings the nation to brick of annihilation, even if the government fails them. 

What's shocking is the amount of risk Toho taking with the setting: A post World War 2 Japan, with the protagonist being a Kami Kaze pilot (If you aren't familiar, these are the suicide jets that flies straight to high value targets without any means of escape)

I am pleased to say the movie does not glorify the WW2 Japan, it's a movie about survival, wanting to live, wanting to move beyond the haunting past that has drown the nation.

The movie says a lot about how Japanese felt during post-war Japan: the anger, nihilism, sorrow, makes it difficult for some to even accept the joy of life. Some eventually did, some are still living in the past.

Godzilla, being the ""villain"" of the movie, brings in yet another complete destruction that valuable rebuilt progress. Sounds familiar? The constant Earthquakes in Japan, the ""lost decades of Japan"" after the economic crisis. For a nation that tries so hard, it seems the odds are always stacked against them. The glimmer of hope just never stays.

The plot spends a lot of time and effort building up its characters, which are exceptionally well crafted and the relationship between them are organic and easy to like.
This gives every scene that we used to cheer for, Godzilla appearing/using heat ray, an entirely different atmosphere. 

We see the level of destruction closely on the ground, and the amount of damage being done to the precious rebuild effort is heartbreaking for the audience. And of course, how the loss of lives and rebuild effort destroyed extinguished the hope and optimism along as well.

It also does something rarely seen in western cinema nowadays, where plots are mostly in the extremes: ""Look at how mighty our nation is"" vs ""Look at how terrible and shameful our past is"" (the former is vanishing even)
While not saying these movies don't have their importance, but very rarely do we get any movies that brings the nation together through collective pain and bring in positivity despite all odds.

While some would call this an Anti-war movie, this is more about existentialism which is a common theme in Japanese works, and ironically this philosophy originated from France/Germany post world war 1 and frankly has vanished from most western literary/cinema. 

Overall, for the average audience, this is a great movie with great sound track/sound effect, decent visual. For Godzilla fans, this brings back the horror and OG Godzilla feel. 
For movie lovers, this is a great work about humanity and Japan's spirit, a reminisce of the peak Japanese movie decades from the 70s.

Japan is on its path of economic recovery, with great results in sports/arts etc in the past few years.
This movie and Shin Godzilla are love letters to the Japanese people, for their resilient and willing to take responsibility for a better future despite all the flaws from the system or the past."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,For a movie that's at a disadvantage and this is the BEST movie of 2023 by far!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie in my lifetime...has everything you love in a movie from plot to characters it did not disappoint...
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good movie. The post WW2 setting and imagery worked well, human characters were easy to follow and identify with, and unlike the Hollywood godzilla films, computer graphics weren’t as overwhelming. One of the better godzilla films for sure."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant work of drama and companion piece to the 1954 landmark original.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It just wasnt a monster movie, it was a complete movie. I rate it 2 after the 1954 movie. The best of 2023. Hollywood just got its butt kicked good. Toho rules."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic adaptation to the classic Godzilla story. This is one of the top 3 Godzilla movies of all time. I can not recommend it enough!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched the movie earlier today and omg… Really one of the best Godzilla movies I’ve ever seen and top 5 films of mine ever made this is great really and you should really check this out. Very heartwarming human story and a super badass Godzilla!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,love this movie! easily one of the best Kaiju films to date and definitely needs to be seen in theaters.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece!!!!! I grew up watching Godzilla with my dad and have been a huge fan since I can remember and this movie is hands down the greatest Godzilla movie ever! The story, the music, the action, seeing him back to his roots of being the villain and damn does he look terrifying!!! So well done. Could not have been any better."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,👌👌👌 100% recommended!! 🔥
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie looks absolutely amazing. Far better than anything Hollywood has produced.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Story and characters were great. Godzilla was a beast especially the scenes in the ocean.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,absolutely phenomenal film
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"godzilla minus one Best 2023 movie of the year hands down, No woke crap, just pure authentic cinematic glory, writers and producers knew exactly how to represent Godzilla and the humans 👍"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,More than just a monster movie. An incredibly well made and beautiful story that you are completely immersed in. One of the best movies I've ever seen.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Top 5 Godzilla movies of all time. Time well spent.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, great score, impressive visuals and soild storytelling. I think of it as what the original 1954 team envisioned but couldn't do due to limitations of technology and government restrictions."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The most realistic Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, best movie of the year."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm a 48 year old, life long Godzilla fan.  I believe that Minus One is the best modern Godzilla film since 2001's  GMK.  Besides a few non distracting nods to the 1954 film, Minus One is very different from the rest.   It has a very strong and compelling human story.  It probably has the best writing of any Godzilla film in that regards.  It may be set in a post war Japan, but it is far from being a remake of the 1954 film."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie for $15 million.  The effects were good if not perfect, but you hardly care because the movie is engaging. Lots of emotion, and as a family man, there were some genuinely touching moments. The set up was good, character growth all around, and the finale was well-earned as a result. You should see this movie if you don't mind subtitles. Oscar- worthy."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was absolutely amazing. It had great action scenes, and an actual engaging human element. I would recommend this to everyone. It was tense, fun and also, at times, very touching."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was absolutely great. No movie has ever brought me to tears like this one. I loved every single moment. If you have a chance watch this movie not just once , but twice! This movie is unforgettable and a masterpiece!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is hands down the BEST movie I've seen this year. It's Oscar-worthy, and that's not hyperbole. The script is perfect. The themes explored are deep and heartfelt - the post-war trauma of an entire nation, survivor guilt, shame, PTSD, what makes a family, love, redemption, forgiving others, forgiving oneself, the value of life, and choosing to live in the face of terrible odds. You'd never think a movie about a giant monster stomping on stuff would make you feel for and root for the human characters, but Godzilla Minus One does just that.  I can't say this enough - go watch it. If you were ever a Godzilla fan, go watch it. Even if you were never a Godzilla fan, go watch it. This movie is easily one of the best movies of 2023.  And all for a very modest 15 million-dollar budget, compared to the hundreds of millions Hollywood pours into its (often disappointing) blockbusters."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best Kaiju Film ever! Period, end of story. The blending of history and the start of Godzilla's evolution/Mythology was amazing. The acting wasn't overwhelming and it served as a guide through the destruction of Godzilla physically and mentally."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Gorilla is my one favorite monster
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Those looking for a popcorn creature feature with 90 minutes of no plot and wall-to-wall destruction may find themselves disappointed with this Japanese feature, celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the longest running franchise. But those looking for the definition of CINEMA, will be rewarded with thrilling action sequences, special effects that beat out every Marvel and DC comic universe entry to date, an epic film score, stunning cinematography, and most surprising of all, a heartfelt poetic story supported by a stellar and earnest emotional cast performance."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very loud but had unexpected character plots. Its not just about the monster.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen! Well done to all involved in the making of this film.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a Godzilla movie that doesn't strictly rely on special effects. A cast of great actors who make you care about their characters. Hopefully we get a sequel because this movie deserves it!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies of all time, amazing story, Godzilla back to his roots of being a terror, absolute masterpiece highly recommend."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,My adult son is a huge fan of the lore. He asked if I wanted to check it out and I said Yes - cuz I love going to the movie theater. No great expectations - and just got blown away. Incredible characters. Engaging storyline. Great movie making. Must see movie. In the theater. Don’t miss it!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely must see.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me, it's one of the best, if not THE best films of the year. Movies in Hollywood recently have shifted a-bit away from what a good movie is about. For a small budget of 15m$ this movie was a masterpiece. Godzilla was great, human characters were great, story was great, CG was great. So if you ask me about my complaints, I do have two small ones (that aren't really complaints actually): I would appreciate a little more Godzilla sequences, and the CG did look a bit rough on the edges in some really rare occasions. That said, I enjoyed the whole thing and even if the G-man wasn't on screen all the time, I was still invested in the human characters, which is rare in a Godzilla movie these days. Two hours went by without me noticing, because I didn't get bored. Granted, not all people will connect 100% with the movie, it depends on wether you are a Godzilla fan or not for example, or if you have some knowledge of how Japan suffered from WWII ect. But I do think that every viewer will enjoy at least some parts of the movie if not all of it. I really recommend seeing it, even if it's subtitled, you won't even feel it like an issue anymore after the first 5 minutes of the movie, because you will be invested. Great story, great performance, emotional at times, and GODZILLA.WAS.AWESOME."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie Was So Good! My only dislike is the movement of Godzilla being when he was walking but I was told the reason and why. A MUST SEE!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"OK, normally a Godzilla movie, especially made by Toho, is always pretty cheesy, with the guy in a suit stomping Tokyo.   Yeah, it is Godzilla, but there's most likely never going to be an Oscar for the actors.  

I just got back from the newest Godzilla movie... ""Godzilla Minus One"".   It is excellent, and this is one that should be seen in the theaters.  

Now, how do you tell an epic story, and make it a great movie too?  You do it not by telling about the main event, but about the people who are in the main event.  A good example of this is ""Saving Private Ryan"".   If it was just a regular war movie, showing nothing but D-Day, it would have been OK, but just mediocre.   However, it was a great movie because it focused not on D-Day, but on one character... Private Ryan... and how to get him home.  

So, narrow the story down to one person, or just a few.  

""Godzilla Minus One"" has done this.  It is the story of a Japanese Kamikaze pilot, who chickened out, and due to this he has massive guilt.  Something else happened (no spoilers) where he chickened out again, so now he has to go home to a devastated Tokyo, that was destroyed by the fire bombing campaign at the end of WWII.

The story focuses on him, and his new family, and about him trying to get over the PTSD of WWII.  


This is why the new Godzilla movie is excellent, because it has a great story.  It is not just about the giant lizard who shoots nuclear beams."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla is terrifying. I love that they keep finding ways to keep the story fresh. In this one we see the beginnings of Godzilla from the point of view of the ordinary people. I wish we would have gotten a bit more Godzilla action but what we got was new and awesome. More please.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Dang good movie !! Go see it !!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must watch in IMAX!!!! Or at least in theaters. In my opinion, this is the best movie of this year as well as the best Godzilla/monster movie ever!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus one is perhaps the Best Godzilla movie ever made. Godzilla is a creature that just wants to destroy everything in its path.   The back story is interesting too.   I will probably see it again.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,genuinely might be the best godzilla movie of all time. i have watched around 40 0f the 50 or so movies in the franchise and i am confident in saying that this one is the best.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is absolutely the best Godzilla movie ever made. it has heart, has suspense and the special effects is outstanding and Godzilla is a badass in this movie it's a must see film!!!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic.  I cried THREE TIMES.  

Imagine feeling like an ostracized outcast for not sacrificing your life on two consecutive occasions.  You would feel completely alone and worthless.  How do you even come back from that?  Do you sacrifice your life the way everyone seems to demand?  What happens to your kid if you do?  Do you sacrifice yourself for her?   What happens to her then?  

I won't spoil any more for you, but that's the kind of stuff the main character deals with.  It's an all too common story for so many these days, and it really hit home for me.  

That's the kind of deep drama that has been missing from theaters for far too long.  American cinema is dead.  The Japanese just proved it."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Love that the movie isn’t the traditional monster mash movie. This Godzilla stands out above the rest
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great practical effects. More movies should be like this. Take note Hollywood! Bravo Japan! ❤️
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent redemption story that happened to have a murderous monster in it.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It’s not just the best Godzilla movie ever, it’s Letters from Iwo Jima, Schindlers List good. Riveting, heartfelt, emotional. Simply awesome."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever. Storyline is strong and moving.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"perfect rendition of godzilla, a little bit of the old and new, it is perfect for any fan whether they are die-hard or new to it. wonderful story to boot as well."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie and personality my favorite of all the recent Godzilla films
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Quite possibly the greatest Godzilla movie of all time! This Japanese film is far better than anything Hollywood has produced in years.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I am a Godzilla fanatic and this movie delivers on all fronts. Minus one delivers on what all American made Godzilla movies miss on. The humans feel real and you can connect with every emotion they go through. Will be watching this one for years to come
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful and brutal as a Godzilla movie should be.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece, every single scene had me hooked, emotional and stunned. Truly breathtaking and a must watch even if you're not a Godzilla fan you will enjoy this movie, amazing story and visuals please go see it!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant. What Godzilla is and always has been about.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it!  Terrific cinematic masterpiece, not another campy monster movie. The story and characters have depth and keeping the original Japanese with subtitles preserves the depth of the movie.  This is the original story, stunningly retold. It is one to see in the theater on the big screen."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,After 70 years of Godzilla movies they finally nailed it. Absolute 10/10. Even if you think you aren’t a fan of Godzilla movies there is no way that you won’t be a fan by the time the credits roll.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"loved this movie can't wait for the sequel....no politics or bs in the story at all. I think it's the first Godzilla movie which focused deeply on the characters. You actually care about the characters, had real emotional depth which surprised me for a Godzilla movie. I usually just want to see Godzilla kill things and smash stuff. So so so good, and tiny $15M budget wow. Hollywood, Disney and the like should wake up and learn that $250M+ budgets are stupid. Not necessary unless you're physically building massive sets like an actual replica of the Titanic ship....CGI costs in the US are way out of control. Fantastic Godzilla movie, amazing acting and story! I'm gonna see it again but in IMAX!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolut blockbuster must see!
Was going in with lower expectations and was absolutely stunned in the first 10 minutes. Film keeps pace till the end - good story, really good CGI and really good acting. Perfect sound and music score.
Went 2x to the cinema. Second time was as good as first time."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I have ever seen.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a nice storyline to complement the destruction and mayhem.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,So good.  Great story and character development.  Not just another popcorn movie that’s out there.  This one has substance.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best movie of 2023 so far. Toho absolutely nailed it. Great performances and a story that will make you forget it's a monster movie for a bit.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,My son and his friends LOVED it!
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best movie I have seen this year.  Great story and good action. It was better than other films that I have seen with 100 million budgets.  I would go see it again.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen every single Godzilla property. Multiple times. I'm about as an over the top fan of Godzilla as you get. But recognizing my own bias, this is still an amazing movie. Easily one of the top Godzilla films of all time. It does what many Godzilla movies fall short of accomplishing, that is telling a compelling story with Godzilla acting as a driving force and unique tool to drive the plot forward and drive home the narrative. Possibly the best Godzilla film since the original 1954."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"An awesome kaiju epic with emotion as big and strong as Godzilla himself, perfectly written characters and expertly crafted action scenes will leave you earning for more once the credits begin to roll"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best monster movie since Jaws. Exceeded my expectations. Must watch in theaters.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was epic. The D-Box loungers made it like a ride at a theme park.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The human drama is as strong as Godzilla. Great credit goes to director and writer Takashi Yamazaki for crafting what may be the greatest Godzilla movie of all time and just a great movie period. The depth and development of the characters is the best I've seen since Ishiro Honda's original 1954 masterpiece.
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla/kaiju movie ever! Great story line, great effects, and great cinematography. So much detail throughout, had to watch it twice! Enjoyed it both times!"
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,this is now my favorite godzilla film! The story was very well done and actually made you care about the characters. Godzilla loomed incredible and scary
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing it’s definitely a must see I will definitely watch it again 
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Impressed that this only cost 15 million to make.  The worst thing about this movie was the guy eating a bagged lunch next to me.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,THE ABSOLUTE BEST GODZILLA MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A-MAZ-ING!!!! As a Godzilla fan since I was a kid from the 1970s, this is by far the best. Japan decided to remind us how Godzilla came to be and you also have a heart-warming story to make this more than a monster movie. We literally watch the evolution of Godzilla as more bombs are exploded on him. Thank goodness this was subtitled and not dubbed! Definitely watching this again on the big screen!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie overall! No real complaints
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies! Highly recommended 👍🏼
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really good story with Godzilla right in the middle of it..  Awesome!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. The story was shockingly touching, good characters, the CGI was very good, the action was exhilarating, and themes were done well. The one thing that nags it down is the pacing can be slow at points even though a good story is still being told. This is the Godzilla I've been waiting for over a decade, and it delivered everything I wanted. This is what I wanted the 2014 one to be. Great movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!!!!!  Cant wait for the blu-ray release!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly moving. Some pundits are all action and that's what they want and expect. This was human drama and gave you heroes you could identify with and root for. It just happened to have a kaiju as the villain. But every time that little kid showed up on screen, I teared up. The plot to defeat Godzilla was a little far fetched, but its science fiction. Most sci-fi is far fetched. This movie could even be called a period piece. It was of the times reminiscent of post-war Japan. The costumes, the setting, the people and their struggles were rooted in realism and those times. Well acted, great special effects, a sense of reality. A monster movie that works. A good time in the theater."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal. A couple of nitpicks here and there, but this Godzilla fan was very satisfied."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is truly how Godzilla is suppose to be! 
Truly the KING OF THE MONSTERS FOREVER!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best since 1954.  Good story.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Impeccable film, it's all you could want in a monster film."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie!!! Loved it!!!! going to see again!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one in my opinion did a great homage of the original, without spoiling anything, the new take of this version was great, I understand some people are upset that just like our 1st take on godzilla(2014) with the monsterverse, then you know the major problem with that movie, basically same as this one, Stoll a great movie though"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The plot on how they killed Godzilla.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was phenomenal. This movie is one of the best movies of 2023. The film had a budget of $15 million and portrayed the film with high quality. The action, story, character development, CGI, and etc were awesome. The films' Godzilla fighting scenes and spectacular human story combined with human emotional connection keeps you and your family engaged from the start to the end of the movie. This movie is the top Godzilla movie and if not my favorite film of all time by far. Watch it and learn something in life.🤗"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, will definitely see it again."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect balance of action set pieces and character drama.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Growing up and watching Raymond Burr broadcast Godzilla in black & white tv, I took my son to watch Godzilla Minus One in an iMax theatre. The storyline kept true, the roar was a Godzilla and the music was from the original. Now its my sons turn to carry on"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie I saw all year.  I enjoyed the fact they kept it in Japanese and did the subtitles in English.  I won't spoil the movie so others can enjoy it.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The BEST Godzilla movie since the 1954 original Gojira. It was everything you could want in a monster movie and more.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible MOVIE. Not just monster movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Still a great movie.  Different visual impact from the first.  Gives a more appropriate feel for the time setting.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw godzilla minus one today and it was the best godzilla movie to date the acting, the atmosphere and the characters were all amazing there were a few scenes that made me cry and the main cast do such a magnificent job in there roles and godzilla was a true force to be reckoned with and a true terrifying creature that hasn't been seen since  the 1954 movie, this movie is a masterpiece and everyone who are new or old godzilla fans or even casual movie goers are sure to get a kick out of this 10/10 movie the best godzilla movie in the decade."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest movie ever
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This GMAN movie is nearly perfect. Certainly the best Japanese Godzilla since the ""classic 1954 original"". Great story, great acting, surprisingly good effects. Serious
drama. No other monsters to make it goofy. A new classic that will be hard to beat by Hollywood. Even if you don't like or care about Godzilla you will be very glad you saw it."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies of 2023. Definetly best godzilla movies.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A magnificent sequel that like last year's ""TOP GUN: MAVERICK"", it may just outshine and outdo its original predecessor."
"Dec 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much talks
Less godzilla action"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is excellent! Extremely close in style and tone to the original Gojira. We both loved the acting, the storyline, and that the monster almost looks like a guy in a 200-lb suit (it isn't it's CGI). Good G design, and one slightly oomphed-up G element that screams to be part of the action figure and for some unknown reason isn't. There are only a few plot holes that we both hand-waved away because Godzilla. It's just over 2 hours long and we both only got restless at about the midpoint. Suporting characters also well-written and acted. We also started spontaneously directing the traditional G music when it appeared.

As soon as this comes to streaming, it gets my money."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a perfect Godzilla movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie experience. This may be the best Godzilla film ever.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gigantic stakes, Intense drama, Wonderful story. Legendary take notes. This is the Godzilla movie not just for 2023/2024 but for the 2020's. This is the mountain to scale."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is the ultimate villain , the bringer of death & destruction but humanity continues to fight , the will to survive .
Godzilla : Minus One is by far the greatest Kaiju spectacul ever made with a genuine human aspect, something that is never been a factor in any Godzilla movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding film. The finest Godzilla film ever, surpasses the original. Big G is terrifying and acts like a king. The human element is enthralling. Touches on the effects of love, loss and war. Just incredible."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was so amazing great story !! Feel like original series I gave a A+
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It stays true to the time period. Love the Godzilla scenes
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a must see for any fan of the original Godzilla movies.  It is a perfect blend of retro theme, engaging human stories, and awesome effects and sounds!  As a veteran, I was impressed by the authentic hardware and military customs represented in the movie.  Godzilla is back!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece that the American Monsterverse should take note of.  This movie is like the 1954 original movie. Very dark and makes Godzilla scary as hell. The CGI has a few issues, but that is from what I hear. This movie only cost 15 million to make, and if that is the case, it's one of the greatest movies ever made. The Story is very similar to the 1954 just set right after World War II, which was a great idea. 
Kamiki Ryunosuke, who is Koichi, gives an Oscar performance as a veteran who is living with PTSD. Along with Minami Hamabe, who is Noriko gives you Characters that feel real, not like the American versions. 
The people really sell this movie. They are so good, every one of them. As a Veteran, at some point, I even cried. The way everyone portrayed the aftermath was so gripping. This is not a typical Godzilla movie. This is truly and one of a kind movie that must be seen. Oscar containers all around on this movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was excellent movie I enjoyed. All cants are great. I cried.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than the 1954 original, and it's not even close. Tightly written and directed, acting good enough to make you forgive subtitles, beautiful homages to '54 and GMK. Best depiction of survivor's guilt you'll ever see put to film. So good I'm dropping a review, and I never do this kind of thing. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed. Best thing I've seen in years."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie. must see. the best godzilla movie by far. bring tissue, very emotional"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A traditional Godzilla movie, meaning Humanity vs a force of nature. Probably one of the best Godzilla movies ever"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS is how you tell a story.  THIS is how you develop characters (so you actually care about them by movie's end).  

Superb movie that does run a bit long...but 100% worth it by the end.  

A++++++"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic film. Everything you are looking for from a Godzilla movie
"Dec 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Needs more Godzilla ...in a Godzilla movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much, much better than expected! Just as compelling and serious as the original 1954 movie, but with the production values and visual effects from the more recent MonsterVerse fare!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie made story was very captivating. Godzilla look 👀 was terrifying good really enjoyed it.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies in the franchise and very impressive quality based on how small of a budget they had to work with. I hope they give the production company more money for the sequel so we can see how much better they can make this new series of Godzilla films.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie… Hollywood take note
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a fantastic movie that is definitely in my top three Godzilla movies to watch. I was interested in just about all the characters that made this movie come together and of course a fantastic Godzilla. Do yourself a favor and go see this in the big screen.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is maybe the best Godzilla movie ever. Unbelievable what these filmmakers did on that budget. Movie is solid wire to wire. The human characters are actually interesting and you don't mind going along from their pov through the story.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie in 4D at Pathé De Kuip, Rotterdam.
This is the best Godzilla movie i have seen in a long time, not to mention the budget of minus one was only 15 mil. 
Hollywood needs to take notes!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent!!! classic Godzilla
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is a very well written and very well directed Godzilla film that revolves around the Message of Moving on through your guilt and finding the beauties in life to live. This is one huge winner For Toho and For all Godzilla fans. I was in love with The Heart Wretching moments and terrified when Godzilla was on Screen. I absolutely applaud this film. 9/10. Run! Don't Walk to see this movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding story that keeps you interested in the characters and has you pulling for them against incredible odds. Probably one of if not the best Godzilla film ever made. Special effects were great even with its much lower budget than a typical Hollywood film. Godzilla is a force to be reckoned with and is terrifying at times and once again shows why he is ""King of the monsters"""
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever made.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla I've seen in years. Godzilla is truly horrifying in a few scenes. His face in one scene in particular was one of the scariest monster faces I've ever seen, in any franchise, not just Godzilla. I usually dont expect much from the back stories  of Godzilla movies, but this one was done really well. It was well thought out and acted convincingly. The back story had real weight and invoked genuine emotions in the audience. It brought a tear to my eye at one point and I assure you, that is no easy feat. This is an independent movie and does NOT require having seen any other movie in the franchise. I would HIGHLY recommend this to any fan of monsters or action movies."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. best Godzila to ever fill the big screen.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla and movies
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie! Great cast, great story, great direction, great special effects, great soundtrack! an emotional story which brought tears to my eyes at end."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. A great fresh take on the big lizard. 
A new story. Probably my favorite Godzilla movie.  A good look at the real Godzilla and not just the Americanized version (which I also like)."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,#GodzillaMinusOne is an incredible film. The whole family loved it and can’t wait to see it again and again. It’s a masterpiece which will no doubt be racking up nominations come awards season. Do yourself a favor and see this movie; you won’t be disappointed.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,wow. best Godzilla movie and my best of the year
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies ever and one of my favorite movies ever too
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just saw the new movie last night. I thought it was fantastic. Beautiful direction and script. The cast did a spectacular job. Truly a great movie. Godzilla was pretty scary, just like the original 1954 movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Characters were able to keep me involved in their stories. Even though the amount of screen time for the main antagonist was limited, it was spread out enough that you weren’t wondering where he was or missing his presence…"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Showcases the best traits of humanity against The Beast. Must see movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,There needs to be a rating higher than 5 stars. This is an A+++++. The humanity and threads of fate and trauma were so perfectly woven together. THIS is how you do a legacy movie. THIS is how you celebrate an anniversary. This was sheer perfection on the screen and what movie going should be about.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie! I cried 😭
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla is the best version I have ever seen!!! Godzillas size makes him menacing and a predator to the people of Japan. I totally recons watching it!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I think that this is the best Godzilla movie ever and will stand the rest of time.  This rendering Godzilla is a MUST see and it's because the story is REAL and the action is awesome.  That's my take-so go see it and enjoy a QUALITY movie for once in a long time.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything you've heard about this being one of the greatest Godzilla films ever made is true. Come hell or high water, you need to see this film."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterclass in not in just monster movies, but filmmaking."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla Movie. So many elements brought into this movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Love story with Godzilla
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great all around. One of the best Godzilla films. A real must see. You don't need 200 million to make a movie. Good writing, and visual effects were amazing."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,What an absolute masterpiece! Hands down the best Godzilla movie I've seen.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally Godzilla gets a movie worthy of him and its actually not about him.  Dont misunderstand if you like the Alpha Dog Titan stomping and breathing atomic breath youre going to like this, but thats a vehicle to move the cast through a poignant story of regaining dignity and burying the ghosts of the past. As a Boomer I grew up with Godzilla and understood very well he was a metaphor for the Atomic Age.  Then over time he devolved into  almost a joke.  His rebirth in the 2014 Godzilla was amazing if you love the monster and a decent enough movie overall but I cant tell you that until today Ive seen an actually great piece of cinema in the entirety of the catalog - the 1954 original being maybe the closest.  Well I have now."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the Godzilla we have all been waiting for, where the monster is a monster, he is not a ""good guy"" and is not interested in being a friend of the people, as we have been led to believe in the most recent incarnations.  Good storytelling, fast-paced and a whole lot of fun to watch."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Return to classic Godzilla horror form, without a large portion of the cheese. The story about the humans around Godzilla was much higher quality than most other Kaiju films, but you absolutely miss the big man when he's off screen and still manage to hate his guts when he's on screen.  The second to last scene feels a bit like a cop out of some earlier decisions in the plot. I'd say it's mostly an improvement from Shin Godzilla across the board. They took what they learned from Shin and really honed it in, easily putting this in the conversation for best Godzilla film ever."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies to date. Goes back to its original roots and gives us a fresh new take on Godzilla.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. I felt invested in the characters. Value driven story arch. A few nit pick criticisms but on a different level than standard studio drivel.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just got home from the Cinema and i have to say, the movie is really great. It has a really good story and the King of Monsters has actually quite a lot of screen time and when he‘s there, oh boy. I highly recommend to go and watch it for yourselfs. I am actually mad at our local Cinema that they aren‘t showing it in imax and/or 4dx."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,best godzilla movie ever
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla film in my opinion. Toho knows how to deliver its golden boy to the world. Keep it simple. Godzilla attacks Japan and also at sea. He is unforgiving and destructive. The original roar! The human storyline was refreshing and performed perfectly. There were scenes that paid homage to the original film. I love this movie. It brought us back to why we all became Godzilla fans. Legendary started off this way but eventually lost its way as it is no longer the Monsterverse, it’s now the Kongsterverse. Thank you for this well made film, Toho! "
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I did not expect such a good film in this day and age of big budget disappointments. A human story in a monster movie? It is possible - makers of this movie have proven that. At moments, it felt like live action ""Grave of the Fireflies"", it's that gripping… Go see it while you can!!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down the most compelling human story in a Godzilla movie of all time. While, at the same time, we get one of the most ferocious and destructive Godzillas of all time. An absolute must-see"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. Went on a lark. Wasn't expecting it to be one of the best movies I've seen in ages. Great monster, great 'fight' scenes, amazing storyline for the actual humans in the movie. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
"Dec 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The story is strong, the humans are actually human, and Godzilla is Godzilla. I was satisfied with it. 🍅"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Post war feelings, check.
Godzilla being a complete badass, check.
Good human characters you care for, check.
First time I actually wanted Godzilla dead.
If you are a Godzilla fan this is a MUST WATCH"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a good kigu moviwith practical effects.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Best Godzilla ever.  Great story.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whether you're a long-time Godzilla fan or someone being dragged to go see this by a long-time Godzilla fan, this entry in the franchise does not disappoint and exceeds expectations in many ways.  Godzilla is truly terrifying and the human characters are engaging enough to make you care about them."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, what a great movie. Very well written, a humanistic view of what would happen if Godzilla attacked. Loved how the director pulled this off. Pays homage to the franchise. Hey, Hollywood, you should pay attention to what happens when great writing, directing, and not forcing your political agenda on people does to movie making."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Grate story, and grate animason and music and the famely drama made it hit oooh so harder go and enjoy gojira"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a good well made movie. Story. Visuals. Themes. Well done.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing Display of using your little Budget where it matters how is it possible that this movie looked better with its budget of 15 Million than Godzilla 2014 with its 160 Million, the movie is Atmospheric, looks great, great Human Characters, Epic Score and a Godzilla that is with Shin Godzilla probably the most Scary and Evil Version that Japan brought to the big screen. Give it a watch one of the best movies of the Year, and definitly one of the best if not the best modern Godzilla movie !"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just like with Shin Gojira, we finally have another director that *truly* understands the meaning behind Gojira.

The horror and trauma of war completely front and center of the plot and driving force behind the story. Gojira is back as he was originally intended; a true manifestation of what the civilians of Japan endured in WWII, from the actions of *both* the Japanese Government and United States. From the Japanese Government abandoning their civilians to starve, sacrifice and waste away, to the bombings from the United States. We can also see this by just witnessing the countless deaths we see on screen.

This is a true force of Gojira and the unstoppable threat of his mere existence. The American Godzilla as an idea is nothing compared to Gojira.

The only thing holding me back from a higher rating is a few instances of poorly-handled visual effects, and the terrible choice for a title name."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla: Minus One is an AWESOME movie if you can handle subtitles.

It has a great story with complex human characters.  I don't eant to give to much away, but the writing and storytelling is incredible.

I DEFINITELY recommend it, but it is a subtitle movie.  The dialog was clean enough that I had no issue keeping up with reading.

I can't remember the last movie that I saw in a theater that was this good with such an authentic human story, and it is a monster movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Go watch it. You'll want to watch it again right after.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was the one Godzilla fans have been waiting for. A masterpiece in every sense of the word and it derserves consideration from the Academy.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie to date!!! Loved the design and the acting was very good as well!!! 
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a game changer in how old school movies mixed with today's special effects. When even the human element of the storyline is gripping, poignant, and gee, INTERESTING - then that just enhances ANY monster movie.
Me and my entire family absolutely loved this flick. Godzilla is undoubtedly a MONSTER! Make no mistake.
With this movie only costing $15 million to make - Hollywood should take heed. Especially Disney and their Marvel brand.
Script is King."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the CGI and the characters were not cheesy at all. The soundtrack was on point! If I had one complaint it would be that I wish they would stop showing almost all the scenes with Godzilla in trailers leading up to the movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,JusT came out of a 9am showing and OMG!! This movie is a Tear jerker and an absolute emotional roller coaster. Oh and Godzilla is in it and he's an absolute Unit. My favorite Godzilla movie bar None and favorite Movie of 2023. This is why we Love movies
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Was awesome. Great character development. Godzilla theme score just kicked in at the perfect times.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie with great storyline, and returning to Godzilla's roots with mass destruction.  
My two kids (10 and 12) loved it.   I highly suggest you tell your kids the backdrop beforehand. I explained WW2 which they knew about but went into detail on how Tokyo was demolished and what Kamikaze pilots were and their purpose.   Subtitles were not an issue for my kids. I wouldn't take very young kids tho, since there is a story going on besides just a monster, that a young child will totally miss out on if they can't read substitutes or have a limited vocabulary. 

This is more than just a monster movie, tho Godzilla creature was in fine form.  The kamikaze's storyline was nicely done.   The overall storyline was realistic too and the movie had very few implausible situations which is essential to enjoyment.  
Everyone clapped at the end of the movie and there were all ages there. 
Now I understand the reave reviews and 98% rotten tomato rating!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"In a movie with awesome Kaiju destruction, the human element stood out. Incredibly heavy lessons about humanity and family launches this movie to the top of any list of best Godzilla movies."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Action starts ASAP the movie doesnt feel like 2 hrs and Godzilla is pissed off - Great story telling makes you care about all the human characters! thats a plus - even non Godzilla fans will like it
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The film stayed true to the original style of cinematic photography but better. Great story great acting and Godzilla really activates his back and destroys!!! Awesome film !! Great soundtrack also and effects..
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best godzilla movie ever. This comes from a lifelong fan. You do not have to be a godzilla fan to enjoy this movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie by a mile, brutal action sequences yet character development whereby you care about characters."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was timeless. I highly encourage anyone to see it, especially if you liked the original. The music is fantastic, the human characters are great, godzilla is phenomenal and it only used a 15m budget. Masterfully written, pays homage to the original, puts modern Hollywood to shame."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not only an amazing Godzilla movie, it's a great movie, period. We tend to classify Godzilla movies in their own category because even if a Godzilla movie is called ""good"" by fans, it typically is a mediocre or bad movie by everyone else's standards.
Not this one. This one is a great movie that really makes you care about the characters being terrorized by a 200-ton radioactive dinosaur.
It's hands down the best Toho Godzilla movie ever made. And I've been a fan since the 70s."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Breath taking action scenes hep together by gripping character drama.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is literally what a Godzilla film should be like. And the story with the humans was one of the best stories I have ever seen in my life.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lifetime fan of Godzilla films. Toho has rebooted the franchise a handful of times but has always resisted the urge to remake the 1954 film considering it sacred. So when they decided to do this finally I was skeptical. I can confidentially say as a 40 year fan of the G-Man, it's never done this well.

 There's numerous homages to the 1954 film and some are really really well done. This is the best Godzilla movie ever and it hurts to say ….but better than the 54' film. This thing was made with love for the franchise and its roots."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best modern day Godzilla movie. Toho gets it so right and the human plot is actually great!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Godzilla movie I've ever watched, and I've pretty much watched them all. Even those who aren't Godzilla fans and simply watch it as a high concept disaster movie will be entertained."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a long time Godzilla fan I would say this ties with the original for best Godzilla movie for me. My 10 year old son is a relatively new Godzilla fan, and he also rated it as his top Godzilla movie. The movie is great for a wide range of ages and familiarities with the franchise. The characters are easy to become invested in, even my 10 year old was unsure if he was rooting for Godzilla or the protagonists by the end of the movie. I cannot recommend highly enough."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. A lot of overacting but entertaining. Though the creature was a little slow moving! Overall a good movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just the best movie of the Toho franchise, but a fantastic movie in general. If there is not a best foreign film Oscar nomination, the system is broke. 
This film deserves the 100%"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This, this is how you make a Zilla movie!
Hollywood, take note!"
"Dec 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wish I rate it at 0. Kamikaze?! Really? I wonder what WW II fallen heroes would say about this movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Godzilla is absolutely terrifying and the humans are equally as compelling I have no words for how amazed and happy i felt leaving this movie. I'm a life long Godzilla fan and seeing a Godzilla movie this good was so refreshing.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't see enough  of godzilla
"Dec 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was so mid my Asian gf called it mid 1 a total of 56 times in 2 hours.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"🏆90%
……………………………….."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best modern godzilla film
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I struggle to think of anything that I dislike about this film. 

Despite my 5 stars, this isn't a perfect film, make no mistake.
I wish we saw more Godzilla. The water effects at times were a bit meh... Especially regarding the foam. 

But I left the cinema feeling happy and satisfied. This is a great film that I have to nitpick to find fault with it. The acting was incredible, the characters were likeable and fleshed out. I felt for the characters!!! Godzilla's actions were terrifying.
I felt like the characters were on the precipice of death - without feeling overwhelmed and smothered by hopelessness - in fact I felt the opposite - hope... a really powerful message - which perhaps towards the end gets a little obvious - But my oh my - This film earns it's ending!

5/5 - A must watch for Godzilla fans - a Must watch for Monster Movies fans."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Especially liked that the story was more about the people than Godzilla. The special effects were great.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is officially the golden age of Godzilla. Never before have we had such consistent, quality Godzilla content. It's been building since Godzilla 2014, and it just peaked.

Godzilla Minus One is perhaps the greatest Godzilla film since the original. There is an argument for it being considered the best, better than Godzilla '54. This Godzilla fires on all cylinders, not just as a creature, but the movie as a whole. Godzilla himself is perfect, but everything else in the movie is held to that same standard. There is no ""weak part"". The humans are just as important as Goji, and their stories are MORE compelling than the giant radioactive lizard. At one point, I genuinely forgot it was a Godzilla movie, and I had to remind myself Goji was going to return, and bring death and destruction with him.

This version of Godzilla is like nothing we've seen before. He is not an animal. He is not a force of nature. He is worse. Pick any god of death, destruction, and/or annihilation and he is that idea brought to life. He is malicious at every opportunity. He is the most menacing we've ever seen Godzilla. He is more powerful and destructive than any previous versions of Godzilla. Any scenes with Goji attacking are outstanding. Nothing is held back. And surprisingly, the effects are done so well they stand up to AAA Hollywood films. His ""heat ray"" is breathtaking. It's so beautiful and destructive. Seeing this in theaters is a must. The sound design and visuals do a fantastic job making you feel the sheer power being unleashed.

Everything about this film hit. I've never been so proud to be a Godzilla fan. The story, the plot, the acting, the characters, the themes, the action, the destruction, Godzillas design, the sound design, the soundtrack, everything for this film is done with care, with effort. Nothing falls short. You could take Godzilla out of this film, and everything else would still stand tall on its own. I genuinely think this will win awards and will usher in a new age of Japanese cinema. Hollywood should be taking notes on how to make lower budget movies. It's mind blowing that a Japanese film with a 15-20$ million budget was better than any 200$ million Hollywood film that came out this year.

I could praise this movie for days straight. I'm going to go see it again and bring everyone I can with me to the theaters. It's hard to rate a movie as perfect, but this movie is as perfect as any movie has been this year.

If you like Historical Dramas, go see this film.

If you like massive destruction sequences, go see this film.

If you like Godzilla, go see this film.

If you like good movies, GO SEE THIS FILM.

DON'T MISS MAYBE THE BEST MOVIE OF 2023."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla movies I've seen!  The characters were so well done and definitely the best atomic blast ever for Godzilla.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"new favorite godzilla movie. so done with the modern 'oh, it's a monster, better send in the marines and maybe a nuke! 'merica, hoorah!' we got characters we really care about, not just if they live or die but if they can work through their trauma post ww2. it's never so dark we can't see the action to save on cgi.  civillians not governments taking care of business.  it's goofy, it's tense, it's got heart, it's got a killer boss-battle soundtrack... yeah.  watch this one."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"An epic, yet emotionally grounded and heartfelt film. 
Easily one of my top three favorite Godzilla films of all time.

If you can, see it in IMAX!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Awesome. Great movie. Thanks!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Main story very good with multiple excellent sub-plots.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film to DATE!!!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very well done homage to the original film. If you're thinking of seeing it, go, you wont be disappointed."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A truly phenomenal film that manages to be on par with the original 1954 film. The film was able to give us a great story and human characters that you actually come to care about. With a budget of 15 million this film gives us beautiful effects that put the higher budget films to shame. If you are a fan of Godzilla do yourself a favor and go see this movie asap.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent story with developed characters and clever themes.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Very satisfying. The movie has a story line that is strong and maintains its connection to its roots.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of if not the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. Along with that it is an amazing tribute to the Franchise.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was born in the early fifties and remembered the first Godzilla movie, this was a fresh remake of the original with a great story line.  I related to the line up of actors in a way which made the movie even more enjoyable having spent time in Japan.  Definitely would recommend."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best films to come out of this year! 10/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing!!!! This is the Godzilla we ALL have been waiting for...well worth the ticket price, will see it again on the BIG screen."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A phenomenal and heartwarming movie of redemption. The story of survivors guilt and dealing with PTSD should hit home and inspire. And BTW Godzilla was in it. The action scenes were more engaging and realistic than any CGI or digitized work could ever capture. One truly feels the horror and destructive power in each and every encounter. Absolutely the Best Godzilla movie I have ever seen, and one of the best movies period in the last 25 years. This one should go in for Oscar contention under at least best foreign film, but more appropriately under Best Film. I would pay to see this at least a couple more times."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent film due to fine acting of characters the viewer truly relates to and cares for.

IMAX is wholly unnecessary for screening because of that. A theater room with strong audio may aid in evoking emotional response, but so could one playing in mono.

And such an impression extends to visuals. A larger screen does not at all evoke response. Acting does. Visually, at one point a viewer may wish that director Takashi Yamazaki had put someone in a rubber Godzilla suit, letting the viewer's imagination further work. However, one begins to see that the creature's CGI, deliberately made to look as if someone is in just such a rubber suit, is thoughtfully done in respectful homage to the original 1954 *Godzilla* film. Yamazaki proves that creativity can and does exist even when barraged by current digital special effects and at less expense than that spent by the US film industry.

The storyline and dialogue also could be anime -- right down to the happily ever after(?) ending -- yet truly fit into the classical kaiju mold, in which they brilliantly portray the life of a young family and post-WWII Japanese community.

And this film is edited well. Never once does one wonder how much time remains before credits.

Overall, *Godzilla Minus One* is a jubilant shock at how enjoyable a movie  can be after years of drudging superhero special effects stories where ""this...changes..."" nothing but one's pocketbook."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent! The Japanese prove that Hollywood studios should just stop trying to make these movies. Godzilla Minus One has a ton of heart and will make you care for the characters, Godzilla tearing up a city and sinking ships is just a bonus."
"Dec 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"#MovieReview #GodzillaMinusOne 

It was a fun movie, it's not in English whatsoever, so prepare for that 

But like I said, it's a fun movie, it's not exciting to the point you get out of your seat, and the storyline is drawn out and drug out for over two hours 

And the downfall of Godzilla is he's hardly in the movie, and when he is in the movie action, sequences are good, but it's when he's in the movie 

He has less screen time than the actors in the movie is called Godzilla ￼"
"Dec 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Best sleep I had in a long time. All subtitles  and monster fights were about 25% of the movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"In terms of tone this one is like the original 54 Godzilla; none of the other G-movies come close to this darker tone.  ... and honestly, it might even surpass the original in it´s athomsphere.  The movie manages to present likable characters (something that a lot of G-movies fail to deliver)  that you root for and you root against Godzilla. The monster sequwences delivered, the score was great.  I THINK this might be the best movie of the year and is a strong contender for best Godzilla movie ever."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was made to actually care about the human characters and their struggle, something previous godzilla films failed to do. Stakes were high, and I was actually scared that someone important might end up dying. A twist happy end was refreshing to see."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great, action packed and so much destruction. I think it could be one of the best godzilla films EVER and that's saying alot. Altho the story is a bit sad, they do the characters so well. Godzilla is a beast in this film he's not good, he's not bad he's just straight up a monster. It is pretty similar to shin godzilla but the story in my opinion is better. Overall this is a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone rather if your a godzilla fan or not, you'll still have a blast."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"After growing up in the early 70s and watching war of the Gargantua's and all the other Godzilla movies I cherish, this is movie has made it to my #1 monster movie. It's awesome enjoy it."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie best Godzilla I've seen in a while
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The human story was beautiful and affecting. The effects were marvelous. Godzilla was truly monstrous... intentional in its destruction, and it was delightful. 

My main complaint was that the movie needed MORE Godzilla."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"One if not the greatest Godzilla movie by far. Shin Godzilla had brought back the original concept for the monster and honestly I never thought they would have made a similar movie since legendary was currently making the newest series of Godzilla movies. Toho really went back to the drawing board to make Godzilla the terrifying creature he once was back in 1954. He's not your hero or anti-hero in this film, but a monster of pure terror and destruction that symbolizes the immense power of an atomic bomb given life. It had a compelling story with some good action with Godzilla. The best way I can personally describe this movie is that its a war movie feeling the aftermath of WWII and the country now had to defend itself with whatever army it has left against an unknown creature that came about from the attack of the war itself."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I won't make a super long review here because I think I can sum this up in a few sentences. Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla to date, it holds its own against Hollywood's version visually, its got the best story with touching moments and wonderful actors, the best version of Godzilla and gives you a very satisfying ending IMO. Go see this immediately and support Goji in Japan and in America, I believe both are amazing and I can't wait to see what the sequel might be. Godzilla Minus One is second to no one. 9/10 final score and the best movie I've seen all year! Goji is BACK and better than ever in Japan!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film was amazing! Toho did Godzilla justice, as one would expect of Toho! Bravo!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of scenes played like scenes from Jaws. Except for about 20 minutes moved along rather well. Lots of action in the daytime. I loved it. One of the  Best Godzilla movies ever. Will most likely see it again. Its rare to get a Togo Godzilla movie in the U.S.  The boat and land scenes rank with the best of the best.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great reimaging of the classic 1954 Gojira!!! Will see again, and again"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A true masterpiece. Finally a Godzilla movie where we actually care about the human characters. Of course, the Godzilla mayhem scenes are also brilliantly executed."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie! The best Godzilla movie ever made. You would never know this movie was made with a 15 million dollar budget. The story was powerful, the acting was fantastic, the subtitles were easy to follow, and Godzilla was angry! Can’t wait to see it again!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie even if Godzilla wasn't in it.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only is it the best Godzilla movie ever, but a great movie in general. It's thrilling, action packed, emotional and very entertaining film."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie Loved The Human Story Easy The Second Best Godzilla Movie Besides 1954 Godzilla 9/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and well done.
"Dec 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Godzilla Minus One is a competent, well-shot addition to the series.  Although it's much better than any of the drivel produced by Legendary Pictures, it still leaves much to be desired.  Good acting is offset by terribly written dialogue, and there's plenty of dubious CGI on display throughout the film.  The human drama is at the forefront,  with the titular kaiju taking a backseat to what is a decent, although ploddingly paced, story.  Overall a decent film, and easily within the top half-dozen Godzilla films, but it can't contend with a masterpiece like the 1954 original or a gripping contemporary take like Shin Godzilla.   Not bad, just severely overhyped."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,love that they show godzilla a lot and great story
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,They made Godzilla scary again! A must see for fans of classic kaiju movies. All successfully done on a small budget.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"IT WAS SO PEAKKK, if you want to see a exhilarating kajiu movie with a actual good story WATCH THIS."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best godzilla movie the world has ever seen and one of the best movies of 2023.
A MUST SEE!!!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The classic theme song of Godzilla hits home again! This movie brought back how truly destructive Godzilla is, as a walking natural disaster. Bringing back the sobering reminder, Godzilla is not here to protect us, but to DESTROY US!!! 10/10!!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the movie of the year.  It'll take your breath away.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,By god was this movie beautiful down from the characters being some of the most compelling to the story that talks about overcoming fear and living for the future. To the monster Godzilla a great tribute to the kaiju he was from the 50s it was simply remarkable and deserves all the love it's getting. Go Go Godzilla!!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie gives us a peek into Japan after WW2 that we rarely get to see. The mix of defeat Japan had after WW2 and the search for a identity brought together by the need to Defeat Godzilla who is rampaging throw a country finding its identity. The clash of war and peace, identity and obscurity to build a new Japan as reality of what happened moves them forward to a new Japan. As much as this is a story about a monster it is also a story about the people trying to grow past WW2 and the culture during the war to achieve self worth again for a bright future of Japan. Godzilla represents victory of achieving this goal of a new identity by doing it better for a brighter future."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Must seeeeeeee
My wife and 3 year old son loved the movie. Great story that makes it a memorable film"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just want to say that Holywood needs to see this masterpiece and realize how movies need to be made, this is THE best Godzilla movie so far, story, special effects, cinematography, everything is superb, acting,
and characters, this is a movie about aggressive devastating Godzilla, you feel the power and real threat when he is in the scene, I did not felt boring during the whole movie, this is one of the best thrilling and engaging stories with complex characters in Godzilla film yet, i cannot recommend this movie enough, and all of that on 15 million budget, hello The Marvels anyone. Thank god for this movie, because after trash like The Marvels, Napoleon, Silent night...etc, this is a superb movie and must watch."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I use to love watching Godzilla movies as a child with my grandpa. This Godzilla movie felt new and captured the old personality of the original Japanese Godzilla films. The CGI was AMAZING and they gave this Godzilla the personality of the original ones before CGI. Story was great and the WW2 Era was a perfect setting for it. I hope they make a sequel for this.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie, Might be better than the 1954 original, enjoyable story satisfying action, there really isn’t anything I disliked about it. This movie, then the original, and the Brian Cranston Godzilla movies are the most enjoyable of all the Godzilla movies"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A good movie for subtitles. Although, there was not enough Godzilla in the movie. There was too much focus placed on the subplots than on the main character. I suppose this was because of budget constraints, but it would have been nice to see the movie feature more of the main character. Lastly, this Godzilla was probably the most stiff one I've seen again likely the result of the budget."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can only find very minor nitpicky things wrong with this movie. Outside the 'monster' story, the movie holds up as a well-told, compelling story of post war Japan, PTSD, and post war recovery efforts in a devastated society. This would have been enough, but they added a giant angry monster, and it's awesome.

The small moments of homage to the original are sweet reminders to us Godzilla 'veterans' and an amazing introduction to all the new fans this movie will bring in.

The acting is top notch, the effects are flawless when they need to be, and the pacing is how a big budget monster movie should be. Once again, Japan takes a film genre, and establishes a new baseline for everyone else to reach for."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a following of Godzilla as a kid and having watched every possible media production, the film is the single greatest and terrifying Godzilla film produced. Such raw and touching human impacts on Japankind, I can't wait til he lands on US soil and nukes San Francisco or New York. Imagine the destruction. Fear him, run from him as there is nothing you can do to stop him. Humankind's reset is coming."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really takes you back to the monsters roots. For Americans we see Godzilla as more of a defender and just fighting other monsters, so this is a breath of fresh air. Human story had me engaged and invested the entire way through. Overall amazing experience"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my 5 year old enjoyed the hell out of this movie! I cannot wait for this to be available to buy to own.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This version of Godzilla combines the best parts of all Godzillas into one terrifying beast. The human story is poignant, and there is a good balance between it and Godzilla screen time. In fact, I grew to care for the characters so much, the thought of another run in with Godzilla felt as scary as it did exiting! There's a real sense of building tension throughout the whole movie that leads to deservedly satisfying end."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a novel take on the classic Godzilla storyline. It was a great, human-centered epic with some great acting. Felt incredibly realistic, and it made the intesity that much better."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, good acting and dramatic Godzilla movie, must see…"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm a Godzilla fan so I wouldnt have missed this in the theater.   What I walked away with is a masterpiece of a movie.  The plot/story is simply amazing.   This is by far the best Godzilla movie made to date and they did it for $15m.   Proof again you dont have to spend $300m to make a great movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been watching Godzilla movies since I was a Kid in the 80's. This Movie gave me everything I felt the others were lacking.

A great overall message, a great connection to the cast, Great Practical effects mixed with modern CGI techniques, scary, with thrills. 

This film, for me, is the best Godzilla movie ever made."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Would watch again AND then again
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"2023's Godzilla Minus One- Is essentially a faithful remake/retelling of the 1954 Original. Keeping & instilling the message & morals of the original film. Whereas the original film focused more on Godzilla & the destruction of Japan, with the struggle & emotions of the Japanese people being more the backdrop to the main characters of the original film (i.e. Godzilla & the city itself) Minus One however subverts this expectation and focuses more on character development with the human characters themselves. The screen time we do get of Godzilla rampaging throughout Japan & the destruction he causes; though more breif than I was wanting, is a sight to be hold and leaves a significant impact. Just wish there was more of it!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love this movie!!! Love, love, love it!!! My favorite Godzilla ever and I am 49! Beautiful work!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie highly recommend 👌🏼
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This may be the best movie I’ve ever seen. And I don’t speak a lick of Japanese! (I was unaware the movie was only in Japanese and subtitled for English). I was shocked at the heart of this film, as I was expecting a run of the mill monster movie. This movie has such great acting and emotion and heart to it. I’m recommending this to everyone. Excellent score as well! This movie is powerful!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie great cast good story 
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A wonderful monster movie! I really compelling human story as well.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the greatest Godzilla movie since the 1954 original.  Great human story terrifying monster story.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a godzilla fan then this is a must see movie. 
Be warned, it is a fully japanese film with subtitles, so if you arent into that you may want to wait for a dubbed version but the film is worth watching this way if you can do it. 

While the film is not perfect, theres quite a few things lost in translation and there are a few choices in how it is put together that I would have done differently, its still a great movie. 
If you just want a mindless monster movie, like the legendary pictures godzilla, you will likely not enjoy this one as much. This is more of the thinking mans godzilla like the original. 
But if you are a fan of godzilla's classic storytelling and solid themes that are heavy in morality, emotion, and thoughtfulness then this is a film to see in big screen. 
This one evokes the best format of godzilla, the eminent threat to, and enemy of, humanity that we have to struggle to deal with, and it touches at the heart and soul of the original film and all its successors into shin gojira. 
The characters and archetypes are fun though predictable, but they are more about carrying the message and theme of the film rather than being fully fleshed out entities. 
The visuals are gorgeous and really nail the time period feeling and make godzilla feel threatening and savage, theres some truly awesome moments in there and some legit tense scenes. 

The main drawback I have is with the pacing, especially early on as we dont really get to know the characters they simply drop in which is a bit of a letdown and sometimes confusing. 

Overall I would definitely give this a recommend, I would have been more comfortable with a 4.5 star rating but I felt it deserves more than 4 for what the director, cast, and crew accomplished."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing.  Best Godzilla story of them all, incredible acting, cinematography, music, and so realistic, you didn't feel compelled to look for things that looked fake.  Wonderful story line"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Rivals the classic original as a powerful exploration of atomic horror via an allegorical force of nature.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been a life-long fan of Godzilla, but I was skeptical of this at first, but upon watching it, I was immediately immersed in this phenomenal cinematic experience. It has all the depth, emotions, and scale you could possibly want from any great movie. Also the music was amazing. Overall I rank this movie a 11/10, but since its Godzilla MINUS ONE I guess that makes it a 10/10."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"We went and saw Godzilla Minus One.  It's not only a great Godzilla movie, it's also a good movie.  The special effects look great, the big G has never looked better and as a bonus the human characters are also interesting and have a good story line.  The film is in Japanese and you have to read subtitles but it doesn't distract from it.  As a movie I'd give it a 7.5 or 8.  As a Godzilla movie it's easily the best one.  Even better than the Japanese version of the original."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The most terrifying Godzilla ever!! Epic in every sense of the word. Great human characters as well.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent film that also happens to have Godzilla in it. Well worth watching.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Very emotional and extremely masterful work of art.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Breathtaking. Godzilla is a beast and the story is one I'll remember forever. So happy to see Toho keeping Godzilla alive.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla! Such a great movie and storyline. It gave 1954 vibes with a modern look. Go see it!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully crafted, moving story. Excellent movie. Can't wait to own it."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It is truly a Godzilla that symbolizes the current era. Has there ever been a Godzilla that excited me as much as this one? It was wonderful.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfection from beginning to end. Gut wrenching, destructive, visually engaging, incredible sound design, music, writing, and a hopeful optimism for a brighter tomorrow. This film has all the characteristics of a good Godzilla film, and maybe more. I dont know what the future holds, but I want more. Much more."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent movie. not one to miss.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay now this Godzilla is really standing on business😤

But seriously this was incredible! The biggest and loudest Godzilla movie I've seen and to have a 15M budget is very impressive! Definitely see this on the biggest screen"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was in Japanese. And I don’t speak a lick. What an  amazing movie. Visually, musically, just extremely well put together and had all the feels, too. I cried, laughed, and just really enjoyed it."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's classic Godzilla only Toho can do justice. Heartfelt storytelling plus amazing visuals, music, and sound. Mind-blowing that this film have a mega-budget look and feel yet was produced on a budget of $15 million, which by Hollywood standards is low low budget."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Godzilla. Always 5 stars except the Matthew Broderick trash
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the absolute best Godzilla films. Incredibly gripping and excellent fights.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece of a movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the monster movie that future monster movies will be measured. This is the Godzilla movie you show to someone who has never seen a Godzilla movie.  Outstanding.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must watch! This movie was fantastic! If you’re on the fence due to the subtitles, this is your sign to bite the bullet and watch this fantastic film. Godzilla is an epic force to be reckoned with, but the Japanese people rally together and combat sheer force and power with strategy and wit. Definitely one of the best movies I have watched in a few years! Go see it now!"
"Dec 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is a Godzilla movie with a ton of character development and not a lot of Kaiju action IMHO.  Granted, when Godzilla is on the screen it's pretty awesome but he's not on much for a kaiju movie.  Godzilla does have the most awesome new atomic breath I've ever seen.  I mean it is so wickedly wild that no other kaiju would want to be on the receiving end of it.  Yet, most of the movie is more of a character study with Godzilla as more of an afterthought at times.  I mean it is about people living in Japan right after WWII.  It's a decent movie but not a hard-core kaiju one for me.  One thing about it is that the Japanese military isn't in it much.  After WWII, they didn't have much working weapons and, as part of the treaty, were required to remove weapons from vessels etc.  So, Godzilla goes up against homemade stuff vice the laser cannons etc. from previous movies."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was just awesome We kaiju fan's haven't seen something like this for awhile Godzilla is just evil he's really trying to kill people in this movie awesome call backs to the original 1954 as well and you actually care for the people haven't seen that since 1954 the characters were wonderful they have a purpose to survive just amazing and sad as well this movie 5 stars an incredible story in this movie instant classic right next to the original 1954 Godzilla. And Godzilla just awesome in this movie and to my fellow kaiju fans go watch it ,it's worth it and to none kaiju fans go watch it you'll like it as well
GODZILLA -1 the best movie of this year hands down. Oh p.s don't listen to Adam Olinger this is from the guy who liked the marvels🤣🤦🏽‍♂️"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen I think. It was enjoyable from start to finish!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Lost for words And that You should go see
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing. I love Godzilla and this movie exceeded my expectations
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting, heartbreaking, the best movie this year"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie amazing story I'm so happy I chose to see it on its opening night the acting was amazing I cried the whole movie 100/10 one of the top movies I've seen this year!!!!! Great job to the actors and everyone who made the movie!!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest Godzilla movie ever made!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I figured out how this movie was made so cheap.. Godzilla's arms don't move.  I can't believe an English subtitle Godzilla movie made me tear up twice. Hollywood should take notice when this Godzilla movie turns a solid profit.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I have been a godzilla fan my whole life. I saw Broderick Godzilla in theaters. I rented them all from the library. This is the best of the best. See it on the biggest screen you can.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Riveting. Best Godzilla movie ever made
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A great Godzilla film.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is nothing short of incredible. I can't believe I was sitting in a kaiju movie bawling my eyes out. The writing, the performances, the visuals all have an atomic impact. Godzilla Minus One is satisfying in every way."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent remake of the original Godzilla movie but different!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,great to see the original studio back at it!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding, great movie"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it don’t get me wrong it’s just that it gave a shin Godzilla type ending and that’s why I give it four stars
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best movie I watched in this year
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie you will see this year and forever!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A moving and heartfelt post-war drama that also happens to have Godzilla in it,"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest Godzilla movie ever!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie exceeded all expectations. The Toho team took advantage of all the technology available now and brought Gojira to it's full potential. 10/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie, so intense, so good"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"MInis One is definitely better than most modern movies, and it is better than the Western tellings of the Godzilla story. However, the pacing is slow, and it drags I several places. Two hours was too long for the movie, but that two was substantive. I just wish moviemakers learn to tell a coherent story in less time. Other than the runtime, if you are a fan of Godzilla, redemption stories, and alternative history pieces this Isa movie for you."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up watching Godzilla movies in the '70s, so I went into this particular Godzilla movie with a chip on my shoulder. What can you show me new about Godzilla I thought to myself. This movie superseded my expectations! It's rare to see Godzilla upstaged by the human characters, often in Godzilla movies the human characters are just used as a Segway between the Godzilla scenes. You will have to read the subtitles, however you get to see the movie in its original language which only adds to the movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrific!! I was completely vested in the characters. The writing was sharp, and the cinematography was beautiful. ABSOLUTELY, one of the best movies of the year!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man, Japan makes far better movies than Hollywood nowadays. Great story, great acting, likable characters and the best Godzilla I’ve seen."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One was a tremendous film! Absolutely one of Toho's greatest Godzilla films of all-time. The plot was hugely character-driven and it was one of the film's best attributes, especially in relation to the plot and it's most intense moments. Not to mention the beautiful special effects treatment they gave Godzilla himself. Easily one of the best films of 2023 for me."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This version of Godzilla is refreshing to see as the Japanese take on this kaiju is a contrast to the American rendition of Godzilla. For those unfamiliar with the foreign/original take on Godzilla, this film is a good, modern entryway into the decades of Godzilla movies produced under Toho. The monster's presence also sets the basis for human conflict/challenges played by well-known actors in the Japanese film industry."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is probably one of the best Godzilla movies ever made. Right up there with the original from 54. Its visual story telling is top notch. Godzilla looks great. The human characters felt relatable that I empathized with what they going through. A must watch for fans of giant monster movies & if you just like good movies in general.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see! Best Godzilla movie!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie full of depth and plot with the characters. Loved it.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the first movies in years to bring me to the verge of tears. This movie does three things: First, it beautifully incapsulates the horrors of destruction and trauma that plagued post WWII japan, along with the hope and recovery of the country. Second, it shows a gripping story about human characters in a monster movie that add to the plot rather than just be there for the ride, thus succeeding where many monster movies fail. Third, it is an absolutely awesome monster movie and a phenomenal modern rendition of the original Godzilla movie with all the horror and despair that the original created, just with the addition of modern day cinematography capability’s. If you can, do watch it, as it is worth it."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched it last night, it was great!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I love how they brought the old Godzilla back makes you feel like a kid again watching the big G MAN causing mayhem wherever he walks 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is or isn’t a g fan to watch this movie
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, even if not a Godzilla fan you’ll enjoy it"
"Dec 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"needed more action, less dialogue"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film yet
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a Godzilla movie that surprisingly has some of the best human characters in the entire series and they deliver powerful performances. Godzilla was just the icing on the cake, he is scary as well as pure evil. Some fans might find it slow but I found the humans exceptional good and the Godzilla attacks were incredible. Most fans will be in heaven"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing acting and special effects with great engaging storytelling with only a 10 million dollar budget puts Hollywood movies to shame.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful doesn’t describe this masterpiece first time bowing to a film after the credits let alone a Japanese film. I can’t recommend this more to Godzilla fans and those who have never watched or care to watch Godzilla movies. This is a beautiful introduction to the franchise. On par with the OG movie that birthed the franchise.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was an absolutely amazing nod to the original, with even small nods to the english version. The way Godzilla moved, the use of his iconic theme, everything was so amazingly placed and crafted and carefully placed.

The story for the human characters was very emotional and while you can probably guess the story beats at points with it, it still was impactful all the same.

I cannot stress enough how well put together of a film this was."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up on Godzilla!!! And this is HANDS DOWN the best movie made!! It has an amazingly deep and layered plot! Minus' greatness doesn't diminish prior films, just simply brings more to the table with its human perspective and representation of post-war life trauma. Godzilla is the destructive force and monstrous terror that has been lost through the years!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This isn't just an extraordinary Godzilla movie, it's an extraordinary movie!
Everything is firing on all cylinders. the script, the pacing, the effects, and especially the acting. I can't wait to see it again!"
"Dec 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't like the return to the older format of Godzilla and I still prefer Godzilla the hero.

However, I can appreciate what they did but it did not appeal to me.  "
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The storytelling and Godzilla looked old school, amazing."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie I've seen bye far this year definitely recommend 💥
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The King of Monsters triumphs flawlessly, even after 70 years of release of the very first movie in 1954."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was near perfect!  One of the best Godzilla movies ever made, maybe the best.  Great movie…"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"As someone who does not watch many monster movies, Godzilla Minus One was an incredible cinema experience. The film perfectly balanced action, tension and emotion. Every minute was captivating; Godzilla was a visual spectacle, the human characters were wonderfully written and acted, the cinematography was sharp and the score was both suspenseful and beautiful. I highly recommend watching this on the big screen for its immersive surround sound. Even if you are not familiar with any Godzilla films, this stands alone as one of the best films this year!!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just one of the best Godzilla films ever, but one of the greatest films of the year"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla since the first!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla was pure evil truly a monster.. great character development and story telling
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Old School Godzilla with updated special effects. 
Thank you Japan! Thank you for making a movie that doesn't talk down to me with ""The message."""
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I’ve ever watched.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie made me fear Godzilla and hate General Douglas MacArthur. 10/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Highly recommend 10/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Exciting and emotional movie. By far one of the best Godzilla movies!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing edition to the godzilla verse
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal Godzilla movie, by far the most intense portrayal of the King of Monsters to date. The acting was superb leaving me choking back tears and bursting out laughing multiple times throughout the film. The intensity of Godzilla's presence is unsettling in the best way and the action scenes left me feeling a sense of awe and hopelessness for the people facing his wrath. Everything made sense, and it feels like Godzilla has finally achieved a proper portrayal in modern CGI. 10/10."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story. Powerful acting. Godzilla is a beast! This wont be the Godzilla movie you were expecting and youll be glad its not.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic Godzilla film, with a great human story as well as a violent and mean Godzilla!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just witnessed one of THE GREATEST films ever made much less best Godzilla movie ever. The hype was real for the 100% on RottenTomatoes Godzilla Minus One

This movie has so much depth due to the deep character driven storyline of a failed disgraceful  kamikaze pilot who returns to nothing only to take on hope through a orphaned child and wily woman who he slowly falls for, yet his internal war of shame and pain rages too much within himself to even love anyone anymore, only to almost be redeemed by love but only to loss it all , then willing to fight to the death for revenge by being the most dangerous monster a person could be, suicidal, to deal with the biggest monster of them all, Godzilla, which as always represents the fears and demons of the main character. Only to bring things back full circle to hope.

Absolutely brilliant action with Godzilla, stellar story, and THE BEST movie of 2023 and it should be nominated in the Oscars for best film. Also  the best 4D movie of 2023. Glad to watch one of the best movies I've ever seen in 4D  with fam.

Better than 90% of Hollywood trash movies out there now and before"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best Godzilla films
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I was really blown away by how compiling and gripping the storyline was. To see how unbelievable aweful post ww2 Japan was and how they made do was very moving. This Godzilla was incredible. Menacing and evil. I will own this movie when it makes it's steaming premiere.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, justice for Godzilla.  This is more appropriate the Peter Jackson's King Kong."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have been a Godzilla fan for over 31 years at this point. I have seen every film in the series. I've been lucky enough to see Godzilla '98, Godzilla 2000 Millennium, Godzilla '14, Shin Godzilla, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters in the cinema, so it was a genuine treat to see Godzilla Minus One. I live in the middle of nowhere so it was an hour long drive. But the drive home was good thinking time. 

This movie has opinions. It has very clear things to say about war, valuing life, and individual people's role in society. It has ""big acting."" Huge displays of human emotion. Consider the collective strain and trauma and how overwhelmed you'd been in these situations. 

Luckily for us the ""big acting"" is attached to legitimately interesting characters who you don't want to see get squashed by Godzilla, because for the first time in a long time, Godzilla is a dick. This verison of Godzilla reminds me of ""Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All Out Attack"" (2001) in how much he just hates. If he sees a person that person dies unless they get away or at least out of sight. He will tolerate none in his way. 

To continue, I echo much of what you've probably already read: impressive visual effects, especially for the budget. The plot is good and you have characters you like. The score is not overly dependent on Ifukube but the expected themes are there and they are exceptional updates. The original music is generally good with a few haunting themes I liked. The sound design was great actually, and I liked when the film chose to slow down and be quiet for a few minutes. 

Fans of the Godzilla series will probably notice the nods to the past... and I feel that it was done well, with the easter eggs being fairly subtle, rather than overtly shoved in your face. 

If you're only familiar with the Legendary MonsterVerse Godzilla, this movie is very different. This is a post-WWII antiwar drama about survivors guilt, PTSD, found family, and the value of human life. There just happens to be some incredible monster scenes and exciting action scenes. But it's a drama. I loved it. Go see it while its in theaters."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has a beautiful story and at times you almost forget you're watching a monster movie. The actors are fantastic and some scenes are very emotional. Godzilla himself is more terrifying than ever and there is plenty of action to move this movie along.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever watched
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well done, without the CGI it had that old school feel. Like that it told a story more about the people than Godzilla. Made for good story telling."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie! We had not  seen any previews, had no ideas about it at all. I'm not even a huge Godzilla fan..but the reviews were so positive,  we gave it a shot. So glad i did. Top 5 movie this year!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a longtime Godzilla fan, this was a return to form for the movie in all the right ways. Truly hit all the emotional notes and made me super happy to see non-Godzilla fans gasp and react so positively to the movie. Go see it"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Even in without color this movie still proves why it’s one of the best.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A grim but impacful film that shows the scariest godzilla we've seen since shin. A must watch and a truly amazing film!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never thought it would happen, but caring for the collateral damage takes an emotional effect unlike previous zilla extravaganzas."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie I've seen. The story, acting and action were incredible. My 8 year old son loved it also! Better than our expectations. Let's go!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,If you are a fan of Godzilla and Kaiju this is a great movie. It is a great background story of the king of monsters and begins in late 1944. Storyline is well written and directed. The effects are first rate. This is one of the best Godzilla movies made. I saw it in 4DFX and you get thrown around in it. The theater effects are great!. The down side is it is in Japanese with subtitles so kids who can't read quickly might not like it. Excellent movie!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This truly is a masterpiece. The film draws you in from the start and the plot keeps you invested. The best Godzilla film I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Perfect!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Instant, Classic, I recommend to go see it in theaters while is out on IMAX my favorite movie of the year"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,SO GOOD! We loved the movie! Huge Godzilla fans and when the Godzilla theme music started playing about a third of the way in we had to hold back from cheering. Very well done!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was the best Godzilla film to ever be seen with stunning visual effects. 10/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an amazing retelling of the 1954 iconic film! The director's decision to tell the story from the viewpoint of the Japanese as they try to rebuild after the end of WWII only added to the validity of the main character. A DEFINITE MUST SEE for any Godzilla fan!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Godzilla movie, real classic feel to it but with great special effects."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Seeing this movie in IMAX was haunting everything from the dark story to the stellar visuals and incredible acting make this Godzilla movie one of the very best ever put on screen
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some folks have complained about Godzilla's cg being poor quality. But as I watched the movie, I felt like this was done on purpose - it harkens back to old school 50s and 60s Godzilla and it felt like a tribute. I teach psychology, and this movie does an incredible job of realistically portraying PTSD. You feel so strongly for Shikishima and his continued plight. I was literally breathless when we see Godzilla take out the first Destroyer and use his atomic breath from underwater. Amazing costume and set design - everything felt real and authentic. Incredible movie!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see for any Godzilla fan. A must see for any fan of cinema. We need more of this in the Godzilla franchise. Godzilla is more than just a famous movie monster and this film proves that. Every movie director in the world should take notes.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see. The story and cinematography.  My new top Zilla movie.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm a huge fan of the G-man, this is movie is amazing and finally characters we actually care about, if I had time I would have watched it at the next showing tonight."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action-packed from the get-go with a beautiful story at its heart. Not hard to follow at all, even with the subtitles"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Came for the big stompy lizard mashing a city, got all that and a great found family story too! Growing up on the classic Godzilla, once the theme dropped it was an absolute wave of nostalgia!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fantastic, very character driven, I liked it in subtitles, DUB would ruin otherwise great character development. Godzilla scenes felt real. Gotta see it! I love legendary Godzilla but this one is good too!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Not only the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen (and I've seen nearly every Toho and Legendary movie) but one of the best films I've seen in years by far.  The story was outstanding the and the struggles and pain of the human cast was palpable.  Music and atmosphere was also incredible.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's more than a Godzilla flick, great acting and action. Invested in characters well being."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story inside a great Godzilla movie!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,PERFECT MIX between human emotion and Godzilla badassery. Soooo well made.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great characters, great story, great scenes with Godzilla!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"""This Movie, Painted In Despair, Will Strike You With Fear"" - Director Takashi Yamasaki

OH MY GODZILLA!!!!

I'm utterly speechless, this movie was amazing in every possible way imaginable for an audience wanting to be entertained. The Human characters were very well written, the acting was outstanding, the emotions were strong with loss, pride and hope. The main cast were perfect together as a group, even the minor characters were amazing. The music, Oh My God the Music was conducted to fit every scene it was in and the OG theme was incredible to hear in a Dolby theater for the first time. Akira Ifukube would be proud, May he Rest In Peace. Lastly it was very educating in a way to see what Japan was like immediately after the War following the Atomic Bombs. The hardships they went through just to rebuild was very emotional to watch, but the way they climbed out of that pit of hopelessness would inspire any viewer to the franchise both Long Time along with Newer Fans

Now to the matter at Hand, the Star Himself, GODZILLA.

The King of the Monsters is more terrifying in this movie than any other in the 69 year history of the Longest running franchise in the World! Every time he appears on screen he strikes fear into your very soul and leaves you in Awe at the same time. His destruction was unrelenting, the action out of this world, his Power Godly, his portrayal Very Real. At times you almost feel sorry for him because what's happened to him wasn't his fault. I haven't seen a monster movie this well done since Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and Cloverfield (2008).

My solid review of this movie is a 10/10, and I recommend save notifications of any kind for when this movie hits the Home Media market because I sure will.

Honestly I don't think I've ever watched a movie this perfect before

Last note, The Whole Theater shook everytime Godzilla took a Step and my very bones were vibrating from his Roar

"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing story bringing a fresh feel to the Godzilla universe once again. More drama vs the quick paced governmental cog movements of shin Godzilla but equally as enrapturing
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderfully executed.  One of the best Godzilla movies of all time.  This is right up there with Shin.  The backdrop story of WW2 takes it back to the original concept of Godzilla.  Toho's done it again.  My 12 year old daughter really enjoyed it as well.  Good old movie going fun.  Goodbye  superhero garbage and welcome back real cinema.

"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie in a long long time

"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie delivers on a grand aspect, giving you Godzilla front and center, and also delivering with great storytelling and character development. it's nice to see a movie that cares more about the storytelling than anything else."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must watch masterpiece. I went in expecting to feel meh but this was gripping, suspenseful, and made me tear up. This isn’t just another mindless movie like the Hollywood Godzilla films. I’m watching the movie again in theaters and buying the DVD. I never see movies twice in theaters and never buy physical copies, it was that good."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie blew me away! It was by far, the best Godzilla film to date. It was poignant, true to the original music and historically beautiful. I did not expect this. How refreshing to watch a non-woke movie that left a lasting historical impression. The costumes. The sets. The actors!! All fantastic."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great and, I enjoyed it even more with the D-BOX Seats i felt all the moments where Godzilla charged his atomic breath shaking my seat."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie there is 10/10
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,RAAAAAAH IT WAS AMAZING
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Godzilla movie to come out thus far, great story, great characters and amazing VFX with a budget of only 15 million dollars."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is a solid Godzilla movie but also a surprisingly well crafted drama about post war Japan, courage, family, unity and survival. Loved it.
my issues were some of the over acting, odd CG choices, and the somewhat sloppy introduction of Godzilla."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down one of the best Godzilla movies ever made. One of the best human interest stories in a Godzilla movie too!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla movie since the original, No I am not kidding. This film is beyond anything then I ever expected, I'm more than happy I got to see this masterpiece in theaters. If you haven't seen this film yet, I greatly encourage you to see it IMMEDIATELY! It tugs and pulls at your heartstrings way more than you'd ever expect. The human characters are such an amazing part of this film that it brought me to tears several times. The special effects are gorgeous and you feel every ounce of power they've given Godzilla in the film. He is the King of the monsters and he's felt in every aspect of this movie."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This really hit my childhood. This is exactly what you expect a Godzilla movie to be plus more. Amazing story, characters, horror, and my god this is peek godzilla. There were some parts that were a little too unrealistic but this is a monster film after all. Will definitely be watching again."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie! interesting new twist on the story with the lead character.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"For context: I've been a pretty dedicated fan, since my childhood. Therefore, my opinion may be biased. That being said, 'Fuckin' A'! 
I was skeptical, but color me 'impressed'. 😁 I felt like it was a nice and subtle throwback to the original. Unlike most other 'Godzilla' movies, it accomplished something different. This film established the sub-plot, involving the humans; in a way that was engaging, understandable and made you actually care. It also involved some plot twists, that I did not anticipate. I will gladly go and watch it again. However, I would prefer to see it with others, who have not seen it; so as to see their reactions. 😊😆"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched all sorts of Godzilla movies since I was a kid back in the 1970s. This is the BEST that I've seen thus far. Highly recommend the sub version.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's the best Godzilla movie I've seen. It's has a great human story. I must admit that I had a ""Polaroid "" moment and teared up."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I never write a review but this movie was the best movie with special effects since Lord of the rings.  The storyline is phenomenal and Godzilla looked incredible.  I recommend you see this on the big screen!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Not your traditional Kaiju movie. This is a drama that is in a kaiju universe. Great acting and a great script. This will receive numerous film awards. Must watch
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,A cool and new outlook on the iconic king of the monsters special effects were wayy better then multi million dollar Hollywood flicks. And this movie payed homage to the original also kept to its roots the way it should be. Godzilla is a definite must see for all generations of Godzilla fans.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Thank you TOHO for making Godzilla right again. Keep it coming!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lifetime Godzilla fan here. As I've grown older, I still love the franchise as a whole, but unfortunately, as soon as Toho realized you could make money putting the focus on the giant monster versus battles compared to the human drama, it just hasn't been the same. However, this movie manages to give us a compelling and well-written AND well-acted story, with some of the best monster action to the date. Gojira has been my favorite for a while (GMK a close second), but Minus One is, for several reasons, my favorite, and I'm excited to take the whole family to see it tomorrow."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me this film was the best of the best Godzilla films ever made! I rank it with the original Godzilla 1954 for being the best! I thought the acting,storytelling and the music was spot on! As a full grown old man I cried because of the characters were so intense in their roles! Hats off to Toho and the Japanese people in making a grand masterpiece!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 100%"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the first Godzilla film from Toho since 2016 and it was honestly worth the wait. It hits you with every emotion especially sorrow and I cared for the characters so much I didn't want them to die. You feel for them throughout the film and want to cry with them. The incredible score adds to it. Godzilla surprisingly feels more scarier than Shin Godzilla which I thought was a high bar to reach but obviously I need to reevaluate my bars. The director is obviously a Steven Spielberg fan as well because Godzilla felt like Jaws. He was a force of nature unlike most Godzilla films. Godzilla Minus One is worth seeing on the biggest screen you can and I highly recommend you see this spectacle while it's in theaters.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,excellent story! the acting was phenomenal! best Godzilla ever!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic Godzilla film 👏
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It held true to the old Godzilla movies while still being a thrilling and absolutely terrifying experience. You could see the passion from all of the cast and they performed so well.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only the best Godzilla movie, but one of, if not the best movie in recent memory. Fantastic on every level"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is so much more than at first glance. Godzilla Minus One is a modern cinematic masterpiece that harkens back to the original Godzilla. The acting is top notch and the setting of post WW2 Japan is very somber. The overall theme of the story is one of survivors guilt. The visuals of the movies are amazing considering the budget of the film is a fraction of a Hollywood film. It may sound crazy but Godzilla Minus One should be considered for best motion picture or director at the Oscars.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, really true to the way Godzilla is portrayed. Spectacular cast aswell. Effects were amazing, overall a 10/10 experience for me."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Minus One is the best Godzilla movie of them all so far.  I was surprised by the depth of the story-telling and the poignant struggles of the main character.  Metaphors abound.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its simple - best Godzilla movie ever made. Its budget (15 million dollars) with its quality, both production and acting wise, puts to shame all Hollywood blockbusters. Go and see it - you will be very pleased, also by a surprisingly good and engaging human story."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought Godzilla had peaked once more with the amazing Shin Godzilla, and would be untouchable for years to come, but I was so wrong, and happily so. Godzilla Minus One is THE BEST Godzilla movie imo, and easily, one of the best movies of this year. It does something the western Godzilla movies fail to do, and that is have a captivating, compelling human element amongst all the destruction. You'd do a disservice to yourself not to check out this movie in theaters."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie I've ever seen perfectly blends monster action and human drama
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,best Godzilla film to date
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie  a little to much talking but Godzilla was right on the money!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the whole movie. Well done to the cast and crew. One of my favorite Godzilla movies
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla -1 was amazing S tier on this one if godzilla wasn't in it it still would have been a compelling story, The humans in this one matter and have real depth. I was shocked by the number of tears i shed during a friggin Godzilla movie. lots of powerful stuff going on in this one. I want to sit with it and see it again but this might be the greatest Godzilla movie of them all. i know its bold statement but WoW..... if you're any sort of Godzilla fan you owe it to yourself to see this on the biggest screen with the best sound system you can find. Best Movie of 2023 for me. I found nothing to nitpick. I cant really give any higher praise than that. everything works the actors are all top notch the cg was perfect the score amazing.... just wow"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great monster movie with a very strong (and surprisingly emotional) human story! Feelings of terror, hopelessness, sadness, joy, and triumph made this a very welcome part of the Godzilla franchise! An absolute must see"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED it. The human characters were interesting and had lots of emotion, godzilla was properly scary., the movie played out like a war film and mirrored the effects of Hiroshima, just like the original godzilla film.  The bits in the wooden boat were awesome.  Felt like Jaws with godzilla, so cool. And G's heat ray was awesome in this incarnation!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie for us Godzilla fans! This will be the go to movie for convincing your girlfriend that you're not a nerd for loving Godzilla from now on! Also, good story."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Thrilling. Emotional and a exceptional addition to the Godzilla franchise.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,a must see movie i loved it
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Go watch this movie now!!!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing character development and innovative approach to a Godzilla movie. Highly recommend, and suggest watching the movie in 4DX!"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Look,I'm a 58 year old American man that loves Godzilla Movies..This is by far the BEST I have seen..great story..great FX..it truly beat out all the big budget American movies! Someone else mentioned it has a Jaws kinda feel and I agree!.. It's in sub titles and STILL rose above all the others. Made me tear up at the end..and I can count on one hand when I've ever done that!..Bravo, Japanese Cinema Bravo !"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is hands down the best Godzilla movie yet. If you've only watcher the American godzilla movies PLEASE PLEASE WATCH THIS. The characters are written so well, and throughout the movie you grow with them, experience trauma with them, watch them break down and try to overcome it. It is seriously gripping, especially towards the end of the movie, with great twists and acting. The action is also great, and the way that Godzilla is seriously destroying everything in this movie and really being seen as a monster is very well done. This in general has to be one of the best movies released this year so please go watch it and give it the credit it deserves. Incredible ode to the original Godzilla they created while also making it modern but still mixing it with old touches, Japan really knows what they're doing when it comes to movies like this."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"phenomenal story telling, action, character development and emotion. this movie had me FEELING"
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Seriously good. Not just one of the best Godzilla movies but up there with the best movie of 2023!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever made.  Enough said.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,great Godzilla movie they need to dub English or a lot of people won't see it and deserves a bigger audience
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Was the best Godzilla movie to date. I didn’t think Shin Godzilla could be dethroned.  But it was
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow. Truly the best Godzilla film.
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Well done. Checks all the boxes you expect in a good Godzilla film.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen!! 10/10 must watch!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,greatest godzilla movie ever!!!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Takashi Yamazaki should be proud, he has set the new gold standard by which ever monster movie going forward should be held to."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,As a person who has watched Godzilla movies for 45 years I can tell you the King of the Monsters never looked so awsome. The story was well done and emotional just like the first in 1954
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly breathtaking, pretty much everything you want in a GodZilla film 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An Excellent Godzilla movie! They take it back to the roots and honestly this might be the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im a lifelong Godzilla fan (okay, obsessive) but believe me when I say that this may be the best in the series since the 1954 debut, and a film that can, and should be, appreciated by anyone. Everything works in this original, inventive film - the visuals and creature design, the believable story (given the irradiated monster in the middle of it), and the human drama that is so often the boring bits between atomic destruction.  Even if you have franchise fatigue, book your tickets for this one - well be talking about it for years."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely spectacular! Best Godzilla to date! An absolute must see!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"phenomenal movie, godzilla is insane and the humans in the movie are fantastic"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"When Godzilla arrived at Tokyo for the first time and his main theme started playing, everyone in my theater lost their minds, It was so nostalgic hearing Godzilla's main suite playing whilst he was destroying Tokyo! Godzilla's atomic breath scene was also one of the coolest things I've ever seen in a movie. His atomic breath is literally like a nuke exploding! One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Godzilla got half his head blown off, and he instantly regenerated it. Another cool part of this movie is when Godzilla ""dies"" and it cuts to a shot of a piece of Godzilla flesh regenerating, teasing a potential sequel. I forgot to mention how awesome these human characters are, I actually cared for these characters and I was worried for them throughout the movie ( Unlike past Godzilla films ). Also, can I mention how awesome the human story is? This is possibly the best human story I've ever seen in a Godzilla film. The plot to kill Godzilla was so creative in my opinion, sinking Godzilla to the bottom of the ocean so the sea pressure would crush him, and then when they bring Godzilla back to the surface to finish the job, it was so dang awesome! One of my favorite things about this film was the fact it had so many references to the old Godzilla movies, I noticed at least a few dozen references. I found out after I watched this movie that this film's budget was 15 MILLION DOLLARS! For reference, Godzilla vs Kong's budget was 155-200 million dollars! Getting to see Godzilla be the ""bad guy"" again was a nice breath of fresh air. I simply cannot put into words how much I enjoyed watching this film. Arguably the best Godzilla film ever made!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a die hard Godzilla fan if you've not seen this what the hell is wrong with you this movie in my eyes is a prequel to The original Gojira and is worth 10 million stars out of 5
Seeing Godzilla regenerate on the big screen where he regenerated part of his face holy cow and his heart was slowly regenerating in the water"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just a great Godzilla movie, it's a great movie period! Great story about war and the cost of war, friendship and family. The last line of the movie hit pretty hard especially if you or a loved one has served in the military. Plus it has Godzilla! Highly recommended!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I recently watched the original 1954 Godzilla movie and found it a great balance of monster movie and emotional drama. I'd suggest that the time and the movie culture of Japan in that time made the latter aspect a difficult challenge, but they did manage it. Subsequent Godzilla movies that I've seen have not provided this for me, but I fully acknowledge this isn't a franchise I've devoted myself to, so there are likely many that achieve this.

So that said, I struggle to remember a movie that I was more impressed with or enjoyed more. It was astonishingly good, with personal grief and emotion, seriously frightening scenes of devastations, and actual ""I'm not crying, you're crying"" moments (In a Godzilla movie!!). I really felt this wasn't a movie of monster devastation, but boy howdy was there monster and devastation, but a movie about people and how the heck would they deal with this catastrophe just shortly after the war that they'd barely survived.

You'll hear a lot about this film. Go see it so you can be the one who saw it first (okay this might be a little marketing).

*****

I've tried to avoid saying it's the best movie I've seen in years, but others are saying similar things. 

Like Forbes Magazine for example. ""…the latest reboot Godzilla Minus One is one of 2023's greatest films."" and ""The result is that Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla film ever made, and a masterpiece of kaiju cinema"""
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow... he was angry, and just, wow! TOHO nailed it this time."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect Godzilla movie!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,THAT SCENE WHERE THEY PUT THE BOMBS AROUND GODZILLA AND THEME PLAYING MY LORD IT THE BEST MOVIE THIS YEAR BY A LAND SLIDE
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal movie that really nails Godzilla. It perfectly portrays the scenes with the titular creature as terrifying and conveys the despair. The story is really good and you care for the characters. Worrying about what might happen to them as they encounter Godzilla. It’s a great movie
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Didn't think I'd say this about a Godzilla movie but I really cared about the humans! Well crafted characters that actually had you emotionally invested in them and their relationships, not only to each other but also to the star of the show himself, Godzilla. This is also the best looking and most realistic Godzilla ever and I remember thinking multiple times ""wow, they really put a lot of money into this movie."" Then I found out the budget was only $15 million! That made the movie even more impressive than it already was. Don't see this movie at home as your first experience....see it in the theatre! It's not only a love letter to Godzilla fans but a great film for all movie fans in general. Not doubt ""Godzilla Minus One"" is in the Top 3 Godzilla films of all-time if not the greatest! 5/5"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is how a Godzilla movie should be done! I love this movie so much!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is an absolute triumph. The human protagonists elevate rather than reduce the quality of the story, a quality that is missing in many Godzilla films. The story is thematically dense, thought provoking, tragic and yet uplifting. Whether you are a longtime fan or have never watched a Godzilla film, this movie will blow you away."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I  loved the story line , and the pace of the movie. Definitely top two movies of Toho.  I am seeing again tomorrow. !"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great version of Godzilla.  It's not just some monster movie - it has a good plot and heart-breaking personal stories behind it. It spins a story that older people will absolutely relate too, and the sci-fi/visuals are top notch.   If you are into all that cookie cutter comic book movies or think the masked singer is great forget this movie."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"To be honest, I have only ever seen the American Godzilla films. Which is why I was really excited when I heard this Japanese production was getting a wide release. And, as someone new to this franchise, Minus One floored me!
The acting is fantastic, the characters are endearing, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is awesome, the effects are fantastic, and Godzilla is terrifying!
I have but one spoiler-filled flaw with this film, and that's it!
This is a staggeringly fantastic blockbuster! It delivered so much of everything that I wanted as a newcomer to this franchise, that I can only imagine how ecstatic longtime Godzilla fans will be watching this film!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Eine herzzereißende Story gepaart mit super Effekten. 100%
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Un film su Godzilla in cui il mostro passa in secondo piano. Non fraintendetemi, è il miglior ""protagonista Godzilla"" della serie, davvero maestoso, esaltato dai moderni effetti speciali, un'accurata fotografia e la sua classica ed inconfondibile colonna sonora. Semplicemente la storia umana narrata nel film, e le riflessioni sulla cultura giapponese a cui questo porta, sono davvero incredibili per non farle passare in primo piano. La maestria del regista Yamazaki nell'abbinare a tutto ciò un buon vecchio stile cinematografico, ne fa il (mio) film più bello di questo 2023."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Geez that’s a good a** movie!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie, but I was thoroughly entertained, amazed, and enthralled. My partner and I both cried several times and hung onto every moment.

100/10, best movie I've seen all year, possibly ever. Quite possibly one of the most perfect movies.

Epic, emotional, and enthralling."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Oh when the big guy shows up and the theme starts playing slowly and builds.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This isn’t your typical monster movie but a monster movie with actual story progression that will leave you feeling bittersweet.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was truly a masterpiece ToHo did it again and all thanks to the director Takashi Yamazaki he made Godzilla scary again
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I have never seen another Godzilla movie before this but you don't have to. This movie is a stand alone Godzilla film that is perfect. The human story had me emotionally invested to where I was not bored when Godzilla was not on screen. When Godzilla was on screen I feared that he would kill our main character's. The acting from the cast is some of the best I've seen. I would recommend seeing this movie no matter who you are.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The acting was top notch. Generally I don't like to watch movies where I have to read the captions, but in this movie, it didn't interfere AT ALL with either watching the movie, or reading the captions. The story is very dramatic.  The Godzilla monster is absolutely vicious when it comes to killing and destroying.  The special effects with the Godzilla renders were excellent. Sometimes off when it came to navy ships.  The movie was not fast paced, but it did move along and didn't leave me bored at any point.  I enjoyed the story and the movie as a whole.  This movie proves you don't have to go all 200+ million dollars to create a great movie with top tier special effects.  If you like  great drama, great acting, and a great monster movie, this is the one!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie! A must go to for any fan of Godzilla. The character growth, acting, and vfx was really good. And Godzilla was the best acting character in this movie, the feels it provided just brilliant. Will be going again to see it."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had a compelling story, never stopped being entertaining, and worth the price of admission"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I can’t wait to see what they do next!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a very important film, in addition to being one of the best Godzilla films I have ever seen and the radical change between the current Godzilla and the legendary one is striking, but the sound is rarely very abrupt but the rest is extremely great."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,You have to go see it on the big screen!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is THE best Godzilla movie ever! Brings him back to his days of destroying everything in his path! Will definitely see this multiple times!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Undoubtedly, one of, if not the best monster movie there is."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way better than Shin Godzilla. In the prior Godzilla films, they failed to highlight the human story in a way that was emotionally relatable. This story did the human side justice.  From surviving WWII to encountering Godzilla, the main protagonist goes through hell. I know some Godzilla fans may be disappointed that there is less Godzilla, but this is almost a survival film and redemption. If you’re into story, I highly recommend this one. My second favorite Godzilla film after vs Destroyah"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An awesome Godzilla movie!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie had some classic godzilla easter eggs from the original black and white film. The human characters side story was also really good and could honestly make for a good short stand alone post WW2 film without Godzilla. American studios could really take a lesson on well written characters within a giant monster film
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I have no words and nothing but words.  It was phenomenal.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Over the past 7 decades, the Toho Godzilla series has offered everything from somber horror, to camp, to thrills, to almost arcade-like action - and I've enjoyed (pretty much) them all. This one takes us back to the beginning, and I swear Godzilla has never been more terrifying, or the human elements of the film more engrossing. This film will take hold of you emotionally more than any previous installment, and more than the vast majority of cinema has ever managed. It is a bit slow to set up, but it pays off. If subtitles bother you, I'm not sure a dubbed version is showing - but I also doubt a dub could do some of these performances justice.

What a film."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best godzilla in last years, absolutely perfect"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever, period! Could've used one more Godzilla mayhem scene and I would change only one thing with the ending but otherwise a great movie nonetheless, do not miss this it isn't some goofy corny Godzilla movie it's a character driven drama with great Godzilla scenes!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just returned from the cinema, I am enchanted. Great movie, very well written characters, engaging storyline. Probably the best movie I've seen in the cinema this year"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazingly well-made movie especially when you consider the relatively small budget. Both grand in scale and focused on the human side of things as well. It was emotional and gripping throughout and the pacing was great. Best movie I have seen this year as it was a total package of why we go to the movies.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,this film is a masterpiece. well done toho
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is soooooo bad the plot leads to no where of I wanted to waste time I would eat garbage 🗑️🗑️🗑️
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent film, one I f the best Godzilla films. Go see it!"
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm honestly surprised by all the glowing reviews. I was really excited to see this movie after watching the trailer, but it was a huge letdown. I'll admit, the opening was one of the best Godzilla segments I've ever seen, and Japan's Godzilla is way more terrifying than Hollywood's. But aside from the intense and terrifying Godzilla scenes (of which there were few), the film suffered from pacing issues and unlikeable characters. During one of its many slow sequences, the man next to me literally yelled, ""Just move on already."" I'd suggest just skipping to the Godzilla scenes when it comes out."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is most likely my favorite movie of the year. The strength of its storytelling and special effects are immense, but on a scale far more grand than the modest budget might have you think. The film is an interesting alternate take on the story of the original 1954 film, with many characters and scenes in homage to the classic, while also delivering amazing new ways the giant monster has not been perceived before and with a ferocity that can actually generate fear. Highest recommendation to any moviegoing fan, not just the genre junkies like me."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever you have to go watch it !!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"They show as the real Godzilla, they are work on it that is awesome"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie! Turning existential atomic dread into a more personal case of ptsd and survivors guilt resulting in an amazing story.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Toho's Latest Raises the Bar for Godzilla Movies and Kaiju Cinema
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The emphasis on the destruction he can cause was great
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing story along with cgi one of the best
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie that goes back to the series roots while taking a new perspective to the approach. Lively characters that are entertaining through the humor and the drama, and a ferocious relentless take on the Japanese beast. Haunting scores to go along with his appearances accompanied by fantastic acting. This film will remind you how haunting this time for Japan was."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film since the 50s!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Best monster movie I've ever seen.  The human story would have been good as a standalone story and fits in with Godzilla so well.  You can tell they paid homage to the 1954 origin too!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Something rare that Godzilla movies do is make you care and be interested in the human characters. The emotional feeling from the original 1954 film is recaptured here. You get attached to the main characters so much that it makes you wish that nothing happens to them. Godzilla is scary, and his performance in the film probably out beats the rest. This is not the hero that restores balance, or ""just an animal"", this is monster Godzilla. The writing is spectacular, and the film itself just looks amazing. Brilliant film. I would be disappointed if this film is not at least a nominee for the Academy Awards."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie to be experienced on the big screen. Being read with native language was a pleasure and felt authentic.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome Godzilla movie. Been an avid fan since I was a kid and this movie does it justice. Bringing back 1954 Godzilla as a scary unstoppable force. Even my wife who tagged along as support really enjoyed it. Great monster movie for anyone curious in dipping their toes in this kinda genre. Definitely getting it once released on digital, hopefully in good Dub so my kids could watch it."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"very emotional acting, subtitles throughout, you Still just cannot kill Godzilla....74 year old movie goer"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Always  a pleasure to see Godzilla on the big screen again and as a villain no less amazing movie, sfx and acting was phenomenal I didn’t cry personally but had my heart going couldn’t say less for my gf she cried lmao. A Mist Watch for sure"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Shin Godzilla
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely fantastic. It's simply an experience that cannot be skipped out on. It's an emotional ride of sadness and hope for the future. In this film Godzilla is absolutely terrifying and fun.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolutely amazing film definitely the best movie of the year and I will watch it again on the big screen long live the king!!!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just watched the film last night, and I rushed to see it again on IMAX tonight. 

This film is incredible. This was the first time I actually felt scared of Godzilla. The characters are also incredible, and was also the first time I cared if the characters' safety. I wanted them to survive the entire film... Except for Koichi. Koichi whined way too much for me. I wanted to slap him and tell him to collect himself. Other than that, my partner and I loved the film. This is the best Godzilla I've seen so far. Thoroughly loved the amazing story telling. I cannot wait to watch it over and over again on screen. Fingers crossed it gets more IMAX time 🤞"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,such a sigma movie all my sigmas should watch it
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was fantastic! All of Godzilla fans want more screen time for the big guy so that's a given. The movie was very entertaining and fx was done well. My only kind of negative thoughts is that I wanted more stomping through Tokyo...lol. Go enjoy it fan or not.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This may be the best movie of 2023.  Highly highly recommend.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is not only for Kaiju fans but for anyone who is looking for a good emotional action packed entertainment. Not only is the story well told but the visual effects have you questioning what is Hollywood doing these days because this movie is very low budget. A huge step up from ""shin:Godzilla""(2016) this movie is the most important movie to have come out of japan cinema in a very long time."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is one of the rare movies where I felt a true emotional connection to the human characters. Often in a Godzilla film you want more Godzilla and less of the ""plot humans"", but this movie hit the perfect balance. This is a movie about family, about the value of life, and returns Godzilla back to its serious origins. The effects are also a spectacle, never have I seen such a clear view at Godzilla and have him move in such an organic way. A monstrous Godzilla paired with a somber and beautiful plot. There has never been a better Godzilla film in theater."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The film blew me away! Best Godzilla movie since the 1954 original. Sound design was amazing. People are going to be talking about this film for a long time.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Extremely entertaining once the actions starts. The music is iconic. This new Godzilla is awesome.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is probably the most dramatic and emotionally filled Godzilla movie, that keeps you engaged from start to finish, with great scenes of destruction with the big G."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One may be one of if not the best film in the entire godzilla franchise!

Our main protagonists in the film are engaging and show us the struggles of post war Japan. We feel their sorrow and pain as well as their faith as they push for a better future.

As for the big G himself… WOW!! Every time he is on screen, you are on the edge of your seat! His presence is horrifying and majestic at the same time. He is a walking atomic bomb and it shows!

11/10"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great movie! Smart, mature, thoughtful, made by competent people with a really great artistic vision."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Godzilla films have long suffered from lackluster writing for the human characters. Don't get me wrong, I have seen every Godzilla movie and have been a fan since I was a kid, but it's always been about watching monsters destroying cities. Godzilla Minus One feels like a complete movie package. Great characters, great acting, a smart plot, and a Godzilla that is actually scary. Go see this one in the theater!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a long time Godzilla fan I went into this film with high expectations, and Toho certainly didn't disappoint. Not only does this film hold an empathetic and engaging human cast but it also tells a tonal and dramatic story of guilt, a soldiers duty, and the aftermath of war. Personally I would've enjoyed this as a standalone film, but the biggest cherry on top is how Godzilla was seamlessly weaved into the story. Godzilla actually played a large roll in the main character's motivations and development rather than the typical random obstacle to overcome. Godzilla himself harkens back to the original 1954 version, a terrifying monster, a force of nature with no rhyme or reason disturbed by humanity's meddling. Godzilla in this film is terrifying, even more so than 2016s Shin Godzilla. Overall I only had minor critiques throughout the film and despite personally finding the ending a bit disappointing, I think the rest of the film makes up for it completely. This film is not only an example of how to make an amazing monster movie, but also just an amazing movie in general. 10/10"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely amazing. It had an amazing story line and the characters in the movie were not useless to the story line. Also the movie did a great job in making the viewers actually care about the humans and what happens to them. They did a great job with the CGI making Godzilla look real. Over all this movie was a 9/10 definitely a must watch.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best Godzilla films ever created and should be seen by everyone!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best films of the year.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the greatest pieces of cinema ever out to screen! A sobering retelling of the original 1954 film, Godzilla Minus One (2023) displays the crippling tragedy of war through the metaphor of the monster who has, and always will, do it best. The film is a true emblem of the broken post-war Japan. The feelings of disgrace and overwhelming trauma of the war are expertly woven into the characters and their narrative, providing a gripping human element that gives to heart and weight to the film. A culmination of a nearly 70 year legacy, Godzilla Minus One (2023) is perhaps the best and most raw Godzilla has ever been."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One was a very emotional piece, with easily the best human story in the franchise, and quite a classic movie feel. I know this will definitely be one of my favorite films of all time for the rest of my life."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Terrifying, deeply moving, and thought-provoking. See it on the largest screen you can."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely masterpiece! Godzilla was terrifying and looked amazing. I've never been so invested in the human story of a Godzilla movie before
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Taking what makes Godzilla great and taking it back to basics.
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Monster Disappointment.  The writer/director (Takashi Yamazaki) talked this up as a film that would capture the horror, terror, and despair that Godzilla would create if real.  The teasers and trailers all mirrored that description, but the actual movie is 10% Godzilla and 90% human melodrama.  I am one of ""those"" Godzilla fans - the ones who go to a Godzilla movie to see Godzilla, not the human characters.  I never felt any connection to any of the characters and found myself looking at my watch during the last 40 minutes of the film.
I understand a lot of Godzilla fans love this movie, but I was not one of them."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie I've ever seen, it's amazing to see what this team did with a 15 million dollar budget. Great storyline and even better visual effects. It's a must watch on the big screen! I prefer the original Japanese with English subtitles viewing if you can make it."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, best version of Godzilla so far. Can't wait for what next!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible a fresh, real, human look at a genre we think we know. Godzilla has become enshrined mythos in Japanese culture and here it is examined through the eyes of authentic characters played by a superb cast. For truly the first time despite the phenomenal special effects we have seen him in the recent monsterverse films the creature is terrifyingly real. The cast and plot aided by top notch direction has given us dare I say it an Oscar worthy tale for the ages. "
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an amazing movie start to finish. The human element of dealing with ptsd, and how terrifying Godzilla is. This is what a monster movie should be. ..a scary Godzilla. Very well paced and balanced between Godzilla and the human element!!!!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme de todos os tempos, escolhendo o país asiáticos para gravar o filme ficou coisa de louco ficou ótimo amei maravilhoso
Os atores tbm escolhendo os melhores para gravar o filme elencos nota mil"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot of heartfelt moments and suspense to match. All in all a real good movie.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"As far as Godzilla movies go, Minus One is among the best of the best. Taking us back to a traumatic period in Japanese history, it reflects on Japan's place in the war, and how Godzilla itself is now a representation of trauma. It has great characters, great music, great action, and utilises its budget well. Great film."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie yet!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is one of, if not, the best Godzilla movie out there right now. The pacing is perfect. The story is phenomenal, when Godzilla shows up it is extremely tense, and you're on the edge of your seat rooting for the characters. The visual effects and design of Godzilla is some of the best I've ever seen, and it's not just Godzilla who's awesome, every character is well thought out and has their time to shine. It is a perfect balance of human and Godzilla, and they even benefit each other which isn't as common as it should be. I also want to say the sound design was extraordinary, when Godzilla is on screen, you don't just see him, you hear him too. Definitely a movie to see in the best screen/theater possible. I also want to mention the music was also amazing,  it was so cool to hear a ton of classic Godzilla music, and the new music made for this film is possibly better than the classic music. I walked into Godzilla Minus One expecting an amazing movie, but it was an experience I walked out of, and one I want to relive over and over again."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Must watch in 4DX theater. Story is compelling and the action is amazing. Heat Ray steals the show.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Spectacular! Best version of Godzilla movie I have ever seen. This was beautifully written and I will definitely be watching it again.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far, best Godzilla movie in terms of story and FX.  If there was anything bad, it would be not enough monster but then you run risk of boring movie so they really focused on character development so much that it feels like a post war drama with Godzilla as a backdrop.  What was interesting was the plan to kill the monster which was very creative and just something you never see the humans do in such a film which is fight head on with the monster."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Returned to a classic format and Godzilla looked amazing!
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sorry, this film had too many lapses in logic and was marred by poor, stilted, one-note acting to be effective. I mean, the best performance was by the young girl. That's kind of sad, you know. 
The premise is good, but what's on screen just progresses from one scene to the next like everyone is going through the motions. Maybe the only scene with any urgency takes place on the boat when the crew of four first encounters Godzilla. 
And seeing how the US base in Ginza must surely have been destroyed, it's incredulous to believe the US wouldn't get involved. If the director had wanted to get away with a pure fantasy film, he'd have done better to set it 200 years in the past. WWII memories are still very much alive and rewriting history like this is risky business."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yamazaki's Minus One is an essay on maximizing a modest budget by employing excellent character development that grounds this Godzilla outing to a degree that audiences haven't seen since the 1954 original.  It's a visceral tour de force with all the money on screen.  An engaging often poignant dramatic piece about community, PTSD and survivor's guilt along with self redemption.  The Godzilla set pieces are utterly riveting but it's the uniformly superb ensemble cast that will cement Minus One as one of the best films of 2023 and it's standing within the kaiju pantheon."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"An intelligent, emotional story about post war trauma and survival that just happens to have a radioactive monster arrive to add to the wartime devastation.   This is a movie that proves that you can blend realistic characters dealing with authentic problems with fantastical elements and make a compelling story.  In Japanese with subtitles as it should be.  The characters and situations are so well developed you could watch it without translation and still understand the film.   Kudos also for the attention to detail regarding the use of WWII Japanese military equipment and warships that are relevant to the story.   And Godzilla?  He never looked better.  True to the original 1954 version but with details not possible using traditional effects.    This is one enraged and destructive creature.   This is  a Godzilla movie that makes you forget the underwhelming Monsterverse offerings.  Go see it!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece! It earns that 98% RT score and SO MUCH MORE (no thanks to Adam Does Movies the only negative critic review). I urge anyone to see this movie you will come out more than satisfied.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla is the best. It finally makes Godzilla scary again. In no way is he saving Earth- he's the enemy now. He is so much more powerful. Loved the movie.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is my personal favorite Gojira movie ever made. It's definitely worth seeing in a theater.  Go support this movie if you are a fan!!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was a roller-coaster from the start. Godzilla was a malevolent force that almost took on a Terminator esque persona. The graphics most of the time were amazing and believable but at times seemed poorly paced and unrealistic.

As a faithful reimagening and retelling of the original Godzilla film. It's provides a unique look at how people deal with trauma and how to move on. 

It is a must see for any Kaiju lover and doubly so for a Godzilla fan."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great mix of Monster and human story. Great action scenes. Over all Godzilla is and still King of the monsters.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one is one of the best godzilla films to come out since godzilla 1954. Having characters you want to root for, a monster of war and the evils of nuclear power, and a rich story that doesn't get confusing a muddled like more recent *american* godzilla films.
The soundtrack having a dreadful feeling to it, including parts of the 1954 soundtrack that made me shake in my seat.
Godzilla is a true villain, but you can tell he is still just a mutated creature, having him only become physically dangerous with his heat ray when attacked.
This is the perfect prequel film, and I would gladly watch it again."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like Godzilla movies, you will love it. If you like a good story on loss and redemption, you will love it as well"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie so much. best Kaiju movie.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in theaters to watch this film and….
This blew away my expectations, best Godzilla film of all time right next to Godzilla 2014, King of the Monsters, and the original  1954 film.

I seriously recommend this timeless masterpiece to all those about to go out there to the movie theaters, like seriously they made the Godzilla and the human screentime perfectly balanced, and fixed the Goji screentime problem. Filled with emotions, horror, dark tones, and relations.

I'm not kidding, this is the best movie of all-time now (to me at least) but still, I recommend this movie, it was SPECTACULAR I promise you."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,SEE IT IN IMAX OF YOU CAN
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla movie ever made.  Outstanding acting and story.   Godzilla was really pissed off during the movie.   A surprise ending.    A must see.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful, directing, powerful film. Great acting all around, Godzilla is scary again."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a movie first, and a Godzilla movie second. Yet, it does not neglect the giant monsters. 

Godzilla is very present, and very destructive. 

This movie is more like Shin Godzilla than Godzilla: Final Wars. It's a beautiful piece of cinema that often leaves you astounded at what is presented. 

Run to see this movie in theaters. The sound design is so amazing, it deserves an award. The movie simply sounds better in a theater then it could possibly sound on any smaller screen."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"EVERYTHING WAS GOOD MOVIE OF THE YEAR IT WAS GREAT REALLY HEARTFELT FOR MY BIC BOI
GODZILLA"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not as intellectually stimulating as Shin Godzilla, Godzilla: Minus One succeeds in almost every area, making it a must see for any fan of monster movies or war dramas."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,this isn't just one of the best godzilla movies ever it's one of the best movies ever period
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first monster movie in a long time where I gave a crap about the humans. I wasn’t just waiting for Godzilla to appear… but when he did … what a payoff! Run, don’t walk! Run like Godzilla was chasing you!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I’m old enough to remember the first Godzilla movie by Toho. First there was the English language version with Raymond Burr which was shown for years on TV when I was a kid. It was an amalgamation for the original Japanese language film which was finally available years later. Far superior. This latest from Toho may be the best yet. Great character development and story. Set after WWII and the aftermath of the Japanese defeat. The way the writers tied all the characters together was amazing. You really cared about them. Of course the monster and the effects are simply breathtaking. I came away feeling like I just saw one of the best films of the year. A must see even if you never saw the original. Brilliant. 
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie.  Probably my favorite Godzilla movie and one of my favorites of 2023.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Godzilla is enraged and relentless. The story telling and human connection is superb. The score is so much fun. Great acting and fantastic work, was thoroughly surprised to find out later it only had a $15m budget. Stunning. A+++"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the best movie with the iconic Japanese monster GODZILLA, a Moral  Anti-nuclear and the very destruction of human beings. I love the fact that GODZILLA in this movie really feels the suspense."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Not so much Hollywood involved. Just a great origin story!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie does what previous Godzilla movies have failed to do and that is human characters that you’ll actually want to root for and care about. As for Godzilla himself, he is done incredibly well. They have brought him back to his original roots like he was in 54. This movie is truly a top contender for the best Godzilla movie."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie of all time, puts the western adaptations to shame. And does it with less than half the budget."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The whole movie kept you attentive both with waiting what Godzilla did in a scene and the story with the characters. The atomic breath scene towards the end was probably at the same height as the Oppenheimer bomb scene.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Minus one is the best movie of the year!

Just got back from an early access fan event. It was absolutely fantastic! The story, human characters, destruction and visual effects are the best the series has ever had. His atomic blast is literally atomic. Not just a great Godzilla move but a great movie period. The best I've seen this year. See it in whichever theatre near you with the best sound system. The Dolby cinema sound was mind blowing. Godzillas roar never sounded better."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I cannot apologize for my review. 5/5 is ridiculous. Are there flaws? Absolutely...but they are minor. For a 15 Million dollar film, I now know that Hollywood is broken. CGI is like the graphics debate of video games. Good stories resonate over fancy visuals.

Am I a lifelong Godzilla fan? Yes. I love 1954, 84(85), Destoroyah, and Shin. But this is by far the best balance of human drama while respecting Godzilla's original themes. Honda and Tanaka would be proud. I am glad Japan has reclaimed its creation. The Reiwa era has followed up with a nice K.O. punch."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Don’t expect to see godzilla in every scene, this movie builds great characters and when you do get godzilla it makes it more worth watching"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I phenomenal movie. One of the best I seen this year. Godzilla is at his most terrifying we have seen him. The human plot is actually worth watching for once. A must see
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A brutal and violent new take on Godzilla that gives new life to the original storyline. Acting is great, story is sad but with several relief characters that give you hope, and Godzilla is a frickin’ sea monster in a way we haven’t seen before. I’ve watched it twice and it’s amazing."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I applaud this movie for having characters we actually enjoy! Everything about this movie is perfect as a Godzilla movie and very well crafted as a legitimate movie. It's better than basically every Godzilla movie and I thought Shin Godzilla was as good as it was gonna get for a newer Godzilla film. Part of the top 3 best Godzilla films that almost anyone can like/love, fan or not. Just be warned that this movie is just as dark as the original in some aspects to the point where you could get teary-eyed watching it."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was incredible. Compelling human drama, outstanding music, and absolutely TERRIFYING. The scariest Godzilla has ever been. Must see on the biggest screen possible. Had me tearing up and rooting so much for the humans."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie Ive seen personally. Usually the human characters seem bland and are just there to fill time. This movie I actually felt emotional connection towards most of the main cast. 10/10
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I've been a Godzilla aficionado since childhood. This is the best Godzilla movie I've ever watched. Magnificent and happy to go see it again.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to an early showing of the film on November 29th, It was a last-minute decision spurred by my love of kaiju films and a desire to see new movies, I invited a few friends and when leaving the theatre we were speechless with only one thing to say, ""We need to watch this again."" I was blown out of the water by the superb acting and the amazing visuals. I am not an emotional person, especially with films but I teared up and cried at 2 distinct points in the movie, When watching most monster films you wish for the razing of cities and the visual of the destruction and loss of life, here is quite the opposite, believable human characters that you immediately fall in love with. I see this movie as one that is a must-see and at that, a must-see on the big screen, fans of Kaiju films Jaws, and Jurassic Park will surely enjoy. 10/10 no complaints"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the 3 BEST G movies ever!  Completely stand alone G movie with amazing effects and a heartfelt story. Absolutely loved it! The '54 original, Shin G, and now Minus One are the the standouts in his long running franchise. The American ""Monsterverse"" movies just can't compete with ANY of Toho's Japanese movies. They lack the charm and feel in every way imaginable. Saw this one in 4DX so it wasa all that much more fun!
Thank you Toho and PLEASE don't stop your truly original entries. Fan for life!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie does what it set out to do perfectly, and is a must watch for practically anyone who's even slightly interested.

Despite my soft spot for the American films, they're sloppily written, and are sometimes overbearing and cartoon-ish with just how much they show the monsters doing ""cool things.""
Minus One has significantly less Godzilla than the American films, and yet has a 100% better use of the monster for what it wants to do. Godzilla is on screen for the perfect amount of time, and is used in a near perfect way.
All of the rest of the screen-time is used by extremely well written human characters, well developed themes, and proper execution of the plot.

Overall, this is easily my favorite movie of the Godzilla franchise, and deserves all the praise that it's getting. Absolute must watch."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie did amazing making Godzilla a destroyer, a monster to the human race. His design along with the amazing CGI did him justice. I'm also amazed that the movie made the Human characters so loveable and when the movie progresses you really see how they conquer there issues and trauma. This is probably the very first movie that made me love the human characters in a Monster movie.! And the ending makes me want to watch more so I'm super exited for the sequel!!  100%, 20/10 movie worth the watch"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visual movie with emotional acting taking the place of  over the top special effects
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I was not prepared for how amazing this movie would be.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie all the way around! Great plot, great acting. I normally can't watch movies with subtitles, but this was SO good! This is one of my favorite looks for Godzilla, aesthetically; but as far as the destruction he causes in Minus One, it's the absolute best, in my opinion. He is very violent and powerful. Was a great experience watching in a theater. It's a must see!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great character development and chemistry. The best live-action Godzilla that brings back the original black and white Godzilla memories to the fans.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Ayo who let them cook
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is peak cinema -Martin Scorsese
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla minus one is one of the best Godzilla movie I watched to date. Make sure to watch it in IMAX make the experience even more enjoyable.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was the absolute best godzilla movie ever. I felt the genuine fear in people , so much emotion in this movie.LOVE IT"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,A much more moving story than I expected from a Godzilla movie. Really enjoyable experience overall!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a great addition to the Godzilla franchise.   The plot was great. Cinematography and special effects good also.  Godzilla has serious anger management issues but this was offset with a really heart warming storyline.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute peak Godzilla
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I mean this is a masterpiece, I mean it's a masterpiece. Not only is this one of the best Godzilla movies but it's a geniunely FANTASTIC movie. With a very fresh concept, surprisingly deep characters, excellent acting, great drama, pleasing visuals, a fantastic score, and bone-chilling Godzilla sequences, this movie is truly incredible! 10/10, A+"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I really hope this movie gets serious consideration for Academy Awards. It is so perfect.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The raging King returns! 
A great 21st Century Japanese culture/international level SFX entertainment film, one thing we have been waiting for to come up from the Land of Rising Sun and they finally did it.
I salute to TOHO and the production staff.

To me, the story of ""Godzilla Minus One"" and its cinematic perspective against of ""Shin Godzilla"" have a little bit in a similar relationship between ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". 
Portraying one huge raged-god-like creature and the people against but from two near-totally different characters and their standpoint s, but, both are still ""Catastrophic and horrifying Godzilla landfalls on Japan and the Japanese"". 
They have their own pro and cons yet both they are good films, and simply very scary as well as an encouraging film, too, by the end.

Viewing in a DolbyCinama if not IMAX strongly recommended to hear his devastating roar and stamp."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie! The human characters are well written and the emotional beats hit hard. The themes are clear and poignant, and it doesn't hurt that the monster action is captivating.

A must see for any movie enjoyers"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible!!!!! One of the best movies I have seen in my life so far. One of the best Godzilla main movies since the original.

The acting is incredible. The human connections the bonds, the real worry and terror!

The way they presented Godzilla in this Minus One is one of the most terrifying and genuinely scary renditions I have seen.

Just incredible!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"In complete shock.

Such a beautiful movie - Story, Score, Acting, Cinematography, Sets, Costumes....all the things.

Godzilla is actually rather secondary to the story and the moral of it 

I actually cried.

Went for a campy nostalgia trip and saw one of the best movies I've seen in years. #GoSeeIt #GodzillaMinusOne"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot was excellent, CGI was good. I found it interesting that some of the effects had a feel of an older Godzilla movie and the use of the old soundtrack made it feel really nostalgic but modern."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not just the best Godzilla movie ever made, the best made movie of the year."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was one of the best action movies I've seen in a while. I've really enjoyed the Legendary monster movies, but they could take a lesson from Toho and Takashi Yamazaki on how to create characters and story that are compelling enough to carry the movie without the monster. Then add one heck of an awesome interpretation of Godzilla and you get one of the best movies in the series. The real shocker here is that Toho did this on a $15 million budget. Disney/Lucasfilm/Marvel...Are you seeing this?"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,BRINGING GODZILLA BACK TO ITS ROOTS TO WELL WRITTEN CHARACTERS AND A NORE INTIMIDATING GODZILLA! HELL YEAH!!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a Masterpiece in the genre, this is more than just a monster movie. It tells the story of a kamikaze pilot who struggles with shame, ptsd and survivors guilt while trying to take care of an adopted family. The story at times can beat a gut punch sprinkled with moments of levity between likable characters you learn to love and care for, which makes it all the more terrifying when Godzilla is on screen. Minus One delivers an exceptional story and returns Godzilla to what the original film intended him to be, a terrifying force of nature. Something Godzilla has been lacking for quite a while."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it. I went to see this with my brother and cousin and they loved it as well. The whole movie was amazing I love the action and drama. I would give this movie at least 5 Oscars awards. I love it and I would definitely watch again.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow just wow. Probably the greatest Godzilla movie made. For the first time I was interested in the human characters while enjoying Godzilla as a monster. 
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely the BEST visuals in a Toho Godzilla movie to date!  It's a movie that MUST be experienced in a theater to get the full larger than life feel that Godzilla is portrayed here.  Arguably the best action flick overall in 2023...the hype and rave reviews are legit...GO SEE IT!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome! The 4DX was off track so it was doing things when there was just a conversation and it was kinda annoying!! I wish it woulda synced up better
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Toho Godzilla movie to date, the human characters and story were interesting and not just fillers between the monster stomping destruction.  The big guy himself was more terrifying and powerful than ever...and that's a good thing 👍🏼"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,What a wonderful and triumphant masterpiece for Toho! Absolutely loved it. If Godzilla were not in this film it still would have been an emotional drama worth watching. Godzilla was fierce and scary as Hell!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was purely amazing. It was nice to see Godzilla as a horror monster then as some action hero. Godzilla roaring sent shivers down my spine.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The human drama is as compelling as the spectacle. The best movie of the year.
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,The effects are on point but I found it to be nothing more than the same old same old with Godzilla. Is it possible to retire this IP 
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my family and had us in suspense. I am a seasoned Godzilla fan and I was in awe throughout the movie. Go watch and be amazed.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This Godzilla movie has a very cool and terrifying Godzilla with very likable characters. it's a must watch for fans and I think even if you ain't a fan of the franchise you'll probably like this one.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been a Godzilla fan all of my life (I'm 37) and this is one of the best, possibly even the best. A must see!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, a perfect Godzilla film, acting , score, writing and action!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely going back to see it again.
Hopefully 4D."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen most of the Godzilla movies and this y far the best. I plan to buy the 4k dvd if it comes out. For anyone that wondered if the original origin could be remade better this movie should convince you. There is no Raymond burr character, but they do have a quick tip of the hat is a very dark way. Speaking of dark, they do make Godzilla out to be scary and most likely the most powerful variant. By the way, the acting was also the best I have seen, even better than most of this years films. A real tear jerker actually."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the BEST Godzilla film I've seen in 50 years! Well done!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though there were a couple scenes where some effects looked kinda off, I truly feel that this is a worthy successor of Godzilla, and a new starting point for Toho’s plan for the monster in the future."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,2023 making me feel like a 7 year old again with FNAF and now this AMAZING action filled atomic breath action and horror movie | the writing is actually good but to let you now you are reading subtitles the whole time and the ending I was amazed critically 10/10 as a Godzilla fan 100000000000/10
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie that manages to balance the fearsome spectacle of a ruthless killing behemoth with the story of a broken man trying to reconcile his cowardice. While the movie may have the occasional dragged out slow down, but it still manages to set the stakes for a cathartic finale."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"So amazing. Great combination of OG Godzilla, Legendary Godzilla, and a twist of Godzilla only TOHO could give us. So well done. Definitely one of my favorite Godzilla movies ever. Must see for any Gojira fan."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. I enjoyed this movie. Felt very fresh. The emotional rollercoaster this movie bestows is great. The action packed sequences, the destruction all amazing."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have loved godzilla as a kid and my first Godzilla movie was Godzilla 2000 and it's still my favorite. Watching Godzilla minus one took me back to when I was younger and made me realize why he is my favorite movie character. Godzilla minus one shows the terror, destruction, emotions, and so much more. This movie made me tear up so many times and made me care for the characters that no other Godzilla movies has ever done for me. Highly recommend this movie! It's definitely in my top 3 Godzilla movies of all time."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"absolute masterpiece. The best Godzilla movie since the original. Toho should be proud of this. I cried, I felt anger, I empathized, I felt fear and dread."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"First Godzilla movie where the characters were just as interesting to watch as the main monster. The characters had depth and developed through the film and Godzilla (as usual) never disappointed when he was on screen. Toho has made, what I believe, there best Godzilla film since the original back in 1954."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A cinematic masterpiece, it's dark, it had great human characters, great pacing and story, great action scenes, and arguably the scariest and most badass Godzilla in the whole entire franchise, definitely a must see in theaters and its one of the best films in the franchise and its on par with the 1954 original."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great character development, really made me invested in the story. Way better take on the story then the recent American versions."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Godzilla movie with characters and a story you actually care about, perhaps even more than seeing Godzilla. But, the Godzilla parts are epic and kind of terrifying."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story 100/10. Depiction of the aftermath of WWII 1000/10. Absolutely perfect timing for BGM! 100000/10. Honestly,  this is probably one of the best movies made for 2023, and I hope more Godzilla movies by the same director are made."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! Godzilla doesn't play in this one. He's an unstoppable, killing machine."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its one best Godzilla movie since Shin Godzilla. The story was great, the charters were well written, CGI was pretty good for a low budget film, and Godzilla was very scary. I highly recommend to see this film if you can stomach the subtitle and trust me, this film is worth it."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The human plot is an Oscar worthy film on its own. Godzilla is added in as a perfect emulsion.  Takashi Yamazaki has done to Godzilla what Christopher Nolan did to Batman.  Perfect.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,No need to go into great detail here...this movie is fantastic. I felt like a 12-year old again watching this.  The visual effects are stunning and the human story was better than any in the 70-year series.  Definitely a big-screen watch.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely my favorite Godzilla movie of all time! 
It truly captures the best visual representation of Godzilla to date.  Everything from the crisp clear CGI, the portrayal of power, the fear invoking unbridled nature of the beast, the ferocity, the aura of invincibility all come together beautifully.   And that is just the King of Monsters by himself.  Add the most interesting human character development and storyline of any of its over 30 movies and its an absolute chef's kiss!!! You truly have to experience this one in IMAX!  I'll be seeing this one again!!!  A love letter to fans of Gojira with the best elements of previous films.  Go see this!!!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a fun movie! It's not perfect, but it is awesome! This movie has a lot of heart which I did not expect."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best Kaiju movie that's ever been released. It also has the most compelling human storyline to ever appear in a godzilla movie. The most amazing cinematography. It truly felt like I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie I've seen in a long time
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily one of the best Godzilla films
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla back to form.  Amazing and heartbreaking characters with the reality of a post war country in disarray
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must seea!!!!! Absolutely brilliant film. Phenomenal story, solid character development and ok special effects. It was great to see Godzilla back to his old ways again!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Being a long time Godzilla fan I was hoping for a good Godzilla movie. I instead after watching had to contend with the fact that this is just plainly a good movie.

It has a great story excellent acting and poignant themes that keep you interested as well as pulling off some heart stopping suspense and amazing action scenes.

Making this an Exceptionally Excellent Godzilla film and a great film overall I've recommended all my friends go see it."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,As a childhood fan of the original movies I felt they connected well with the audience in true Traditional Godzilla formula. 
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty much right up there with ’54.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a true masterpiece of a Godzilla film. Godzilla himself looked absolutely amazing. Toho has really come a long way and the story itself was very memorable!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nostalgic! If you liked the old original Japanese version of Godzilla, this movie will take you back in time. The destruction, the storytelling, and unified effort to combat a monster during a time when modern technology was still on the rise is all in this movie.  I loved it. I also appreciate the nod to history and how the Japanese people had to struggle to survive and repair their cities post-WW2. This is a great addition to a timeless classic! Bravo!"
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I’m really not sure what the critics are watching but it wasn’t the same movie I saw. Pretty terrible. Pacing was off, story was okay but strange editing choices. Acting was… weird. Just strange, didn’t feel like genuine human reactions at many points, made me laugh for than feel anything. Props to the actors you can tell they are really trying their hardest. But man… just BAD lol. It had a couple (literally about 3) good lines and scenes. Characters make dumb decisions, not enough Godzilla, just a HUGE disappointment. I really would not recommend this to anyone."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A new bar has been set for monster films. A instant classic in the genre. A beautiful character driven film with the most terrifying Godzilla we've ever seen as a backdrop to the story. Cinematography, music, acting, even the CGI is all top notch. This is a must watch for all kaiju film fans as well as fans of all Japanese cinema."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is actually amazing! If not almost perfect. You actually care about the human characters this time around , unlike the WB monsterverse movies. - Go out and support this movie in theaters!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,What did I like?  EVERYTHING!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a proper Godzilla movie and probably one of the best in the entire series. I would say that if you or your kids don’t mind to read subtitles (not an issue with anime fans), the whole family can go and see this and have a great time!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good. Kept you interested the whole movie. Nice balance between the story interest of the pilot and  Godzilla
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the finest Gojira movies I've seen.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever watched on screen. A true masterpiece by Takashi Yamazaki that actually feels and looks like an updated version of the original. A must see for all fans.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a fun time at the movies for sure a great Kaiju movie, loved the actual monster he showed out  🌊🤟🏻"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow!  Just finished G-1 in IMAX and wow what a movie!  Godzilla has saved the movie going experience with what us easily the best movie of the year. They even gave us IMAX Godzilla Minus One movie posters. What an experience!!!!!  Awesome pulse pounding movie with great acting special effects and that musical score and sound effects. Hollywood please take notes!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The main character has top tier acting. Probably the most talented actor I've seen in a while. The human plot is so well done and gets you so invested. The movie does an amazing job of capturing the damages and destruction Godzilla causes. The first design had me a little worried but once I saw Godzillas true look, it was in awe. They did an absolutely amazing job with the design and effects that it really made Godzilla horrifying. I hope to see more from Toho soon!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,After seeing this at the early screening I can say this is my favorite Godzilla movie and in my top 5 movies. Finally a movie that isn't just a fun monster movie but an in depth character study and period piece that lives up if not improves upon the original. The arc of Koichi learning to live is beautiful and perfectly fits the story and the time period. While the effects are a bit clunky at the for a 15 million dollar movie it rivals some 300 million dollar movies.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,A total must-see! It was a rollercoaster of emotions and a lot of beautiful visuals! One of the best Godzilla movies ever!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This has to be one the THE BEST Godzilla movies Ive seen. The story was heartbreaking and I actually cared about the human characters. Godzilla looked incredible and was actually terrifying and had some amazing destruction scenes.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a Masterpiece! definitely go watch it. the acting was superb and Godzilla was just pure evil! there were some parts that were really sad and some people were actually tearing up. the movie got a standing ovation 👏. will be watching it again it's only going to be in theaters for a week only so if you get a chance GO WATCH THIS MOVIE! 🍿
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw it last night it was very well put together, the action was great the humans in the movie were very great it was like watching Godzilla of old but up to date it truly is a great film"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla fans will be well pleased with this reimaged origin story. I saw it at the IMAX screen. It has a good story, a little of Godzilla Raids again story line here. (how the Japanese fight Godzilla) The tormented lead character is played well by the actor. I dare say non-Godzilla fans will like this movie just for the story . Oh yeah, Godzilla's frickin' AWESOME in the movie. Damn ,2 thumbs way up!!!!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heartfelt, Thrilling, and above all else a Masterpiece!! For any diehard fan or newcomer this is a must see Film! There is a fresh spin on Godzilla's Abilities that was quite a surprise. See in 4DX worth every penny!!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely succeeds in being a character drama, a period piece, a war movie and above all else a monster movie. It resonates on  a number of levels. See it on a big screen if you can."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"If it aint the best Godzilla movie to come out since the original, its close in the runnings. This is the movie that casual fans and movie goers can jump into and do so along side the crowd who fell in love with the people in rubber suits. Fair warning, watch the trailers for the movie. Its the majority of the movie minus the final act. How you feel during that minute and a half trailer is how you are going to feel the entire 2 hour runtime. By the time the credits hit, you will be exhausted, and the movie will run rent free in your head the rest of your night. See it as early as possible if you want to see it with the fans of the big guy for all these decades. Wait for the applause that will come from the crowded theater at the end. 

The story will keep you invested. The pain you feel, will be along side the characters who might face death at a moments notice when they are not trying to rebuild not just their lives, but their broken selves. Godzilla is a money shot every frame he is on that camera. The cinematography and the sound editing is insanely pulled through. it was like the director had a sense of playfulness with his vision for maximum impact. There is a double usage of Godzilla's original theme for his rampage, but each use is done differently, with the music pushing on a sense of beautiful irony as we get to our climactic moment. Even more interesting is its multitude of themes. Themes are very prevalent in this movie. You have failure and shame, sins of the past. What dictates a family? A subtle hint at the end of Samurai culture as they tackle the notion of self sacrifice for the greater good and how as a nation they should look forward. A strong anti-war message. In my view, a smaller one is this is a movie made by the grandsons of those alive during that time. the ones who felt the effects of the ending of WW2 Japan. The original 1950's movie was a sense of a nation processing the atom bomb. This movie is the next generations message going forward while looking at their own past."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was made for true G-fans! From the storyline to the visuals. Absolutely fantastic!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything a Godzilla movie should be
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen. Hands down. Probably because it's a movie first and Godzilla is in it. There's a real story involving humans. The Godzilla sequences are amazing and made more so because you are invested in the human characters. This deserves an oscar nomination. At least for best foreign picture.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla is a fuckin menace
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,First scene for real 💯💆
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The scene of Godzilla's attack on Ginza is nothing short of spectacular. Familiar landmarks like the Nihon Theater and Ginza Clock Tower are systematically destroyed, revealing Godzilla's malevolence and outright hostility towards humanity. Additionally, there are many scenes filmed at Godzilla's feet, intensifying the overwhelming scale of the creature. The sheer magnitude of Godzilla's presence becomes palpable, leaving a lasting impression."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I ever seen
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Soooo BAD!!! I fell asleep!!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,what a great movie thoroughly enjoyed myself
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film, some aspects of which take inspiration from the original Gojira, as well as Godzilla Raids Again. The human plot is well done, and keeps you engaged for the upcoming spectacle."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie that captures the same feeling I had when I first saw an old Godzilla movie on the TV back in the 70's. I was in complete awe. The story was solid, and Godzilla was terrifying! Thank you TOHO!"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I saw this on early access fan night in IMAX.  I really liked this movie.  I thought the human aspect added so much to the story and made for a good movie.  Very well rounded.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen would have been one more scene of Godzilla destroying another city!  One is never enough!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The absolute best Godzilla Ive ever seen outstanding
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is exactly what you'd expect - it was a good movie that did what it set out to do. There was little things in the progression of the characters I didn't like, to which it won't get a 5 star from me. Loved certain memorable scenes with Godzilla that blew me away  - this is the classic and fresh new era for the Famous Apex Predator. The cast was phenomenal - there were moments I felt my goosebumps. Yet this movie fell short at the 1 yard line and it was only because the writers and director fumbled to complete the masterpiece."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Three words: Godzilla welcome back.
"Dec 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,I appreciate that the movie focuses more on the human story vs just using the humans to transition between action set pieces. That being said I wish there was one more action scene and one less dramatic humans scene (or shorten one of the longer dramatic scenes to add an action scene). The action sequences were incredible and the CG is very good considering the budget. The acting is pretty good all around even though it drifts into B movie territory on occasion (not really a bad thing). I'd like to see this again in IMAX while it's still in theaters!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Film was one of the best this year. Incredible characters and story. Godzilla is genuinely scary with his stare and dead emotion responses. Phenomenal filmmaking all around.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie felt a little long in certain moments, but definitely the best Godzilla movie I've seen."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute BANGER. Modern Hollywood should never be allowed to touch this IP again. Thank you Toho.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best godzilla movies of all time and one of the best movies of this year!!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was such a Great movie, a release from over CGIed, no story movies. This being on a small budget, was better than anything on a $200m budget. The subtitles were not an issue, nothing was rushed, easy to follow and not miss the anything on the screen. Loved every minute, serious contender for Oscar !!!! Very emotional and you focused on Godzilla every second he was on screen."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the action great cast members beautiful story line ❤️
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually a great movie , even if there wasn't an awesome non westernized Godzilla,  I would watch this movie"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is something else. This isn't your ordinary Godzilla movie. It is a masterpiece in my eyes. Genuine emotion and compelling characters. A movie about the indomitable human spirit, and how hope can make us prevail.
This is one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've had.

Saw it on iMAX, November 29th, 2023"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the Godzilla movie true fans have been waiting for forever.  It is awesome.  It is a great movie.  Not just a great Godzilla movie.
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Arguably the best Godzilla movie ever!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie would recommend
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fantastic my grandfather and I loved it
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything the 2014 Godzilla should’ve been
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Intense, Emotional and Exceptional"
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent Godzilla film to add to the trilogy!
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Without a doubt the greatest Godzilla movie of all time. An absolute must watch for any fans of Godzilla, and I strongly recommend it even if you have never seen a Godzilla movie."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is not just a good Godzilla movie, this is an excellent film no matter WHAT standard you want to use. Go see it now before Toho's limited time run is over."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even more terrifying than the original color version, almost thought I was watching the original 1954 film with how similar many of the shots looked. Hope this version is included with home releases, will probably watch this edition over the color one due to how much more effective the scares are in B&W."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Phenomenal movie and the Godzilla design is amazing. Must see for anyone
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just watched this movie. It puts Lengendary's movies to shame. This is more than about Godzilla, it's about the aftermath of WW2  in Japan. This is a move worth going to see. It's only in the U.S. for a week."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"A decent but predictable story. Probably the best story for the people in a Godzilla movie that I've seen, though that bar is kind of low."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is truly a work of art for any Godzilla fan to enjoy also the movie gives the best thrills of this year!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"There are few good Hollywood movies nowadays superior to or on par with this one (the exception being Oppenheimer). This movie is almost flawless and better than you'd have expected, meanwhile, I can't remember the last time I walked out of a theater this way. It is undoubtedly one of, if not, the great film of the decade so far! All on a $15 million, that just blows my mind."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible!!! The visuals, the music, the story, the acting, it all comes together to create one of the greatest Godzilla movies ever made. An absolute must see for any Godzilla fan."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Damn good. Characters that I care about. Godzilla is actually the monster. Totally worth it.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is what a Godzilla film should be
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This a good Godzilla movie and a great movie in general over all.  The story telling is great and it's reference to post WW2 is very well done.  It's easily a 8,5/10."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolutely amazing spectacle that you'll have to see to believe the effects and score was absolutely amazing and the human story is one of the best in the whole Godzilla franchise. An amazing movie for both Godzilla fans and average movie goers will love can't recommend it more go see it in theaters and experience the monstrous Godzilla in theaters!!!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can never get enough Godzilla in my zilla movies, but that's me. this movie is top 5 for sure. I can't wait to see the next one. finally, a great story and good human drama mixed in. A must watch for fans and casuals."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely amazing, I loved everything part of it. I usually go to godzilla movies to see the G Man rain terror on humans, but this movie had me invested in the lives and well-being of the human characters and not just godzilla. Overall, it is a must watch for anyone who loves a compelling story and giant monsters."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing best Godzilla has ever been
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was such a great cinematic experience! Minus One is as much a horror film as it is a war drama. Definitely harkened back to the dark tone of the original Godzilla and got some Jaws vibes as well. The human characters served as an integral part to the plot and definitely added depth and emotion. Such great cinematography as well, possibly the best looking Toho Godzilla yet. Overall, this movie was the perfect reboot to the Toho Godzilla. I can't wait to watch it again!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a masterpiece, surpassing even Godzilla 1954 in my opinion. I consider it the best Godzilla film ever made. Effectively, it serves as a perfect remake of the 1954 classic, devoid of 1950s American film restrictions for Japanese film. It sets out to tell a story of loss and hope, narrating it in such a masterful way that you become attached to the characters without the need for language. You could enter this film with no prior knowledge of its plot and emerge utterly stunned.

As a Godzilla fan, I anticipated greatness, but what I experienced left me so awe-struck that I found myself unable to speak for a good 20 minutes. Every aspect of the film, from the setting, tone, characters, sound design, soundtrack, cinematography, to the visual effects, surpasses my ability to articulate how amazing it was, especially when watching it in IMAX.

What truly blows my mind is its modest budget of 15 million dollars. It efficiently utilizes every dollar, or technically, yen, so well that I find it challenging to return to most Western entertainment without noticing flaws. It genuinely brings joy to identify myself as a Godzilla fan."""
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Humane horror for humans made by humans. Human equals additional suffering.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A wonderful take on the classic.  Godzilla more ruthless and utterly terrifying in some scenes.  Just a touch of the corny we are accustomed to from older Zilla movies.  Definitely hit the emotions for some as well and ended like any other Godzilla movie should have.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies ever made, the visuals are spectacular.  Probably the best human cast in a Godzilla movie to date. It's a story of redemption, a man who fled his destiny of being a kamikaze, who was nearly driven mad by the shame, a shifting of the times.  Are there cheesy moments absolutely it's a Godzilla movie, but it's one hell of a ride all hail Godzilla minus one"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Its is an amazing monster movie
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely an amazing film from start to finish and frankly serves as a means to take Godzilla back to its roots ultimately the movie benefits from a great sense of pacing and character which all culminate together to create a excellent film in Godzilla Minus One
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla minus one was cinema perfection in every way. It told a compelling human story about disgrace, honor and redemption. Godzilla in its 70 years of destruction has never been this terrifying. Pitting a staggered country again an overwhelming force. Showing a country's will to change. Godzilla symbolizes japans atonement for their sins in WW2 at the same time he mirrors japans war culture pre War. This movie deserves all the accolades coming to it. And if America does not award it in some way Hollywood is surly tone def - Tony"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a Godzilla fan, so all comments should be taken with that in mind.  This movie met my every expectation.  The characters are engaging, the story is clear, and the threat of the monster feels believable. There is a touch of melodrama, but given the setting and the events it would understandable that emotions run high.  The characters delve a little into simplification and trope, but this is a movie about a giant lizard, so accuracy should be tempered.  There is an elaborate plan to destroy the monster that is in keeping with Godzilla history, but nothing that is ""hokey"".  The acting is a little old fashioned, but feels true to the historical setting.  The visuals are wonderful.  It is clear that they are NOT billion dollar, but they are very good, and in some ways had a better gut feeling.  There may have been some practical model work, or a concerted effort to reach that look (depth of field?) as an homage.  There are few clear homages to the original Godzilla and some other movies, but nothing distracting.  There are few scenes of Big G in action that were quite brutal in his effect on a recovering Japanese population.  His smaller size in comparison to recent movies works better for this movie. There is some interesting point-of-view camera work that went a long way to giving you the feeling of experiencing it firsthand. The fact that it is subtitles only occurred to me the next day, so clearly that did not distract. I do prefer this over dubbing. 
Overall a great effort by all involved. I highly recommend for the casual or diehard fan.  You will not be disappointed.  Some one who has no experience with Godzilla (do such people exist?) may come away wondering what all the fuss is about."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla: Minus One will go down in history for be one of the greatest, if not the greatest Godzilla movie of all time."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Even better than Shin Godzilla! And Shin Godzilla was pretty good
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie! EFX are superb, best looking Godzilla ever. Brings the monster back to his roots, soundtrack, and all. Really nice story that accompanies the monster carnage. See it on the best-sounding theatre you can."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything about this movie was perfect! The music, the cinematography, and especially the effects! The only criticism I would have would be the overly intense reactions of the characters at points, but that's minor compared to the expertly crafted character arcs and strong messages. 10/10 for me!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen. I put the creature design up there on the level with some of my favorites such as the Xenomorph from the Alien franchise, the Predator, and John Carpenter’s the Thing. This is definitely one for IMAX. "
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A terrific film that takes Godzilla seriously—-and so will you.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent film. Great story and I cared for the human characters. Godzilla's design mostly loved and great call back to the original films. Some CGI shotty at times.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,My brother and I loved it . First time we liked every single person in the movie and that a movie made you care about the story and characters
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw this in IMAX at the early screening fan event and it did not disappoint. A+ visuals, A+ soundtrack, A+ message. This is a movie about the people of a country coming together at its lowest point, in a time when the government doesn’t have the public interest in mind. They nailed the human story and you really feel for the characters as you watch them. Only thing keeping it short of five stars is not enough of the Big G himself. I am definitely going to see it again in theaters."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One exceeded all expectations, delivering a truly phenomenal cinematic experience that is absolutely brilliant!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought Godzilla Minus One was an incredible film! It had great action, suspense, and even heart. Godzilla's destructive and chaotic nature was a perfect foil to the Japanese people's resilience and determination to survive. The final battle was truly a sight to behold, and I enjoyed the touching message of hope and compassion that the film emphasized throughout. Overall, it's one of my new favorite films to watch and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Monster movies."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is back. The true Godzilla at least. Yes, we may have had some fun with the legendary Godzilla, but, Toho just gets Godzilla. A force of nature that can't be bargained with or contained. He is disaster incarnate. The movie paces itself in such a perfect way and will leave you holding your breath for the next scene. The acting and dialogue is impeccable. This movie truly encapsulates the unrelenting spirit of man and the absolute terror of a walking bomb. I will also mention Godzilla's atomic breath and design surpassed those of any Godzilla iteration (in this humble fan's opinion). An instant classic to introduce this terror to a new generation."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I got early access tickets in America to see it in IMAX on 11/29. It is truly a masterpiece. It has the perfect balance of emotions and action between the character growth and fight scenes. It is everything a Godzilla fan could dream of. It supersedes every film dating back to the original.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good I love Godzilla live in a Japanese film 😊👍🏻
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding movie, all any Godzilla's fan want, it's a new air fresh for the franchise, this movie it's a reminder of 1954 movie, you can feel the fear of the Japanese people, in future a classic indeed"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was good it was everything i wanted in a godzilla movie.This is the perfect godzilla movie.In almost every other godzilla movies i never cared about the humans i would root for godzilla to kill them since they were boring and uninteresting,this movie actually made root for the humans and hope godzilla goes away because i cared about them.the charachters were writen and acted well,i was never bored when godzilla wasnt on screen.Now about godzilla he is perfect.Making him smaller was such a good idea it makes the deaths more personal because he can actually recognize the humans and he isnt killing them on accident he actually wants to kill them.CGI i have no right to say it was bad its just insane what they could doo with a really small budget.This movie is a 10/10."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,For the first time I actually cared about characters in a Godzilla movie. The pacing is wonderful and Godzilla's screen time is wonderfully spaced out. (I guarantee you won't notice how frequent or infrequently he appears until you go back and skip through every scene he's not in)
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The film is incredible. Best solo godzilla film to date as Godzilla being the antagonist. It's has everything you want in a godzilla film and the human aspect of the story has all of the heart. Absolutely must see cinema.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,absolute masterpiece of a film. this is a high quality movie that also happens to be a Godzilla film. chef's kiss from Toho.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the true definition of a Godzilla movie. The story is beautifully told, weaving through both the lives of the people of Japan post-WWII and the disaster that is Godzilla's destruction. As someone who struggles with self-valuation, the characters in this movie I was both able to empathize with, and become inspired by, their struggles."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a masterpiece! The best Godzilla ive seen in theaters. The immersive sound and scope and scale of the visuals pulls you in to the dread of that world. Godzilla is mean, menacing and aggressive! Total chaos and destruction! And you actually care about the humans!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,been waiting for a new Godzilla movie from Toho for abit now and this movie delivers! it was really good! Can't wait to see what they do or think of next!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"As big time kaiju films go, this one is way up on the list. It borders on fine cinema at parts (I found myself forgetting it was a Godzilla flick). I've seen all 33 original Japanese releases and I can honestly say, this one right in there with the original Godzilla (1954) and Shin Godzilla. The difference is the story. These are characters that are believable and you will care about what happens to them. A few cheesy moments aside, this is one that deserves a Fresh Rating."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best Godzilla movies ever made.  A masterpiece.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The perfect Godzilla movie and great for people not familiar with Godzilla. 

It is a reboot of Godzilla that takes place right after World War 2. An amazing retelling of the classic nuclear monster vs the people story.

Amazing visuals and emotionally engaging story. 

Watch it as a double feature following Oppenheimer and you are set :)"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,great story! he's a monster! just beautiful! imax was incredible and so was 4dx!!! must watch!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into this expecting some stupid fun. What I got was a deep heartfelt movie about survivors guilt. The characters are fleshed out really well. This led me actually caring about people running from Godzilla for the first time. It is easily one of the 3 best Godzilla films ever made. It fits right in with the original Gojira, and Shin Godzilla. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good Kaiju movie but also wants characters to have depth."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only one of the best series of action sequences in a Godzilla or monster film but Minus One has probably the best human story to go along with it, at least that I've ever seen in a monster film. I hope to see American monster filmmakers take notes… tight action sequences, specific and meaningful human story, and consistent vision. 

The American films surrounding monsters seem too preoccupied with cramming in as much as possible to their sets, characters, action scenes, etc. sometimes less is much, much more. 

5 out of 5 atomic breaths"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. Where do I even begin? Godzilla Minus One is an absolute masterpiece. I cant believe how good it is. It's a magnificent drama wrapped in Godzilla clothes. You could honestly take Godzilla out and it would be a fantastic drama by itself. But Godzilla takes it over the top into one of the best movies of the year. It's scary, emotional, triumphant, hopeful, and a thrill to watch. Will be watching again soon. 10/10"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thrilling monster movie, amazing special effects, and heartfelt human melodrama. Minus One is the whole package and the movie Godzilla fans have been hoping for for decades."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely astonishing for me! For two whole hours you are sucked into this eerie atmosphere as if you were actually there holding your breath in fear and anticipation. This movie had me on my seats edge I couldn't get enough I stayed absolutely quiet as godzilla thunderous roar enveloped the theater I could swear you could hear it from outside. This movie is an absolute must see that keeps you wanting more and for me I'm going back for more Thank you Takashi Yamazaki for giving us this amazing gift of a film I loved every second of it.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best Godzilla movie! Bravo toho!!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great writing the characters was ok but godzllia was js so good they actually made me feel the connection to 1954s godzilla really recommend it
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"まさかゴジラに泣かされるとは

正直舐めてた、でも結果は違ったよ。
とても良い映画だ、是非とも友人に勧めたい"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never write reviews but this movie is completely different than most Godzilla movies, I was fine(understatement) watching the performance of the humans and what they offered! Godzilla is Godzilla and was awesome. I was only let down by the budget but was still great film to look at, if you know you know. Japanese movies can be more misses than hits in my opinion, but this one is a hit and worth it at the movies"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, character development was great, Godzilla was terrifying. must see"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was magnificent. Godzilla has never been scarier or more vicious. The human story was sad and heartfelt. I can't wait to see it again.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely incredible movie! Went expecting a popcorn monster flick - but it's so, so much more. It's a movie about the trauma of military defeat, the destruction of cities, PTSD and survivor's guilt. The cast really bring the characters to life and make you root for them. Action is great but isn't what you take away. Today's pandering Hollywood couldn't make this movie on its best day. Go see it and support this film."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Great Great movie I wish it was showing in XD more I plan on seeing it a few more times and buying it on 4k when it comes out
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good I saw it twice last night. Combining genres has become one of my favorite movie experiences of late. This is a well conceived, well told romantic-action-Godzilla film. I cared about every character throughout. What a Christmas present for movie goers."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story was amazing. Some of the graphics weren't the best during water scenes, but overall this film is awesome. Action, drama,.and horror all rolled together in a beautiful package."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Toho returns Godzilla to its atomic roots with a story line that PREDATES the original 1954 film. The human drama reminded me of some of the early Akira Kirosawa films, and the monster footage delivers in spades. I am one of those long-time fans who still feels Shin Godzilla is one of the series best. This film is at least as good as that one, and at times perhaps better. MINUS ONE manages to bring the character back to its original storyline, but still manages to feel refreshing and even frightening at times. I think the people behind most of the original series (especially Ishiro Honda) would be proud of this film if they were still with us. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"As lifelong fan of Godzilla, I already had high expectations for Godzilla Minus One. Let me tell you, this movie did not disappoint. I'm certainly not one to love a Godzilla movie just because of franchise loyalty. I'm not afraid to criticize a Godzilla movie, however, I don't think I have any criticisms of this film. 

If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be ‘Refreshing'. The down-to-earth plot, the genuine fear this movie provoked, the new aspects of Godzilla explored, even the enticing human elements this movie brought with it, Godzilla Minus one was such a refreshing film for the nearly 70 year old running franchise.

With over 30 films under its belt, one might question if there's anything novel a new installment could bring. 'Godzilla Minus One' confidently answers that question with a resounding 'yes.' Godzilla Minus One was a story worth telling and they executed it flawlessly."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is just great. It has a human story as well as tons of destruction! I rewatched Kong vs Godzilla the other day to compare them. Next to Godzilla Minus 1 it's not even a popcorn flick, just a lame story interrupted by, I admit, cool cgi effects. 

Don't get put off by subtitles and japanese language, if you do, you will miss a truly great (monster) movie."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite Godzilla movie, a very grounded (as much as a giant kaiju movie can be) and emotional story that is easy to connect with"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! I would rank this as one of my top five favorite films of 2023! I was lucky enough to catch a fan event, pre-screening. 

Just from watching the previews, I had a feeling that it was going to be well-worth watching in a theater because of its production quality. What I did not expect was that it was going to be a high-stakes drama. This movie is gripping, heart-wrenching, quite frightening, and more suspenseful than anything I expected. If I tried to compare it to another movie it would have to be watching the original Jaws for the first time. (There is one scene in particular when Godzilla is pursuing our hero who is in his worn-out tub of a minesweeper.) But this was even better than that!

The director does an excellent job of sucking you into the horror and sadness of post-war Japan. It only took a few minutes for me to become heavily invested in the hero, and then each of the side characters: his found-family and friends. The director also gives you the origin of Godzilla, and you can actually sense the difference in energy between his original and final form. Godzilla is furious, vicious, violent and horrific. The violence in the film does not feel gratuitous - you are going to experience the shock and horror of the victims (the airplane mechanics, the people in Ginza, the unfortunates on the various ships, and the PTSD the hero has from his encounters with Godzilla). Unlike the Godzilla movies from the 60's on, you aren't going to be able to savor the mayhem quite so much, unless you lack human empathy.

If you are going just to see Godzilla, you won't be disappointed though. Wow. He is monstrous. The graphics of him destroying Ginza are incredible, but it is when he is at sea that I found him to be the most frightening. On land, it seems like there is a chance to get away from him. At sea, it is a different story entirely. 

And finally. There is a more realistic quality to this movie than the vast majority of monster movies. In particular, I liked how the plan they come up with to battle Godzilla. It felt thoughtful and possible.

Great Fun! Don't pass up the chance to watch it in the theater!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a fan who has seen every Godzilla movie, Godzilla Minus One takes everything great in the past entry’s and expands upon it. The movie definitely deserves a 100% rating. "
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A nostalgic remake of the original which mixes loss and tragedy with the hope in post-war Japan.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla film to date. Perfect blend of monster meets man. The human side of the movie was a gut punch that you couldn't look away from, nor wanted to look away from. The characters were well written and real. No one felt safe from the destruction, and the relationships between characters tugged heartstrings. Let's not forget the biggest part of the movie, Godzilla. By far the most terrifying and stunning version of the monster to date. The special effects and look of this were fanominal. When first seeing the big G in action for the first time I could only stare slackjawed. This movie made me feel all the emotions and showed no mercy. A real love letter to fans and to film making. Too, thank you so much for this."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla: A Captivating Enigma of Destruction with a Stellar Score

Godzilla, the iconic king of the monsters, has captivated audiences for decades with its awe-inspiring size and destructive power. While many fans adore the creature as a symbol of nature's untamed might, others view it as a mindless force of destruction devoid of any redeeming qualities. This film, however, manages to strike a delicate balance between these opposing perspectives, revealing the creature's enigmatic nature while also highlighting the plight of the human characters caught in its path.

From the outset, the film establishes Godzilla as an unpredictable force of nature, its actions driven by primal instincts rather than any discernible logic. Its destruction is not motivated by malice, but by a desperate need for survival and a yearning for connection. This enigmatic nature is precisely what makes Godzilla so captivating, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats and wondering what it will do next.

At the same time, the film does not neglect the human element, portraying the characters as complex individuals struggling to survive in the face of unspeakable devastation. Their desperation to avoid Godzilla's wrath and their resilience in the face of overwhelming odds underscore the creature's immense power and the profound fear it inspires.

The film's masterstroke lies in its ability to balance these two perspectives, allowing audiences to appreciate Godzilla's enigmatic nature while also empathizing with the plight of the human characters. This delicate balance elevates the film from mere monster-bashing spectacle to a profound exploration of the delicate balance between destruction and compassion.

Furthermore, the film's score deserves special mention. The music is both epic and emotional, perfectly capturing the film's themes of destruction and resilience. The score is one of the best I've heard in any film this year, and it greatly enhances the overall viewing experience.

In conclusion, Godzilla is a captivating film that succeeds in capturing both the allure of the enigmatic beast and the struggles of the human characters caught in its path. Its ability to balance these two perspectives, coupled with its stellar score, makes it a must-see for fans of the genre and newcomers alike.

Rating: 5 out of 5 stars"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very reminiscent of the first movies.  Absolutely fabulous.  If you're a slow reader like me, don't shy away because of the subtitles.  Dialogue was not long speak or fast so easy to read and enjoy movie.  This is one we will be seeing again in the theater.  That is a first for me to see a movie twice."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a Godzilla fan, since I was the age of 5 or 6, I can tell you that this movie definitely is one or if not the best Godzilla movie since the Original 1954 Godzilla. The story plot of this movie is what makes a perfect Godzilla movie. It's a story about defeat, loss, despair, and hope. When I watch Godzilla movies, the human characters can be either a hit or a miss. I will say these characters are quite on pair with the Original 54 movie and that's a huge achievement with this movie. When Godzilla shows up and see the destruction he leaves, it was just perfect and it really shows the embodiment of what Godzilla really is. The music was perfect with all the moments and the graphics is superb. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 5 if I had to. This is a perfect movie for both G Fans and Non-G Fans. Please go and watch this movie!!!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,An homage to the original classic. Slight changes from original but they add more complexity to the overall symbolism and narrative that is the Godzilla universe. Well done.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"In a world full of movies like The Marvels, and The Flash, Japan comes out and absolutely demolishes American cinema by giving us the most enticing movie that in some ways, surpasses the original Gojira, Ishrio Honda would be absolutely proud."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"You don't have to be a fan of Godzilla to enjoy this movie. It has a solid storyline, minus the glitz and corny one-liners that you'd find in a Hollywood production."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely stunning! The entire movie was a spectacular masterpiece! The story and humans were wonderfully written while Godzilla himself was terrifying but also so damn cool! 10/10
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,My family and I saw an early showing last night. It was fantastic! Godzilla was the scariest in any movie I've ever seen and the Japanese theme and subtitles was the most authentic as well.  The acting was a little bad but that also makes it more authentic to the original Godzilla movies. Absolutely loved i!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been watching Godzilla for 50 years. It's a coin toss as to whether this film or Godzilla (54) is the best. For a modern audience I'd have to give the nod to Godzilla -1
This is a much different experience than the current Legendary series. Plenty of call backs for longtime fans while at the same time this should be a great film for general audiences. I think Honda,Tanaka and Tusburaya would give Godzilla -1 a big thumbs-up."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie - It is a great origin story and hopefully a great reboot for more Godzilla movies from Toho.  A perfect 70th anniversary piece.  I was totally invested in all of the characters and loved the ending.

I need more of this!  Hollywood can learn a thing or two about how to make a movie."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great new twist on the original, with great focus on the characters and how WWII affected them."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Loved the incorporation of the original music score.  Even use of the original Godzilla roar.  The story pulls you in.  You actually care about the characters having to deal with not only Godzilla, but trying to recover after WWII.  I hope they let the director continue on with his vision.  The ending definitely sets up for a continuation.  Went to two early access screenings on Wednesday.  Plan to see it again in IMAX.  Sadly, no Dolby Atmos theater around me that is playing it."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,All Hail and Bravo to this Monumental and Spectacular Epic of a Movie…
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely beautiful. An amazing score, beautiful vfx and amazing characters that you care about, with motivations and flaws. 10/10"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've been dedicated fan of Gojira for all of my 21 years of being on this planet, I have seen all the highs and lows this series has to offer, from its campy moments, to the beautiful scores, haunting moments, and awesome action. So when I put in perspective how genuinely refreshing this movie was for an long time fan to see both the monster, its meaning in nuclear symbolism,  and its human characters all being both grounded in a gritty yet emotional focus, and still remember its a godzilla movie at its core. The king of the monsters has truly come back with a vengeance and I implore anyone, fan, critic, or average movie goer, give Minus One your time, this film is a master class and a frightening amazing experience. LONG LIVE THE KING!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Capturing the terror that Godzilla still hold is step one. Giving you a fantastic group of humans that you WANT to win, step two. Heat Ray, three. What a fantastic film to keep 70 years going strong."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely incredible. Nice feeling a sense of dread seeing him in action.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"third time seeing it and it just gets better, pays so much homage to the original 1954 movie as well as some others. second best if not the best Godzilla movie"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty much the perfect Godzilla movie - the monster action and destruction is amazing, but the human story is also really compelling and touching."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Almost everything I’ve wanted to see in a Godzilla film since I was a child!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is a destructive force of nature that crushes everything and everyone in its path, without cause, without reason, without regard. The combination of Akira Ifukube's powerful music and Naoki Sato's terrifying strings makes you shiver with pleasure when it's time to stomp and annihilate. Godzilla Minus One manages to constantly catapult you into a perpetual feeling of helplessness in the face of the inevitable. Godzilla Minus One is the best movie since the 1954 Godzilla."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The best use of humans in the entire franchise and probably the coolest versuon of Godzilla yet.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"definitely a great godzilla movie that needs to be seen on the big screen, the human characters were actual likeable and godzilla was a threat that was felt"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was emphatically the greatest Godzilla movie ever made. Such beautiful and compelling story telling. Beautiful cinematography. Relatable and empathetic characters. Amazing special effects. And most of all, the most terrifying and gruesome and believable rendition of Godzilla ever portrayed on the big screen. This whole film I could find no flaw."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The Godzilla movie I’ve been waiting 20 years for!!   Go see it in an IMAX theatre. It’s  more visceral watching Godzilla in action. Absolutely loved it!  Going again!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One WAS PERFECTION! Blending classic Godzilla with Modern action and visuals to create something so memorable, emotional, and haunting! Godzilla is a force more than ever and the story couldn't have been more touching. This took my breath away!

For starters the humans are some of, if not, THE BEST IN ANY GODZILLA FILM!! The story and journey these characters go through feel earned and by the end of the film, you feel and care for each and everyone of them!

Godzilla was an absolute FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH! His atomic breath might actually be my new favorite of the franchise. The ocean scene kept me frozen! He was haunting, extremely powerful, and looked phenomenal. Which leads me to talking about the effects, leaving the theater… all I could think about was the saddest part of watching that film was knowing that it probably won't get the recognition it deserves come award season, ESPECIALLY FOR ITS EFFECTS! The CGI/visual effect were all polished. NOT ONCE did it dip in quality!

The score for this film was beyond beautiful, touching at times. I got emotional just by music queues multiple times during the film. At times it was bone chilling, hype, and gut wrenching. Other times, seat clenching and even had elements/full tracks from the original!

It was emotional, action packed, had a beautiful story, gorgeous visuals, and brisk pacing that never dragged. Godzilla is the monster we all hoped for with humans that felt TANGIBLE. This is one for the ages and I mean that with ZERO HESITATION, actually… MINUS ONE!

I highly recommend seeing this in theaters as soon as possible but PLEASE MAKE SURE ITS ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN YOU CAN FIND!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this movie in Japan and again in the United States in iMax. This movie is a different type of Godzilla movie than the Legendary movies or the previous Japanese Godzilla movies. This film is much darker and more serious in tone. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen come out of Japan. This iteration of Godzilla is no hero, he's far more primal in nature as well. The main characters, which is a place Godzilla films are usually lackluster, were characters you could get more emotionally attached to than in prior films. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at, when I saw this movie in Japan, I didn't expect to experience a theater of people emotionally drained and many crying."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great blend of the more modernized Godzilla, while still giving the movie heart. And everything we love about the orginal."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily a top Godzilla movie. Great mix of action and character moments in a post WW2 Japan. Nice visuals, acting and sound. Godzilla here is a force of nature and does not disappoint."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I managed to get tickets for an early access fan screening yesterday, and as a life long Godzilla fan, I can say with EASE that this is in the top 5 Godzilla films ever made. 

A common complain amongst Godzilla fans, and critics in general is that the human characters are often forgettable and cause the film to drag. This movie is the exact opposite. I cared and was invested in nearly every human story introduced . 

Godzilla was the destructive force of nature we've come to expect, and setting it in the backdrop of a real world 1940's where technology is the most limited we've ever seen in a Godzilla film made for one of the most ""edge of your seat"" Godzilla vs. Humans battles of all time. Do NOT miss this movie. Second best film of the year after Oppenheimer. Who, ironically enough, probably caused Godzilla to wake up..."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was AMAZING!!!! Definitely seeing this one again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever and the BEST movie of 2023 nuff said
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla at its finest. The 8 year old me was smiling ear to ear the entire time.
"Nov 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,GodzillaMinusOne  was good! The story and action were good! Some of the acting was a bit over the top but overall it is one of the best Godzilla movies I have seen. If you are a fan of Godzilla then go see it! Without spoiling it is  about redemption and the fight to live.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Truly a modern-day masterpiece in film-making and storytelling. Not only were they able to capture the compelling character development of the original 1954 film, but they brought Godzilla back to his horrific roots and made the titular monster scary again. 10/10 well done!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,If you are a Godzilla fan you need to watch this movie
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a fantastic movie that just so happens to have my favorite big boy causing havoc and destroying cities. Might be my favorite in the series. I loved almost everything about it
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The sound design, writing, and visual were amazing"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was definitely an amazing movie watch in IMAX!! The sound design, characters, music, story and Godzilla itself all made this movie beautiful, beautifully terrifying.

"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went to an early fan event viewing. Not ""fun"" because it emulates the serious tone of the original but a thoroughly engaging experience. Also it looks amazing and has great acting and interesting human characters that I was actually rooting for. Made on a 10th of a Hollywood budget and put most modern movies to shame. A refreshing breath of fresh air to know someone still remembers how to make a genre movie."

"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This may be the greatest Godzilla movie. Take the themes and tone of the original and give it a modern budget with new technology
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the best Godzilla movie to enter the franchise. It finally creates characters that you can feel for and cheer for to survive. It also showcases the best form of Godzilla that we have seen on the big screen. The soundtrack is phenomenal the cinematography is phenomenal everything about this movie is just phenomenal
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,There is no Godzilla movie better than this
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus one is a masterpiece that has a big impact!

"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Story and Destruction Scenes
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great addition to the Godzilla film series, and one thats beautifully crafted."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heart pounding, emotional, perfect! Godzilla is a terrifying force of nature in this and the humans have a sad but beautifully thought out story about the losses and emotions of post world war! No one should have an issue with this new addition to the franchise!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow EPIC!!! great soundtrack excellent acting emotional rollercoaster will be seeing again soon
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie in years
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute cinema. If you’re a fan of classic Toho Godzilla you WILL have an amazing time, and even if you’re a newcomer you’re probably going to love it as well. Brilliantly written, directed and acted, with a perfect level of monster action and destruction. Can’t find a fault"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline! Great effects!!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has an incredible human cast that just works with this movie. Very human element feeling desperate and hopeless in a disastrous situation. Definitely one of the top Godzilla movies in the whole series.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is the first Godzilla movie in 70 years (aside from maybe Shin) to capture the horror and poignancy of the ‘54 original.
9/10"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Completely epic with a wonderfully emotional payoff. One of those movies where you want to jump out of your seat and pump your fist. Be sure to catch it on the biggest screen
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first Kaiju movie  i feel, i cried and laughed. Feels are all over, but the human story is wow.  The ending had me in tears like a kud, the best movie this year for sure.  Raw and honest. This is war movie with kaiju as metaphor. Wow."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie in the Godzilla series. Well composed of both actions and human-drama. In this movie, Godzilla actually look as you and recognize you as it’s prey."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow… I've seen many Godzilla films and this one is probably my all-time favorite.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Hands down best Godzilla movie!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie and I’ve seen them all! If you enjoy ‘54 this will be fantastic! The Ifukube theme still slaps!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has the best story of any Godzilla movie. I know for a Godzilla movie that's not saying much, but the movie could hold its own with high quality hollywood films. I thought the human story was very good and well acted. If you prefer Godzilla fighting other monsters and don't care for the human story, then this movie is probably not for you. The CGI isn't as good as a high budget hollywood movie, but it's definitely the best of the japanese films. Overall, I think this is the best godzilla film and I've seen them all."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla in a long time closest thing to 54 OG! Must see for Godzilla fans.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Movie Godzilla has ever been in. Not quite sure if it's the best Godzilla movie tho. He's the most devastating with doing some of the least amount of devastation on land other than his atomic breath.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best Godzilla movie ever produced
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Godzilla movie ever, and a great movie and story that stands on its own. Sometimes it doesn't feel like you're watching a monster movie. This movie achieves what Hollywood has failed to do with many sci fi or monster movies...good character development and compelling stories.

It also does a good job of preserving the roots of the original 1950's Godzilla film, complete with the music and also the setting of postwar Japan. Even has a small hint of the cheesiness of the original franchise at times but it's not over the top.

Best movie we've seen this year in the theaters"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely surpassing any previous Godzilla movies. With a captivating story and a grand scale immersive outlook of a newly design for Godzilla.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Destruction, chaos and mayhem were all spot on. Soundtrack was phenomenal and gave the old school vibes when something bad was going to happen/happened."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING! It reminds you of the fear and the power of what Godzilla is!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Toho still makes the best Godzilla movies
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! 
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"After seeing it early for the fan event, Godzilla Minus One is everything a godzilla movie should be and so much more, everything about this movie from the characters, music, emotion, tension, dread, and especially Godzilla himself are top notch, this is a must watch and likely the best entry into the godzilla series, well deserving of the Kings 70th anniversary!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One SPOILER Review

10/-1

At this time I cannot decide if I like minus one better or my old favorite Godzilla against mechagodzilla. First things first, this is by far the best version of Godzilla. I knew as soon as Takashi Yamazaki was making it, the design was going to be amazing just by his Godzilla in its always sunny on third Street. What I didn't expect was everything else. This Godzilla movie is 100% a horror movie. The beginning scene with Godzilla as a more dinosaur like creature was amazing. That's the kind of Godzillasaurus I wanted to see. His atomic breath is awesome. The spikes coming out and going in was fine. I didn't like it any more or any worse that the normal glowing spikes, but the atomic breath itself is beautiful. With Godzilla being the metaphor for the bombing of Japan, his atomic breath actually creating a nuke like explosion was a perfect touch I didn't realize Godzilla needed. And his death at the end was the second best Godzilla death in my opinion. Nothing can beat heisei melting down. Now the actual plot. Unlike most Godzilla films, this movie has one of the best character driven story's. It's stars a Kamikaze pilot who pretended that his plain was broken to skip out on dying. The twist and turns his story had were so compelling, I almost forgot about Godzilla. His later to be wife's death I saw coming, but it later being revealed to fake, with her actually surviving was the biggest twist in this movie. There where many small nods to older Godzilla films that will excite long time fans, but that's not at all what makes this movie good. While I had a heavily bias opinion on the movie, my friend who has only seen shin Godzilla also thought this movie was fantastic. And, of course, every scene with the Godzilla theme is amazing."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A 100% is the lowest score I will accept for this movie.
"Nov 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Overall I think this has a better plot than the Godzilla movies that the MonsterVerse has. I really connected with the characters and like how it was mostly from one persons point of view. I have two main issues with it with one being that the pace should’ve been a little faster and just felt too slow for me. Don’t get me wrong I liked how we got to know the human characters but the pace still could’ve been improved on. My second issue is that there’s hardly any Godzilla. What’s the point of this being a Godzilla movie if theres hardly  any Godzilla?
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Freaking amazing. Most interested human story ever in a Godzilla movie.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far the best overall Godzilla movie since the Japanese original. Godzilla is absolutely horrifying in this film. This is the most devastating portrayal of his atomic breath ever. The human story is usually a weakness in these films but here it is a solid, endearing story."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterclass from beginning to end that serves almost as a pseudo remake of the original while updating it for modern audiences.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Toho has taken Godzilla back to the basics with a compelling and delectably   destructive story. With great character arcs that make every character feel like they belong. A dire situation that keeps you hoping the heroes win. And a monster you just can't wait to see on the screen again and again as it makes a thunderous and profound mark on the film. Modern blockbusters should take note. This is how you make a movie worth seeing in the theaters.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely Epic. Like the Japanese original, only 1000000x better in every way. The 2nd best Godzilla creature ever. Sorry, the new US Godzilla is Bonkers awesome. But.... So is this one. What a time to be a KOTM fan. 1000 Stars"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the best Godzilla movie you probably will ever watch. I've seen almost every Godzilla movie I like or love almost every one of them but none of them compare to this movie. It's strong character movie. It's like old Godzilla meets new Godzilla. It takes place back in World War II times, but you have the special effects of modern day so you get the best of both worlds of Godzilla …you should see this I saw it in IMAX … I hope you get the chance to also ."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It has been years since I saw a movie this intense and amazing. A must watch.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure it deserves to be 100% but it was entertaining, great special effects, fantastic acting from the principal actors and actually did something Oppenheimer failed to do: show the devastation and aftermath of the h bomb dropped on Japan. I enjoyed the secondary storyline immensely. And even if you don't take any of that into consideration, Godzilla eats a freakin train! In my opinion that trumps everything."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down best Godzilla movie since the original, and frankly the best movie of the year.  I was in awe of the imagery, and Godzilla was truly a spectacle.  Gritty and emotional, every scene with Godzilla felt ironically personal. The human story was heartbreaking and also endearing.  As a life long fan, I am grateful for the respect shown for this iconic monster.  Visually so impressive with a raw human element that finally really works not seen since the first film.  Dare I say it might even get a few awards or noms."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"There was a great deal of character development in the movie. A country still recovering from WWll, the spirit of the movie was about recovery and wrestling with fear. When faced with destruction once again by the ravages of Godzilla, the people draw close to take on an impossible task. There was a great deal of tension between the two main characters, and you expect a romance to bud. But due to personal battles concerning the war, the romance is not fully realized. Really heartbreaking at one point. But not giving anything away, the movie does not leave you disappointed as they battle Godzilla and deal with the demons of the past. I would say this was more of a drama than a old fashioned Godzilla movie."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, with exceptional character development and moving story. There were no cheesy bits and was an overall excellent monster movie that happened to have great story telling with good acting. A movie that showed the horros of war and promulgated a succinct commentary on government shortfalls and the perils of nuclear war. My favorite Godzilla movie by far, and a must watch even for non G fans."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was astonishingly surprising. And both as a critic and a Godzilla fan, it was well kept with a very intriguing human story and very well balanced Monster scenery and interaction. This movie defines what Godzilla truly is and what a Godzilla movie in the future or past could and/or should be. A very fantastic movie"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film yet! Amazing twist on the original story. It was deep dealing with WW2 and the atrocities of nuclear war and the aftermath of destruction.  https://youtu.be/MUE8iJTXK6Q?si=bk1MW8NRtal6qQZi
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a must see
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just finished seeing it and I loved it, it was honestly very good and Godzilla was ruthless and that was needed. I miss the evil Godzilla and this delivered, it almost got me tearing up at some parts.







Spoiler: the way they almost killed Godzilla with a inflatable was kinda funny"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Godzilla has some real attitude in this one. It's almost the complete opposite of shin godzilla and yet still manages to be on par with it. Solid 10/10 that I want to spoil so bad but won't. Definetly a must see and will be added to my collection once it's available.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, not just for a godzilla movie but, in general, an amazing movie"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Instant Classic!!! A Masterpiece!!! The Performances were Exceptional. Even if you are a Die-Hard Godzilla fan, you find yourself rooting for the supporting cast. This Godzilla is Truly Menacing!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Words cannot explain how incredible and amazing this movie truly was. It had characters you cared for and a sad heartfelt story that keeps you satisfied while Godzilla is off screen. When he is on screen however is when this film reaches another level. The greatest movie I've seen this year thus far! 10/10!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just returned from an Imax Screening, really good cinematography in this one, not as much action as Shin Godzilla/Monsterverse movies, but Godzilla's attack on Tokyo is very intense, and the human portion of the story is arguably the best Ive seen in any Godzilla film. Its a very good sorta remake of Gojira."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely incredible. Not just a good Godzilla movie, but a good movie in general. Fantastic acting, gorgeous cinematography, and an emotional story. What about the big guy? He was downright terrifying. Ferocious, and truly felt like a force of nature. From his first scene, to the last Godzilla delivered on the spectacle one would expect. Absolutely brilliant."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action and storytelling, this Godzilla movie actually has a very well thought out storyline and makes the characters very interesting and likable. There is also just enough character screen time and Godzilla screen time and pacing was great. This movie is a must watch even if your not a big Godzilla fan and i feel could be close to movie of the year, go see it now!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was astonishingly surprising. It was well kept with a very intriguing human story with very well balanced Monster scenery and interaction. This movie defines what Godzilla truly is and what a Godzilla movie in the future or past could and/or should be. A very fantastic movie!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I love it. This was my first Godzilla movie but I was bawling my eyes out with some scenes and felt so many emotions that not many movie do. 10/10 would and will see it again
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie were awesome for the first time in a long time I enjoyed the human element in a Godzilla movie. Love clever, way they did the Easter eggs. And the most important thing, my youngest son 9 year old enjoyed it and he wants to watch it again this weekend."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Must watch in imax to experience the full dread you will feel coursing through your body as Godzilla is on screen.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla film in forever. It truly does the original justice.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Looked great on the big screen!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is a cinematic masterpiece. It's seriously written like an Oscar nomination film in terms of characterization of the cast. I'm shocked to say this film did the impossible, it's either on the same tier as Gojira (1954) or surpasses it. Sound design was remarkable too. The director did a tremendous job giving us shots and sequences we've never seen before with Godzilla. Easily a 10/10"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the greatest Godzilla movie of the modern era. 

No shade thrown at the Legendary pictures, they're a completely different monster, pun partially intended, but this Godzilla proves that you don't need to keep making the kaiju bigger for them to be terrifying. From his first appearance early in the film to the heart-pounding climax, this Godzilla is closer to the humans he terrorizes than any since the original 1954 classic. The difference in scale creates a completely different kind of dread - something in between a colossal apex predator and a force of nature.

The people in this film, for maybe the first time in the history of Godzilla movies, steal the show. Godzilla is the backdrop against which post-WWII Japan struggles with the horrors and guilt inherent in survival of mass destruction and whether or not those who came home from war ever truly stopped fighting it. Koichi Shikishima and his found family challenge the audience to do more than simply keep surviving.

I have seen many different iterations of Godzilla over the decades. Minus One is the most successful version since the original King of the Monsters to tell the story of nuclear horror and how humankind has to be willing to do more than fight to the death; they need to find the strength to live."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just arrived home after watching the early screening. Brilliant on every level - human, monster, metaphoric, every level.  You care about the main characters, their emotional trauma, and their motivations. This is an angry Godzilla and it works because Godzilla is a metaphor for the cruelty and senselessness of war."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla best sound
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A once in a generation film. Absolutely incredible. One of the greatest monster films of all time.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"If Oppenheimer didn’t release this year, Godzilla Minus One would be the film of the year. This I can say is absolutely better than a masterful film like Dunkirk. This is true Cinema!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,First Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen and definitely one of the best movies I’ve seen. Everyone clapped at the end and I heard people talking about how good it was on the way out/ 100% on rotten tomatoes too. A testament to just how good this movie is.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it best out of Zilla movies
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing 10/10 and the music was incredible
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best Godzilla movies I have seen. I was hesitant about the human storyline, but it was intertwined throughout the film very well and compelling enough to keep you engaged. Godzilla was awesome as usual. A must watch and great addition to the franchise."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw the movie in a Dolby Cinema theater and it was absolutely top tier. I highly suggest you see this in at least IMAX or Dolby, as the sound experience is next level. The human story really drives home the theme of fighting to live and not wasting life, along with the messages learned from WW2 (PTSD, regret, etc). The human interactions really made this movie worth seeing, and Godzilla is the vessel we see through. Then when you focus on Godzilla, his class theme song, roar, and the heat ray/nuclear blast is eye & ear candy. The only nitpick I have is that some CGI is a little weird with him and the backgrounds/cities. Overall, no complaints, 10/10."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am not a fan of monster movies. My husband is a huge Godzilla fan so I followed along, thinking I'd have a nice nap during the movie. I was so wrong. The story is captivating and moving. The CGI was masterful and Godzilla was amazing. I'm telling everyone to go see it. The only downside is it not being in American theaters for very long. So go watch it!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,MASTERPIECE! 20 out of 10! 
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"My son is obsessed with Godzilla, so we've seen all of them. This is the best Godzilla movie, ever... It's so well done, brilliantly shot, and so compelling that I was just in awe through it's entirety!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Great message, story, and subplot. You're not watching, waiting for Godzilla you are totally engaged with the human aspect creating a perfectly weaved movie with rich plot lines."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Omg one of the best Godzilla movie ever.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome Movie. It's a must see, especially if you used to love Godzilla on TV in the 80's."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although not as impressive as Shin Godzilla, it was a good Godzilla movie."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Godzilla Minus One"" goes deeper than almost any Godzilla film prior to it and delves into topics rarely discussed during monster films. The heart from director Yamazaki is apparent from the opening scene, and is carried throughout the entire film."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible!  One of the best experiences you’ll have this decade at the movies.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has everything for both longtime fans and newcomers to Godzilla. It's rare for kaiju films to have the human and monster plots work seamlessly together. This film achieves just that. Whether you want a monster film, or just a good film overall, this is a great choice."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not gunna go crazy here, let's just say this movies was PERFECTLY done. Easily 10/10"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak. Movie of the year
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Instant classic! Masterpiece in my opinion.
This is the Godzilla movie we've all been waiting for. 
A+"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can see why this receiving perfect scores from critics, really made you get into the background of the characters and make you care about them for a change as opposed to most other godzilla movies.."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"ToHo is back in a big way, most Godzilla films have boring characters you don't care about. This is not one of those movies. Interesting characters. Nice dialogue. Great action. Go watch this movie"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Got to go to the early access screening for an IMAX showing. I am so happy! They made a great Godzilla movie and for only $15 million!!! Disney, take notes! You don't need to spend $200-$300 million to make great entertainment. You need talented and passionate people. This movie has a great and well told story, you actually care about the human characters in this. Direction and cinematography were great, the performances were good, heck the visuals were good! This is how you make a Godzilla movie. See this movie in a theater on the biggest screen you can find. Yes you have to read subtitles, who cares! You can still enjoy what this movie brings to the table. I can't wait to see this again in a few days. Thank you Toho for delivering on this movie! One of the best movies of 2023 by far."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I have watched all the Godzilla movies and this one is by far the best!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Great. Entertaing
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie ever!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great take on Godzilla. The storyline is compelling, the beast is fantastic. Easily among the best in the long series."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a real tear jerker. There's a lot of humanity shown in this movie, and the fear of being helpless is really so dramatic. Godzilla truly sets the fear in this movie, all the way to the end. Spicy It was magnificent, despite being lower budget the effects were quite amazing."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a very satisfying and fulfilling spectacular movie!!!!
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie really surprised me. Godzilla actually feels monstrous. He was actually terrifying and felt like a force of nature when on the screen. Additionally, the human part of the story was not just the Godzilla waiting room, the story was engaging and I came to really care about what would happen to the cast of characters. Easily one of the best experiences I've had watching movies in 2023."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite movies of all time. Ive now seen it ten times
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"OMG, that was probably the most exciting movie I ever watched, for some reason the 2 hours of this movie keep you wanting more and wishing it never ends! The acting, the effects everything was so amazing. I would say more but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's a must watch and I hope it gets a great support from the audience, but for sure it worth watching it in th biggest screen possible to enjoy it at the fullest! Highly recommend!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm am not exaggerating at all when I say that this is one of the best movies ever made. This is considering all genres and franchises. One of THE BEST movies of all time. 

There really isn't a single bad thing I have to say about Godzilla Minus One. The CGI and other effects are great, the human story is the best in any Godzilla movie so far, the action sequences are unparalleled, and the way it all blends together is perfect. This movie deserves every single nomination it got in the Hochi Film Awards."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest Godzilla films ever made and one of the best films released this year.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Japanese cinema has done what Hollywood has been unable to do: make an entertaining film with real human characters, real human story arcs, great action and a compelling story. Applause, tears, excitement - the audience was enthralled by this. Not another cookie cutter super hero movie or blockbuster. No ridiculous story line or empty characters. Godzilla minus one is how movies should be made."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Godzilla movie I've seen in years! The atomic beam is the coolest. How the dorsal plates pop out right before nuking the entire city! And that one boat scene where the boat explodes! Great movie! Would come for part 2
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"After the first watch, this movie might be my favorite Godzilla movie of all time. Great acting, good plot and the pacing was great. Never at any point during the movie did i ever feel bored. Godzilla feels terrifying in this adaptation, especially when we first see him. Not only is this movie scary but it also does an amazing job at portraying post WW2 Japan. You can feel the desperation and depression in the characters throughout the movie. Overall I feel like it has a great mix of everything you would want in a movie and would definitely recommend it."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it - one of the best Godzilla films. All of the flavor of the 50's-70's films, with characters that you actually grow to care about. Absolutely worth the popcorn and springing for IMAX if you can find it."
"Nov 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Other than the CGI not being great but also not horrendous, this was an overall entertaining story. I think unlike most, I’m not a big fan of a Godzilla that has no purpose and therefore is nothing more than a destructive force aimlessly reducing villages, towns, and cities to rubble. But I get and can appreciate the metaphor."

My Favorite film of 2023!!!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best solo Godzilla film since it's 1954 original film. It was very well balanced out between the human characters and the Kaiju himself and the story was very post-war feel, especially for the citizens of Japan and what the hardship they went through in the aftermath."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and story.
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One director Takashi Yamazaki has done it… the film is a triumph! 

Yamazaki's mastery of VFX shines through in this latest Godzilla movie, seamlessly blending astonishing visuals with a gripping human story. This entry into the Godzilla franchise reads like a dramatic period piece with a monster horror element. All the actors deliver heartfelt, meaningful performances that connected me to their characters like no other Godzilla film has before.

I truly believe Minus One will be remembered as an important piece of kaiju movie history. Its a movie that celebrates the endurance of the human spirit and our ability to evolve when thrust into the chaos of conflict while remaining accessible to both fans and newcomers alike."
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I am Japanese. I saw it in a Japanese movie theater and am typing using the translation. I think there's a good chance that people who love Godzilla will enjoy it.
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla minus one is absolute fantastic🔥💯🔥
