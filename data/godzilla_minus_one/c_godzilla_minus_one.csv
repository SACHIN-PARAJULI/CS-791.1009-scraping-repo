"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE," One year shy of its 70th anniversary, Godzilla makes a return to the big screen with a Tojo effort that makes the American renditions look like drive-in disasters in Godzilla Minus One. At the tale end of World War II, a Japanese kamikaze pilot (Ryunosuke Kamiki) makes an emergency landing on a small mechanics’ island where he hopes no one will figure out that he’s deserted in the face of fear. His worst nightmares are realized but no one will bear witness as Godzilla strikes and kills nearly everyone on the island except our protagonist and one mechanic. As he returns home, the destruction of the war has left the country reeling and with his parents dead, he seems adrift in his shame and frustration, returning to work as a necessity. It’s while working on a wooden fishing boat blowing up floating mines that he and his crewmates discover that Godzilla is back and will be heading for mainland Japan. They can’t stop him the first time but a crew of retired military seamen will certainly try to stop his eventual second arrival. While the film doesn’t entirely deal with the human devastation the war caused, nor the nuclear origins of Godzilla, it paints the Japanese people as beleaguered but undeterred in rising from the devastation and preventing it from happening again. That theme succinctly frames the post-war struggle of Japanese society and its intent to rise from the ashes stronger and better. It gives the narrative added resonance even with all the monster elements that make it fit within the long history of Godzilla films. The performances range from passive (Kamiki and Minami Hamabe as his wife) to excessive (Kuranosuke Sasaki as the gruff boat captain) with only Yuki Yamada as the young crewman who didn’t get to fight in the war due to his age striking the right balance. While those exaggerated performances fit better within a traditional Godzilla movie, this felt like it was trying to be a more crafty disaster movie than monster movie. To that end, the visual effects were largely good, though the opening sequence where Kamiki is landing on the island looked incredibly chintzy as if they wasted their budget on everything else and had to make do with the start. Beginning poorly can have its benefits but that’s a rare situation and this wasn’t one of them. Godzilla Minus One, in spite of its flaws, is an enjoyable film that hits its beats nearly perfectly, eliciting emotion with careful precision. The king of monster/disaster films remains such in his latest outing. While it might not be the dramatic interpretation we should have gotten, it’s still immensely entertaining."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Yamazaki is using &#8220;Godzilla Minus One&#8221; to create an alternate history where the World War II Japanese veterans are not possible war criminals&#44; but valiant defenders of people&#46; 
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Imagine asking not &#8220;how cool would it be if&#8230;&#8221; rather&#44; &#8220;how can our monster test our fully-realized human characters&#44; and &#8220;how can we use our monster as a tool of social commentary&#44; a means to explore and critique aspects of the culture that created it&#63;&#8221; 
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,&quot;Godzilla&apos;s properly menacing&#44; the emotional &#91;moments&#93; work&#44; &#91;and it makes you&#93; excited to see what Toho has coming next&#46;&quot;
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE," While it might have felt like the cinema of 2023 was all about Barbie and the Bomb, there were plenty of other films that likewise made their marks, whether critically, commercially or controversially. Here, then, are my picks for the 10 best movies of 2023, followed by 10 worthy runners-up and other assorted superlatives. 1. POOR THINGS (Yorgos Lanthimos). The best film of 2023. Working from Alasdair Gray’s same-named novel, director Yorgos Lanthimos (whose 2018 release The Favourite earned my vote as the best picture of that year; go here) and screenwriter Tony McNamara have fashioned a true oddity, a Frankenstein Meets Forrest Gump flick filtered through a feminist focus. Emma Stone, taking a bold leap up to the level of today’s greatest actresses, stars as Bella, a suicide victim who’s brought back to life in the most fantastical way by quirky scientist Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Under the tutelage of Godwin, the childlike Bella receives an education within the strict confines of home, but as she matures, she realizes she wants to explore the outside world. And thus she takes off with a seedy lawyer (a hilarious Mark Ruffalo), growing ever more bold as she samples life’s perils and pleasures and in the process discovers her true self. To say that Poor Things isn’t for everyone is an understatement, yet those willing to go along for the sometimes gross yet always giddy ride will experience a movie that, much like Barbie, illustrates how a woman who knows nothing of our world’s crippling problems and prejudices might carve her own path in pursuit of becoming fully human and fully independent. 2. THE HOLDOVERS (Alexander Payne). No stranger to my 10 Best lists — The Descendants was my #1 for 2011 while 2004’s Sideways and 1999’s Election also placed extremely high — director Alexander Payne (working with scripter David Hemingson) serves up a small-scale gem that, by utilizing a 1970s setting, manages to recall the intimate cinema of that period. Paul Giamatti is perfect as Paul Hunham, a grouchy professor at a New England prep school. Despised by practically everyone, he’s given the unenviable task of looking after a group of kids with nowhere to go over the Christmas break. When he’s not hanging out with the school cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, matching her marvelous performance in Dolemite Is My Name), he’s spending time with the most troubled of the students (Dominic Sessa, an actual New England prep school student making a remarkable film debut). Full of humor and pathos, this is one of those unassuming treats that overpowers the viewer with its enormous humanist bent. 3. ALL OF US STRANGERS (Andrew Haigh). No movie from 2022 emotionally wiped me out as much as Charlotte Wells’ Aftersun, and no movie from 2023 emotionally wiped me out as much as Andrew Haigh’s All of Us Strangers. Paul Mescal proves to be the connective tissue: Delivering a performance in Aftersun that earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination, he’s in support here; the star is Sherlock and Fleabag regular Andrew Scott, in a performance that should have earned him (but didn’t) a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Scott offers a wonderfully nuanced turn as a gay writer who sees dead people — namely, the parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy) who died in a car crash when he was a child. His time with his folks is intercut with time spent with his equally lonely neighbor (Mescal), but it’s not long before the two worlds converge. Rich in meaning and metaphor, and open to various interpretations, this is a rueful and haunting study about letting people in and letting people go. 4. OPPENHEIMER (Christopher Nolan). It was quite gratifying to see that both halves of the Barbenheimer phenomenon lived up to the hype, with the approving frenzy so ear-piercingly loud that it probably belonged in an IMAX production directed by Christopher Nolan. While Barbie offers sunshine and rainbow colors to go with its satiric and social themes, Oppenheimer understandably hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues. Cillian Murphy is excellent as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist whose work on the Manhattan Project led to the creation of the atom bomb — as for the all-star cast surrounding him (Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., etc.), Nolan hasn’t merely collected A-listers as if they were baseball cards but instead employs their characters to help round out Oppenheimer’s story, in the process lending greater import and understanding to the thorny proceedings. 5. ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT’S ME, MARGARET (Kelly Fremon Craig). Based on Judy Blume’s landmark novel, this focuses on 11-year-old Margaret Simon (Abby Ryder Fortson) and the circumstances that arise when her mom (a phenomenal Rachel McAdams) and dad (Benny Safdie) decide to relocate from NYC to a New Jersey suburb. With the full backing of Blume, writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen) has fashioned a splendid coming-of-age film that’s both sensitive and perceptive — it steers clear of condescension, mean-spiritedness, and glib humor in order to truly understand the tribulations of not just Margaret but also her friends and family. This unfortunately proved to be a commercial underachiever — given what was dominating the box office at the time, perhaps they should have renamed it Are You There Mario? It’s Me, Luigi. 6. AMERICAN FICTION (Cord Jefferson). A formidable actor who has lent his support to everyone from James Bond to Katniss Everdeen, Jeffrey Wright finally lands the (leading) role of his career in this black comedy about Black literature. Wright delivers a beautiful slow-burn performance as Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, an academic author whose novels are rejected for not being “black” enough. After another scribe (Issa Rae) hits it big with a book called We’s Lives in Da Ghetto, a frustrated Monk writes a deliberately pandering novel in the guise of a fictional former convict (“Stagg R. Leigh,” from the similarly titled blues folk song) and then is flabbergasted when it’s a success. Few films from 2023 can match this one for sizable belly laughs, but the guffaws never obfuscate the issues at hand, particularly the reductiveness and stereotyping of the Black experience in America. 7. BARBIE (Greta Gerwig). What’s left to say about this cultural tsunami, a zeitgeist rattler so potent that even the usual armies of MRAs couldn’t disturb one strand of hair on its perfectly coifed head? (Not that they didn’t try; see the FOX “News” rants as well as all those down votes on IMDb.) Writer-director Greta Gerwig and co-scripter Noah Baumbach have created a colorful confection that benefits from the inspired casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and just Ken. The laughs are plentiful — some of the year’s biggest nyuks can be found in its digs at film school grads, Justice League fanboys, and Matchbox Twenty — but what makes Barbie truly work is its deft tackling of themes like existential crises, toxic masculinity, feminist self-worth, overarching capitalism, and the dangers of both the patriarchy and the matriarchy (the latter a key point conveniently ignored by the whiny detractors). 8. THE TASTE OF THINGS (Trần Anh Hùng). I certainly didn’t expect a porn flick to land on this list, yet here we are. To clarify, I mean “food porn”: Like Babette’s Feast, Eat Drink Man Woman, and others, this is the sort of film where one can get aroused not only by the mouth-watering shots of delectable cuisine but also by the filmmakers’ ability to allow the gastronomy and the philosophy to commingle. Think of it as the art of the meal. Titled La Passion de Dodin Bouffant in its French homeland, this lovely effort from French-Vietnamese director Trần Anh Hùng centers on a 19th-century gourmet (Benoît Magimel) and the woman (Juliette Binoche) who has served as his cook and lover for 20 years. I suppose the central romances in Fallen Leaves and Past Lives might hold slightly more urgency and currency, but those films didn’t offer co-starring roles to a vol-au-vent and a Baked Alaska. 9. THE TEACHERS’ LOUNGE (Ilker Çatak). Movies have long employed the high school to serve as a microcosm of an ailing society at large, and this German import can proudly and profoundly be added to the ledger that also includes the likes of Election, Brick, and the underrated Teachers. A middle school harbors a thief from within, and the teachers automatically assume a student is the culprit. But when an idealistic teacher (Leonie Benesch) arrives at a different conclusion and reports her findings, all hell breaks loose. As tense as any thriller, this slowly and masterfully introduces a host of real-world problems into its storyline, including the tendency of people to offer opinions without all the facts, the employment of social media to distort and distract, and the blurring of lines between ostensible heroes and villains. The non-ending is a letdown, but everything else merits a circled red A. 10. SALTBURN (Emerald Fennell). Certainly, it doesn’t feel like this divisive effort from writer-director Emerald Fennell (whose Promising Young Woman was my pick for the best film of 2020; go here) should be placed above some of the heavy hitters cited on my Honorable Mentions list below. And those folks who groused about this largely being a rip-off of The Talented Mr. Ripley weren’t entirely incorrect. Yet there’s something to be said about movies that take root in the mind’s eye and refuse to leave, and this one has lingered more than many on this list. This story about a young man (Barry Keoghan) worming his way into an aristocratic family’s everyday existence is occasionally predictable, but the daring nature of Fennell’s approach, the spectacular visual palate, and Keoghan’s letting-it-all-hang-out (literally) performance are anything but pat. It’s Gothic stateliness by way of Goth subculture — enter at your own risk. 2023 Movie I’m Most Sorry to Have Seen:
The Killer. I was initially going to go with The Exorcist: Believer, but since it was from the writer of Halloween Ends and Firestarter, it probably never stood a chance of being watchable to anyone but the easily startled. The Killer, on the other hand, hails from David Fincher, who’s made a few fine movies (Seven, The Social Network) over the decades. This dismal dud isn’t one of them. It plays like a John Wick flick for people who think they’re too good for a John Wick flick, and the problem with Michael Fassbender’s borderline incompetent assassin isn’t that he’s unappealing but that he’s a boring zero. 2023 Movie I’m Least Sorry to Have Missed:
Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. Since it was made by a pair of QAnon nutjobs, I was initially going to go with Sound of Freedom, but why give them even the time of day? Rebel Moon, on the other hand, hails from Zack Snyder, who actually directed a pair of decent movies (Dawn of the Dead, Watchmen) decades ago but has been flailing since. So if even the fanboys who worshipped the silly Sucker Punch, the miserable Man of Steel, and that excruciating 15-hour cut of Justice League are turning their noses up at this one, then it must be a real stinker. For now, I guess Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver has dibs on 2024 Movie I’m Least Sorry to Have Missed. None of the reviews of ANATOMY OF A FALL mention the extraordinary performance of the young actor who plays Daniel, the son of Sandra Hiller’s character. What is his name?"
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,A surprisingly emotional melodrama bolsters what may stand as the most enjoyable Godzilla movie ever made in Yamazaki&apos;s call back to the nuclear creature&apos;s origins&#46; 
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE," Next month, Hollywood’s latest Godzilla movie will hit theaters. Titled Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, it will join Warner Bros.’ “MonsterVerse,” a glitzy American spin on a formula that Toho Pictures began in 1954 with the original Godzilla. The film features a fearsome monster doing battle with King Kong and other beasts, while an all-star cast looks on in horror. But although Hollywood’s approach to translating the monster has relied on pure silly spectacle—understandable for a series about a nuclear lizard beast smashing cities—Japan has, of late, found new and original angles on its kaiju hero. The newest, Godzilla Minus One, was good enough to draw a surprising amount of attention in the U.S., a signal that domestic audiences are open to high-concept spins on familiar characters. Made to celebrate the franchise’s 70th anniversary, Godzilla Minus One is the creation of the Japanese auteur Takashi Yamazaki, a visual-effects innovator with a long run of success in his country. The original Godzilla tapped into Japan’s anxieties about nuclear fallout after Hiroshima and Nagasaki; Godzilla Minus One takes place from 1945 to 1947, in the immediate aftermath of Japan’s surrender. Despair and loss pervade the film: The protagonist is Kōichi Shikishima (played by Ryunosuke Kamiki), a pilot struggling with survivor’s guilt from making it through both the war and an attack from a not-yet-fully-grown Godzilla, who destroyed a military base where he was stationed. Kōichi is haunted by his cowardice in the face of the monster and by the wartime devastation of Tokyo, which has left him without a home or family. He takes up with a woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and a child named Akiko (Sae Nagatani)—both also orphaned by the war—and becomes a minesweeper, trawling the sea for unexploded ordinance with other disaffected veterans. Into this uneasy present wanders Godzilla, now gigantic and mutated by nuclear testing. Over his 70 years of stardom, Godzilla has been variously depicted as a rampaging destructive force (in the early films), an evolutionary system keeping the world in balance, and an avenging angel doing battle with even worse monsters. His films, broken into different eras with loose continuity, range from horrifying to goofily camp. But his portrayal in Godzilla Minus One might be the most terrifying I’ve ever seen on-screen—he’s not just shambling through buildings and stomping on cars; he’s wrecking city blocks with singular purpose. His “atomic breath,” a mainstay of the series since the beginning, is represented by Yamazaki as a pulverizing nuclear blast that creates new mushroom clouds on the horizon. It’s scary. I’ve seen plenty of Godzilla movies and enjoyed most of them, but the title character has rarely been so frightening to behold. Of the American attempts, Gareth Edwards’s 2014 Godzilla came closest by emphasizing the scale of the creature, shrouding him in darkness and doling out his terrible roar with admirable restraint. Though I like that film, the humans in it are either boring or plainly risible, a problem in many a Godzilla—while the monster spectacle may draw in viewers, Godzilla himself takes up only a slim chunk of a run time largely devoted to people running around in awe and horror. That is why Godzilla Minus One is a great film rather than merely an impressive feat of monstrous visual effects (although those were justly Oscar-nominated last month, the first time a Japanese film has received a nod in that category). Kōichi is not just a cipher who exists to move the narrative along; his personal guilt and sense of hopelessness about Japan’s future are successfully entwined with the wider destruction being wrought by the monster. Kōichi’s crew of misfit survivors on the minesweeper ship, portrayed by a charming bunch of veteran Japanese character actors, are all clinging to vague hope as they look for a way to stop Godzilla. Yamazaki has said that he saw modern parallels in his story too, particularly in the national sense of confusion and futility during the early months of COVID. Whether you focus on the historical analogy or the contemporary one, the point of Godzilla Minus One is the same: Triumphing over the monster is less about destroying him and more about finding the will to live after a great cataclysm. These are deeply affecting emotional stakes, and they help the film stand as an impressive counter to the previous Godzilla film released by Toho Pictures, Hideki Anno and Shinji Higuchi’s brilliant Shin Godzilla, which was a bald-faced satire of modern governmental incompetence in the face of a kaiju attack. Viewed back to back, the films reveal how impressively versatile the series can still be; they also make Hollywood’s endless slap-fest between Godzilla and King Kong or a slew of other, anonymous monsters feel even more juvenile. Godzilla Minus One was warmly received in Japan, and its American reception has been especially surprising. On top of the Oscar nomination, the film has grossed $56 million in the U.S., by far the most for a Japanese Godzilla movie—in comparison, Shin Godzilla made just under $2 million—and the third-most of any foreign film in history. Its theatrical run concluded last week with a terrific black-and-white version that further emphasized Yamazaki’s despairing tone. Godzilla x Kong will storm into theaters next month and should stir up plenty of ticket sales on its own, but as audiences understand how artfully made and visually arresting these movies can be, they may lose interest in the corny American knockoffs."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE," Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb. When Godzilla first destroyed Tokyo in 1954, he was a metaphor for Japan's recent atomic terrors. Despite many outings since, rarely has he been as terrifying... until now. Godzilla Minus One refreshes this original tale and, crucially, remembers that it should be a horror movie. Despite this Japanese production's small budget (by Hollywood standards, at least), writer/director Takashi Yamazaki shows off the scaly beast's carnage as inventively as possible. Even when Godzilla isn't on screen, tension still builds; fans of Jaws may recognise certain tricks. The human cast is excellent, too, led by Ryunosuke Kamiki as kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima. Stumbling into a Godzilla attack at the start of the film, his cowardice costs lives. So, when the creature stirs again a few years later, Shikishima has a chance to redeem himself and save his new family, but can he face his greatest fear? A tough call, as this Godzilla is an elemental, uncaring force, a manifestation of Japan's darkest psychology. Just as he should be."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,But the horror&#44; or evil&#44; in Godzilla Minus One isn&apos;t limited to the Big G&apos;s rampages&#46; Indeed&#44; Takashi Yamazaki&apos;s monster is a secondary source of trauma&#44; and the attendant destruction is dwarfed by the war which immediately preceded his attacks&#46; 
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE," If you enjoy adventure films with a combination of intense action and dramatic flair, Godzilla Minus One might be the movie for you. Directed by Japanese filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, the film offers a visceral and fast-paced fantasy with striking visuals and a strong sense of conviction. Yamazaki employs blockbuster tactics to depict multiple dangerous situations with a radioactive Godzilla wreaking havoc on a postwar Japan.  The story revolves around Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a former kamikaze pilot turned deserter and sea-mine extractor. His lack of courage brings shame to many of his fellow countrymen. However, when he encounters Noriko Oishi and her rescued orphan baby, he discovers a new purpose in life. As Godzilla heads to Tokyo, Koichi sees an opportunity to redeem himself and prove his bravery and piloting skills. The film explores strong anti-patriotic sentiments associated with the loss of war, mixed with a sense of unity among a group of civilians led by former naval weapons engineer and strategist Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka). Despite some plot holes and sentimental moments, Yamazaki enhances the film with stylized visuals, well-composed frames, and knockout sequences that blend ferocity with desolation. The director bends the rules of the genre by providing reinforced visual effects and relying on an intense musical score. While Godzilla's new roar is a result of a simple amplification of the original, the overall experience feels fresh and new."
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE," Godzilla has forever been misunderstood. Not in the sense that the giant lizard was right to wreak havoc on the people of Japan, but rather that in the transition to Hollywood, many iterations of the character seemed to lose sight of what Ishirō Honda’s 1954 classic stood for in the first place. Naturally, you can’t have a Godzilla film without sequences of mass destruction; buildings effortlessly knocked over as if they were made out of paper, people fleeing for their lives under the feet of a gargantuan beast that threatens their very existence. But the character has always carried with it something more. Honda’s original creation was more akin to an elegy, a haunting film brought about by the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945; the monster itself is an allegory for the aftermath. Fast forward a few decades and most people’s understanding of the character is “giant monster fighting other giant monsters”, helped by the ongoing “Monsterverse” from Warner Bros. and Legendary. This didn’t stop Toho (the studio behind every Japanese Godzilla film since 1954) from continuing the legacy they started. The critical and commercial success of Shin Godzilla in 2016 proved there was still a place for the traditional Godzilla film, bringing us up to the release of Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One. Boasting more in common with Honda’s film than recent iterations like 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, Minus One brings us back to the franchise’s roots, marked by its post-war Japan setting established in the shocking, almost Spielbergian opening (similarities to that iconic T-rex scene in Jurassic Park are absolutely valid). The focus of the story here is not the titular monster, but rather failed kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima, whose first encounter with the monster leaves him haunted by the ghosts of the attack on a Japanese base on Odo Island. Upon returning home, Japan is at zero. Cities left in ruin, families destroyed, with no hope left for the future. Shikishima begins working as a minesweeper, while helping to support Noriko Ōishi, a young woman whose family died in the war, and the orphaned child she rescued from the rubble. As the years pass, however, it becomes clear that what Shikishima saw of Godzilla was only the beginning. It’s truly astonishing to see what has been achieved here on simply a surface level. In an age where blockbusters are costing more and more to produce (multiple examples from 2023 alone include new entries in the Indiana Jones and Ant-Man franchises), Yamazaki manages to craft one of the most aesthetically striking blockbusters of the past few years on a budget equivalent to just $15 million. The sense of scale created here cannot be understated: the action sequences are thrilling and monstrously terrifying, with the titular monster portrayed in a way that feels both familiar and totally unlike anything you’ve seen before, thanks to some astounding VFX work. From the nightmarish late-night attack on Odo Island that opens the film, to the unforgettable Ginza set piece that sees trains flung across the city and buildings obliterated in brutal fashion, there’s no shortage of thrilling action to keep you clutching your arm rests. But what really sets Minus One apart from its American predecessors is the amount of focus it places on its human characters, as opposed to being solely monster focused. Instead of reducing the humans to nothing but cannon fodder, they are all injected with a poignant humanity that elevates an already impressive film. In dealing with the trauma of the Japanese people after World War II, Yamazaki’s film makes for a compelling companion piece not just to the original Godzilla from 1954, but also the more recent Oppenheimer. The character drama is just as striking as the nightmarish sequences of devastation. Shikishima’s inner battle as a disgraced kamikaze pilot dealing with a lifetime of guilt takes centre stage as his revenge against Godzilla becomes the end goal of his redemption; a deeply emotional arc that acts as the beating heart of the film. Oddly enough, however, in bringing the franchise back to its roots, there are many moments throughout Minus One’s runtime that are frankly a little too derivative of Honda’s film, right down to its similar story beats, but never to the point where the immersion is broken, and this just speaks to the sheer quality on display here. With the excitement towards franchises like the MCU beginning to dwindle, Godzilla Minus One is looking like a ray of hope for the future. It’s an unexpected gem; one of the most exhilarating, pulse-pounding blockbusters to hit the big screen in quite some time, packed with so much genuine heart to make it stand out among the onslaught of generic actioners and cinematic universes that seem to be dominating the multiplexes today. Most importantly, it makes clear the staying power of Godzilla as a franchise, where filmmakers are still finding new ways to bring the monster to the big screen in a way that is both endlessly thrilling and emotionally affecting.

"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Late to this party&#44; but really admire the thought &amp; karmic energy in the film&#44; both with Godzilla Easter Eggs &amp; the allegory of Japan&apos;s sad legacy in World War 2&#46; Goes much deeper into the Godzilla mythos than ever before&#44; while remaining true&#46; Go-Go G&#33;
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE," When Ishirō Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya’s singular creation, Godzilla (Gojira), shuffled out of the ocean depths in 1954, little did they know that their gigantic, atomic fire-breathing monster—a monstrous metaphor for nuclear devastation—would be celebrating its 70th anniversary next year. Given Godzilla’s protean ability to morph with changing trends and newer audiences, it’s more than likely that audiences in 2094 (or their post-human equivalent) will be not just celebrating the king of the monsters’s 140th anniversary, but also looking forward to the next half-century and beyond. Subsequent sequels, remakes, and reboots, including the ongoing, American-made, big-budget MonsterVerse series naturally kickstarted by Godzilla (2014), never fully recaptured the horrors and terrors of the 1954 Japanese original. Until now, that is, and writer-director-visual-effects-guru Takashi Yamazaki’s (Ghost Book, The Great War of Archimedes) reboot Godzilla Minus One. At times startlingly downbeat and crushingly bleak, at others uplifting and optimistic, Yamazaki delivers a multi-layered, tonally perfect, provocative take on Godzilla and post-WWII Japan. In Yamazaki’s hands, Godzilla feels almost entirely new, both as a terrible force of nature and destruction and as an all-purpose metaphor that can change with the times. And it’s all thanks to Yamazaki and his collaborators on both sides of the camera. Godzilla Minus One opens in 1945 during the closing days of World War II. Japan’s defeat isn’t a matter of if anymore, but when. For Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot with wavering loyalties and a keen instinct for self-preservation, throwing his life away on a lost cause seems like a deeply unwise, illogical decision. Landing on a Japanese-held island for “repairs” on his faulty plane, Koichi hopes against hope to avoid his fate or barring the fate the Japanese military has set for him and others like him, another day or half-day of life. The airplane techs on the island greet Koichi with wariness and some doubt, but before they can act on those doubts, the title character appears, wreaking havoc on the airfield and worse yet, leaving only Koichi and the chief mechanic, Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), alive. Not surprisingly, Tachibana blames Koichi for hesitating when he should have attempted to engage Godzilla. Koichi would have failed, of course, but Tachibana stubbornly rejects the possibility, leaving Koichi with the equivalent of badges of dishonor (photos of the dead men) as a reminder of Koichi’s failure of nerve. After his brief, terrifying attack in the prologue, the title character hovers offscreen for the better part of another 30-40 minutes before returning for several command performances, each one both different than the last and brilliantly staged by Yamazaki and his team. With Godzilla temporarily offscreen, Yamazaki focuses on Koichi and his painful, anguished reintegration into society. Marked as a coward and—by at least one neighbor, a traitor to Japan—Koichi’s deep-seated emotional and psychological struggles take centre stage. Across Godzilla Minus One’s remaining running time, Koichi’s arc follows a not-entirely-predictable character, from a one-time pilot, once driven by nationalism and cultural attitudes about collectivism and self-sacrifice, to one driven by a straightforward, clear-eyed ideal, sacrificing himself for a greater good. That “greater good” for Koichi includes Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), a young woman who follows Koichi home one day, and Akiko (Sae Nagatani), an infant survivor Noriko saved from almost certain death. Connected by need and not biology, Koichi, Noriko, and Akiko form a makeshift family—first by default, later by intention. Still haunted by his actions during the war, Koichi remains at a physical and emotional distance. Even as he turns into a “good provider” for their family by getting a well-paying job aboard a minesweeper, which slowly improves their fortunes, Koichi can’t bring himself to ask for more from Noriko. While Godzilla represents a far greater danger, one defined not by ideological fervor, but by pure instinct, Yamazaki’s implicit worldview leads him to turn Godzilla Minus One into a celebration of the generation that survived the horrors of WWII (some, admittedly, self-inflicted, though that admission appears nowhere here) and the seemingly infinite resilience needed to rebuild post-war Japan. Taking a deeper dive into Godzilla Minus One, however, and Yamazaki’s critique of the Japanese government before, during, and after the war isn’t anywhere as clear and non-ambiguous as it first appears. Yamazaki skirts an incredibly fine line, allowing moviegoers to make the film’s themes fit whatever preconceptions or biases they had before entering the theatre. Multiple times several characters express their bitterness either at the slow-moving, inefficient bureaucracy that hinders their efforts to stop Godzilla after it makes landfall in Tokyo or at their conduct of the war. The latter can be read as either criticism of the Japanese government for bringing Japan into a destructive war or their incompetent management of the war, leading to inevitable defeat. Wherever the characters stand ideologically on the just-concluded war, they ultimately set aside their differences and unite to defeat the existential threat presented by Godzilla and its atomic breath. Yamazaki celebrates both unity and more importantly, collective action—free of bothersome government interference, no less—when Koichi, his minesweeper buddies, and ex-navy men agree to participate in an ingenious plan concocted by Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), a brainy ex-navy engineer and one of Koichi’s minesweeper compatriots. That, in turn, leads to a nerve-shredding set piece that easily qualifies as best-in-class—or among best-in-class—across Godzilla’s 70 years and nearly 40 films. Godzilla Minus One sets the concluding, decisive battle on the water, the motley assortment of decommissioned ships, merchant vessels, and tug boats the last defence against a rampaging Godzilla. Yamazaki uses every cinematic tool available to deliver a harrowingly intense, spectacle-rich experience on par with its bigger-budgeted American counterparts. As the battle progresses toward its inevitable climax, Yamazaki nimbly cross-cuts between multiple ships, their respective crews, and Koichi in full-on redemption mode. In those last, stirring, riveting moments of Godzilla Minus One, Yamazaki’s overarching theme, that only collective action—a renewed nationalism separated from from the self-destructive politics of Imperial Japan—can defeat an existential threat like Godzilla, fully comes into focus. As we’ve repeatedly learned in the past, however, any rumours of Godzilla’s demise remain, if nothing else, exaggerated.

"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE," Not only was Godzilla: Minus One one of the best movies I’ve watched in years, we absolutely deserved that happy ending. This is coming from someone who understands that creatives in Hollywood or in the film industry love a sad ending. You know what I’m talking about, one that rips out your heart and is supposed to make you think about the beauty of life blah blah blah. And I think it’s simply not sustainable or realistic. If we’re going to spend a lot of time honoring or featuring sad endings that speak to the harsh realities of our world, it’s important to also highlight the good. And the ending that we got in Godzilla: Minus One was an amazing one that showed the power of the human spirit and how the choices we make have consequences that last.  Overall I feel like this movie honored the spirit of Godzilla. For the last couple of years Hollywood has released or tried to build a world for Godzilla that revamps them. But by doing so, I feel like they have ignored the origins of this iconic monster. Hollywood’s version of Godzilla is basically the Michael Bay version. There are explosions, fights, and a bunch of big epic moments. That’s not the Godzilla that I grew up with. Sure, there was destruction. But there was always a deeper meaning and understanding of Godzilla as a symbol of the consequences of war, radiation, and human hubris. And I think Hollywood has never understood that or respected it. That’s not to say I don’t like the Hollywood versions. Besides the Apple TV show, I do. But they don’t understand who Godzilla truly is. Minus One built a world that was grounded in loss and grief. On one hand, you have Shikishima. He went off to fight a war and ended up being a deserter. And his fear, which was totally justified, led to a mountain of guilt that he didn’t step up and help when Godzilla was attacking the island he landed on. He took that with him when he went back home and discovered that his entire family was gone. And he continued to carry that as he met Noriko and inadvertently started a family with her. His grief felt real, complicated, and the kind of thing that doesn’t go away over time. It’s something that you have to face and work through. And I think that he worked through all of that to end up where he did at the end of the movie. We also have Noriko. She also lost everything and found a lifeline in Akiko and Shikishima. One ended up being her child and the reason why she kept fighting every single day when the world was just torn apart around them. And the other ended up being her partner and someone to help carry the load of raising a child. The notable difference with Shikishima is that she helped him more when it came to his grief. She willingly did it because she cared. But it got to the point where she realized that you can only help someone so much and that she has to do things for herself. That right there takes strength and if I had any complaint about her character is that I would have loved to see more of her grief at losing her family. While watching Godzilla: Minus One I got this feeling that they would end up together. I liked that they formed this little family, that they help each other carry the load of this new world, and that Noriko drew a line in the sand with Shikishima. And when we thought that Noriko was dead and that he would follow her, I grieved. I grieved for her but also for what they could have had. Color me surprised that by the end of it Shikishima survived and was on his way to living a life that he chose and on his terms. And color me even more shocked when Ota came with Akiko, sharing a shocking revelation that ended up being that Noriko was alive. Personally, I loved this ending. And as soon as I watched it I ran to Twitter to see if others agreed with me. They didn’t. A lot of people were saying that it took away from the meaning and the spirit of the movie that both of them survived. And I disagree wholeheartedly. A happily ever after is just as powerful as an ending where both of them are one of them died. And I think that a happy ending feels more realistic for the journeys that the characters went on. The rug wasn’t pulled out from underneath them. This ending felt earned and like both of them could start a new phase of their lives after processing their grief. Both of them being dead or one of them being dead would just slap on more grief and ignore what happened during the movie. Even more so, I’m kind of tired of women being fridged for the character arc of a man. This movie dabbled with that concept by making us believe that Noriko was dead. And I didn’t like it. Bringing her back or revealing that she was alive, even though she has some sort of infection on her neck that alludes to more to come, honors who she is and how her story plays into the overall story of Godzilla: Minus One. It shows her importance and how she will be a continued part of this world. And if we do get a second part to this movie that shows what is going on with her neck, I hope that it’s done from a perspective where Shikishima supports her and we end up focusing more on her journey. Because she is of value and super interesting as a character. I even liked that Godzilla is not totally dead at the ending. Godzilla is everlasting and continues to come back for more no matter what happens. They are a reminder of the hubris of humans and how they think they can conquer nature or do things to nature with no consequences. But they are also a cycle of life and how in reality we go through ups and downs that come back to haunt us when we least expect. And I think that Godzilla will come back for Noriko and Shikishima. Or they will come back for whatever descendants of my new OTP. And just like before, Godzilla will be conquered and humans will live to fight another day, understanding that their actions or the actions of other humans, brought them here. Agree wholeheartedly with you; it was good that she did survive. And what’s wrong with having happy endings in movies? Goodness knows that we don’t have enough of them in this chaotic world of ours. Besides, isn’t movies about escapism?"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE," In the seven decades since Ishirō Honda’s 1954 classic Godzilla kicked off the durable genre of the kaiju (or giant monster) movie, this fearsome mega-reptile, a prehistoric creature summoned from the depths of the sea by atomic radiation, has stomped, chomped, and fire-breathed his way through 38 movies, not to mention countless comic books and video games. He has battled King Kong, a three-headed dragon, and a benevolent gargantuan moth, and he has even been known to fight alongside the human race against a common enemy. In writer-director Takashi Yamazaki’s remarkable Godzilla Minus One, the venerable behemoth returns to his roots, once again serving as an embodiment of Japan’s anxiety about nuclear weapons in the aftermath of World War II. But Yamazaki also brings something new to the Godzilla-verse: a more modern understanding of, and profound sensitivity to, human psychological states like post-traumatic stress disorder and survivor’s guilt, as well as a critique of the nationalist machismo that shaped Japanese soldiers’ attitude toward their role in the war. It’s the rare kaiju movie that cares this deeply about the inner lives and motivations of the people scurrying out of the way of the monster’s ginormous thudding feet. In 1945, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a young kamikaze pilot, lands his plane on a small island devoted to military aircraft repairs. A mechanic (Munetaka Aoki) suspects that Koichi is only faking his plane’s technical problems so as to avoid flying an inevitably deadly mission. That night, the monster of the title emerges from the sea to wreak havoc on the island encampment, and everyone is killed except for the mechanic and Koichi, who, when called upon to unload his plane’s weapons on the beast, instead freezes in fear. Racked by shame and guilt, Koichi returns to his home in Tokyo, where his neighborhood has been reduced to rubble and both his parents killed. Amid the wreckage, Koichi crosses paths with a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who has taken in a baby after the child’s mother died in an air raid. Though he initially resists the responsibility of taking them in, Koichi cannot bring himself to leave these two to their fate, and the three become a kind of ad hoc family as Tokyo begins the painful process of reconstruction. Steven Spielberg has cited the original Godzilla as a major influence, and in Godzilla Minus One, Yamazaki returns the favor. After his return to Tokyo, Koichi takes a job on a mine-sweeping boat tasked with finding and blowing up the remaining ordnance in the sea off the Japanese coast. The small crew on this rust bucket—an old-salt captain, a brainy naval engineer, and a young sailor who wishes he too could have served in the war—can’t help but evoke the three-men-on-a-boat finale of Jaws. Soon after Koichi joins them, the boat’s crew encounters the colossus at sea, now mutated to be even more powerful thanks to the atomic tests at Bikini Atoll. In a jury-rigged operation that again recalls a certain shark movie, and that is staged with similar panache by Yamazaki, the boat’s crew devises a plan to make the creature swallow a mine, which they will then detonate in its mouth. It works, but to their horror, they realize that the leviathan has developed powers of self-regeneration. (Throughout the movie, but most especially in this first sea battle, the monster is rendered with a solidity that recalls the “suitmation” technique of early Godzilla films. Though he’s a CGI creation, his towering bulk and the craggy texture of his skin feel scarily palpable.) It’s only a matter of time before Godzilla has reached dry land, storming through the Tokyo neighborhood of Ginza while munching the cars of an elevated train as if they were a string of linked sausages. Godzilla Minus One—the title comes from the notion that postwar Japan had been set back to zero, with the arrival of the beast pushing the counter into the negative—understands better than any movie I’ve seen in ages how to balance big action sequences with quiet character moments. For those used to American-style blockbusters, the lizard-free stretches may seem unusually extended. Between Koichi’s first encounter with the monster and his second, two full years go by, the passage of time indicated not by a quick on-screen legend but by a series of small-scale scenes between the human characters. Even if he had never laid eyes on an enormous prehistoric monster, Koichi would be contending with a powerful internal conflict: his deep guilt at having survived the war when so many he loved didn’t, which he regards not as a sign of resilience but of cowardice. Kamiki’s anguished, vulnerable performance is one crucial part of what makes this protagonist so memorable, but an equally important element is the sheer amount of time that Yamazaki’s script allows him to fret about things other than radioactive reptiles: how to earn a living in a war-ravaged economy, for example, or whether he is ready to accept the love that Noriko and their adopted daughter are so eager to give him. In the five weeks since its U.S. release, Godzilla Minus One has crushed the box office under its mighty foot, not via the power of hype but through old-fashioned positive word of mouth. Made for a relatively modest budget of around $15 million—less than a tenth of the budget of the 2021 Hollywood installment Godzilla vs. Kong—it has become not only the most successful Godzilla film ever to come out of Japan but the highest-grossing live-action Japanese movie of all time. Lest the above-praised attention to character development and emotional nuance make it sound like an arty snooze, rest assured that Godzilla Minus One remains a rollicking action spectacle with a series of thrillingly crafted set pieces (several of which make judicious but clever use of Akira Ifukube’s original Godzilla theme, one of the most recognizable music cues in movie history). Come for the skyline-destroying radioactive dino, stay for the delicately etched portrait of recovery and self-forgiveness. Or vice versa. Just don’t miss the chance to remind yourself why the world fell for Godzilla in the first place."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE," As someone who typically doesn’t enjoy monster movies, I realize that I am not a member of the target audience for “Godzilla Minus One.” As a critic, it’s my job to be objective when evaluating a piece of cinema, and very little about this film worked for me. While I admire writer / director Takashi Yamazaki‘s ambitious vision of making a Godzilla film with a more human-focused story, I found it difficult to form an emotional attachment to any of the characters. Combined with the forced acting and sluggish pacing, almost everything about the movie is painfully dull. Near the end of World War II in 1945, a kamikaze pilot (Ryunosuke Kamiki) lands on a Japanese base on Odo Island. A mechanic (Munetaka Aoki) assumes that the man has fled his duty by claiming his aircraft is suffering from a technical problem. Later that evening, a terrifying creature emerges from the ocean and attacks. Already devastated by the war, Japan faces a new crisis in the form of a giant lizard monster called Godzilla. With the exception of the opening Godzilla attack, the narrative set-up is slow, which will disappoint those expecting an action packed monster movie. Not that this is a bad thing, but be aware this is a more emotionally heavy Godzilla movie. There are some action scenes with mayhem and destruction that top out at “just okay,” and the tone abruptly shifts towards the dramatic. The CGI effects are decent but certainly not mind-blowing, and there are times when Godzilla looks like he’s stepped out of a second-rate video game. He is goofy looking with a cheesy grin and a big, round belly, which makes him more laughable than formidable (which is a problem in a monster movie). The end fight to defeat Godzilla is the most exciting part of the movie, because everybody loves a hero. But the dramatic elements of the film feel manufactured and fake (cue the ridiculously hokey happy ending), especially when I felt zero emotional investment in the characters. “Godzilla Minus One” doesn’t have the universal appeal that it so desperately needs. I am not and have never been a fan of Godzilla, and this film did nothing to make me one. Well thank you very much! I do like to think I’m funny, and your witty, insightful comment gave me the confident boost I didn’t need! 🙂 Thanks for taking the time to comment, sure wish you’d let me know what you thought of the movie rather than hurling simplistic insults, but you do you, Ricardo.  Well, it won for best special effects at the Oscars so mediocre video game effects is certainly not a good fit anymore, also please explain “forced acting” because I didn’t see that. All I saw was a different culture well played on that type of stage. The Academy gets it wrong a lot. I expected more hate mail after the win tonight. “Oppenheimer” deserved the Oscar in that category. Look, “Minus One” just didn’t work for me. I found it exaggerated and boring. It’s my job to express how I feel about a certain film, and that’s how I feel about it (even after a second viewing). I am so glad it resonated with and worked for so many people, but I just don’t think it’s a good film.  Sometimes it’s the individual that gets it wrong, even with the best intentions. It doesn’t matter if something fits your personal tastes what matters is contributing positive consideration for a film that does not fit your tastes but is still a worthy piece especially for the limited resources and different culture involved. I think you watched a different film than most of us.  The ending superficially might be “happy” but it’s not. I guess you weren’t paying attention.  The pacing is amazing. If you think it’s slow, I recommend avoiding Seven Samurai as you will find that a real snooze-fest for an “action film”. Funny you mention “Seven Samurai,” it’s one of my all-time favorites. So happy “Minus One” worked so well for you, it certainly didn’t for me. Thanks for taking the time to comment, I appreciate you sharing your thoughts. I appreciate your timely response. Without knowing the genre however, I would imagine this film might be hard to approach.  It harkens back to the original 1954 Gojira for its solemn tone.  I’m still surprised at your pacing comment.  Pre atomic Godzilla shows up no more than 8 minutes into the film and more or less serves as a slingshot to propel the story forward, much like the initial attack on Chrissie in Spielberg’s Jaws (1975).  Narratively, Minus One shares more than a few similarities with Jaws actually. The opening attack is fun enough, but then I thought the pacing dropped dramatically as the narrative is set up. I didn’t find the characters interesting or even that sympathetic, but I’m so glad you did. I know a lot of people loved this movie, and that’s really cool.  With the exception of the first 8 minutes, I found the film to be incredibly tedious, slow, and boring. The ending was so bad, and I was indeed paying attention. I never change an opinion for hits or clicks, but I am firm and confident in my opinions on films. I am so glad “Minus One” worked so well for you, but it was a complete dud for me. That’s what makes art so great — its beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Thanks again for taking the time to share your comments.  I felt that way about “Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.” I absolutely hated it, but so many seemed to love it. The filmmakers went to my alma mater and when they won the Oscar people came out of the woodwork to ask if I was excited a couple of Emerson graduates had won.  I always think something’s wrong with me that some movies just don’t resonate at all when so many others love them. I am a huge sci-fi fan, but have literally hated every Star Wars film I’ve seen. My favorite film – Annihilation – seem to be polarizing as well. All that said, I absolutely loved this film. Saw it again last night, this time in black & white, and I have to say it was even better “minus color.” Godzilla Minus One poorly paced, poor characters, and mediocre CG, but Barbie and The Marvels those are good?
Yeah I think I can tell why you maybe didn’t care for it if those movies are considered good by your standards. Fair point, but I wasn’t over the moon about Barbie or The Marvels either, I just found them to be slightly “fresh” for RT. At least I wasn’t bored. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.  There’s nothing fresh about either of those movies, but they check certain boxes for certain people so that’s why they get a pass from critics that other movies don’t. I won’t say Godzilla Minus One isn’t without flaws, but there’s far more quality, and craft put into it for it’s budget than either Barbie, or The Marvels, or half the garbage put out by Hollywood. You finding it boring doesn’t change the fact that every character is set up, and pays off by the movies end storytelling 101. Seriously???  So not enough car chases and silly slow-mo fight sequences for you???  You shouldn’t be reviewing films because obviously you have no clue what a good one is. Thank you for taking the time to comment. Everyone has different perspectives and preferences on movies, and I’m so glad “Minus One” worked for you. Do you have any other movies that you think are “good?” Was wondering if we agreed on any titles, because I’ll bet we do.  SZ, I think you’re in a very small minority regarding this film. Of course, you could still be right, but I think you should ask why your take on GM1 is swimming so much against the stream. What is everybody else getting, that you aren’t? Personally, I found it an excellent blend of spectacle and human drama. Once in a while, I am thoroughly shocked and surprised that my take on a movie is so different than everyone elses. It hasn’t happened often, but it does happen. I even tried to go back and rewatch “Minus One,” and I still was bored by it. Something about the story simply doesn’t resonate with me. Thank you for taking the time to comment and share your thoughts!  Thanks for taking the time to comment, although I certainly wish you’d contributed to the discussion on the film in some meaningful way rather than hurling the most basic of insults. Would still love to hear what you thought about the film, if you’re able to discuss. Curious how a single person can proclaim a movie doesn’t have universal appeal when an incredibly high majority of people have agreed that it indeed does? Seems like logical fallacy if you ask me. The ending is absolutely not happy as it’s a stand in for the long term effect radiation had on the Japanese people. Did you see the part where she’s “sick”? Or did you legitimately not catch the twist? It was subtle and if you had checked out by that point I can understand missing it. I’m a firm believer that critics should obstain from reviewing certain films they clearly don’t have an interest in reviewing and you should have stuck to your strengths, which you admit, this is not one of. Many of us align ourselves with critics we agree with or share similar interests with, and it seems you may have a hard time finding an audience for you opinion besides in these very threads which are not engaged with based on your robust critical film experience, but more so the lack of. Thanks for taking the time to comment. It’s my job to review all types of genres, and what a sad belief to have that critics shouldn’t review certain films. EVERY movie has a chance to win me over, including this one, but it failed on every level imaginable. It’s just an opinion, as is yours.  I would be interested in knowing what kind of characters you do connect with? As a Godzilla fan I recognize I’m bias. In all the movies I have seen (all of them up to Godzilla 1985) I have always enjoyed seeing Godzilla and have never cared about the human characters. This movie left me with a changed perspective. Similar to the first viewing of the Matrix the world felt diffrent afterwards. Not because of the feeling of the veil being pulled back but because my dorky guilty pleasure of film had changed into true art. Even stranger is I can’t get it out of my mind. I think this is why so many feel your review  is not authentic. Without being rude I agree it feels like there may be an agenda at play here or a lack of understanding to the point of reviewing negligence. I realize the film worked for so many people, and many seem to take it personally when someone else doesn’t agree with them (as evidenced by a lot of these comments). My review is authentic: I simply did not like the film for the reasons I stated. I even tried to watch it a second time, and it still didn’t work for me. One of the most enjoyable things about film criticism and evaluation of art is that we all don’t  have to agree, and not every “fresh” review of the film is glowing nor totally positive. It’s weird to me the defensiveness of the movie’s fans; I’m just one writer who sees hundreds of movies a year, and I simply didn’t think it was a good one. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, I appreciate hearing from people who agree and disagree!  I thought Godzilla Minus One was a film with some serious tonal flaws (what was that sudden bikini atoll scene? Was it a Godzilla 1998 reference?), but overall landed very well for me as far as putting me in the shoes of a soldier who felt like a walking ghost that ultimately chooses life by the end. A story of hope in the face of overwhelming odds both in the mind and in the physical world. The bikini atoll scene was Godzilla having an atomic bomb dropped on it. You see Godzilla getting effected by radiation. Its an explanation of how it became such a big monster compared to the first attack scene. Its a reference to the history of the movie and how the test we did at bikini atoll influenced the creation of Godzilla in the first place. This cannot be a serious review or this is merely an internet blogger not an actual film critic. Pacing, character development, acting, story, and intensity are lacking according to this “critic”. This is the gen z folks who have attention span of a gnat and think bloated budgets and sparkles, and explosions and the logo (marvel, LOTR etc) make it good.
 Sorry true story telling, real personal drama, character development and less explosions and a film where you might have to know actual history to have a reference point isn’t up to par to modern young people…. I was born in the 1970s and am a “real” film critic, and I stand behind my review and opinion of this film. I do appreciate you taking the time to comment, however.  I’m sorry you’re had to put up with this harassment. I don’t agree with you but nobody deserves to be treated with disrespect over an opinion. I don’t don’t think Christopher Nolan has made a 5 star film that I’ve seen. We all have some film or filmmaker we don’t connect with. No art can ever be objectively bad, only subjectively loved or derided. Thank you for the kind comment. As a critic, especially a female, I’m used to the harrassment. It unfortunately comes with the territory whether I like or dislike a particular movie. Art is so subjective, and that’s okay! Thanks again for taking the time to comment.  You must have had a bad day when you watched this movie.  If you have ever seen any of the other “blockbuster” Hollywood versions of Godzilla you would know that there is something very different and special about Godzilla -1.  This film, finally, focused on the human aspect of the story and removed the constant mind-numbing action sequences of today’s throw away movies.  I have not seen a movie in over 30 years that I still think about days after watching it and, of all things, it was a monster movie!  It was a monster movie but there was so much more to it than that.  Regardless, I respect your opinion although disagree with your assessment.   This was a great film. Thank you for taking the time to comment, I’m so happy the movie worked for you. I know so many people do love it, it just wasn’t for me.  Shame on you. You are either trying to get clicks or you don’t know what you are talking about and have no business being movie critic. I’ve always wondered what goes through the mind of a small time film reviewer who’s among an infinitesimal number of Rotten Tomatoes critics disliking a movie — in Minus One’s case, 2%. I really do. I hope you know that Minus One was created with a budget of $10M to $15M, roughly less than 1/10 of Barbie and 1/20 of a Marvel production. What is presented on-screen is quite an accomplishment, I’d say. Your snark over Godzilla’s looks and the surrounding special effects shows that you have no understanding of the monster’s heritage and how Japanese filmmakers traditionally portray him. And the Minus One’s writer/director had temerity to center his movie around a human drama set in post-WWII Japan that would’ve been nearly as compelling without the monster: a kamikaze pilot who can’t follow through with his mission to die and must live with guilt-driven PTSD, and Japan’s innocent citizens forced to rebuild their lives due to politician’s poor choices.  I’m sorry the film’s nuance and subtext passed by you. I stand by the 98% percent of the audience who found Minus One a genre film achievement. As a reviewer who sees an average of close to 300 films a year, there’s always going to be a handful that simply don’t resonate with me. “Minus One” is one of those films in 2023. Thank you so much for taking the time to read and comment, though!  I’m really shocked at the level of vitriol thrown at the reviewer over a piece of entertainment. I thought the movie was excellent, but I can understand that if the characters dont appeal, the film is going to feel slow paced. Not every movie is for everyone and opinions are not objective fact. 98% on RT thought this film was good, but that’s just an opinion, too. What is rather remarkable, however, is the fact that the reviewer has taken every attack in good faith, retaining their dignity and compassion in answering some rather deplorable comments. I’m not sure I would have retained my composure so well under the same circumstances. People are quite vocal with this review because it’s a great movie that breaks the formula. Godzilla -1 is a glorious midfinger to hollywood studios that think people want to see “representation” and “cool visual effects”, when people just want a good history, with good characters and some food for thought.  It’s not an action movie, its a drama with aspects of a horror movie. Maybe you saw the title and thinked “oh, ok, godzilla movie, lets see a monster destroying a city with cool effects”, but this is a historical drama that just “have” a kaiju. It’s a movie about Japan post WWII, its about the nuclear bomb, it’s about people losing faith in the government, it is about survival guilt and PTSD – who cares if godzilla looks “silly”!? Ginza attack is about the fear and the grief of losing Norinko and the sonder of the scene. The black rain after was the same that felt in hiroshima in 1945. Silly godzilla with large belly is a metaphor for something very real and truly scary. The “happy ending” is deserved when the engineer says “the government don’t care about the people, they made tanks without armor and planes without catapults – kamikaze. But we fight to protect ourselfs”. The mechanic saw a covard he despised becomes a hero that was ready to die and THEN he saved his life including a catapult in the plane. It’s amazing writing and characther development. The problem with this review was that it didn’t differentiate betwen “I don’t like it” and “it’s a good movie”. If you are a critic and know about cinema, you MUST understand why this movie is so great, and then it’s ok for you to saw “but it didn’t work for me”. Calling a movie with a small budget bad because it’s “lacking CGI” it’s offensive. Calling a drama bad for “lacking the pace of an action movie” is unfair. It’s ok for you to have a personal view on this movie, it’s not ok to say it’s bad. I respect that you didn’t like it. I loved it. I never watch movies in theaters and I went to the theaters to see it 4 times. I dislike pretty much everything Godzilla too, but I saw a youtube video about the history of it that had me interested in this one. I think that there were a few CGI scenes (girl hanging from train, top down from boat) that I didn’t think were as good, but overall the boat chase scene, the atomic breath, everything else worked really well for me. I saw the behind the scenes video they put out and it gave me even greater an appreciation for it. I have a friend who is a history buff about tanks and planes, he loved the attention to detail on the vehicles. He told me they even got the engine sounds on the plane correct. As for the story, I really liked the human characters, I empathized with the main character. The only change I would make is I don’t think the love interest should have been alive at the end. That seemed like a cop out. When I compare to the other movies I have seen, this one actually stood out as really good. I don’t like a lot of movies that are high rated on RT or IMDB, but this one I really enjoyed. I hope you stop getting hate, not everything is for everyone. Rhett and Link did a song about that once actually that says “And I don’t mind that I don’t like liking the same exact things as you”. People should learn this. Bro… your review was anything but objective. Everything you said was subjective and personal… I feel like you put more effort in replying to the comments than writting the critique.  Objectivity is important, but all critics bring some subjectivity to their reviews and views, it’s the nature of the beast. I’m so glad you loved “Godzilla: Minus One,” I just didn’t think it was entertaining enough to deserve a “fresh” rating. Thanks for taking the time to comment, I do appreciate it.  Saw our review on rotten tomatoes. How does it feel to be so incredibly wrong about EVERY single thing you wrote. You clearly have no clue what you are doing, or think you are being super edgy by downgrading the film. This should have won film of the year. Louisa Moore is inept, and should be relieved of her job. 98% on rotten tomatoes, and you think you’re special because you downgraded the film….moron. I stand behind my review. The number of personal attacks about this is truly astounding. Thanks for sharing your expertise in being utterly unpleasant, it’s truly awe-inspiring."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE," If you sift through the cinders, there, shockingly resilient, as they have been through every dark period of the last century, are our movies. They are cultural markers that can tell us about ourselves if we listen carefully enough. They are mirrors if we can stand to look at ourselves: cruel and implacable, as only the plain and awful truth can be. It’s easy to look back twenty or thirty years and track the character of the time, the fears and warnings left like time capsules buried as cultural artifacts in the sand of our diminishing options. Can we turn that intuition on ourselves? I don’t know. Every generation believes they’re the last is what they say, though I wonder if what this really means is that every generation comes to realize it deserves to be the last. I imagine us scrambling to slow entropy and entropy refusing to slow. I remember thinking I could make a difference, and how good that used to feel. The world is on fire. I think you could probably blame fewer than a dozen very wealthy people for that, wealthy enough that we no longer have the ability–nor indeed the will–to stop them. As soon as you allow billionaires to exist, the Rubicon has been crossed. Game over. So in the time we have left, and as the window for our ability to express ourselves about popular genocides in public spaces closes, we still have movies: these shadows on cave walls telling whatever will be left that we were here and that we knew. We did. We were so angry and sad, and there was nothing we could do, because the people and systems that were supposed to protect us only protected them. Now it’s done. The buzziest movies of 2023 were Greta Gerwig’s dangerously facile Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s remedial Oppenheimer, both machine-tooled to tweak the pleasure centres of as broad an array of their target demographics as possible and finding themselves the topics of conversations not so much divisive as tediously programmatic. I worry that cultural discourse looks like this now: skirmishes between evenly-matched featherweights; slap-fights between emaciated and untrained antagonists that ultimately seem more like staged diversions than prize matches. We are not edified arguing about whether the monologue in the one is retrograde and patronizing or if the theme of the other is the nihilistic arrogance of man in the face of the anonymous misery he enacts. We are not enriched by weeping at the recognition of unenlightened observations delivered as hambone and cheese. Masturbation doesn’t result in offspring. The best movies of 2023 are interesting because they’re more than just reflections of the current state of our state. They carry in them the spark of…is it hope? Hope, or hopefulness? Is there a difference? Is the difference that one is belief and the other the expression of belief? I don’t know how to parse it, but I’m holding on to both with two hands, so hard my fingernails are leaving tiny bloody crescents on my palms. I don’t know how much longer I can do it. Sixteen honourable mentions follow below. I didn’t see Evil Doesn’t Exist or Close Your Eyes; I suspect both will get 2024 releases. Okay, you know the drill. Let’s go. Friendship and family start us off. The partnership between Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (Matthew Johnson), which forms the disintegrating moral centre of Blackberry: two nerd best friends who dream of combining a telephone with an Internet server and rapidly take over 45% of the fledgling cell-phone business in the United States with the help of evil capitalist Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton). The friendship between Jaime (Anwen O’Driscoll) and Marike (June LaPorte), navigating their mutual adolescent attraction and the oppressive Jehovah’s Witness cult to which they belong in You Can Live Forever. Families ground the high-rise horrors of Evil Dead Rise and the sideshow guignol of Where the Devil Roams, while fidelity to God and country drives the doomed heroine of Reality, who tips off the media that the Russians may have had something to do with manipulating the results of recent elections. There’s hope here: hope in the idea that abandoning friendships is still bad and that families, blood or relational, are still the glue holding society together, no matter how broken and perverse. I can’t say that any of these films has a happy ending, per se: they feel like a drowning person reaching for the rope trailing behind the ship after falling overboard–but here we are still thrashing. Doomed, you know, but not dead yet. Family and friends, sure, but let’s also talk about self-loathing in 2023. Let us go, you and I, we the patients etherized on a table bathed in flickering, silver light, peeled-back skin and muscle, sinew and artery, bone and scraped marrow. I imagine the essence of us caught in grooves and drained into the floor. When Julianne Moore’s monstrous narcissist Gracie in Todd Haynes’s May December protests, “I am naive, always have been,” to the soap opera actor (Natalie Portman) trying to mimic her, I died a little on the inside. The level of self-deception, the lack of introspection at war with her complete self-knowledge and seething self-hate, exquisitely captures Haynes’s career inquiries into identities in the process of crashing into themselves. In Talk to Me, YouTube sensations Danny and Michael Philippou explore similar themes of coming to terms with inner darkness through a series of possessions and facial obliterations: stabbing, carving, smashing, blinding at the least; the goal always seemed to be the desecration of the temple of Me. Blunt–and a lovely companion piece to David Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer that engages in similar Oedipal derangements while engaged in the question of reproductive choice. Passages boasts the most fascinatingly loathsome/compulsively watchable character in a film since Mike Leigh’s Naked. Franz Rogowski’s Tomas, a cross between Vincents Gallo and Cassel, lays waste to everyone who wants to love him through this indescribable mixture of gluttonous hedonism and absolute insecurity-masking-as-confidence. Ben Whishaw, as he is wont to do, steals the film as one corner of the triangle Tomas creates when he cheats on his husband (Whishaw) with gorgeous schoolteacher Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). It’s maybe 2023’s most infuriating watch, even if it does let the audience off the hook with a cathartic comeuppance. But while it’s firing, it’s nailing the evil that men do in a more visceral way than Oppenheimer‘s sexualization of intelligence. Tomas isn’t brilliant, he’s a worm insensibly insinuating itself into the soft flesh of the unfortunates falling into its radius. Afire, meanwhile, tackles self-loathing in the body of a writer–one of a couple of writers this year–who only exists to create misery he can mine for his work while just outside of frame an actual world-consuming fire rages. Atrocities we know but manage to ignore is a theme of our age of missing information, where we are so inundated with knowledge we retreat into our holes, eyes closed and ears covered. Mark Jenkin’s Enys Men is the cleanest evocation of Wordsworth’s “story of place” I’ve ever seen: a Cornish nightmare revealing a story in every landmark, every plant, every ruin, whether inside our bodies or out. It’s a ghost story about our haunted planet, a cautionary tale about the impossibility of living somewhere that hasn’t been fed with blood and tears. The picture takes root like the parasitic lichen at the centre of its intrigue–the only active force in an insensate, immoral vacuum. A day or two before my dad died, he told me he had a dream of being in a forest, wearing a paper mask, holding a fire in his hands and coming upon a group of others in a similar state. I asked him if it was a scary dream, and he said no–he said it was a deathdream, and that he was going home. He wasn’t a spooky guy, my dad. He didn’t tell many ghost stories when I was growing up. We were credulous; there were enough things to fear here and now to worry about later, elsewhere. For the twenty years since his death, I have waited to dream of a forest full of figures, paper on their faces and flame in their hands. He gave me a lot of things to carry once he set them down. That’s what fathers do. Ted Geoghegan’s chamber horror Brooklyn 45 assembles a gallery of war dogs in the immediate aftermath of WWII to drink, tell their hoary stories of survival and the terrible things they’ve seen, and confront, eventually, how deep the roots of conflict have taken in each of them. A German maid is discovered, a friend of theirs kills himself, favours done for a pal become a secret about a war crime; in the year Henry Kissinger finally went home to his throne in Tartarus, here is this little movie about the heads that wear the hero’s laurels. Michael Edward Geoghegan, the director’s late father, is thanked in the credits for giving his son the stories of pain and personal sacrifice comprising the background of this personal project that, in the telling, becomes a mortal diagnosis for all our prospects. I miss the people in my life who are gone. I alternate between wishing they were still around and being jealous that they don’t have to be here with me to watch the walls bleed. Lila Avilés’s Tótem covers a birthday party for a terminally-ill man through the eyes of his young daughter, seven-year-old Sol (Naima Senties)–more a death-day party, really, as everyone except Sol measures the gravity of this being the last time most of the guests will see the centre of attention. Senties is remarkable–or, rather, Avilés demonstrates an uncanny ability to piece together an emotional process from what is unspoken, seen, hidden, and revealed. She is a major emerging talent. Compare her work in silence here with master John Woo’s in the logical endpoint for his career as a choreographer of the sublime dance of heroic bloodshed, Silent Night. I feel like I’ve spent thirty years defending Woo’s narratives as books for operas, step charts for elaborate tangos, works that operate in experimental and gestural spaces rather than novelistic and narrative ones. He’s been working towards a “silent” film for a long time, and 2023 seems to be a year where being robbed of one’s voice (it happens, too, in Sisu and No One Will Save You) speaks piquant and eloquent. I think the film would have been met with the same incomprehension and derision had it been traditionally scripted: For my money, Woo has never been traditionally scripted. Silent Night is not an outlier for Woo, in other words–it’s a meticulously-engineered vehicle for action. There would be no John Wick without John Woo. Alice Rohrwacher’s sedate, melancholy, haunted “thriller” La Chimera is about a taciturn tomb raider, Arthur (Josh O’Connor), armed with an unerring nose for buried antiquities and pining for a woman who’s more than likely dead. The title suggests his lost Lenore is a mythological beast, an amalgam of disparate parts or capable of changing its appearance–and indeed, Arthur is restless, constantly searching for things to fill the hole in him. He finds it in the end, only to hurl it into the ocean upon realizing that what gives his life meaning is his miserable, romantic, and endless hunt. Isabella Rossellini, at this point in her career the human embodiment of the elderly relative you love and miss the most, plays Arthur’s grandmother, maybe the last person to still love him. The last, certainly, to indulge his fantasy that he’ll ever recover what he’s lost. Finding meaning in the diversions is the crux of Rodrigo Moreno’s shaggy heist flick The Delinquents. Not shaggy like some ’70s piece, aswarm with character actors and European sensibilities, but so entirely in the bag for the concept of the “MacGuffin” that long stretches of it have nothing to do with what it’s ostensibly about. Moribund bank tellers Moran (Daniel Elías) and Román (Esteban Bigliardi) hatch a Hitchcockian plot to abscond with enough money to live comfortably for the rest of their lives, but halfway through their half-assed plan, well, Román gets distracted. The ticking bomb of his inevitable discovery underpins a sweet romance, a light comedy of living life in the moment, and eventually the realization that none of us knows when the falling piano will flatten us, so maybe lift your eyes and fill your lungs while you can. Brian Duffield’s brilliant alien-invasion flick No One Will Save You manages to tell a pitch-black tale of the dark desires of the human soul without ever playing like a “down” picture. (Its resurrecting the music of Ruby Murray surely helps.) The idea that there might be a higher intelligence who will one day offer to trade your awful reality for a curated unreality–and that this bargain will be more than even the most heroic could resist–is a ballsy one to present in a genre used to noble expressions of the indomitability of the human spirit. Ditto Bomani J. Story’s outstanding debut The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster, which mines Mary Shelley’s extraordinarily progressive Frankenstein for a story about a brutal police force, being profiled for your appearance, and how autodidactism is the only way out of the shackles others would place on your freedom. Completing this trio of young women heroes is 11-year-old Margaret Simon (Abby Ryder Fortson), making her way in a new school with new friends while navigating puberty and organized religion in Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, Kelly Fremon Craig’s follow-up to her similarly exceptional The Edge of Seventeen. Perhaps we should also include Charlotte (Natália Germáni) of Tereza Nvotová’s chthonic fable Nightsiren, returned to her family’s hut in the forest upon her mother’s death and after a long separation following an unspeakable accident. Round out this section with Iranian filmmaker Houman Seyyedi’s dizzying, satirical balancing act World War III, in which itinerant worker Shakib (Mohsen Tanabandeh), hired on as a physical labourer on the set of a Holocaust film, is first recruited to play a concentration camp extra and then Hitler himself. Consider the absolute audacity to use the Holocaust as a metaphor for how money corrupts everything, power systems immediately pervert morality, and desperation makes villains of us all. It shouldn’t work, but it works like a Swiss timepiece, clicking along invisibly and betraying nothing while moving through a series of events that are at once entirely unpredictable and the only things that could possibly happen in hindsight. It opens with a quote attributed to Mark Twain, one I’ve returned to as 2023 wheezes to a close: “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” At the beginning of Jeff Rowe’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, our boys pause on the way back from a scavenging trip to be “normal” for a while, watching in the dark with the rest of their block a bit of the outdoor movie cutting through the sultry New York summer night. 2023’s themes surrounding the power of community-forged families and the evergreen urge to belong are captured in this most unlikely of places–a film that is arguably the first truly faithful adaptation of Eastman & Laird’s high-concept underground quartet, who were designed to speak to the immigrant experience, the fracture of social class in New York, and the despair of being invisible in one of the most densely-populated places in the world. It’s as sharp and savvy in its callouts as Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which shifts its attention from a Black kid finding his voice to a young woman seeking to do the same. The search for words is central to Brandon Cronenberg’s Infinity Pool as well. There, an author’s fears of being blocked, being made ridiculous, being seen, are exploded as a deathdream of broken identity and murder on the cheap. Everything is for sale in Infinity Pool except actual accomplishment. The world is plastic, and nothing means anything. How could it, when the only things it values have a price tag? That’s the world from which Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has retreated. He has no friends, “only admirers.” He refuses to use his intimidating skills of ratiocination to help the mob of people lined up every day outside his apartment, only relenting to entertain a guest when it’s “old friend” and crime writer Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey). She’s onto something, she tells him, a big story, and she needs his help. It involves a suicide, a seance, a haunted tenement in a sinking city, and a Halloween party for orphans where the guests are warned of all the dead children wanting to add to their numbers. It’s spooky, sure, more so for Poirot’s dangerous despair and, eventually, the rage that causes him to use his gifts as a bludgeon–a scythe of obliterating logic that answers every question except the one of his loneliness. My favourite line in Broadcast News comes when Holly Hunter’s type-A producer is told it must be nice to believe you’re the smartest person in the room and she says, “No, it’s awful.” I love all three of Branagh’s Poirot films for this thread of a broken man exploited and celebrated but desperate for a human connection to ground him in the world of the living. El Conde deals with a different kind of supernatural element in the peeling-back of the world’s injustices, placing vampires as the ageless, chimeric heads of state throughout history, responsible for the looting of their countries, the misery of their citizens, and the ongoing genocides of native populations that make all the rest possible. Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s About Dry Grasses and Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Monster form (along with Ilker Çatak’s The Teachers’ Lounge) a trilogy of teachers vs. students here at the beginning of a cultural revolution in which intellectuals are targeted for hostility preparatory to their eventual extermination under fascist leadership. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Neither film takes sides. Both take in the absolute, irresolvable tragedy of pitting these two groups against each other in ideological battles–he said/she saids and sprung power dynamics that feel like toothpaste you can never put back in the tube. The hardest thing about the last several years has been learning how fragile our systems are and how easily they’re overturned by people who just…want to. Our governments are the equivalent of those little chains on doors. It only works as a deterrent so long as the person trying to break it down refrains from putting the tiniest bit of pressure on it. About Dry Grasses leaves the classroom environment to explore how the foundations built in childhood cast long shadows on a culture’s odds for survival, while Monster is fixated on the price of kindness, of standing up for the right things, even when the only difference it makes to do so is the assured destruction of the person making the right choice. Laura Moss’s Birth/Rebirth is specifically about how even the notion of the “right” choice is difficult when questions of choice are entangled with existential legislations in the United States that essentially relegate women, officially, into a caste of second-class citizen. Davy Chou’s Return to Seoul is the immigrant-life-that-could’ve-been film I most connected with in a visceral way this year. Lost, wayward Freddie (Park Ji-Min) is a Korean-born woman adopted as a child by loving French parents who, as a young twentysomething, makes a trip back to Korea in search of the parents who gave her up. It’s a set-up for any number of familiar scenarios the film assiduously avoids en route to telling a story of cultural friction and misunderstanding, resentment and grief, and figuring out who you are in maybe the last place you were going to look. I love Freddie not because she isn’t a monumental fuck-up whose decisions hurt other people, but because she is. The film is unsentimental about it. People are broken sometimes, and they either find solid ground or they drown. That’s it. Chou doesn’t gild it, doesn’t provide Freddie a safety net, merely presents all of these terrible moments where friends like Tena (Guka Han) decide not to be friends with Freddie anymore, though not before telling her how sad a person she is. Aren’t we all. Cap this group with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the continuing adventures of Tom Cruise’s invincible hero as he suffers unimaginable losses in fighting an omniscient and indefatigable foe. Ethan Hunt is much like Branagh’s Hercule Poirot at this point, aware of his specialness and the full extent of how it makes him alien. Ethan still has friends, but fewer and fewer. He is Ethan Edwards from The Searchers. His job is to save society, not live in it. Four films about the male death drive are the legs for this group of films, starting with Jacob Elordi’s violent, child-like take on The King in Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla. Coppola is the very definition of an auteur–the author working through a specific set of issues and interests through her medium of choice–and this is, after Somewhere, my favourite of her careful, moonstruck tales of little rich girls abandoned emotionally by the schmucks they figure out the hard way they can live without. Michael Mann’s Ferrari envisions the car mogul as a force of malignant nature whose will to power cuts a swath of death–at one point literally–through those unfortunate enough to be caught up in his dervish. Penélope Cruz steals the show, though (just as Marion Cotillard does in Mann’s Public Enemies), as the long-suffering wife of Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver), the woman trying to hold it together when massive chunks of her life fly apart. Bradley Cooper attempted to do the exact “in the middle of the maelstrom” thing with Maestro, but the difference between the two films is the difference between glancing a stone across the surface of the method pond and diving deep into the appetite for destruction that pushes some men to stoke their furnaces with the wreckage they’ve made of their lives. David Fincher’s thematic sequel to Fight Club, The Killer locates modern man as the hunter of Amazon wishlists and the gatherer of packages dropped off thrice daily at his doorstep. A dry-as-ash comedy about masculinity’s endpoint in capitalism’s emasculating convenience (and the importance for some to pretend at potency regardless) sets its climax at a luxurious penthouse where a billionaire does his best to figure out which of his crimes against humanity has brought a hired killer to his doorstep. Even the fact that the film itself is a technical marvel, sleek perfection from start to finish, is part of the gag. Consider The Killer‘s smooth surfaces vs. the cool facility of diplomat/official De Roller (Benoît Magimel)–“the roller,” n’est-ce pas?–who slithers through Albert Serra’s colonial nightmare Pacifiction like the proverbial snake in the garden. He makes promises he never intends to keep, condescends to the locals, placates the foreign heads of state, and seeks to suppress rumours of a resumption of nuclear testing in the Tahiti protectorate he represents without seeming to care whether or not these rumours are true. For De Roller, what matters is that he reach a state of relational equilibrium between every player–that he please all stakeholders by quieting alarm, smoothing over it with a blanket of unctuous equivocations. He promises one group they’ll receive access to exclusive casinos (“Plus a free chip for all citizens?” “Sure!”) and another the opposite, and it’s not that he’s ever lying–it’s that his only job is to get people to a state of continuous quiescence. The art of making people not care they’re about to end the world and die either in the blast or the fallout is what most of our public discourse is now. Seeing it represented on film by an abandoned rave way past its endpoint, presided over by a topless DJ dancing alone in the purple, ultraviolet glow, is the exact visual metaphor for Charlie Chaplin rollerskating along the edge of a gaping hole for our modern age of ignoring the uncomfortable. Top it off with the finest comedy of the year, No Hard Feelings, a film about the income gap, America’s social classes, and how Jennifer Lawrence may be, aside from Tom Cruise, the last of our real, bona fide movie stars. Romance in 2023 is defined by Aki Kaurismäki’s deadpan heartbreaker Fallen Leaves and Andrew Haigh’s heart-shattering All of Us Strangers–the one about a congenital loser who realizes he has one last chance to turn everything around, and so, after fucking up, he takes it; the other about a writer who creates an entire interior life of hope and acceptance from his despair and alienation. Kelly Reichardt’s Showing Up is the first of her uniformly excellent films to truly resonate with me. It’s a portrait of an artist who has an indefinable process and pace and is woefully aggrieved whenever either is violated. Plagued by inconveniences real and exaggerated, she tries to finish a few crucial pieces before her big show but mainly finds cause to be exasperated, stressed out, and depressed. Nailed it. The interiority of her dysfunction is projected in the surreal expressionism of Ari Aster’s Beau is Afraid–another director making a mark on me for the first time with a personal piece obsessed with the peculiarities and perversions of the life of the mind. Opening in a Republican’s vision of New York, its anxious nightmarescape pulls Beau (Joaquin Phoenix) to an innerspace constructed of filial guilt, inadequacy, and his manifold failures as a man and a father. Its closest analogue is Synecdoche, New York, and I suspect this is the film Aster’s wanted to make all along before those pesky genre movies got in the way. As I’ve enjoyed hating Aster for hating his own films, it’s a shame this one is so good. Finally, there’s Takashi Yamazaki’s awe-inspiring Godzilla Minus One, the year’s grandest spectacle bar none, mixed with Japan’s sober reckoning with the horrors of war and the pieces of that atrocity they collectively own. Hayao Miyazaki has attempted the same sort of reckoning with his last two films (The Wind Rises and The Boy and the Heron), but while I’m a huge admirer of the former, I think the latter is done better here, in Japan’s hoariest metaphor for the trauma of WWII and the inherent confusion within of outrage and culpability. Is Godzilla friend or foe? Is he expression of righteousness or manifestation of justice against not only the Japanese, but also all of mankind? In a year where our viability as a civilized species has come under serious question, here is the answer in the resurrection of a golem from the deep. Civilization was always a lie we told to forgive our unrelieved savagery. The sequence where Godzilla bites a train and stands with three passenger cars hanging from his jaws like a duck carcass in a hunting dog’s mouth gives the lie to the idea any of us ever deserved the benefit of doubt. It’s the insect’s turn; we’ve had ours, and we made a real fucking hash of it. Five more romances for this block though only two are conventional: Asteroid City is focused on a widower and an actress but its heartache is built on the tragedy of a playwright’s lost muse, and They Cloned Tyrone is supercharged by the screwball interplay between a pimp and his charge. Even Yorgos Lanthimos’s Poor Things, wherein the untameable Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) learns all about her “place” in a male-dominated society from master-cocksmith Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) before destroying his ego with her independence and polyamorousness, takes a few, let’s say, nontraditional routes to get to its happily ever after. Rude and antisocial, it’s the third of three Frankenstein riffs from 2023 (after The Angry Black Girl and her Monster and Birth/Rebirth) that each reclaim Mary Shelley’s envelope-pushing activism from within the reanimated body of her work. Raine Allen Miller’s hyphenate debut, the charming, Jump Tomorrow–esque Rye Lane, thrusts the slightly drippy Dom (David Jonsson) together with bon vivant Yas (Vivian Oparah), both recently single after harrowing breakups. They fall in love as they walk and talk through vividly detailed sets in a London exploding with Jonathan Demme vibrancy and cultural specificity. You could spend days in the environments Miller creates here or in the company of Dom and Yas; you could spend several more unpacking the sociopolitical complexities buried in the text. Or you could simply let the joy of it wash over you, hand-in-hand with Peter Sohn’s no less exquisite Elemental, pairing a firecracker from the wrong side of the tracks with a sheltered, privileged young man who falls for her without considering the problems their mixed relationship might pose. The best romance of the year, it was marketed as a preachy kid romp about being yourself. It’s also one of 2023’s keenest immigrant melodramas, dealing as it does with first-generation entrepreneurs and the regulatory agencies that make their lives excruciating, if not outright impossible. It’s an instant classic, as is Juel Taylor’s They Cloned Tyrone, in which racial codes are explicated as literal science-fiction when a nefarious plot to craft an entire urban social system around stereotyped behaviours is discovered by pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx), one of his employees, Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), and a street tough, Fontaine (John Boyega), who takes care of a never-seen invalid mother while playing muscle for the local crime lord. Compare its Blaxploitation vibe, sense of fun, and sharp satirical slant against the blithe, retrograde racism of Gareth Edwards’s appalling The Creator for a sense of how great, how welcome, it is. Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City is science-fiction of an entirely different stripe and the first movie of his I’ve wholly connected with since The Darjeeling Limited. It accessed my grief for my mother’s death in the way Anderson’s films used to access my father’s death. Knowing nothing about Anderson’s life, I wonder if this was by accident or providence. It doesn’t matter. Asteroid City features one of the best performances of the year from Scarlett Johansson as an aging starlet recovering from a few bombs and maybe some abuse she’s having trouble camouflaging in the desert next to an atomic test site. Is there nuclear anxiety in the air in 2023? Is there ever. When apocalypse looms, it seems we collectively prick up our ears. Let’s see if it’s too late. You know where my money is. The five best films of 2023 begin with Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers, which I love unreasonably. Then Trenque Lauquen, Laura Citarella’s indescribable, incandescent two-part saga of obsessive love, monsters, and the end of the world. Everything 2023 is about, in other words, packaged in one four-hour odyssey in which two men in love with the same woman search for her across time and the unmarked Argentinian backcountry. The clues? A series of old letters hidden in random library books–love notes exchanged by two people long dead that gradually morph into documents of a relationship turned sour and possibly worse. The beauty of the film, though, is its refusal to behave. It’s not “slow” cinema because so much happens in it, but neither is it a breakneck thriller with something to solve. The mystery of the piece involves the peculiarities of the human heart: how we fall in love so helplessly that anything seems possible, then fall out of love so calamitously that the sun fails to rise. Trenque Lauquen is unclassifiable (if akin to a Márquez novel) and endlessly compelling. It’s wonderful. When Evil Lurks is savage, lawless; at the end, when our heroes saddle up to fight the Rotten, I felt like I always feel when Chief Brody, Quint, and Hooper board the Orca in Jaws. That’s right. Wim Wenders’s Perfect Days is about the grace of being okay when you’re not okay–about living out your days for the little things in defiance of the dismal tide. Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest is that dismal tide. 2023 was a marvellous year for the movies and an awful one for the human race. There’s a Presidential election in 2024, and one of the candidates will be an illiterate, authoritarian fascist who has already promised to complete the dismantling of every social guardrail in favour of a white-nationalist ethnostate as his first order of business. Things are about to get worse. 2024 will probably be a marvellous year for the movies, too. God help us all."

[Full review in Spanish]"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE," James Greenberg was formerly editor in chief of the DGA Quarterly, the craft journal of the Directors Guild of America. He was film critic for Los Angeles magazine and has written for The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, New Yorker and Entertainment Weekly. He started his career as a critic and reporter for Daily Variety. He is author of Roman Polanski: A Retrospective (Abrams), the only book of its kind that Polanski has ever participated in. Chances are that at some point in your youth a Godzilla film scared the hell out of you. From the first Godzilla film in 1954, and in numerous films after that, the fire breathing mutant dinosaur has been a symbol of Japan’s post-war despair while exploring themes of masculinity, guilt and shame. At its best, Godzilla was a monster with something more on its mind than wreaking havoc. And now at a time when the world is falling apart anew, “Godzilla Minus One,” written and directed by Japanese effects whiz Takashi Yamazaki, arrives as a thoughtful, stylish and entertaining addition to the canon. Although it serves essentially as a reboot of the original 1954 film, and is grounded in the traditions of the series, it stands on its own as a meticulously crafted piece of filmmaking. In fact, one need not care a whit about the history of Godzilla to enjoy this roller coaster ride. What makes the film so successful is not only the fireworks surrounding the monster but the care paid to the script and construction of characters. The emphasis on interpersonal relationships cleverly heightens the tension and impending danger. The film toggles back and forth between the mayhem of Godzilla’s attacks and the story of a family and community trying to recover from years of psychic and physical devastation. Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a young kamikaze pilot in the closing days of the war who doesn’t want to die for a lost cause. After faking engine trouble and landing his fighter jet on a remote island for repairs, he spends the rest of the film battling not only the fire-breathing dragon but his own personal demons. Since everyone knows what Godzilla looks like, Yamazaki is not coy about revealing the width and breathe of his creation. Starting with a brief flash of light from an Atomic bomb test in the Atolls, the monster emerges as some kind of deep-sea prehistoric dinosaur, a walking nuclear device. In the first few minutes of the film, the monster comes out of the water breathing fire and kills most of the population of the island where Koichi has landed. Instead of escaping the war, he has brought it with him. Faced with a chance to gun down Godzilla, Koichi chokes again and does nothing. Back in an already ravaged Tokyo, Koichi learns that his parents have perished as the city prepares for the arrival of Godzilla. Wide-eyed, panic-stricken people flee the onslaught in well-staged crowd scenes of chaos and destruction. Tokyo is no match for a 164-foot monster of unbridled rage. Godzilla picks up subway cars and sends them flying as if they were toy trains (which they probably were). But the wild action never seems hokey, befitting Yamazaki’s standing as one of Japan’s top special effects artists. Accompanied by the dramatic strings and pulsating rhythms of Naoki Satô’s score, spikes pop out of Godzilla’s spine as it shoots blue rays of fire that explode in mushroom clouds. After the pandemonium, Yamazaki adeptly ratchets down the tension and switches gears to a domestic story. Koichi becomes the de facto guardian of a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), and an infant girl she has inherited from her dying mother. The trio comes together in a makeshift family, but despite his affection for Noriko and the baby girl, Koichi is too wracked with humiliation and PTSD to embrace the relationship. He has other matters to settle first; his war is not yet over. How can a society that has been crushed from its wartime experience rouse itself to fight again against Godzilla? An official government response or help from Japan’s allies is out of the question because of the cold war complexity of American-Soviet relations. Yamazaki clearly doesn’t have much faith in official channels. If there is a solution, it must come from a grassroots effort of citizens banning together to fight for their survival. Just as Kochi must find himself after the war, Japan as a nation must reclaim its identity to defeat Godzilla. So a rag-tag collection of resourceful army veterans, including a reluctant Kochi, comes together to save the day since no one else will do it for them. By default, it’s “the useless to the rescue.” Then in a rousing finale on the open sea, Kochi has to literally fly into the belly of the beast to finally purge his dishonor. “Godzilla Minus One” manages to function on a number of levels. It’s a cautionary tale and social commentary on nuclear weapons and other natural disasters threatening the future of the world. At the same time, this iteration of Godzilla is a masterful popcorn movie with heart. What is perhaps even more remarkable is the fact that the film was made for the miniscule budget, by Hollywood standards, of $15 million. As producers like to boast in Hollywood, every penny is up on the screen. And in this case, it actually is."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,GODZILLA MINUS ONE quintessentially demonstrates how modern blockbusters can be a giant epic with mesmerizing characters and themes&#46;
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE," For context, I've seen a few of the American Godzilla movies, but I've always felt like I should enjoy Godzilla, and Kaiju (giant monster) movies in general, more than I actually do. I have no real connection with these movies and may well have skipped right past Godzilla Minus One as I wasn't asked to review it by my editor at News 24 were it not for the exceptionally good reviews and enthusiastic word-of-mouth. And let me tell you, the glowing reception to the film could not be more deserved: I was blown away by this truly brilliant film. I may not be a major fan of the approximately seven million Godzilla films that have come out since 1954, but even I know that a large part of what made the original Japanese version of the film such a hit was that it was about a giant lizard monster rampaging through Japan, yes, but it was also a metaphor for post-war Japan entering the nuclear age. Godzilla Minus One, which is set directly after the second world war (the title refers to Japan being at its lowest - or at ""zero"" - after its defeat and complicity in the war, with the appearance of Godzilla dragging them even lower: or to ""minus one"") follows that trend by being a thrilling movie about a giant lizard monster, yes, but also a tale steeped in themes as rich as survivor's guilt, Japan's rejection of its Bushido death-warrior code, and the effects of war on innocent civilians.  Post-war Japan is fascinating in and of itself and it serves as a timely message for a certain conflict happening right now in the world as a people defeated in war and occupied by their victors, rejected violence and worked with those very occupiers to build a thriving nation that is still the envy of most of the world, and when filtered through the layers of metaphor and allegory in a film as vibrant, heartfelt and, yes, fun as Godzilla Minus One it infuses matters of historical interest with a serious emotional charge. In short, Godzilla is a far more substantive film than many, perhaps even most of the big ""serious"" awards contenders being released now. Certainly, in comparison to Ferrari, which I saw the day before and my review of it should be up on News 24 any minute now, it has infinitely more depth and substance to it. But, even with that said, this is still a giant monster movie and just on that level, it's a rip-roaring success that puts the Hollywood ""monsterverse"" to absolute shame - and, for that matter, Hollywood in general. It has human characters that you genuinely care about (unlike so many monster movies where they're mostly just there as cannon fodder), a killer score, nail-biting action set pieces, epic sound design, and stunning visuals. Godzilla himself has also never been better realized than he is here as this genuinely monstrous force of nature, nor has the scale and totality of the destruction wrought on everything he comes in contact with been so brutally depicted, especially in terms of his famed atomic ""light ray"".  That this was all done on a $15 million budget is especially astounding and just makes something like the Flash with its $200 million budget and pre-Terminator-looking special effects all that more of an embarrassment on fiscal waste. Obviously, this lacks big Hollywood stars (though these really very good actors may be huge in Japan), but if Hollywood wants to end the trend of massive flops that have been plaguing the industry for the past couple of years, they should really look here for inspiration. Regardless, I simply cannot recommend Godzilla Minus One enough. And of course, this goes without saying, it should absolutely be seen at the cinema. Even if you don't like subtitles. Or, for that matter, silly monster movies. It's brilliant."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I never expected to be so emotionally attached to Godzilla but this hard hitting character driven story completely captured my full attention from the very beginning to the end&#46; I can&#8217;t stress enough how excellent the character development is&#33;

"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE," Somehow, my father knew I’d be drawn to the horror genre even before it was completely evident to me — or perhaps he instilled my love for classic horror movies. He grew up during the golden age of Universal Monsters: He was 7 years old when both “Dracula” and “Frankenstein” debuted in theaters, and over the next few years, he would have seen “The Mummy,” “Island of Lost Souls,” “The Invisible Man,” “The Bride of Frankenstein” and “Werewolf of London,” among others. He also would have seen RKO’s “King Kong.” So, it is no surprise that he encouraged me to watch “Creature Feature” when it premiered in 1973 on WTOG in the Tampa Bay market. Hosted by Dr. Paul Bearer — as portrayed by Dick Bennick Sr. — the locally produced series presented all of those classic horror films on Saturday afternoons. It’s also no surprise he bought me a copy of “Monsters on the Prowl,” issue 29, in 1975, featuring the cover story “A Monster at My Window! with art by Jack Kirby. And it’s no surprise he chose, as my first model kit, Aurora’s glow-in-the-dark Godzilla. When my father was searching for a name for his new sailboat, I suggested “Calico,” the name of the research vessel in the 1978 Hanna-Barbera animated series “Godzilla.” The name stuck. Godzilla first appeared in the 1954 Japanese epic kaiju film directed by Ishirō Honda. Two years later, the Americanized version premiered in U.S. theaters. Titled “Godzilla, King of the Monsters!”, the film featured original footage produced by Toho Co. Ltd., along with new footage produced by Jewell Enterprises. In addition to cast members from the original, the American adaptation adds Raymond Burr as journalist Steve Martin. The original film spawned a media franchise that has flourished for decades. Godzilla has been showcased in more than 30 feature films. A pop culture icon and internationally recognized intellectual property, the character has also appeared in television series, novels, comic books, manga, and video games. To mark the franchise’s 70th anniversary, Toho Studios and Robot Communications released “Godzilla Minus One” in Japan on Nov. 3. Toho's American subsidiary Toho International released the film in North American on Dec. 1 with English subtitles. By way of disclaimer, I reiterate: I am a lifelong fan of horror and Godzilla holds a special place in my heart because the character is intertwined with my childhood memories. Having said that, my recommendation is that you immediately purchase tickets to see “Godzilla Minus One” in theaters, even if you have never seen a Godzilla movie and are unfamiliar with the franchise. For those of you who have seen a Godzilla film — from the Shōwa era Toho iterations to the recent American films produced by Legendary Pictures, such as 2019’s “Godzilla: King of Monsters” or 2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong” — approach this new film with the understanding that it is different than anything you have come to expect from a kaiju movie. “Godzilla Minus One” is a surprisingly emotional story, delving deep into relatable themes focusing on the human spirit and survival in times of uncertainty and tragedy. Profoundly resonant and candidly expressive in its condemnation of war and epistemic hubris, the films succeed at something many films in the franchise fail to do: It makes you care about the well-being of its central characters. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, “Godzilla Minus One” opens in 1945 in the closing days of World War II. Kamikaze Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), separates from his squadron and lands on Odo Island, claiming technical issues. In fact, he has chosen to disobey orders because he does not want to die. The mechanics on the island find nothing wrong with the plane, and the lead mechanic Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) guesses Kōichi’s true motive. That night, Godzilla comes ashore and attacks the island outpost. Only Kōichi and Sōsaku survive, with the mechanic blaming the pilot for the deaths of his friends. In postwar Japan, Kōichi takes refuge in the ruins of Tokyo. His parents died in the war, leaving him alone. He reluctantly takes in Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a refugee, who is caring for an infant whose parents were killed in the bombing of Tokyo. Kōichi gradually accepts responsibility for his found family, but he is unable to explore his feelings of affection for them because he is ashamed of what he perceives as his cowardice. Burdened by survivor’s guilt and tormented by post-traumatic stress disorder, Kōichi still manages to find work as a minesweeper, allowing him to support Noriko and Akiko (Sae Nagatani). With the country still reeling from defeat in the war, Godzilla — now mutated by U.S. atomic tests at Bikini Atoll — reemerges and goes on the offensive. After destroying several U.S. naval vessels, the monster targets the Japanese mainland. The United States refuses to commit military support because it fears it would exacerbate existing tensions with the Soviet Union. Instead, the Americans ask the Japanese government to deal with the situation, even though the Imperial Japanese Navy was decommissioned after the war. When the Japanese government fails to defend the country, a small group of civilians and Naval veterans must formulate a plan that involves Kōichi and his friends from the minesweeping crew. Stopping Godzilla seems like an impossible task — but living in postwar Japan is an equally arduous endeavor. For Kōichi, living is a constant struggle with a range of physical, psychological, and existential challenges to overcome. He is grieving, consumed by unwarranted but inescapable guilt, and regretful. The viewer empathizes with his anguish, hoping he will overcome the effects of trauma. “Godzilla Minus One” is an epic historical drama set in a country devastated by World War II, underscoring the inhumanity of war. It balances sentiment and spectacle, often making Godzilla an incidental aspect of the fight to endure. It is an inspirational redemption tale with well-developed characters that convey the essential elements of the human condition: mortality, anxiety, aspiration, and responsibility. Oh, and Godzilla is absolutely terrifying. Vividly rendered, the monster is the epitome of violent, catastrophic annihilation. Godzilla is an allegory for destruction, sometimes symbolic of the wrath of nature or the horror of war. Here, the monster works as both a metaphor for unresolved trauma as well as anticipatory anxiety in a world increasingly gripped by chaos, despair, and tyranny. “Godzilla Minus One” posits that even in the most desperate times, there is reason for hope."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla Minus One is not only one of the best monster movies -- it's one of the best movies of 2023, period."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE," “The Holdovers,” directed by Alexander Payne (“The Descendants”) and shot in Massachusetts, took the top prize, best film, and three others: best actor (Paul Giamatti), best supporting actress (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) and best original screenplay (David Hemingson). The crowd-pleasing dramedy stars Giamatti as a bitter boarding-school teacher forced to spend the winter holiday break with students. “The Zone of Interest,” a devastatingly understated Holocaust drama focusing on the everyday family life of Rudolf Hoss (Christian Friedel), commandant of the Auschwitz concentration and death camp, earned three awards: best non-English language film, and best director and best adapted screenplay for Jonathan Glazer (“Under the Skin”). Of all of the award choices, the one that pleased me the most was Lily Gladstone getting best actress for “Killers of the Flower Moon.” To my mind, Gladstone’s less-is-much-much-more work in the epic Martin Scorsese drama was the cinematic highlight of the year (and I said as much during the BSFC discussion). My second favorite winner: Celine Song, best new filmmaker for “Past Lives.” “Killers of the Flower Moon” also picked up awards for best original score (Robbie Robertson) and best editing (Thelma Schoonmaker). Other winners: Ryan Gosling (“Barbie”), best supporting actor; Jonathan Ricquebourg (“The Taste of Things”), best cinematography; “Geographies of Solitude,” best documentary; “The Boy and the Heron,” best animated film; and “Oppenheimer,” best ensemble cast. The BSFC has 25 members, including such noted critics as Ty Burr, Joyce Kulhawik, Gerald Peary, Peter Keough, Betsy Sherman and James Verniere. Dana Barbuto and I serve as the group’s co-presidents. It’s weird: With so many movies to see in such a short amount of time during award season, it doesn’t leave much time for many critics to actually write about them. I know of critics who have taken a vacation week in order to keep up. Sometimes they’ll watch three or four movies – maybe more – in a day. (It’s the same with film festivals, by the way. My record is five in a day – and one of the movies had a running time of over three hours.) After all, there were more than 1,000 films that qualified for BSFC award consideration this year, and it’s not the first time that’s happened. And it all comes to a head in late November/early December, when in-theater advance screenings, and “For Your Consideration” discs and links, arrive like an avalanche.

"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE," There's too many new movies during this time of year for simply one podcast feed! You have been asking for it, so it's yours, VIPs! Let's talk GODZILLA MINUS ONE!"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Godzilla film I&apos;ve ever seen&#46; A fantastic film about people and a nation learning to move forward&#46;  It just happens to have Godzilla as the main villain&#46;  And as a villain&#44; he&apos;s the most vicious Godzilla I&apos;ve ever seen&#46; 
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE," GODZILLA: MINUS ONE returns to the original, post-war iteration of the iconic kaiju. Not with the special effects that bring the mountainous monster to life, but rather with the zeitgeist of those times fueled by the sense of futility over the war just lost, and the conviction that the government had betrayed its people. As is to be expected, Godzilla wreaks havoc and cuts a wide swath of destruction through Tokyo, but the film by Takashi Yamazaki is centered on people coming to grips with the after-effects of a lost war, using Godzilla as a metaphor and manifestation of the angst afflicting a devastated population. Instead of the noir-esque black-and-white of the original, though, we are treated to the saturated color of the period films, all the better to enjoy the blue-light Godzilla emits when revving up for the kill. We are in the last days of World War II when a kamikaze pilot, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) develops mechanical problems with his aircraft. Landing at the military outpost on Odo Island for repairs, he is confronted by something much worse than the prospect of committing suicide for his country. That would be the ancient creature that stalks out of the ocean. Instead of using is plane’s artillery to stop it, he freezes, leading to the death of almost everyone else at the outpost, and saddling him with the sort of survivor’s guilt that will prohibit a return to life as he knew it when Japan surrenders. Not that he is left on the sidelines. A chance encounter with a thief (Minami Hamabe) struggling to survive in the ruins of Tokyo gifts him with an instant family. The thief, Noriko, is a plucky young woman orphaned by the war is caring for an infant given to her by the child’s dying mother. Together they band together to cope with a post-war economy in shreds, living in the ruins of Koichi’s home where his  parents burned to death, and under the angry scrutiny of the only surviving neighbor (Sakura Ando) who blames Koichi for the deaths of her children because he did not do his job in the war properly. Godzilla doesn’t return again until the atomic tests on the Bikini Atoll in 1946, when the creature awakens, bigger, meaner, and more weaponized than ever. During this time, Koichi has settled into a platonic domestic routine with Noriko and baby Akika, and he’s finally found a job that can allow them to rebuild their lives. This being a gloss on the lingering aftereffects of war, it’s a job clearing the tens of thousands of mines left behind by both sides in the ocean surrounding Japan. It’s dangerous work, but not fatal. His crewmates are an ex-sailor (Kuranosuke Sasaki) with a profound contempt for government orders, a former Naval engineer (Hidetaka Yoshioka) with a frothy hairstyle and a lighthearted spirit that hides his true feelings, and a young man (Munetaka Aoki) who despairs that he was not able to fight for his country. When Godzilla makes a bee-line for Tokyo, the government once again falls short of protecting its citizens, and the tiny boat tasked with safely detonating mines finds itself in the center of the battle to save Japan. This, too, is a metaphor as Yamazaki spins a tale of selflessness and cooperation while also delivering a damning manifesto against violence in the way Godzilla reacts to the weapons used against him. They just makes him more powerful. Special kudos to the way the spikes on his back glow and then, ahem, stiffen as he prepares to unleash his oral heat ray of destruction, and how the effects folk acknowledge that a creature that large will move with deliberation, but not alacrity on land. The action sequences are expertly directed to keep you one the edge of your seat, and the solution to the Godzilla problem is not just in keeping with the film’s anti-violence stance, but is also a nifty bit of science. Real nifty. Sure, the big guy is impressive to watch, tossing battleships like javelins and, of course, ravaging Tokyo, but the real action is people recovering from the traumas, collective and individual, of the war. Kamiki is just as impressive as any of the special effects with a performance of depth, tenderness, and pathos. He is also a man of exceptional beauty, which adds to the metaphors at work, pitting the beauty of life against sacrifices both meaningless and heroic. And it makes his defensive cruelty to those closest to him all the more poignant. GODZILLA MINUS ONE is one of the more effective anti-war films, even before the kid complains that he’s never seen battle and is told that it’s something of which he should be proud, Yamazaki makes his case that fighting to the death is nothing compared to fighting for the future. Wise words and a film as weighty and entertaining as Godzilla himself."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s the most wonderful time of the year! That’s right: movie awards season, and I’ve been busy watching some of the most enticing films that remain on the 2023 docket and submitting my ballots for the few critics groups that will have me as a member. Those obligations have left me precious little time to actually write the damn things up, but I wanted to offer a few brief thoughts on some of the best offerings currently in theaters — all of which happen to be foreign language films. With its weird and wonderful tale of a boy grieving the loss of his mother via an adventure in a parallel universe, The Boy and the Heron thrives thanks to the top-shelf imagination that only writer/director Hayao Miyazaki can deliver. Masaki Suda’s quirky, expressive voice work as The Grey Heron should be up for awards and the work itself will hopefully win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature for the stunning visuals and themes of passing the torch, which feel especially poignant considering where the filmmaker is in his career. It’s a fitting farewell for Miyazaki — but then we said the same thing about The Wind Rises a decade ago. Writer/director Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One is a good Godzilla movie, which means it’s a good action movie, but awarding it additional laurels would be generous. The focus on “failed” kamikaze pilot Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) who seeks to restore his honor and forms an unconventional family with some fellow survivors offers decent human drama and something to care about as the big lizard keeps disrupting Shikishima’s rebuilding process. But those interruptions are the main draw and they mostly deliver in the thrills department — certainly more than Hollywood’s subpar MonsterVerse efforts over the past decade. With such a solid foundation in place, Godzilla Minus One sticks its landing with a satisfying emotional climax, but Yamazaki doesn’t know when to fade to black and tacks on a manipulative and, frankly, implausible — even in a Godzilla movie — second ending that negates much of the would-be ending’s richness. Yûji Sakamoto’s script presents a Rashomon-like scenario, but one that stretches into numerous situations to show how incorrect conclusions can be reached despite the best intentions. The results are cumulatively devastating — and bringing tissues with you to the theater is highly recommended. Six years after one of the few times he’s come up short — the so-so The Other Side of Hope — the Finnish writer/director returns to form with Fallen Leaves, an 81-minute (including credits!) marvel in which lonely Helsinki loners Ansa (Alma Pöysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) attempt to share hearts despite (and because of) their quirks. Imbued with Kaurismäki’s copy-written deadpan charms, these lovable lovers traverse the frustrations of manual labor jobs and find relief through life’s simple pleasures — much like we poor souls seek solace in the filmmakers’ beautiful slice-of-life dramas."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE," Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the character, director Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One has become an international hit, and the most successful live action Japanese film in history at the American box office. But does this latest addition to the Kaiju genre live up to the hype? It takes place just after World War 2, with Japan reeling from its loss to the Allied Forces. Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) stars as a former kamikaze pilot, living with survivor’s guilt after avoiding death and surviving the first attack from Godzilla.  If you are confused as to whether this has any connection to Apple’s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters show, or next year’s Godzilla x Kong sequel, it doesn’t. The character Godzilla exists in two franchises: the original Japanese movies made by studio Toho, and the American English-language adaptations, made by Legendary Studios, referred to as the MonsterVerse. While the Hollywood versions are financially successful, few enthusiasts would put those films over the Japanese incarnations. Godzilla works best in Japan because, ever since the original, it has been linked to Japanese identity. The first film in 1954 represented post-War nuclear panic, felt keenly by the nation that suffered the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings. Seventy years later, Yamazaki delivers something more contemplative, with Shikishima’s journey one of shame and regret at having chosen living defeat over a glorious death.  That’s not to say that the set pieces are an afterthought. With around a tenth of the budget of the Hollywood films, Yamazaki creates kaiju attacks that feel devastating. It’s as much about the people fleeing in terror from each booming step as it is the ferocity of Godzilla itself, and while the action scenes are more sporadic than you might expect, every face-off means something.  Ryunosuke Kamiki, a former child actor who was discovered by Studio Ghibli legend Hayao Miyazaki, is gripping in the lead role. His trauma, as well as the unspoken longing for partner Noriko (Minami Hamabe), add layers to the story that keep the two-hour running time breeze by. Much of the supporting cast have little to do other than plan attacks, although Yuki Yamada stands out as a young crewman looking to prove himself. "
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE," Hollywood continues to trash the kaiju-eiga genre with such wildly expensive but so-so monster flicks as Godzilla x Kong. Toho Studios, which codified the form in 1953 with Ishiro Honda’s Godzilla (then arguably ruined it with 28 monster sequels and odd licensing arrangements) has, of late, been determined to do justice to its biggest star. This is not merely a rubber monster suit or its CGI equivalent. Godzilla Minus One not only matches the potent regeneration of the worldwide 2016 hit Shin Godzilla, its innovative, meaningful engagement with the big scaly monster of the title is jollied along by historical depth and exciting set pieces. The enduring quality of the 1953 original is rooted in its engagement with the twin atomic disasters of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. This prequel, similarly, yokes American imperialism, postwar malaise, survivor guilt and weaponised atomic power to produce the best action film of the year. Godzilla opens on a remote South Pacific island where a young kamikaze pilot, Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), sensing defeat, pretends his engine is malfunctioning. He is already racked with guilt, and the sudden and murderous appearance of the titular lizard leaves him with an emotional weight he ferries back to a ruined Tokyo, where he forms a makeshift if emotionally distant family with an orphaned young woman (Minami Hamabe) and a baby she found in the rubble. It’s a poignant vignette that is soon enlivened by entertaining counterfactuals. Godzilla, now powered by the Bikini Atoll tests, rises from the deep to do untold damage to recovering Tokyo in 1953. Shikishima, now a scavenger with a band of scientists and seafarers, must reckon with the scaly beast. As with Honda’s original, CGI is eclipsed by clever cinema grammar: a flick of the tail here, bang goes the neighbourhood there. Takashi Yamazaki’s urgent script – written against a backdrop of Covid-related governmental distrust – adds gravitas to the thrills and spills."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godzilla is the draw, but equally at the wild and monstrous heart of this movie is a surprisingly optimistic exploration of PTSD, shame, survivor’s guilt, and how we are all more than the worst things we’ve ever done."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE," I’ve spent the past two days making graphics and getting things ready for today’s GWNYFCA nomination announcement. Everything will start tweeting out around 10:00am EST like usual and then go live on the website. The change this year is that the winners will be announced in-person for the first time at the Dryden Theatre in Rochester on 1/6/24. Should be a cool change of pace. The deadline for Top Tens at The Film Stage was extended until after Christmas, so I’m hoping to watch a couple more foreign films I’ve missed this weekend just in case they want to sneak in. I do need to also start (and finish) my Top Ten Movie Posters of 2023, though. So, I don’t know what I’ll be able to get done. The plan is at least two of these newly shortlisted Oscar picks: PERFECT DAYS, THE TASTE OF THINGS, THE PROMISED LAND, GODLAND, SOCIETY OF THE SNOW, and TOTEM. And, speaking of that shortlist, what a travesty that KOKOMO CITY didn’t make the cut. I truly thought it was a guarantee. Thankfully, FOUR DAUGHTERS did make it. That’s my #1 doc of the year so far and it just hit VOD today, so now is your chance to watch it too. If watching Andrew Haigh's ALL OF US STRANGERS isn't enough to leave you speechless, try reading the synopsis of the novel by Taichi Yamada that he adapted. My first reaction was to laugh because it's such a stark departure in tone and genre. But then I started to think about it more. I started to see the correlations between what the couple is doing to Yamada's protagonist and what they're doing to Haigh's counterpart. Both ""take"" something. The difference—beyond morphing the physical into the emotional—is that Haigh's are also giving something back. Adam (Andrew Scott) needs it too. Not just because his screenwriter is mired in a bout of writer's block while dealing with the nuisances of living in an almost empty, brand new apartment complex in London. But because he's never been able to shake the loneliness that has consumed him since his parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy) died thirty years ago in a car crash. We can see the sadness in his eyes. And then there's the fear and embarrassment that replace it when Harry (Paul Mescal) knocks on his door. Adam knows isolation. He's comfortable with its pain. To dare to love and risk losing it again? There's nothing scarier. These heavy emotions mix with nostalgia to put him on a train back to his childhood home. The point is to confront the memories. To reconcile who he was with who he is and find a pathway forward. What he discovers instead is an opportunity to drift backwards—to loosen his grip on closure by distracting himself from the resurfacing grief via an impossible fantasy that will only leave him hurting more. Because who should greet him at the door but his Mum and Dad, neither having aged a day since their fateful crash. They know they're dead and they know Adam is their son. They can't wait to find out about the man he's become. The film hinges entirely on Scott's performance as a result. Not just with his parents and the potential that arrives from telling them everything he couldn't growing up (including that he's gay), but also with the blossoming romance opposite Harry. What begins with awkward shyness gradually opens with a newfound confidence and desire for exploration. It's as though Adam has shed decades of baggage from his shoulders through the regular visits he shares with his parents. There's increased clarity, excitement, and energy that he pours into his work and relationship. He's somehow become whole. But at what cost? If this was Yamada's original, Adam would be paying with his soul. Haigh takes a different route. He, admittedly, moves more towards the metaphysical rather than the supernatural. Because the longer Adam stays with his parents, the harder it becomes to reclaim the life he has built. Their presence becomes a crutch now as much as their absence did then. It pushes him outside of his comfort zone in both good ways and bad since the closure he needs has less to do with having them around then it does with having the chance to willingly let them go. It's a devastating revelation made more so by three absolutely devastating performances from Scott, Bell, and Foy. And just as he must accept the truth of what has happened to them, so too must he accept his own truth and the choices he's made. Between his parents and Harry, he's finally escaped a self-inflected exile of body and mind—an evolution that comes with its own fresh dangers. The hope then is that these experiences have better prepared him for new tragedies. That hindsight and recognition have allowed him to understand he doesn't have to feel guilty for surviving. Yes, it's sad. Yes, he's sorry he couldn't save them. But it doesn't mean he's not worthy of living just because they weren't given the chance. It all leads to a heartbreaking finale that's less a shock because you weren't expecting it than it is for knowing and dreading that it was always coming. Haigh beautifully handles the narrative progressions to ensure he doesn't have to jump through hoops distracting us from a truth hidden in plain sight. He knows how to use his script to prevent us from asking questions, but it never feels manipulative. We are simply too caught up in the endorphin release to consider what else is going on until Adam himself is ready. It doesn't make it any less crushing, but it does provide hope. Hope that Adam can embrace that which he had and not simply lament that which he's lost. I really liked the final 25-30 minutes of the new cinematic musical iteration of THE COLOR PURPLE. I think it handles the themes of forgiveness and generational trauma much better than Steven Spielberg’s adaptation and drives home the emotional weight of what Celie’s happily-ever-after truly means in context with the horrors she endured the four decades prior. The first-two hours, though? A freight train of a Cliff’s Notes cram session that seems to slap you in the face to look somewhere else whenever a dramatic moment implores you to take a pause. Marcus Gardley’s script simply doesn’t have time for introspection. Maybe I shouldn’t have watched the 1984 version the day before because having its pace and care in my memory made the speed at which this one travels untenable. I wasn’t therefore surprised to read this isn’t actually a strict translation of the stage musical. So much so that it credits that Tony Award-winning production after Alice Walker’s original novel as another source of inspiration rather than a part of the screenplay itself. Removing thirteen songs and reworking the narrative will do that. I only wonder then how much better Marsha Norman’s Broadway book is and whether it gives the subject matter the room it needs to breathe. Even so, Fantasia Barrino and Danielle Brooks are great reprising their roles. The pacing might refuse to give them their moment to shine and emote before cutting to the next scene, but their impact is definitely felt nonetheless. Colman Domingo and Corey Hawkins are really good too with Taraji P. Henson doing her best to elevate a crucial role that’s sadly been reduced to little more than “muse” and “ride out of Dodge.” So, while director Blitz Bazawule gives the production a welcome kinetic style, it comes at the detriment of the whole. The finished result remains solid enough to be a worthwhile experience, but I’d probably spend the money to see a touring production of the original musical at my local theater before watching it again. The movie FERRARI is a good metaphor for the vehicles Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver) created. Beautiful. Sleek. Powerful. But, most importantly, a soulless machine. From the very start of Michael Mann's film, we learn that life is complex. That despite all our best efforts, ambitions, fears, and hopes, we are beholden to the world around us. All it takes is one unfortunate misstep to ruin everything and the only way to survive that existential crisis of mortality is to steel oneself from ever letting the emotional fallout of such inevitable tragedies change your course. That seems to be the lesson in Troy Kennedy Martin's script (adapted from Brock Yates biography). Yes, men like Enzo can mourn their friends in private. In their minds. But to show weakness in public is a death sentence. So, they delude themselves into believing they have some grand purpose beyond simply enjoying life and loving their families. They talk about legacy and pride and how fear is a liability rather than a strength. Fear will get you killed, but hubris will make you a martyr. A hero. And yet that lack of fear is what gets Enzo into so much trouble. He doesn't worry about hurting his wife and business partner Laura (Penélope Cruz is very good) when starting an affair with Lina Lardi (Shailene Woodley) during the war. His conscience didn't stop him. His humanity didn't make him question his actions. He deserved to be happy at the expense of those who loved him. He deserved to do whatever he wanted while making sure they couldn't. Their actions had to take his success into consideration and his didn't need to worry about their sorrow. It's the same with his drivers. His employees. The press. Everyone is a pawn. Even his own bastard son who wants nothing more than to take his name for his Confirmation. How will that affect the Ferrari brand? How will it affect Laura's state of mind and thus the Ferrari brand? How will needing to think about it distract Enzo from the impending Mille Miglia race and thus the need to inject capital into the company and thus the Ferrari brand? That's what matters. That's what motivates his every move. Those brief moments of honesty and compassion tussling young Piero's (Giuseppe Festinese) hair? Exceptions proving the rule. Does FERRARI use this truth that's baked into its very DNA to judge or comment on it, though? No. And that, to me, is a mistake. By not showing the actions of this callous, one-track-minded legend of racing, sports cars, and Italy itself with purpose, it condones them. It says men in his position are allowed to act that way because they employ thousands of people and thus carry the burden of forsaking their humanity to make money. Who thinks that's a worthwhile message for today's world? A man on the brink of bankruptcy leveraging those in his control to stay solvent by letting them die to achieve that goal? Sorry, but no. I felt nothing for him. Nothing for his company. And, by extension, nothing for the central race. The stakes are shifted off the racers. Off victory. Off everything but whether Ferrari will prove marketable enough to stay afloat. So, Gabriel Leone, Patrick Dempsey, and Jack O'Connell are mere afterthoughts. More pawns to a story that attempts to draw a through line between unavoidable tragedy and negligent tragedy as though someone like Enzo Ferrari could ever comprehend the depth of emotion found via the comparison beyond empty words. Dino dies? Long live the new son. A racer dies? Resumés from replacements abound. Bystanders die simply wanting to admire Enzo's creations? How much money will it take to forgive, forget, and let him risk doing it again? The answer is zero. We love our entertainment and vicarious fantasies way too much to hold anyone in power accountable. We'd rather give them glacially paced Oscar-bait biopics that pretend cold callousness is a trait of greatness rather than evil. It’s more a movie with Godzilla than a Godzilla movie as the monster himself is an afterthought. Not because Japan has seen him before, but because the war has them feeling so defeated that their first reaction upon seeing him is “Here we go again.” And that’s where GODZILLA MINUS ONE stands out. It’s not a unique movie and the pacing is very slow with little plot propulsion beyond “We need to stop Godzilla without anyone’s help because tensions remain high between the US and USSR, but thank goodness the handful of characters we introduced to you are just the right people to do so,” but the central nihilism is refreshing. Because it’s not about revenge. Or the bomb. Or outside interference at all. It’s about all the ways Japan let the Japanese down itself. Government secrets. Sending men to die as kamikazes. Leaving the poor helpless. Takashi Yamazaki is pulling no punches where patriotism is concerned, shifting the focus from sacrificing yourself for country to sacrificing yourself for future generations who shouldn’t have to become cannon fodder like they did. I don’t necessarily think the human-interest stuff works perfectly—time passes so quickly that conflict overshadows emotion every single time—but it has for others. As for the monster itself: this Godzilla is pretty cool with its charged-up heat ray. And it does look great for having a sub-15-million-dollar budget. But don’t tell me it looks like a 300-million-dollar budget because it certainly does not. This was shot very particularly to stretch that cash and often reminded me of SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW aesthetically. The real lesson isn’t about making a little money look good, though. The lesson is that you don’t need a lot of money to be good. It’s just too much for a two-hour movie. Writer/director Sean Durkin had to literally erase one of the Von Erich brothers from history because adding another tragic demise (especially one so close to that of a different brother) would be too redundant to the pacing of the film. The dominoes fall so quickly that it’s also easy to forget these are grown men with wives and families and not just young boys going to war in the ring for Dad. Because giving any of them three-dimensions besides Kevin (Zac Efron) would add five more hours. With all that being said, however, THE IRON CLAW proves about as effective as it could due to Durkin’s juggling act between history and narrative propulsion. The idea is to center Kevin (for obvious reasons). He’s the supposed heir to the “Iron Claw” throne built by his toxically domineering father Fritz (Holt McCallany) who’s the size of a house with an even bigger heart. As Doris’ (Maura Tierney) eldest surviving son, Kevin becomes a sort of secondary father figure to his brothers. The compassionate ear to oppose their father’s (doubling as employer) demands. We understand this dynamic pretty early on thanks to youngest (because Chris is removed) brother Mike (Stanley Simons). He plays the guitar and skips workout sessions. He enjoys watching Kevin and David (Harris Dickinson) wrestle, but wants nothing to do with it himself—a fact his older brother sees and appreciates despite Dad’s refusal. But Kevin doesn’t really have a say. No one does besides Fritz and even he pretends he doesn’t if the words he should say don’t help reach his goal of NWA supremacy. Ask either parent to open their eyes and see what’s really happening and they shrug while saying, “You boys work it out yourselves.” It’s a mantra Kevin takes to heart. One that forces him to feel guilt when bodies start falling. And it’s not because he finds love (Lily James’ Pam) to ground him (I mean, it is since the others don’t get their real-life relationships on-screen). It’s because he sees the truth while also embracing his role. So, when David replaces him at the top of the pecking order, Kevin gets mad at the situation rather than the man. When Kerry (Jeremy Allen White) does the same, rinse and repeat. Where those more polished public speakers crave the limelight, Kevin simply wants familial success. He feels responsible for it … as well as the defeats. Efron is very good in the role even if his character is caught in a cycle that demands he grieve, rage, and reset over and over again. If not for McCallany and Tierney’s dedication to blindly absolving themselves of their own complicity, the drama would become even more repetitive than it already does thanks to the truncated length in which it tries to give depth to such a sprawling series of unfortunate events sparked by drugs, ambition, and the warped desire to make Daddy proud. Because even though we feel each death through Kevin’s pain, we never get to truly sit with it before the next one falls. So, think of this as a good distillation of a much larger tale. Durkin whets our appetite for the example of legacy’s insidious hold on a family’s pursuit of greatness at the cost of their happiness that exists if someone could do it justice in a miniseries that allows each brother his own episode to detail the specific ways in which the pressure became too much to bear. As it is now, THE IRON CLAW is an abridged depiction of a “curse” as self-fulfilling prophecy rather than a dissection of that curse’s origins. It’s enough to move audiences, showcase Efron, and ignite Google searches to discover the everything left out. Everyone tells Sylvia (Jessica Chastain) that what she remembers from her childhood never happened. Everyone tells Saul (Peter Sarsgaard) that what he’s forgotten did. She tries her best to stay locked in her apartment with teenage daughter Anna (Brooke Timber) so as to avoid the cruel world. He tries to escape his locked home with brother Isaac (Josh Charles) to experience it. So, of course they find themselves on a collision course in Michel Franco’s latest film MEMORY. That they do so at a high school reunion is even more on-the-nose considering the whole evening is about nostalgia and remembrance. Like Sylvia’s sister Olivia (Merritt Wever), Saul attends to let those moments flood back while Sylvia does her best to remain unnoticed and thus not risk being triggered by faces that will surely take her back to one of the most harrowing periods of her life. So, when Saul sits down next to her without saying a word, she can’t help grabbing her coat to leave. The film is structured in an interesting way that forces us to question that which we know about these two characters. We should believe that Saul did what Sylvia accuses him of doing regardless of whether he remembers it and yet the film quickly presents evidence to the contrary. It intrigues insofar as allowing this relationship to blossom where its romance is concerned, but problematic when you begin to ask yourself why Franco would sow that seed of doubt at all. I found myself watching the rest with dread. To me, the only reason to write the script in this way is to eventually reveal that the evidence was wrong and what Sylvia first believed was true. Yet, that’s not what Franco does. Another shoe will inevitably drop courtesy of learning the facts behind why Sylvia is estranged from her mother (Jessica Harper’s Samantha), but it has nothing to do with Saul. The deflection allows the impact of that revelation to hit home, but it also muddies the narrative waters as far as what it is we’re watching. The final result still captivates, though. Its value is less about plot than the characters and how their respective brokenness has positioned them to be exactly who the other needs to break free from the psychological and/or physical prisons in which they find themselves. As such, the real draw is performance. Both Chastain and Sarsgaard earn their emotional ache and our attention during happy, sad, and nightmarish times. They’re doing their best to survive the outside entities that attempt to control them, desperate to live in their truth regardless of the societal or familial consequences. I do love the comedy that comes from a literalist character caught within a world of emotionally insecure babies. That Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) is quite literally a baby inside a grown woman’s body who becomes a literalist as a direct result of her curiosity makes it all the more entertaining a juxtaposition. Because she doesn’t deal in dualities. Or decorum. She’s a child with wants and needs and an utter lack of patience with which to wait for those things to be fulfilled. It’s why she’s able to evolve into a robotic genius of mankind’s practical potential while reducing everyone else to the insufficient creatures their unearned superiority cannot hide. I also love many Yorgos Lanthimos films. DOGTOOTH. THE LOBSTER. THE FAVOURITE. Just superb. Unfortunately, sprinkled in with that trio are the equally wild swinging failures—at least to my mind, since many others love them too. POOR THINGS straddles the line separating those two halves a bit too closely for my liking, vacillating between insufferable and hilarious throughout its almost two-and-a-half-hour runtime. And it honestly comes down to a coin toss as to whether the next scene will be one or the other since the tone is exactingly consistent. I just think some locales and characters became too much of a bore. That too isn’t necessarily a symptom as much as a feature since they become bores to Bella herself. Tony McNamara’s adaptation of Alasdair Gray’s novel sends us on an adventure through her rapid education and thus provides us a front row seat to what pleasures, intrigues, and disgusts her along the way. Ever the optimist despite her discerning outlook, Bella ultimately stays with that which disgusts her a little too long. Sometimes it allows their inadequacy to shift from tedium to comedy, but other times it just reinforces how far past their purpose they’ve become. Randomly going back to London to remind us that Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) and Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef) must remain relevant for the future despite them being forgotten afterthoughts in the present doesn’t help matters. If anything, it frustrated me to no end because they were never truly interesting characters beyond their proximity to Bella in the first place. So, without her, they become distractions and, inevitably, postpone the payoff of her evolution as an independent, free-thinking woman at a time when men saw both as reason to murder since they saw women as little more than possessions. It’s why Mark Ruffalo’s Duncan Wedderburn is fun as an instructor of carnality and funnier as a victim to his own tricks (albeit intentional tricks when he victimizes women and unintentional causality when Bella’s actions have him victimizing himself). Once he hits that point, however, it’s time to move on. Although the film seems to understand this by switching venues, it keeps him well past his prime. He’ll still rise to the occasion for a laugh here and there, but not enough to keep his presence warranted as other, more fascinating creatures arrive (Hanna Schygulla, Jerrod Carmichael, and the always brilliant Kathryn Hunter). Between those moments that do work (including a welcome, full circle finale alongside Christopher Abbott), Stone’s transfixing performance of a human being maturing from toddler to Rhodes’ Scholar in a matter of months, and the absolutely gorgeous production design, though, any unavoidable fatigue I did feel was worth it. I don’t think the final result is as smart as it thinks it is or that what it’s saying is profound, let alone unique, but POOR THINGS is an entertaining ride that proves—like Bella vs. Felicity (Margaret Qualley)—how not all experiments work perfectly. But we shouldn’t discount the attempt in case the next one does. “[Keoghan] carries this diversionary tale of ""eat the rich"" politics right through a silly curtain lift that makes it seem Fennell thinks we're as vapidly dumb as the Cattons covering their eyes when THE RING is on TV.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “Only with [this experience and] knowledge, as well as the tools to make it work for them, can women Eya and Tayssir's age attempt to finally break the cycle of exploitation and persecution into which they were born.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. “I still had fun with the film; it just crashed into a brick wall right when it seemed like it was hitting its stride and preparing to deliver the punch-line.” – Full thoughts at HHYS. Your review of ""Ferrari,"" the film, the man and message is right on. Both my son (age 45) and I fell asleep for a time in the middle. Michael Mann and Driver just couldn't make us care."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE," This time of year is an intense time for me as a critic and podcaster. Between my holiday coverage at Hallmarkies Podcast and getting all the awards contenders watched I am woefully behind on my reviews. Therefore, over the next few days you are going to be seeing a lot of shorter reviews as I try and get my opinions out into the world. In this post we are looking at 2 recent blockbusters- one that feels like the last tired push from a corporate behemoth and one that continues on a decades-long tradition of moviemaking with heart and soul. Let’s talk about Aquaman vs Godzilla. For a long time I was one that defended comicbook movies against folks who said they aren’t cinema but it has become increasingly more difficult to do so in 2023. What should be explorations into popular mythmaking and escapism have turned into soulless corporate exercises of mundanity and money-calculated blandness. Such is the case in our last entry for the year Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. In this final entry in the DCEU director James Wan has given us a laborious, reverential, self-serious slog. If you want to see an actual good blockbuster with compelling characters and action look towards Japan and Godzilla: Minus One. I have not seen all of them but I do think it is the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen. Ryunosuke Kamiki plays Koichi who is disgraced when he fails to be a kamikaze pilot in WWII and he cannot shoot the Godzilla monster that attacks his crew. This gives the entire story an emotional weight beyond the typical monster movie trappings of the franchise. Minami Hamabe steals any scene she is in as Noriko Oishi, Koichi’s partner. Like all the good Godzilla movies Godzilla: Minus One has something to say about war, nuclear arms, the environment and toxic masculinity. What does it mean to be a hero? This is something that plagues Koichi almost as much as the giant monster throughout the film! I also appreciate that all of the monster action is clear and I can see what is happening unlike the recent Godzilla: King of the Monsters made here in America. The music is also excellent. I never thought a Godzilla movie would be one of my favorite films of the year but that’s where we are. So there you have 2 would-be epics at theaters right now. I know which one I’d recommend and see again if given the chance! Happy moviegoing! "
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE," How many of the human characters can you remember from the various Godzilla movies? Godzilla Minus One gives us a stirring central figure: Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot in the waning days of World War II who abandons his suicidal mission, instead landing on remote island and claiming to the mechanics there that his plane malfunctioned. Just as they realize he’s lying, Godzilla attacks. Shikishima escapes, but most of the others don’t, giving him a double dose of survivor’s guilt when he returns to the devastated Japanese mainland. When Godzilla resurfaces, the monster embodies Shikishima’s deepest fears. Writer-director Takashi Yamazaki and his team of effects artists bring a thrilling immediacy and tactility to the monster sequences, but what I loved most about Godzilla Minus One is the way it evokes the sense of loss and mourning of the granddaddy of these pictures, 1954’s Gojira (Godzilla in the U.S.) “Is your war finally over?” Shikishima is asked near the end of the film. As long as our wars aren’t, we’ll need Godzilla movies like this."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It gets the balance between drama and spectacle, and proper content. It has substance. "
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE," With the franchise’s 70th anniversary imminent, Japanese studio Toho goes back to the beginning with their latest Godzilla film. Or rather, before the beginning. Sort of. You can view Godzilla Minus One as an alternate genesis for the iconic monster, as interpreting it as a definite prequel to the original – something barely alluded to in the text – can negate this new film’s tension. That said, the strength of the craft ensures it’s still an enthralling visual and dramatic ride, regardless of any nagging thoughts about how the film can possibly have a satisfying conclusion in its own right.The very first Godzilla film was set around the same time as its 1954 release, with the sea creature symbolising Japan’s overriding fears concerning the aftermath of the war and nuclear attacks. Godzilla Minus One takes these same ideas but places them in an even bleaker context. Starting in World War II’s final days and taking place across the following two years (as Japan rebuilds from the ruins), this thrilling film charts the green giant’s journey from being slightly bigger than a T-Rex – terrorising people on a beach – to city-conquering behemoth, thanks to evolutionary enhancement via 1946’s Operation Crossroads.Writing, directing, and leading the film’s visual effects team, Takashi Yamazaki delivers impressive, legitimately scary set pieces. And crucially, the time spent with the genuinely appealing human ensemble in between attacks is truly compelling; exploring post-war trauma, community-led resistance to government disinformation, and trying to salvage peaceful prospects within the most disastrous circumstances."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE," El mes de diciembre es ese inconveniente limbo en el que todo el mundo dentro de la cinefilia se apresura a elaborar y compartir sus listas de lo mejor del año, dejando por el camino muchos estrenos de última hora que parecen llegar tan tarde que no tienen puesto en la cola. ‘Godzilla: Minus One’ es uno de los casos más llamativos porque, no solo merece estar en todos los tops de 2023, sino que es, simplemente, uno de los mejores kaiju eiga de la historia. En un momento en el que Godzilla se mantiene como un personaje válido setenta años después de su primera aparición, gracias a series como ‘Monarch: el legado de los monstruos’ y la próxima ‘Godzilla y Kong: el nuevo imperio’, la creadora del asunto vuelve a contraatacar tras la singular ‘Shin Godzilla’, que convertía el desastre de Fukushima en una diana perfecta para explicar la ineficiencia burocrática de un gobierno acomodado e incapaz, recuperando ahora el poder alegórico del icónico monstruo en su versión más terrorífica y devastadora hasta ahora. De hecho, Toho vuelve a la original siguiendo la senda ideológica de la anterior, de nuevo planteando un país en ruinas con una casta en el que no se puede confiar y unos EE.UU. dibujados como el enemigo en la sombra, dejando la lucha contra Godzilla a los ciudadanos. No por casualidad, la película reutiliza la sintonía clásica de Akira Ifukube, que nos lleva a 1954, tan solo unos años más tarde del final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, justo el periodo elegido para armar esta especie de precuela muy conectada con el film de Ishiro Honda. El resultado es uno de los blockbusters más apabullantes del año en cualquier género. Llegado en tiempo de descuento, pero marcando de chilena, Takashi Yamazaki insufla nueva vida al mito y nos prepara para la que puede ser un revival kaiju equiparable al de la trilogía de Gamera en los 90. Sin salirnos de las franquicias, vale, pero su presupuesto de unos 15 millones de dólares hace palidecer a toda la producción de Marvel y DC de este año, planteando incluso otras posibilidades de ritmo y uso de efectos especiales. Salvo ‘The Creator’ ninguna película de gran presupuesto de los últimos años ha explorado demasiado las posibilidades dramáticas de un uso estratégico de la tecnología. En sus monumentales escenas de catástrofe, ‘Godzilla: Minus One’ pone cada momento de espectáculo al servicio de una tragedia que nos fascina y aterra ver. Nada funcionaría sin su meditado enfoque de drama de posguerra de un periodo muy concreto de su historia, no solo en la forma, sino en sus temas de derrota, honor y resurgir. Esto, que se ha confundido con un problema de ritmo, hace que cada momento importe y el esfuerzo del personaje principal por superar su vergüenza y reintegrarse vaya, mano a mano, con las escenas en las que aparece Godzilla, sintetizando el drama de toda una nación en su experiencia particular. De hecho, buena parte de la película es casi una respuesta a ‘Oppenheimer’ desde el lado japonés, explorando el trauma nuclear colectivo de forma que sirve de contrapunto a la fascinación por la peripecia científica que transpira el éxito americano. Tras convertir la creación de la bomba atómica en una experiencia de viernes noche y palomitas en el multicine de un centro comercial, es imposible no pensar que hay mucho de Hiroshima en la forma en la que se presenta el uso del rayo característico de Godzilla, un momento preparado con la misma anticipación que la prueba de Álamo Gordo, pero con un propósito bien distinto. Sí, tenemos a un lagarto gigante que anda torpemente, pero esa representación fantasiosa resulta más temible y peligrosa en cuanto sintonizamos con lo que nos está queriendo enseñar realmente. No hay que ser muy avispado para captar que el ataque a Ginza está reflejando el efecto devastador de una fuerza inesperada— que aparece, claro, por efecto de otras pruebas militares americanas—, usando al coloso como avatar del terror atómico. Desde las ""quemaduras"" de Godzilla, a la forma angustiosa de reflejar el pánico civil o la presencia de una lluvia de ceniza negra... La imaginería es un catálogo de efectos de la bomba nuclear que explora todo lo que no interesaba reproducir en ‘Oppenheimer’, mostrando, de alguna manera, la cara de la moneda más “descortés” en una película supuestamente de espectáculo. Irónicamente, ‘Godzilla: Minus One’, entre sus varios recursos del cine bélico, recicla algunos momentos del cine reciente de Christopher Nolan, concretamente de ‘Dunquerque’, en algunas de sus escenas navales, que dan la distintiva personalidad marítima a esta entrega frente a las demás. De hecho, esta vocación ""acuática"" hace que tenga algunos momentos de pura aventura marinera que recuerdan a los momentos de peripecia más memorables de ‘Tiburón’ (1975), lo que convierte a Godzilla en una criatura más fiera y que crea lazos con el cine de terror animal más tradicional. Con más comentario social o más aventura, el resultado consigue un balance insólito entre el peso emocional y el gran espectáculo de efectos especiales perdido en el blockbuster americano actual, logrando aprovechar sus limitados recursos al máximo, poniendo en evidencia a las últimas entregas del monsterverse. Un hype que se explica sin matices y un éxito sorpresa de taquilla que evidencia un error de cálculo garrafal de algunas distribuidoras que no han medido la respuesta que tendría en salas, un testamento al poder de los rarísimos blockbusters con actitud y FX al servicio de la historia y no al revés. Con un equilibrio perfecto entre el cine de monstruos y el bélico, ‘Godzilla: Minus One’ funciona gracias a su parte humana, un drama construido sobre la culpa, que no se corta en explotar un énfasis militarista sobre el honor perdido con el que no se atrevería Michael Bay, y que explica el resentimiento nacionalista de un Japón que parece estar buscando reconstruir su orgullo tras un desastre al evocar el deseo patriótico de una nación casi emulando a una película de propaganda ficticia de posguerra, con un fondo tan populista y fascinante como peligroso."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One is a monster movie of singular power, using horror-infused kaiju spectacle to deliver an emotionally compelling story of grief, wartime trauma, and hope. Most importantly, its genre-leading visual effects scenes are complemented by richly soulful performances and humane themes of reconciliation and redemption. Godzilla has experienced a major resurgence in the past decade. The crowd-pleasing pugilism of the American MonsterVerse franchise continues to expand under the leadership of Legendary Pictures, while Godzilla’s Japanese owner-originators Toho have steadily released an array of more cerebral, mostly animated projects that explore Godzilla’s weirder, more eldritch dimension. Godzilla Minus One straddles the sensibilities of both, delivering world-class scenes of monster rampage, a story of considerable depth and pathos, and one of the strangest, most terrifying incarnations of Godzilla in the franchise’s seventy-year history. The filmhas a straightforward premise. In a Japan ravaged by World War Two, Godzilla’s attacks take the country “from zero to minus one”. In many respects the film, too, is direct and uncomplicated, as it hits every major story beat that any audience would expect from a Godzilla story. Urban destruction, fleeing crowds, the monster’s horrifying emergence from the ocean: all executed with percussive bombast and luminous visual flair. It features several extraordinarily satisfying action scenes which deliver thrilling moments of monster mayhem and display to jaw-dropping effect the mastery of visual effects for which the film is already beginning to reap major awards. But the film also has plenty of surprises up its sleeve. Several characters are forthright in their criticism of Japan’s government and the 1945-52 US occupation in ways that resonate with contemporary matters, undergirding the film with an intriguing (if coded) political critique. The score is operatic, grandiose, and spine-tingling. Perhaps most welcome, however, is the emotional sophistication of the movie, as it tackles substantial themes of historical responsibility, grief, and redemption, all channelled through the survivor’s guilt of protagonist Kōichi Shikishima (Kamiki Ryunosuke), a kamikaze pilot haunted by his inability to die his state-mandated wartime death. Everybody knows that Godzilla was originally a symbol or metaphor for the atomic bomb. Over the years, Godzilla’s meaning has grown and shifted, appearing sometimes as tragic, often heroic, sometimes cute and child-friendly. Godzilla Minus One brings out unexpected aspects of the creature’s original wartime resonance, focusing in depth on the abject struggles of ordinary Japanese people scratching a living in the ruins of a firebombed Tokyo. Their confrontation with Godzilla is rendered in ways that foreground their resilience, comradeship, compassion, and hope, imbuing what could have been a maudlin and grimdark affair with the warmth and humanity for which the screenwriting of Takashi Yamazaki, who directs, writes, and handles the film’s exquisite VFX, is rightly celebrated. And Godzilla itself has never looked better. Characterised as a radioactive island god saturated with vicious, bloodthirsty hate and rendered in extraordinarily lucid and gnarly detail, it delivers serious thrills and some unforgettable images. Godzilla Minus One is a superlative monster movie. See it!"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't think it's a great film or anything... It's fine. It's got some good moments, but I didn't go crazy for it."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the film that Godzilla fans have been waiting for.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE," ★★★★☆In a rum week for American cinema — one in which the French have revamped the superhero template with The Three Musketeers: Milady — the Japanese have effectively humiliated Hollywood by delivering the best mega-monster movie since Peter Jackson’s King Kong in 2005, and at a fraction of the going price. "
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE," It can be easy for audiences adoringly saturating themselves in Legendary’s MonsterVerse to forget all about Toho Studios’ ongoing age of Godzilla movies. Which is a shame, because the latest offering, Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One, is something to savour. The 33rd Godzilla film, and the 5th of the franchise’s Reiwa era, is beyond doubt the best Godzilla movie since Ishirō Honda’s seminal first almost 70 years ago. With Minus One explicitly celebrating Godzilla’s anniversary, it is a fitting a tribute to one of the biggest movie icons in the world.  At the end of World War Two, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns back to his family home in Tokyo only to find that it has been destroyed and his parents have been killed. Given that he is a kamikaze pilot however, returning home was never part of the mission plan, and he is chastised by those around him for not following through on his wartime duty. Along with his found family of Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe) and the rescued child Akiko (Sae Nagatani), Shikishima tries to rebuild his life while grappling with survivor’s guilt. This is interrupted by Godzilla, who Shikishima had also confronted two years earlier in the creature’s infancy. Godzilla decides to devastate Tokyo just as the city has put the ravages of war behind it. Shikishima then joins a crew of private citizens who plan to destroy Godzilla once and for all. Minus One is a Godzilla movie first and foremost, but it is also an emotionally charged look at the morals of war, failure, and the value of individual life. While Honda’s Godzilla has been read as a statement about Japanese collective trauma, Minus One channels its ethical exploration mostly through one character – Shikishima, who feels responsible for the death of others as well as thinking that he does not deserve to live.  Godzilla is more than a harbinger of death; he is the very symbol of Shikishima’s perceived failure and shortcomings. You genuinely believe that he has it out for this big lizard without it feeling needlessly silly or unmerited. This personal struggle lends itself to an incredibly tense finale where Shikishima’s ultimate intentions are unclear, while also proving that sticking a massive radioactive monster in your film is no excuse to litter it with shallow human characters. Kamiki’s performance as the former pilot deserves a lot of praise; he wears the pain, guilt, and devastation at all times to help you become intimately enveloped in his struggle.  A drama about a kamikaze pilot’s survivor’s guilt would likely make for a solid drama in and of itself, but as already mentioned this is a Godzilla movie through and through. And the big man has rarely looked so good, with different eras of the character seemingly combining into one monstrous wonder. Yamazaki lingers on Godzilla’s devastation and powers as an unstoppable force of nature, evoking wartime and apocalyptic imagery to make this one of the truly terrifying incarnations of the creature.  Such is the detail put into his design and the atmosphere of dread he creates just by existing, he feels frighteningly real. A lot has been said online about the quality of the visual effects given the remarkably low budget (even if Japanese labour laws explain a large part of this). Yamazaki, who is also in charge of the film’s VFX, makes the most of what he can offer with some breathtaking set pieces. Godzilla’s rampage through Ginza is especially immersive, the camera almost never pulling back to wide shots so that you feel endlessly caught up in the unspeakable destruction.  Minus One strikes a remarkable balance between sombre and epic, with just a pinch of preposterousness to hark back to the cult favourites of the late 20th century. The storyline deliberately evokes some of the original 1954 film’s elements, concreting the sense that Yamazaki’s triumph is more than worthy of the name. Few kaiju movies seem capable of giving you gargantuan thrills while ensuring that there is a deeply affecting, political, and human core to the story. Godzilla Minus One is a welcome lesson on how to do exactly that."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s a standalone and surprisingly low-budget Japanese blockbuster which sees the scaly icon go back to his roots. It’s also the best Godzilla movie I’ve seen. Made to celebrate the 70th anniversary of his movie debut, the film swaps the bloke in the lizard suit for cutting-edge special effects which look at least $100million pricier than its rumoured $15m budget. Director and effects wizard Takashi Yamazaki plays to the big fella’s strengths. The trick is to make him utterly terrifying. But a rampaging, radioactive monster with killer breath isn’t enough to hold anyone’s attention for two hours. And Yamazaki stirs in rousing human drama and chewy post-war politics. Our hero is Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a disgraced – in other words, still alive – kamikaze pilot. He ducked out of a suicide mission at the end of the Second World War and, afterwards, returns to a bombed-out Tokyo where he is spat at by one of his neighbours. His road to redemption begins when he forms a makeshift family with a big-hearted survivor (Minami Hamabe) and an orphaned child. But Koichi is not only haunted by his refusal to die for his emperor but by a previous run-in with the monster at the end of the war. After he’d sabotaged his engine, he landed at an island fighter plane repair facility. As a then medium-sized Godzilla came ashore, Koichi had him in his machine gun’s sights but didn’t shoot. The beast went on to wipe out scores of engineers with a blast of his red-hot breath. So, after a now beefed-up Godzilla flattens a Tokyo neighbourhood, Koichi volunteers for a citizen-led defence force. The plan to defeat the ever-growing beast is ingenious and, according to the ex-military scientist in charge, doesn’t rely on unthinking self-sacrifice."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"You wouldn’t believe a monster movie could make you sob, as well as think, but Godzilla Minus One does."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Ever since he first lumbered on to the big screen in Ishiro Honda’s 1954 original film, Godzilla has been more than just a monster. The city-crunching prehistoric mega-reptile has been cast as a metaphor for the nuclear threat, American military might and environmental abuses. He also represents a seemingly boundless franchise opportunity, having appeared in almost 40 films, of wildly varying quality. Of all these, the terrific Godzilla Minus One is one of the very best. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki (best known for sci-fi horror films Parasyte: Parts 1 and 2 and the comedy drama Always: Sunset on Third Street), this thunderously entertaining prequel, set in Japan in the immediate aftermath of the second world war, takes the king of monsters back to his roots. In this version, Godzilla takes on a fresh metaphorical significance. Here, he symbolises the national anguish, trauma, guilt and grief of the country’s postwar period. His shape, with its squat rump, chunky thighs and a head that seems to be all jaws and no brains, is immediately recognisable. But this version of Godzilla looks as though he was created from the still-smouldering wreckage of Japan’s shattered cities. There are angry embers visible through the gaps between his scales; his jagged dorsal plates look like the broken spines of bombed-out buildings. He is destruction and devastation, pain and shame made flesh. The other standard-bearer for the collective torment of the Japanese people is the film’s tortured central character. Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a former kamikaze pilot. The fact that he survived the inglorious end of the war is a constant reminder of his failure. Not only did he abort his suicide mission; Kōichi froze when he was first confronted by Godzilla, in a prelude to the main body of the film. His hesitation – he fails to shoot at the creature for fear of drawing his deadly attention – indirectly costs the lives of almost the entire ground crew of an island airbase. Kōichi is trapped in the moment of his ignominy and cowardice, unable to move on with his life because “my war isn’t over yet”. He finds himself part of a de facto family nonetheless – Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a light-fingered girl dressed in rags, moves in with him, uninvited, with an orphaned baby she rescued when the child’s mother was killed in an air raid. While Kōichi doesn’t feel worthy of marriage or love, he steps up to the responsibilities. It’s to provide for Noriko and the infant Akiko that Kōichi takes a risky but well-paid job manning the gun on a rickety wooden mine-clearing boat working the coastal waters outside Tokyo. Before long, Kōichi once again comes face to slavering jaws with his lizard nemesis. But now Godzilla, having been bathed by radiation from the first Bikini Atoll nuclear test in 1946, is an altogether more formidable creature, with the capacity to immediately regenerate from injury – and to burp out a devastating heat ray when irked. The marine encounter with the newly beefed-up Godzilla is thrilling, but when the creature hauls itself from the water and lays waste the Ginza neighbourhood of Tokyo (where Noriko has recently taken a desk job), the film, and the monster, really hit their collective stride. Yamazaki pays tribute to several shots and scenes from the original 1954 film, most notably in a dazzling sequence that opens with Noriko gazing, uncomprehending, through the window of a suburban train as the looming bulk of the monster is reflected in the glass. Elsewhere, Akira Ifukube’s classic Godzilla theme – with its relentless, stomping rhythm, one of the most distinctive pieces of film music ever written – is deployed to glorious effect. Godzilla Minus One is unabashedly nationalistic and sentimental in approach, pursuing a redemption narrative in which Kōichi and Japan are both offered the chance to re-enter the field of battle and regain some dignity and self-respect. It’s a testament to the quality of writing, and to the action direction, that this never feels as corny or as crass as you might expect. “The country has valued life far too cheaply,” says one character, a line that tacitly condones Koichi’s failure as a kamikaze pilot. Pointedly, it’s a civilian-led operation that faces up to the monster peril rather than a government or an army mission. The messaging, it’s fair to say, is not subtle. But then this is a movie about a furious radioactive dinosaur trashing the commercial centre of Tokyo. Who needs subtle?"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The technical quality of the effects is great&#46; So&#44; happily&#44; is the artistic quality&#46;
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Like Star Wars or superheroes, Godzilla, as an entity, is more than just pulp fantasy; its appeal and resonance have crossed over into the world of modern myth. These pop icons are often written off as throwaway entertainment when, in reality, their value and stature in our collective imagination have all but surpassed tales of gods and fairy stories of the past. These are the new archetypes, our way of communicating ideas, for better or worse, in the most universal and loudest way possible. These “new myths” have never been more popular in our current era of mass fandom and exploitation of “intellectual property”. Despite this, the ability to take these myths seriously seems to have been lost.  Godzilla Minus One does not apologize for its “ludicrous” premise about a 20th-century dinosaur with radioactive breath. That’s just the thing; the film does not find its premise ludicrous in the least. It is made by someone who loves the character, just like millions of fans have for 70 years, and rightfully, this filmmaker has the utmost confidence in bringing the creature back to the theaters. While it is a reboot that requires no background knowledge of the king of monsters’ extensive filmography, Godzilla Minus One’s director, writer, and special effects supervisor, Takashi Yamasaki, does not seem to feel the need to go out of his way to make a case for a Godzilla movie in 2023, the film is confident and assured. In this way, Godzilla Minus One is a triumph of sincerity.  More recent American action blockbusters, which seem to rule many international markets, often seem filled with a meta self-awareness that more or less points to trying to get as many people in seats as possible, often filling “nerd movies” with borderline apologies for being “nerdy”. There is little to no humor to be found in Godzilla Minus One, no Marvel-esque moments where the filmmakers feel a neurotic need to speak directly to the more cynical audience members who think this is all stupid and silly (why are they there in the theater in the first place?). In this way, Godzilla Minus One feels refreshing, as it silences the need for every serious moment to be undercut with a comedy relief character saying some postmodern quip like: “A Dinosaur? What is this Jurassic Park?” While far from being the first reboot of the franchise, Godzilla Minus One is the first retelling to bring the story back to the post-World War II era when the monster first debuted. Godzilla as an entity indeed became a big silly dinosaur and sometimes borderline superhero lizard (see 1973’s Godzilla Vs. Megalon) in the decades that followed, but when the monster’s first film emerged from the depths in 1954, there was nothing silly to be found in a story of a nation still reeling and barely rebuilt from the horrors of the atomic bomb. This is, of course, what the title “Minus One” refers to – a crushed nation suddenly being pushed further into hopelessness.  Every character in Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One, however briefly they are developed, is easy to empathize with because they all have this shared baggage and desperation in a seemingly hopeless world. The main protagonist, Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), is a pilot who deals with survivor guilt, first from “failing’ to die as a kamikaze pilot in World War II, and then from being one of the only survivors of the first attack by a “strange Dinosaur-like creature”, which serves as the films first major action sequence that only teases at the actual destruction that is to come. The “human story” that inevitably makes up a good portion of any Godzilla installment can help to make or break the experience. Quite often, these aspects of the films become the weak points for fans, offering little more than phoned-in romance and endless board meetings full of same-looking military characters muttering about what they are going to do about this big lizard. There is indeed a lot of human drama in Godzilla Minus One, but rather than feeling like a chore, it feels essential and gives weight to the monstrous spectacle. In this way, it is similar to the original 1954 classic, making its metaphors and ideas flesh and blood through the emphasis on these broken characters who desperately wish for redemption and healing.  In the first few years after the War, our ex-Kamikaze pilot Kōichi stumbles into becoming a part of a “found family” amongst the rubble of a slowly recovering Tokyo. He reluctantly joins Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a woman living on the streets. Despite having an uneasy relationship, the two come together to take in an orphaned infant. Self-hating and haunted to the point of delusion, Kōichi attempts to support Noriko and the child by joining the crew of a ship that ultimately runs into The King Of Monsters once more.  A high-speed boat chase straight out of the best kind of Spielberg action movie ensues and serves as our first look at this film’s iteration of Godzilla in his true, much larger, and now atomic bomb-spewing form. While die-hard fans of the old rubber suit films and critics of CGI might long for practical effects, the computer-generated Godzilla we see here is something to behold. Unlike the more recent American iterations, he looks less like some video game boss battle monster and more like a living, breathing mountain of scales and spikes. Every shot Godzilla enters gives our eyes a feast of details to observe. Yamazaki’s monster is true to the original conception, a beast to be in awe of, as well as a thing that clearly should not exist, a thing that when you look in its large eyes seems to know it shouldn’t exist, almost as if it’s rampage is causing it pain rather than malevolent delight.  When it is finally time for the beast to emerge slowly from the depths and begin to destroy Tokyo, it feels earned, fresh, and exhilarating rather than a simple rehash of a tried and true classic action sequence. Even amongst the explosive spectacle of the monster’s sunset raid on Tokyo (more visual metaphor), where we see buildings destroyed by atomic breath and trains munched by enormous jaws, Godzilla Minus One continues to stay true to its focus, which is almost always on the human cost that comes with the chaos. How this monstrous spectacle devastates the main cast of wartime survivors sustains the film and resonates with the following struggles.  While Ishirô Honda’s original Godzilla and Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi’s wonderful 2016 remake, Shin Godzilla, present darker and more intellectual takes on the concept, Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One stands out for being an uplifting approach to this age-old story. If we might see the Godzilla franchise as a body (And why not? These films have always thrived on metaphors) Godzilla Minus One would be the franchise’s pounding heart, serving as an allegory not just for the struggles that come with tragedy and defeat but for the hope and chance for rebirth that can be possible even in the aftermath of the unthinkable."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE," The Toho production is the sleeper hit of the season—and a critical sensation, too. What separates it from the giant-lizard stories we’ve telling stateside? And what can other popcorn flicks learn from it? Years before the director Ishiro Honda started work on a low-budget Japanese horror film starring a giant, isotope-spewing lizard, he hiked with the Western allied powers through the wreckage of imperial Japan’s brutal atomic collision, in the charred city of Hiroshima. He had heard of the Bomb but he had not seen it. A veteran of three tours of duty in the Japanese Imperial Army, Honda spent the last six months of World War II in a prisoner of war camp in northern China. He’d witnessed first-hand the toll of the conflict in human lives—millions dead, hundreds of thousands missing and wounded—but information was as scarce in captivity as comfort.  When the war ended he was repatriated to occupied Japan, by route of nuclear ground zero. What Honda found—upon the land, in the rivers, among the city’s depleted citizenry and the nation’s collective psyche––was a world’s worth of scars not unlike the imprint of clothing which had been seared onto victims of the bomb. He saw, and never stopped seeing, the battle after the war. The fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were stanched. The embers were not.  There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. Godzilla, the film that Honda would go on to direct less than a decade later, was a movie built as a reminder of the cost attached to nuclear power. It was also very DIY, and I mean that in the best ways possible. (The lizard was a man in a ready-mixed concrete suit.) While immensely rough, the creature’s appearance was a collective endeavor between director and crew with a common aim: “I wanted,” Honda admitted years later, “to make radiation visible.” Thirty-six sequels later, the most recent and most nostalgic entry in the franchise, Godzilla Minus One, has managed to strike U.S. box-office gold and earn word-of-mouth praise, while holding on to its political roots.  Directed by the filmmaker and VFX maestro Takashi Yamazaki, Minus One takes place in the immediate aftermath of the second World War, following Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a one-time kamikaze pilot haunted both by his decision to not sacrifice himself in combat and his inability to confront the titular green reptile. After failing to stave off Godzilla’s attack of a military installation on the fictional island of Ono, Shikishima finds himself caught between his remorse over the wartime death of his loved ones, his desire to protect his newfound family, and his shame over fleeing his martial duties.  Debuting in Japan in October, the film arrived in the U.S. on December 1 for what was supposed to be a limited theatrical run. As of December 11, Minus One has pulled in $26 million in American theaters and continues to have its run extended and expanded. That all of this has occurred on a relatively shoestring budget and without an extensive U.S. marketing campaign puts the film in perhaps the rarest of positions in a post-streaming theatrical marketplace: a genuine, diamond-in-the-rough hit. (And a hit with critics, too: As of publishing time, Minus One sits at 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, better than Oscar favorites like Killers of the Flower Moon and Oppenheimer, and good enough to be the highest-rated entry in the long Godzilla canon.) Minus One works not only because of its intent, but also because of its lack of world-box-office-dominating intention. At its core, it’s a film that’s fluent in the language of American spectacle with ambitions to go beyond it. Leading up to the movie’s release, Yamazaki spoke openly about the ways in which a blockbuster flick like Jaws (which Minus One does a pretty decent impersonation of at times)—or even a crossover darling like Hayao Miyazaki’s Princess Mononoke—was a guiding light in building a narrative with the right amount of propulsion without over-relying on bloated set pieces. These are films that made a shitload of money partly in spite of their artistic compasses. Minus One is not a movie about kaiju formulated to pad seat totals; it is a kaiju movie about people, and—much the same as the ’54 film—those people are not Americans. The history of Godzilla films being rearranged, diluted, and generally proffered in an attempt to attract U.S. audiences is practically as old as the character. When the original picture finally made it over to the States it was renamed King of the Monsters in a ploy to link it to the already-established IP of King Kong (who I now realize coasts on counting stats and opposable thumbs). It was reorganized around the flashbacks of a white American journalist played by the first Perry Mason and practically stripped of its explicit critiques of nuclear proliferation. It worked, but at what costs? Minus One—in part because of the expansion in popularity of anime, and in part because internment is decades and not years away—isn’t just avoiding that fate, it’s showing the fallacy in it to begin with.  Minus One isn’t the first Godzilla film with a bunch of callbacks to the original movie, but it’s one of the few that manages to incorporate them without losing its own identity. From the start of the picture, where we see footage of the real-life Bikini Atoll nuclear-testing site in the Marshall Islands, it’s clear that Minus One isn’t afraid to be viewed as an atomic allegory. (The culmination of Godzilla’s blue ray in the film is a literal mushroom cloud.) While promoting the movie, Yamazaki has said, “Out of all the Godzillas there have been throughout the years … my favorite is still the original from the very first movie.” He’s running toward the comparisons.  What helps Minus One stick the landing is that it engages with the roots of the franchise without merely retreading old ground. Where Honda’s Godzilla used genre to shroud a commentary on nuclear proliferation, Yamazaki’s movie (like 2016’s Shin Godzilla) updates and retrofits the message. A nod to the documentary-style journalism of the first film coexists with a knotty, multi-act wrestling match with Japanese post-war masculinity, or a sly, nuanced depiction of communal PTSD. The defining feature of Minus One, the thing that links the old with the new, is its general inclination toward probing the interpersonal relationships of its characters in ways that both the originals and the American remakes don’t even consider doing. There is the scene in which the lizard literally swallows a grown man in a half bite; the one in which the lizard chucks an aircraft carrier like a K-9 on Adderall; the part in which the lizard flicks a single train car onto a high rail platform like a toothpick; the moment when the lizard takes at least seven shots from various tanks and then keeps on trucking like he’s a college-aged uncle/cousin/sibling taking Nerf gun fire like a champ.  We have not mentioned that he gets a literal mine thrown under his tongue, has half of his cerebellum Jackson Pollock’ed like Scratchy, then regrows it and gives them the “and I took that personally…” glare. Or the fact that folks try to pop him like a balloon at the bottom of the ocean but can’t because he’s not fucking leaving. Descriptors for Godzilla in Minus One include but are not limited to: snarling, jagged, bloody, angry, scary, inflamed, snarling again, crystalline, elemental, and a force of nature. That brother’s starving.  Probably my favorite part of Minus One is how it manages, at once, to take itself both incredibly seriously and not too seriously to be entertaining throughout. Is it a period piece about personal regret and communal grief? What about a claymation semi-aquatic thriller? How can you affirm the innate value of human life and show a naval officer being disemboweled? To really sink into the movie is to hold yourself in a state suspended between reality and surreality. Task-oriented plot mechanics exist next to veiled references to Shintoism, and it all blends perfectly (let the liquor tell it). What we’ve got is a movie that’s a little extra, more than a bit heady, and inescapably soapy at times—which I tend to think a story about a reptile with atomic breath shouldn’t be above. It works because it doesn’t—except of course when it does.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE," It is an astonishing feat that the Godzilla franchise has reached its 37th iteration (being the 5th one in the Reiwa era) and it never once feels old-fashioned, worn-out or quaint in the slightest. One of the reasons that it has such an appealing longevity is because that the franchise is never afraid to be different in terms of shifts in tone, prescience and adherence in continuity. It is through these factors that filmmakers are free to portray the titular behemoth in however they please to satiate their creative juices. In the case of Japanese blockbuster filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, he has done just that with the latest iteration, “Godzilla Minus One.” Yamazaki is best known for crowd-pleasing blockbusters (including space opera “Space Battleship Yamato” (2010), the science-fiction action flick “Returner” (2002), the horror blockbuster “Parasyte” films and the 3D animated film “Lupin III – The First” (2019)) that are unapologetic in their melodrama (i.e. the “Always: Sunset on Third Street” trilogy) and are audaciously overstated in their spectacle. With extensive experience in animation and visual effects, it seems like Yamazaki is the perfect candidate for taking the reins of Godzilla. Does he manage to succeed in keeping the bar high after the last Japanese entry, “Shin Godzilla” (2016)? With a simple, effective story, well-developed characters, a rousing sense of sheer spectacle and a powerfully emotional through-line, “Godzilla Minus One” stands out as one of the best in its 59-year run. In the last iterations of Godzilla, the films had either focused on political commentary like the satirical views of bureaucracy under the topical views of natural disasters like “Shin Godzilla”. Or they had focused on sheer spectacle that delivered the rock-em, sock-em action that Western audiences had satiated for. In the case of “Godzilla Minus One”, director/screenwriter Yamazaki has gone back to the past in post WWII i.e. the Showa era. It avoids the satirical barbs that its predecessor had in terms of its portrayal of the Japanese government and instead explores post-trauma of the war through our lead character Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki.) He is depicted as a kamikaze pilot who flees from his duty only to suffer from survivor’s guilt after seeing his comrades die by the hands of the titular creature. The themes may be simplistic in nature but Yamazaki and crew manage to tug the heartstrings capably well thanks to his sincere efforts in making us care for his characters. Themes like found families, patriotism, redemption and period depictions are nothing new to Yamazaki; especially as he depicts the tropes and themes with crowd-pleasing sentimentality, if not in cerebrally challenging ways. One may see the film as a portrayal of the Japanese making up for their defeat in the war as redemption or one may see the film as a character-based path on fighting through survivor’s guilt and through patriotism, they can settle their guilt and emotional baggage. Unfortunately, Yamazaki takes the easy way out and aims for an easily digestible approach that looks slightly banal after Hideaki Anno’s challenging approach to Godzilla. Teary sentimentality and well-worn tropes they may be, but ample time is spent on characterizations, which makes them effective. Those include Koichi as well as Noriko (a fellow survivor who lost her parents in the bombing of Tokyo) as well as Kenji “Doc”, Yoji “Captain” and Shiro “Kid”; who are all friends of Koichi who work together in sweeping mines. Much like the themes themselves, the characters may all appear simplistic that they almost seem to be homages – the crew that Koichi works with seems to be intentionally Spielbergian. But a huge credit must be given to the actors who are fully committed to imbuing their roles with emotional vigour. Hidetaka Yoshioka (who has worked with Yamazaki since his sci-fi fantasy directorial debut “Juvenile” (2000) exudes a likable reticent charm as Kenji “Doc” while Mimami Hamabe (who is having a great year with this and “Shin Kamen Rider” (2023)) is convincingly headstrong as Noriko. But aside from the titular creature, the real standout is Kamiki. An acclaimed child actor who had matured into a skilled thespian in all walks of artistic ventures including animation (in which he was scouted none other by Hayao Miyazaki himself to debut in “Spirited Away” (2001)), live-action films and theatre, Kamiki portrays the guilt, trauma and conflict of Koichi remarkably well and it is through his interactions and reactions to the world around him that makes his character and his predicaments worth caring for. But what of Godzilla, you may ask? The G-Man is depicted as an encapsulation of crippling fear and unbearable despair of post-WWII anguish; a force of nature that is absolutely frightening and undeniably angry. With the visual effects supervised by Yamazaki and long-time collaborator Kiyoko Shibuya, they lend life to the creature through intimidating scale, textures that signify battle scars/mushroom clouds and of course showing it in a predatorial state as it sneaks to its prey through water in a deliberate homage to Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws” (1975). The set-pieces are terrifying as Yamazaki is never afraid to show the consequences of Godzilla’s actions as they are; as opposed to being cheer-worthy crowd-pleasing spectacle. Human casualties are at an all-time high and are never brazen or overlooked in order to avoid alienating audiences. The set-piece in Ginza is a true highlight in showcasing the awesome might of Godzilla and also critiquing how little the Japanese government are involved in helping out their country (in order to focus on not inciting tensions with the Soviet Union). Overall, “Godzilla Minus One” is not only a top-notch Godzilla film but one of the best blockbusters of the year; a grand creature feature that that bellows and stomps on its competition with its compelling humanist core, awe-inspiring spectacle and its grounded approach to its characters. Highly recommended."

 This year, Santa has blessed us undeserving humans with an unexpected bounty of gifts. They arrive in the form of not one, not two but three heaping helpings of Godzilla, the cinematic lizard king who first appeared on the silver screen in 1954.  The defining subject of kaiju films, a genre of Japanese cinema involving giant monsters, Godzilla is stomping back onto screens as 2023 runs out the clock. What we did to deserve this honour, I’m not sure. Don’t look a gift lizard in the mouth, if you know what’s good for you.  Every generation gets the Godzilla they both need and deserve, and the most recent iteration doesn’t miss. It’s a return to the original concept of retribution for hubris. Godzilla is back to remind us that we humans are not all that. But uniting humanity in the face of gargantuan destruction is only one of the beast’s many gifts.  In addition to the importance of environmental stewardship and social cohesion, Godzilla’s towering height and overall hugeness are good reminders that we are puny little creatures. We might be many, but our overall significance in the universe is minuscule.  Also, if we continue to degrade the natural world by dropping atomic bombs on things, something bad might eventually happen. Godzilla is nature’s revenge, personified (or, technically speaking, lizardified). Born from the disruptive force of nuclear weapons, he rises to remind us of what happens when we mess with things we ought not mess with.  Director Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One, despite its head-scratcher of a title, is a sturdy and sometimes even thrilling throwback to the monster movies of yore. After more than 37 outings since his 1954 cinematic debut, Godzilla is looking pretty good for an old dude. He is still possessed of a desire to smash up buildings and bite commuter trains.  His radioactive heat ray, courtesy of the plates on his spine, lights up with alacrity and his swimming skills remain Olympian level. On land, he’s always been something of a plodder, but he uses it to his advantage, squishing loads of squeaking humans with great efficiency.  After so many different film and television versions of the monster, one question remains: does Godzilla still have the juice? To such a question, I respond with a hell yes. A little awe goes a long way, and Minus One has it in heaping quantities. Godzilla has undergone more career resets than Cher and proves just as fabulous. He is the original survivor. But does Minus One offer contemporary audiences another view of this iconic creature? In short: sort of.  The story begins in the dregs of the Second World War. A kamikaze pilot named Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) fakes plane trouble to get out of certain death. After landing his fighter jet on Odo Island, the small crew of engineers, led by chief mechanic Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), quickly ascertain that there’s nothing wrong with the plane; the fault lies with the pilot. As the assembled engineers look on in disgust, Shikishima slinks away, shame covering him like a shroud.  Later that night, a massive dinosaur-like creature comes ashore. Frozen with terror, Shikishima fails to shoot the beast, who makes quick and deadly business of the men, chomping and stomping, until only Tachibana and Shikishima remain from the rampage.  After this bravura entrance, Godzilla stalks back into the sea and Shikishima returns to the burnt-out hellscape that is postwar Tokyo. The stain of cowardice follows him, but he rallies when a young woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the orphaned baby girl she has rescued move in. The trio set up house and become a family of sorts. Things take a turn for the brighter when Shikishima gets a job on a minesweeper vessel and proves himself a worthy member of the small crew, composed of a scientist, a hoary old sea captain and young seamen.  But peace does not last. Godzilla, grown massive and even more angered by American nuclear tests, returns and lays waste to Ginza. This scene alone is worth the price of admission. As the bass thunder fusillade that is the great lizard’s theme music kicks into gear, a genuine sense of dread and awe ensues. It is a rare feeling in this cinematic period, when every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie is doing its utmost to foster such a reaction and often proving wildly underwhelming. Here it just works.  Whether it’s the near-obliterating scale of destruction or the fact that Godzilla seems genuinely enraged, something unusual happens in this sequence. The ubiquity and familiarity we have with the character retreats, and we see him for what he originally stood for: a symbol of ultimate destruction unleashed. War itself.  There are plenty of culturally specific details in Minus One, beginning with the film’s title that refers to postwar Japan when reduced to a state of nullity. With the entrance of Godzilla, the country and its people are pushed to less than zero.  References to the failure of the government to support its citizens and the hypocrisy and waste of the war effort, in everything from jet fighters that lacked even the most basic safety measures to the inability to organize a counterattack when Tokyo is levelled, are all marched out with little fanfare. It’s the ordinary people who pull together to mount a resistance, yelling at the top of their lungs for almost the entirety of the action. I love a good yeller of a film, and this one is a corker. The stage is set for a final showdown between human cleverness and brute strength in the bay of Tokyo. Sacrifice, courage and community all come together to send the beast packing. But the film ends on a strangely ominous note: you may defeat him, but he’s never truly gone. He will rise again until we learn to stop brutalizing each other.  So take your medicine, humanity: a spanking from the bus-sized paw of an enormous scaly symbol, the deified lizard. We deserve a dose of mighty justice and that’s what Godzilla provides.

"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"You definitely feel for all these characters and and the choices that they make, and that adds a surprising amount of like emotional heft to what could have just been a thrilling but a purely exciting escapist action film."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE," El MonsterVerse — al menos, su versión estadounidense — ha tenido un recorrido irregular por la pantalla grande. Con varios proyectos fallidos — incluyendo la olvidable cinta dirigida por el director Roland Emmerich — la tradicional saga Kaiju tuvo problemas para encontrar su público. Finalmente, lo hizo con la sólida Godzilla del año 2014 y dirigida por Gareth Edwards.  La producción trajo a Hollywood los elementos esenciales del creciente universo de la franquicia. Pero a pesar de que la cinta renovó el interés en los titanes, ninguno de los argumentos que le siguieron tuvieron tanto éxito ¿El motivo? Olvidar el origen, historia y contexto de la mitología del monstruo titular. Un error grave en un conjunto de películas que ya abarca 32 en Japón y 4 en Norteamérica.  Godzilla Minus One de Takashi Yamazaki, recupera lo mejor del cine de Kaiju y lo mezcla con los puntos más importantes de la tradición de Godzilla. Ambientada en Japón después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la película convierte al titán en una amenaza violenta, imparable y voraz, muy lejos de su benigna versión estadounidense. Tal vez por ese motivo, el realizador nipón Takashi Yamazaki decidió volver a los elementos esenciales de la saga en Godzilla Minus One (2023). Lo que sorprende, por ser un riesgo visual y argumental. Los largometrajes hollywoodenses — éxitos de taquilla considerables — tienen su propia estética e historia. De manera que volver al centro de la tradición de Godzilla, que ya abarca casi 70 años, es comenzar de cero. Algo que el director logra al mezclar las premisas conocidas con un toque contemporáneo. Todo, bajo un apartado visual que asombra por ser sobrio, bien construido y sin nada de envidiar a los proyectos que le triplican en presupuesto. Precisamente, lo que más sorprende en Godzilla Minus One, es lo mucho que puede hacer el director, con limitados recursos. A nivel narrativo, volver a los tiempos en que el monstruo prehistórico era una alegoría a la guerra nuclear, es un acierto. Desde su prólogo, el argumento deja claro que Godzilla es una bestia furiosa. Una que es imposible — al menos, por medios sencillos — y que arrasará todo a su paso. Atrás quedó el cine norteamericano de volver a la criatura un antihéroe o un villano. Aquí, el titán es una fuerza de la naturaleza que avanza en medio de la destrucción total.  Ambientada a finales de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, los primeros minutos de la película, cuentan todo lo que hay que saber para comprender su argumento. Lo cual incluye, cómo el piloto kamikaze Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) toma la dramática decisión de desertar. Lo que podría parecer un acto de supervivencia en medio de la guerra, se convierte entonces en el centro de su comportamiento y decisiones a futuro. Abrumado por la culpa y enfrentado a un monstruo, al parecer fruto de la radiación, para el personaje las opciones son pocas. Una de ellas, es cuidar de Noriko (Minami Hamabe), que intenta salvar, a su vez, la vida de un bebé desconocido. El trío avanza entre los escombros de Tokio y después, deberá morir bajo las garras implacables de Godzilla.  La trama, aprovecha la química entre sus personajes, para convertirlos en símbolos de la ciudad bajo los escombros. Un punto que el director destaca a través de primeros planos de edificios caídos y ruinas humeantes. Es, por cierto, la misma imagen de cualquier otra cinta de Godzilla que se precie, pero esta ocasión, más acabada y mejor concebida. Takashi Yamazaki toma algunas ideas de Shin Godzilla (2016) de Hideaki Anno y Shinji Higuchi para completar su atmósfera. Lo que incluye, el tono emotivo y humano de la trama. A diferencia de las producciones norteamericanas, en la película japonesa, los personajes de menos de veinte metros también importan.  Pero sin duda, esta es una historia basada en la tradición de Godzilla y a eso dedica buena parte de su metraje. Esta vez, el lagarto monumental más famoso del cine, es un evento natural equiparable a un ataque atómico. Lo que se muestra en cómo, a su paso, nada sobrevive. No se trata de maldad o un villano de pacotilla. Es simplemente una consecuencia de algo más grande — si eso es posible — y de esa manera se le trata.  El director utilizar efectos especiales prácticos, que permiten a la criatura tener una movilidad limitada, torpe y orgánica. Recuperada su cualidad de bestia sin control, toda la cinta se sostiene de la amenaza que representa. Además, los escasos recursos de los personajes para contenerle o en cualquier caso, salvar la vida de su ataque. El guion — también del director — hace énfasis, en esta violencia que se destaca en tomas abiertas, en el titán muestra su ferocidad.  Claro está, no sería una relato de Godzilla sin algunos giros de guion sensibleros o heroicos para sus personajes humanos. Pero, aun así, la cinta conserva su cualidad salvaje la mayor parte del tiempo. A la vez, que hace de su colosal protagonista titular, una espantosa visión sobre el miedo y lo inevitable. Un detalle sutil que hace de la cinta algo más que una colección de escenas brutales sobre seres humanos arrojados al vacío o rayos azules radiactivos cruzando el aire. "
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla is a monster that just refuses to go quietly into that good night. Time and again filmmakers return to the city-smashing lizard (sorry Kaiju) to try and conjure up its magic, and time and again they fail. Since 1998, there have been four Hollywood movies featuring the so-called King of the Monsters with a fifth, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, arriving in April (the big lump’s 70th birthday). It also appears in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, a series that landed on Apple TV+ last month. None of them, really, set the world alight. In Japan, however, it’s a whole different level – with the monster first appearing in a 1954 movie in which it attacked Tokyo after being awakened by H-bomb testing, all the way up to the 30th live action film which lands this week: Godzilla Minus One. This really shows Hollywood how it's done. This latest film has stripped the format back to its roots, set it shortly after the Second World War with a load of social messages and ladled on lashings of the monster – no holding back for a slow reveal here. And in doing so, the filmmakers have conjured up a thoroughly entertaining, thought-provoking blockbuster at a fraction of the cost of any of its Hollywood counterparts – supposedly it was made for just $15m. Written and directed by acclaimed filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, this has real flair, mixing a wonderfully realised period setting with proper emotional depth, and a monster that absolutely looks the part, the part of knocking over skyscrapers with its tail and munching on train carriages. The title is a reference to post war Japan being reduced to zero, and then, according to the production notes, when Godzilla shows up it “plunges the country into a negative state”. Japan is on its knees, how will it respond? Well for one thing, the filmmakers make clear there's not much point looking to its government. There is an anti-politics/politicians message running through the film  (One character says, ""This country has treated life far too cheaply"") which backs the citizens instead to band together, formulate a plan and somehow destroy this relentless, seemingly unstoppable force.  At the heart of the tale is Koichi, played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, a man wracked with guilt after he decides against
completing a kamikaze mission during the Second World War, instead landing on an island with a group of engineers. Up pops Godzilla killing everyone except him and one other who blames him for not opening fire on the monster with some heavy artillery. Back on the mainland, trying to cope with the disgrace he feels at failing to carry out his kamikaze mission, and indeed stopping Godzilla, he meets Minami Hamabe’s Noriko, who is looking after a baby orphaned during the war.  The bond grows between these outcasts and they create something of a misfit family. But their happiness is short lived as the big lizard comes storming back, smashing up everything in its way. The people come up with a plan and Koichi sees the chance for redemption. This film clearly has a deep love of Godzilla and the character's history, and the camera lingers on the monster – giving the audience what it wants – in great detail, a marvel with those budget restrictions. Up close, from afar, underwater… the great kaiju is gloriously recreated. But it is also, crucially, a film that has an emotional heart and with central characters you can root for. This is a film about rebuilding out of destruction, about friends, families and communities standing together to face implacable forces that threaten them, and it is about second chances. Also it’s a ruddy great romp. It’s explosive, heart pumping stuff, steeped in the films’ lore and does justice to one of movie history’s most iconic monsters."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE," Ever since Ishirô Honda’s prolific 1954 film, Godzilla, the titular kaiju has starred in multiple films that vary from exploring the impact humanity has had on its own environment and society, to the campy battle royales between gargantuan beasts. Humanity has always been involved in these stories, and in some cases, the complaint is that there’s not enough Godzilla (Gareth Edwards’ 2014 film, Godzilla, received many complaints along those lines). What is surprising about Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One is not that it’s focused on the human side of conflict, but that it manages to do that while reminding audiences what makes Godzilla so terrifying. It’s not just a monster, it’s a mirror image of society and the perpetual war machine that destroys it over and over. Set in postwar Japan, amid tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, Godzilla Minus One pulls no punches when addressing the political climate and general hesitancy to protect its people from future conflicts. Opening at the tail-end of World War II, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) makes a sudden landing on Odo Island to have his plane repaired. A kamikaze pilot with second thoughts, the disgrace to his country is outweighed by his desire not to die. However, he bears the burden of death anyway as the entire island is attacked by a mysterious monster - named “Godzilla” by the local inhabitants. Somehow surviving the attack, he returns home to Tokyo only to discover his family was killed by a series of air raid bombings launched by the United States.  Traumatized by the attack on Odo Island and the wreckage he has returned to in Tokyo, Koichi’s despair is alleviated temporarily by a run-in with Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the air raids who swore to take care of a mother’s child when evacuating. Koichi now finds himself sharing his home with Noriko and the two form a bond out of their shared loneliness. To make ends meet, Koichi joins a small group of ex-military personnel who are now acting as minesweepers, going through the ocean and removing submerged mines now that the war is over. However, the peace that allows for Japan to heal and rebuild is interrupted by the return of Godzilla, who is now massive and angry thanks to the nuclear tests done by the United States at Bikini Atoll.  Right from the outset, it is clear that Yamazaki’s screenplay has a lot to say about Japan’s government and the way soldiers are convinced that the best way to help their country is through sacrifice. Koichi’s fateful introduction to Godzilla is one where he shouldn’t have even been there; he should have been dead. Throughout the opening scene, he’s given multiple moments to throw his life on the line, and he freezes each and every time. It’s perceived as a failure to his country, to his family’s honor, and to himself. Flashes of the attack now haunt him throughout the film and he struggles to separate his life from Godzilla’s. Had he acted on Odo Island, could he have stopped Godzilla? Emotionally stirring as it is, with an arc that tugs on heartstrings far more effectively than most would expect from a kaiju film, Godzilla Minus One is also an outright spectacle. The scale is tremendous to behold and combined with Naoki Satô’s updating of the iconic Godzilla theme music becomes this monolithic force of nature. As Godzilla’s havoc threatens Japan’s infrastructure, it’s met with a surprising lack of retaliation. He’s unstoppable, and the Japanese government does not want to burden the rest of the world with its problems, so it seems to do almost nothing. That the major conflict in Godzilla Minus One ends up being between the intimidating scale and force of Godzilla and private citizens forced to act when their government refuses, shows a complete disregard for human life and a country’s own citizens during wartime. It’s not the people that they’re worried about losing, it’s the infrastructure or the alliances. This also explains why a lot of Godzilla Minus One’s action takes place at sea. With that comes incredibly detailed setpieces designed to highlight the scale of its monster and the tense inevitability that nothing can stop Godzilla from coming ashore. It also emphasizes lives lost a little more clearly than letting Godzilla create wanton destruction throughout the city streets. When he takes down a building, the loss is only felt if humans are shown in danger - too often, we see buildings destroyed during evacuations and it’s now commonplace that they have to show us someone being crushed by its debris. If it takes out a small fishing boat in a vast empty sea, the loss is more clearly indicated. That boat isn’t just infrastructure; it’s someone’s livelihood and didn’t just drift out to sea. It results in something far more harrowing but also surrounds Koichi with a constant reminder of his guilt about Odo Island. Godzilla isn’t just an enemy force at this point and takes on the physical embodiment of Koichi’s guilt - a guilt spurred on by a government that assigned him to die a pilot, and the country’s citizens that turned their back on him when he failed to do so. Again, Yamazaki’s screenplay packs so many ideas into it that it’s easy to see Godzilla representing one thing versus another depending on the context and the person you’re talking to about it. At first, the film seems to be about self-preservation, and then it spirals into a PTSD-ridden reminder of the horrors of war until it’s a powerful statement on the will to live - something that can have potency from both Koichi and Godzilla’s perspective. If kaiju destruction is what you crave out of your Godzilla films, Godzilla Minus One delivers a disaster epic worthy of the character’s legacy. That alone would be enough to make Godzilla Minus One a stellar addition to the prolific franchise. However, Yamazaki goes further to cement Godzilla Minus One as the best Godzilla film since 2016’s Shin Godzilla and stands tall alongside Honda’s monumental classic. "
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE," GODZILLA MINUS ONE, THE HIGHEST-GROSSING live-action Japanese film of all time in America, understands one very key fact about Godzilla that so many Godzilla movies forget: Godzilla is terrifying. While the various urges of commercial filmmaking command, time and again, that Godzilla becomes a hero, fighting off even nastier monsters and defending mankind from destruction while generating respectful awe rather than overt terror, the simple fact of the matter is that Godzilla is a pure nightmare blown up to gigantic proportions. Just think of the beast in your mind’s eye: he’s a skyscraper-sized lizard who shoots atomic blue fire from his throat that results in catastrophic atomic-style detonations. Having him show up in your neighborhood would ruin your whole week, maybe even your month. Even if he wasn’t trying to hurt people the simple mechanics of his body movements would lay waste to whole city blocks. A twitch of the tail would obliterate a tenement; every step would crush a school bus full of nuns and/or cheerleaders. All of which is to say that Godzilla Minus One’s opening moments feature some of the most impressively visceral Godzilla action in recent years. Following the return to Odo Island of Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot whose cowardice prevented him from carrying out his suicide mission, Godzilla leaps from the ocean and annihilates the small crew of airmen and mechanics stationed on the island. Given a second opportunity to prove his bravery—by leaping into the airplane and turning its machine guns on the monster—Koichi again quails, running for cover instead. Good thing: Godzilla isn’t messing around. He’s here to kill the intruders in his territory, and bullets aren’t likely to have much of an effect. Fast-forward a couple of years—following reconstruction efforts in Japan, as Koichi builds a life with the homeless Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the young orphan girl Akiko (Sae Nagatani), and Godzilla soaks up some radiation courtesy of the Americans at Bikini Atoll—and the monster is back, bigger and meaner than ever, laying claim to much of the Japanese sea and demolishing gargantuan battleships with little more than a swipe of his claws. The Godzilla seen in later sequences is a little slower but much larger and even more indestructible: at one point, the titanic lizard is swimming through the water after Koichi and his minesweeper crew’s boat, half-submerged, half-visible, entirely terrifying. Neither machine guns nor mines can stop the brute, and death seems certain. Though their tiny wood boat is saved at the last minute, the near-encounter drives home the sheer scale of Godzilla. When he sets foot in Ginza, viewers and residents alike can’t help but gawp at the size of the beast. We see most of the action from ground level, his tail speeding through streets and buildings like a blunted scythe slashing through wheat, the dull blade harvesting ragged chunks of city street. Unlike The Boy and the Heron, the other Japanese film sharing space on American box office charts (and discussed on this week’s Across the Movie Aisle), the symbolism in Godzilla Minus One is relatively straightforward. Rather than being a symbol of America’s nuclear might, Godzilla himself antedates the war and represents the Japanese government’s inability to be honest with its citizens about their place in the world, a monstrous iteration of the government’s—and the citizenry’s—belief that the Japanese should fight to the last man, regardless of the untenability of their situation. The government is not just useless to stop the giant lizard; it actively misinforms the people, leaving them vulnerable to Godzilla’s wrath. Men like Koichi are made to feel as though they are cowards for failing to die in the doomed effort to stop the onslaught. But the people are stronger than their feckless leaders, pulling together in their time of darkness to win the day, stop the beast, save their cities, and yadda yadda yadda. Godzilla Minus One is a big, terrifying piece of melodrama, the blockbuster flourishes spaced out enough to give the heartfelt (some might sneer “overly wrought”) emotion at the picture’s core space to breathe. One thing I wasn’t entirely expecting: how much Godzilla Minus One’s final act owes to recent Christopher Nolan pictures. Yes, yes, the whole thing about the irradiated monster wreaking havoc is a secret sequel to Oppenheimer, har har. But there are indisputable flashes of Dunkirk and The Dark Knight Rises in the climactic sequence, and the whole thing is done with a similar combination of heartfelt and heart-pounding cross-cutting, weaving points of view and action spectaculars and stirring parental emotional beats together with aplomb."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla fans have been feasting lately. Not only have we seen a glimpse of the giant lizard in Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters, Godzilla Minus One finally arrives on UK screens with plenty of hype around it, after it went on to gross over $50 million worldwide against a reported budget of $15 million. However, director Yamazaki has implied their budget was far less than that, making the film even more impressive.  Godzilla Minus One effortlessly lives up to the hype surrounding it and even exceeds it. Most Kaiju films, especially Godzilla films, have struggled to balance out the human emotion with big Kaiju action, but Yamazaki makes it look so easy here.  The story is set in the 1940s (Godzilla has always been linked to nuclear attacks, especially those by Americans against Japan) and we witness the action through the eyes of Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a former kamikaze pilot in the war who still grapples with a strong sense of guilt. Shikishima encounters Godzilla early on, but sees a way to redeem himself by helping defeat the monster, which now terrorises mainland Japan.  If Monarch: Legacy of Monsters suffered tremendously from not having enough Kaijus, Godzilla Minus One has no such issue. In the first 30 minutes alone, you get two major scenes with Godzilla and for a film with such a limited budget, it easily tops Marvel’s latest films with its CGI. Some of the filmmaking choices on Yamazaki’s part come across as a little clumsy and rudimentary, but Godzilla Minus One is without a doubt one of the year’s best action films.  As for the big guy himself… This Godzilla is a proper monster, a horrific, terrifying creature with ear-shattering roars. Yamazaki challenges the idea we’ve collectively accepted since Jaws that when it comes to monsters, less is more. No! More is more and we want it, we want it now! Much care has gone into Yamazaki’s version of Godzilla; the way the creature charges its famous atomic breath, clicking each of its tail and back spikes into position and pausing for just a moment before unleashing the deadly heat ray which annihilates anything in its way. Just writing about it is giving me goosebumps.  The human characters have always been the weakest link in Godzilla films. Focus too much on them and the audience feels cheated out of Godzilla, but focus too much on the supercharged lizard and your story has no emotional base. The human characters in Yamazaki’s film are deceptively simple, but fully fleshed. Shikishima’s motivations are simple, clear and relatable and his character is developed through the inclusion of Noriko, a young woman he takes in with an orphaned child, Akiko. Their relationship is never at the forefront of the film, but it gives us someone to care for, someone to root for as Godzilla destroys the city around them.  Godzilla Minus One doesn’t exactly reinvent the wheel with its storyline; the film comes with a degree of predictability, but I found myself not bothered by knowing where the film is going due to the sheer amount of fun I was having. I was surprisingly moved by the last 15 minutes, more than I was expecting to be in a film of this scale. The plotting on Yamazaki’s part can be a little mechanical, but he’s able to create and sustain tension masterfully.  This feels like a proper, old-school Godzilla film where Godzilla is allowed to be the villain of the story again. The human characters are compelling, but never steal the thunder from our favourite atomic lizard. If Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters left you wanting more Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One scratches that itch and then some.  Kurt and Wyatt Russell lead an ensemble cast in this uneven monster of a TV show. Here’s our full review of Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters.  Godzilla Minus One is the 37th(!) instalment in the iconic Godzilla franchise. Here’s the second, smashing trailer:

"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE," A lot of people have said this, but I agree: The new Godzilla movie has a much better grasp of both storytelling and action filmmaking than probably 95 percent of what Hollywood has been churning out lately. It has clear stakes, it knows how to set up and pay off emotional beats, and for the majority of the action sequences, you can see what’s going on. Revolutionary, I know. It’s the last of several movies this year to come out of nowhere and truly engage with audiences.  When it comes to action-adventure, it was the long-in-the-tooth franchises that came through, all doing very innovative things. The three best action movies I saw in 2023 were the fourth John Wick, the seventh Mission: Impossible, and the 37th Godzilla.  Film critic Vince Mancini, whose podcast the Filmdrunk Frotcast has been one of my favorites for many years, is now writing a Substack called The Content Report, and I encourage you all to subscribe. He’s got reviews, but also some first-rate analysis of where content and the Internet are today.  Once I was forced out of the media brand I helped to build, it was clearer than ever that I essentially had zero control over what happened to virtually my entire portfolio and the evidence of my working life for more than 15 years. I created it, but I don’t own it, and I don’t get any say on what happens to it (which was mostly true even when I still worked there). I’ve come to rely on Google and my past work as much as my own brain when it comes to trying to remember what movies I saw in 2012 or my interests in 2017. Conde Nast did a bunch of layoffs earlier this month, and ensnared among them was humorist Andy Borowitz, author of The New Yorker’s The Borowitz Report humor column.  “Your conservative uncles might go on Facebook every day and share conspiracy theories and racist memes. But it’s your liberal uncles who share something arguably even more horrifying: Andy Borowitz columns.” Borowitz, for the last several years, has been posting the most witless, obvious, bite-free political satire; the New Yorker purchased his website, The Borowitz Report, in 2012. For this, for years, he was rewarded with a nearly permanent spot at the top of the magazine’s most-read stories list, often overtaking some of the best reporting from some of the best journalists in the world. Also, most of the great journalists who you think of as “New Yorker writers” are not employees of the magazine; Borowitz, it appears, was.  Among Borowitz’s final pieces for the New Yorker are “George Santos to Spend More Time with Imaginary Family,” “Ivanka Unable to Remember Name of Her Father” and “Clarence Thomas Collapses from Exhaustion After First Full Day of Regulating Himself.” Forget Trump, abortion, and Israel. America’s greatest divide may be between those who think Andy Borowitz is funny and those who don’t. If you’re left of center and your parents are still alive, chances are they love him. I think he makes Mark Russell look like Bill Hicks.  Borowitz, despite the layoff, should be okay for money. And that’s because, in case you didn’t realize, he is also the co-creator of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Sure, the show wasn’t his idea, he and his then-wife were essentially assigned to executive produce it, and he only worked on it for the first season. But I imagine he’s collected a massive amount of royalties from that, over the years.  Lear, who died this week at the age of 101, had the longest and most prolific career of any TV producer, writer, and creator in history, making such shows as All in the Family, Good Times, Maude, Sanford and Son, The Jeffersons, and many more, several of which were spinoffs of others.  Throughout, Lear’s work was stridently political and progressive, and probably the best possible version of that particular style. Everyone remembers how different audiences got different things out of the character of Archie Bunker, but Lear was never afraid to make a political statement — often a controversial one — with his work.  Lear’s career as a TV writer began in the 1940s when he was in his 20s, and he continued to have credits well into his 90s, executive producing the great One Day at a Time re-imagining that started in 2017.  Pluto TV, this week, is running marathons of several of the Lear shows. And the great 2016 documentary Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You can be rented from Amazon and Apple. Hopefully, PBS, which ran it a while back, will air it again soon.  Last week, after George Santos was expelled from Congress, political writer Josh Barro wrote a brilliant political obituary, fitting Santos into a Republican Party that he sees as “dominated by high camp miscreants” like Donald Trump, Kari Lake, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, who “stand on the shoulders of the homosexuals who created the trashy reality TV aesthetic they are living out.” It seems you can be a gay Republican, or you can be a messy-bitch-who-lives-for-drama Republican, but being both at the same time remains a bridge too far for many conservatives. Or, maybe the way to put it is that Republican voters’ growing tolerance for crime by politicians does not extend to extremely gay crimes like stealing campaign funds to pay for Botox. We have made much progress toward equality, but this shows that there is always more work to be done. Santos, of course, has been compared to a Bravo villain, but Andy Cohen has gone on record that he doesn’t want Santos on his network. (Though were his crimes any worse than those of Teresa Giudice?) However, the ex-Congressman may be headed to another cable network: Yes, HBO.  Could this result in a good movie? Who knows. There’s certainly plenty of material there. But Santos’ story is one of those so over-the-top that it’s hard to imagine a fictional story topping the real thing. This is one of those projects where they’ll probably have to cut out some of his crimes for time. This week, here at the Substack, I reviewed Poor Things and crowned it the best movie of the year, reviewed Matt Singer’s book about Siskel and Ebert, looked back on the 10th anniversary of Inside Llewyn Davis, and reviewed the documentary We Live Here: The Midwest.  For the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, I went through the most Jewish moments in Barbra Streisand’s new memoir, “My Name is Barbra.” The story also got picked up by The Forward and the Jerusalem Post.  For AppleInsider, it’s the latest crime blotter. I appear to have beaten most of the world to that story about a thief refusing to take his victim’s Android phone because it wasn’t an iPhone.  Next week: A big project I’ve been working on for a while, the latest incarnation of the Oompa Loompas, and documentaries about comedies and a sports legend. As always, thank you for your support. "
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE," There’s a certain formula to most genre films, especially monster movies like those belonging to the Godzilla franchise where the kaiju is the real star of the film. Human characters are essentially along for the ride, able to soak up large chunks of the runtime while serving as useful cannon fodder for the carnage the audience is there to witness. Few filmmakers working in the space dare to treat their human characters as people, cutting corners toward an inevitable destination amongst an ocean of forgettable, watchable B-movies. Godzilla Minus One, the 37th live-action release in the franchise and 33rd produced by Toho Studios in Japan, a company that owes practically its entire success to the titular sea monster, understands its place as the titan of the kaiju genre. The original 1954 Godzilla still holds tremendous power for its social commentary on a country still reeling from the fallout of nuclear war. There will always be a certain novelty in watching a stunt double in a rubber suit kicking down prop buildings, but the underpinning of this franchise’s success is how bleakly raw its messaging can be when the series takes itself seriously. Minus One takes the series back to its World War II roots, centering its narrative on Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who abandoned his duties, instead faking plane difficulties to land on Odo Island in the Pacific toward the end of the war. Shikishima bears witness to Godzilla ravaging the island, horrors only matched by the carnage left on the mainland after the atomic bomb was dropped. Returning home bearing the mark of a coward, Shikishima starts to rebuild his life by taking in a woman Noriko (Minami Hamabe) into his home, along with a small baby she found abandoned in a landscape with few survivors. Shikishima finds work as a minesweeper, bonding with his crewmates while learning to live with his guilt. A few years later, the military starts to prepare for Godzilla’s inevitable return, keeping the broader public in the dark even under the bleak outlook. Director Takashi Yamazaki peppers the narrative with vital social commentary about the failures of the Japanese government to adequately relay information in the tumultuous 1940s, largely leaving citizens on their own to survive in an environment still reeling from some of the worst cruelties mankind has ever wrought upon itself. Minus One succeeds through its courage to earnestly invest in exploring the rich complexities of humanity, a gamble few blockbusters dare to make. If that wasn’t enough, Yamazaki also delivers elite practical effects. This is a film that deeply respects the people who came to spend time in its playground. It seems almost foolish to sing such high praises for attributes such as a good script, superb acting, and top-tier visuals, but such elements are often missing from cinema in the year 2023. Beyond just the sheer caliber of the bread and butter filmmaking, Minus One is a richly optimistic narrative. Too many modern blockbusters rest their laurels on larger-than-life heroes with no grounding in human struggles. Yamazaki puts his film’s entire stock in people, everyday humans with flaws who ultimately stare unimaginable odds dead in the face and fight on anyway. 2023 has been a bleak year amidst a broader sea of hopelessness across our modern landscape. It really does often feel like it sucks to be alive in this modern era. Cinema isn’t just supposed to provide mindless escapism. The beauty of the big screen lies in its power to transform the mindsets of the people who paid a bit of money to take a seat for a journey to a world with fresh perspectives and new ideas. The beauty of art is to remind us that even if the shining city on a hill is going to be an uphill climb, it is our narrative arc as humanity to break our baser instincts and fight on for a world worth living in. Though its 125-minute runtime could have used a scene or two shaved off its somewhat bloated third act, Yamazaki has produced one of the best films of the year. We’re living in a precarious time for the industry as so many other mediums vie for consumer’s attention. Godzilla Minus One is a breathtaking tour-de-force for the power of cinema itself, a much-needed reminder of how good it feels to sit in a movie theater when studios actually invest in work that respects the humanity of its audience.

"Dec 13, 2023",NEUTRAL," Anyone who has the temerity to write off Godzilla (fucking Godzilla!) as a spent force of franchise filmmaking will need to backtrack right now. On the evidence of Takashi Yamazaki’s rip-snorting historical action epic, Godzilla Minus One, there’s still some nuclear-powered juice in the lumbering metaphorical lizard yet. The industrious director, who also wrote the screenplay and collaborated on the (very slick) special effects work, strips the story back to basics, keeping context and exposition to a minimum and leaning on robust, timeworn plot mechanics that focus on delivering chunky thrills. The filmmaker has been open in interviews about his love of Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan, and the evidence is up there on screen. But he has not pilfered their stylistic tics, but more their supreme storytelling tactics and the slow, intense build-up to a big finale. It’s a “back to basics” film which replays the story with a very straight bat, and it seems that the weird variations on the Godzilla mythos (see 2016’s Shin Godzilla) have been swept aside from something more purely entertaining. It’s 1945 in Japan, and things are not going well on the World War Two front, to put it mildly. Even the kamikaze pilots are finding excuses to not sacrifice their lives for what they now see as a lost cause – such is the case with pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who lands his plane on an island service base, complaining of machine faults as a way to shirk his nationalistic responsibility. Unlucky for him and the gang of engineers who take him in, Godzilla decides to roll up from the sea and pay them a smashy-smashy visit, which results in widespread murder. Shikishima, scared out of his wits, doesn’t have the nerve to fire upon the beast from the cockpit of his downed plane, and is thus blamed for the wipeout. Back in Tokyo and racked with guilt, he takes in a woman and her orphan child and decides to join a crew of seabound mine sweepers in order to pay his – and their – way. It’s not long before he’s got some more face-time with his scaly, heat ray-blasting pal who, it transpires, can self-heal from all the heavy ordinance fire it takes. It’s after this second big action set piece that the touchpaper is lit for a grand climax which plays out in classic heist movie style: we hear the details and justifications for the madcap plan to destroy Godzilla in immaculate detail, and then must palm-sweat intensely as it all precariously plays out. The film and its subtexts all say one thing: don’t prod the monster. Godzilla, in its defence, only reacts violently when humans start to shoot at it. And the same lesson can be taken when it comes to nuclear diplomacy in the postwar period, although one may question the notion suggested here that Japan entirely brought on their problems when it came to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet Yamazaki’s film works as a perfect entry point to the franchise and doesn’t require any prior knowledge of Godzilla or his city-levelling pals. It’s precision-tooled in terms of structure, almost to the point of airlessness, but you’d be hard-pressed to knock back the final 45-minute showdown as anything less than an impressive feat by a filmmaker orchestrating and charting the fine processes of an epic battle.

"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE," There are bazillions of Godzilla films out there, both from Japan and the US and this latest contribution to the franchise is one of the very best. It’s up there with the original 1954 film, the clever reboot from a few years ago Shin Godzilla, and my personal favourite, Godzilla vs the Smog Monster, AKA Godzilla vs Hedorah (1972), which rocks because it has extras in white gogo boots, head-trip sequences and, in the English dubbed version, a kicker of a theme song called Save the Earth. However, like the other two aforementioned great Godzilla films, this one works because it puts the trauma of history at the very centre of the story, ultimately crafting a story about human beings pulling together to heal and defeat an inexplicable force of destruction. Minus One starts in the very last days of the second world war, a uniquely bleak moment in Japanese history. Protagonist Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is supposed to fly a kamikaze mission but, overcome by fear and an understandable desire to live, he lands on Odo island (a deep cut from Godzilla lore) to fix a made-up engine failure. Godzilla, a monster familiar to the locals, attacks and kills nearly everyone on the island, and once again fear stops Shikishima from fighting back. Shikishima returns to a Tokyo burned and smashed to smithereens by the Allied firebombing to find his parents dead, his home a pile of matchsticks. Nevertheless, he builds a makeshift family of sorts with a young woman called Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who also lost everything, and a baby Akiko (adorably played by Sae Nagatani later as a three-year-old), whom Noriko was charged with looking after when she saw Akiko’s mother die in a bomb shelter. Years pass and this little nuclear family looks poised to benefit from the postwar phoenix-like recovery of the nation. But there are other kinds of nuclear force at play here, especially in the Bikini Atoll where the H-bomb is tested. In the original Godzilla movie, the big bad horror was the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by Oppenheimer and co’s A-bomb, along with anxieties about the nuclear testing in the Pacific, cited in the film as a contributing factor to Godzilla’s genetic mutation. In the contemporary-set Shin Godzilla, the fault lies with institutions and international relations, but an efficient marshalling of those same apparatuses is instrumental, along with a knowledge of origami, to defeat Godzilla. Either way, in all three the saviour is most certainly not some deus ex monstera like King Kong or similar – a move particularly favoured by the American Godzilla films. Instead, in Godzilla Minus One, the most effective means to counteract Godzilla involves private citizens (tellingly, not the government) pulling together voluntarily to pool knowledge and form an effective chain of command to science the crap out of stopping him. For long stretches Shikishima and Noriko practically disappear into the background, apart from one especially wrenching moment when they’re caught up in the big-footed lizard’s destruction of Ginza. Director Takashi Yamazaki masterfully tightens and loosens the emotional screws throughout, abetted by a stunning, throbbing minimalist score by Naoki Satô. Yamazaki also knows how to play with scale, moving between the intimacy of the little family and their fragile lives and the almost incomprehensible scale of the monster, capable of swishing away whole city blocks with a flick of his tail. This is not a cuddly version of Godzilla. He is rageful and entirely incomprehensible, seemingly not even motivated by hunger, desire or revenge. Like a god, he just is, an entity that has become death, the destroyer of worlds, as ineluctable as history itself."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One is the first modern Godzilla film to come along that feels spiritually connected to the original movie from 1954. It could pass as a reboot with moments like the train sequence feeling like both a throwback and a contemporary update. But it’s so much more. In 1945, during the last days of World War II, a kamikaze pilot named Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki, Suzume) landed on Odo Island, claiming his aircraft malfunctioned. That night, a dinosaur-like beast locals call “Godzilla” attacks and kills everyone except for Koichi and Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki, The Roundup: No Way Out), the lead mechanic. A year later, Koichi returns home only to find out that his parents have died in the bombing of Tokyo. He gets a job as a minesweeper to support a woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe, Shin Kamen Rider) and an orphaned little girl named Akiko (Sae Nagatani). Still haunted by fleeing from his duty as a kamikaze pilot during the war and the men who died on Odo Island, Koichi’s guilt hits rock bottom when Godzilla returns mutated and much bigger than before. As Godzilla begins carving a wave of destruction towards Tokyo and military weapons do not stop him, it’s up to the civilians with war experience to formulate a plan that will hopefully keep the unstoppable monster from destroying the rest of Japan. While the original film capitalized on the war, Godzilla Minus One picks up as the war ends and Japan is at its lowest. As Godzilla strikes, Japanese defenses are at their weakest or practically nonexistent. With nothing at their disposal, they have to rely on outside forces to attempt to stand toe-to-toe with Godzilla. It is their job to stall for time, and all they can do is sit, watch, and die once the monster steps ashore. It’s mesmerizing, but it’s also absolutely terrifying. Godzilla goes through changes again to reach colossal proportions, but he has a minor evolution compared to Shin Godzilla with only two different forms in Minus One. As a youngling, Godzilla is smaller and faster, and moreover, the atomic bomb is seemingly still the cause of its birth – perhaps in both instances. The sequences of it stomping and trashing things are as devastating as they are sorrowfully impressive.  The camp associated with the rubber suit days is a distant memory, and likewise, the Godzilla here seems like a far ‘SKREE-ONNKK’ away from the MonsterVerse counterpart. Humans are these annoying obstacles to monstrous destruction in those films, while most of the kaiju know how to smash yet don’t have as much cause or anger behind the devastation. There are some awe-inspiring Godzilla sequences in Minus One beginning with its atomic breath wiping out cities instantly, leaving Godzilla smoldering. Seeing that blue wave slowly migrate up the fins of its tail to the back of its head is executed in a refreshing and harrowing way. The boat chase is a thing of beauty, as well. Godzilla swallowing explosive mines that are then shot at by the mine-exterminating boat crew results in one of the most exhilarating sequences ever realized in the franchise. The cast doesn’t phone in either. Seeing Minus One, you are witness to a once-in-a-lifetime instance of a unique big monster movie where humans are as intriguing as the creature. You feel invested in Koichi’s inability to escape the war and Godzilla’s indestructibility. On the home front, Koichi and Noriko aren’t romantically involved, and Akiko isn’t related to either, but the bold writing choice pays off. The human characters can each live their own lives rather than always make joint decisions or always be in the same place together at once. The fact that Godzilla shows up and the fight against him brings the surrogate family back together makes the film all the more fascinating. The cinematography by Kozo Shibasaki helps give the impression that Godzilla is this inevitable force of nature.  The rampages feel intimate and make the audience feel like they’re part of a terrifying hysteria. Perspective-wise, you often look up at Godzilla as he stomps on unsuspecting people or bites down on them and hurls them into the sky. Godzilla Minus One is not only one of the best films out of the 30-plus in the series, but also one of the best films of the year. The acting is superb, the destruction is immense and incredible, and the gnarly Godzilla design is fantastic. It’s ridiculous, if true, that this film only has a budget of $15 million because it looks better than most Hollywood blockbusters."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE," Everything’s a performance in co-writer/director/star Bradley Cooper’s decades-spanning Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro. From Cooper’s much-debated prosthetic schnoz to the screwball pace of the clipped dialogue to the way the film jumps between gorgeous black-and-white and rich colour, Bernstein’s life is presented almost as if it’s one big show, its exuberant protagonist feeding hungrily off the energy of anyone in his orbit. It’s an appropriate way to approach such a towering figure, best remembered these days for composing West Side Story, but in his day a cultural colossus who helped make classical music accessible to the masses. The film presents him as a musical polymath, a restless spirit whose enormous success as a conductor, teacher and television personality risked undermining his development as a composer – the addictive pull of his public persona in constant battle with the introspection required to create great work. His personal life was no less schizophrenic. He was a man of omnivorous sexual appetites, unapologetically drawn to men and women, never personally tortured by his sexuality, but leaving a trail of emotional devastation in his wake, not least his wife and muse, the Costa Rica-born stage actress Felicia Montealegre. Played with brittle austerity by Carey Mulligan, she’s introduced to Lenny (everyone calls him Lenny) at a cocktail party, but in a portent of the marriage to come, Cooper has them fall in love on a literal stage – performative heterosexuality destined to be enacted many times over, with less and less conviction as the years go by. The early parts of the film are awash with dazzling flights of fancy that merge this nascent marital arrangement with Lenny’s fizzing creativity. Yet it soon becomes apparent Cooper is less interested in Bernstein’s art than he is in tracking Lenny’s growing disinterest in containing the chaos caused by his creative and sexual duality. Mostly this plays out in relation to Felicia. At one crucial performance, for instance, we see her edged into the wings, a shadowy figure no longer basking in the spotlight of his attention. When the film’s second half jumps ahead in time and to colour, discretion goes out the window, with Cooper framing one terrible domestic argument against the backdrop of a Thanksgiving day parade replete with a giant Snoopy inflatable drifting by their lavish apartment. Even marital discord is conducted with flair. The basic point Cooper seems to be circling is that their relationship was complex. Whatever deal Felicia made with herself to overlook her husband’s bisexuality, she also understood that he needed her more than he realised. We don’t learn much more about her than this, nothing certainly about her politics or the activism so mercilessly mocked for posterity by Tom Wolfe in his infamous essay Radical Chic. Nevertheless, Cooper builds the film’s musical climax around Bernstein’s implicit realisation that the virtuosic performance of Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 that he conducted at Ely Cathedral in 1973 was only possible because of what Felicia gave him, even if it’s never clear what exactly that was. Shot in a single six-minute take, the scene itself is a tour de force and, had Cooper ended the film there, Maestro would have brought the house down. But in deference to Mulligan, what should have been a line or two of epigraphical text detailing Felicia’s fate is instead transformed into an extended coda of Oscar-bating awfulness. Underscoring her martyrdom to her marriage, we get scene after scene of her decline from cancer, all of it beatifically rendered with wan smiles and decorous headscarves. These are swiftly followed by more scenes of Cooper in crinkly old-age make-up, still joyful, yet haunted now by all that he’s lost, REM’s Bernstein-referencing It’s The End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine) needle-dropped, inevitably, onto the soundtrack. It’s a bit much, a performance too far basking in the false glory of a self-generated ovation. Unlike Hollywood’s recent desecration of Godzilla with those Marvel-inspired “Monsterverse” movies, franchise originator Toho Studios’ latest domestic take, Godzilla Minus One, serves up a more tactile monster, one whose wanton destruction has more impact as a result. A lovingly conceived throwback to the original, it’s set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, with much of Japan decimated by war, and Godzilla (supersized by nuclear testing) wreaking havoc on the country at the lowest point in its history. Mercifully, the film takes a light-touch approach to using its star as an off-the-peg allegory for processing historical trauma, delivering instead blockbuster thrills with the visual panache of a modern effects extravaganza and some of the pastiching charm of the Beastie Boys’ Intergalactic video. Given her character’s titular billing, it’s disappointing that The Three Musketeers: Milady isn’t a full blown showcase for Eva Green’s take on Alexander Dumas’ treacherous femme fatale. Instead of moving front and centre in this concluding instalment of Martin Bourboulon’s two-part revamp of Dumas’s tale of swashbuckling derring do, she’s still playing second fiddle to François Civil’s D’Artagnan. If you’ve not seen that first part (released earlier this year), it’s probably best to acquaint yourself with it, though the tale is familiar enough to get the gist either way. The all-star supporting cast (among them Vincent Cassel, Romain Duris and Vicky Krieps) makes this even easier on the eye, but when Green’s on screen, it really comes alive, her vampish villainy giving this resolutely old-fashioned film a glamorous, dangerous edge."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE," For a film series that has severed into various franchise strands over the past seventy years, it’s fantastic that Godzilla has finally been reborn into a form that’s both refreshing for viewers and comparable to beloved past embodiments. Despite the surface central concept/draw of “big monster smashes city”, Godzilla has famously teemed with metaphors and allegories relating to Japan’s post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki fear of nuclear weapons and atomic devastation. So, with this latest instalment being set in mid post-war Tokyo, mid 1945, makes Godzilla’s origins more pertinent to the plot and characters than most of its recent predecessors. The story follows Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who lands on the army-occupied Odo Island to get his plane repaired, but when no mechanical faults are found, our “hero” is brandished a coward. Koichi then returns to Tokyo to discover most of his hometown obliterated by Godzilla, and his parents have been killed. Wracked with guilt and ostracised by a community made aware of his gutlessness, Koichi befriends and provides shelter for a homeless woman, Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), and the orphaned baby she cares for. Time passes and Koichi lands a job tracking and deactivating American mines from the Sea of Japan, partly to atone for his past cowardice, but Noriko doesn’t want him to go because of the risk, unbeknownst to both that a greater danger awaits. There’s enough going on in the first thirty minutes of Godzilla Minus One to fill a feature-length drama. The protagonist’s clashing inner conflicts and personal conundrums are such a powerful driving force, the fact that a massive prehistoric reptile is also terrorising the city seems often secondary to the engrossing human drama. Koichi’s arc glides alongside Godzilla’s path of wanton destruction, until strands collide when plans to thwart the beast are unveiled. Godzilla wreaks havoc in spectacular fashion and in intricately rendered splendour during jaw-dropping action sequences, roaring rampant and gargantuan. With an estimated $15 million budget, writer/director and VFX Supervisor Takashi Yamazaki has lovingly crafted a film which celebrates Godzilla’s origins while transcending and subverting its b-movie trappings and trampling those banal US remakes. It looks better on the big screen than most modern blockbusters, due to skilful melding of CGI, miniatures, and classic creature sound design with cues from Naoki Sato’s score recalling what we love about Ishiro Honda’s 1954 original. Some of the action feels inelegantly woven with the slow burning drama and can seem a tad jarring while the acting teeters on histrionic, but this is hair-splitting when compared to the multitude of pros which make Godzilla Minus One the best fantasy action film of the year. The 1940s setting also feels surprisingly fresh and iconic, partly due to the creature’s classic design, evoking the Suitmation/man-in-suit technique, but its heart, complex drama and characters complement the outstanding effects and action. Yamazaki’s film an artful, bar-setting, barrier-shattering, near masterpiece in the guise of a behemoth blockbuster that may even move you to tears."
"Dec 11, 2023",POSITIVE," I’m a Godzilla casual. An awful lot of movies take up mental real estate in my head, and it must be said, movies featuring Japan’s large reptilian son aren’t really among them. Nothing against the Big G! The first appearance of the iconic kaiju in 1954 is absolutely a classic. 2016’s Shin Godzilla is beloved by me since it merges giant monster action with a clever satire of inefficient bureaucracies. As for the rest? For the most part, my belief was that Godzilla movies were disposable fluff. In the old days, you’d stick people in uncomfortable rubber suits, have them stumble through a cardboard mockup of Tokyo, then call it a day. Later, CGI wizards took the place of the suits, but the song remained the same. Big monster, unsuspecting urban area, cardboard characters and cityscape, wash, rinse, repeat. There’s more to it than that, and there’s a reason Godzilla has been rampaging through movie screens for nearly seventy years. A wide variety of stories can be told featuring him, some of which can have an emotional impact that hits with the force of atomic breath. Don’t believe me? I direct your attention to Godzilla Minus One, a kaiju movie with equal amounts of heart and spectacle. In the closing days of World War II, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) has decided not to die. He’s a fighter pilot, a skilled one, yet he’s been assigned kamikaze duty. So he lands his plane at an airbase on the remote Odo Island and tells the men there of mechanical issues. They can’t find anything wrong with the plane, and they suspect Koichi is a liar and a coward. They have bigger problems. Overnight, it comes ashore. The locals speak of it in whispered tones, a creature the size of a dinosaur. They call it Godzilla, and when it attacks the men, Koichi has a chance to kill it. He freezes up. Fails. When Koichi awakens the next morning, he learns that Godzilla has disappeared into the sea after slaughtering most of the men. The only other survivor is Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), who burns with hatred toward Koichi. Two years pass, and Koichi returns to the ruins of Tokyo. He learns his parents were killed in a firebombing. He has nothing, like so many others, and shame follows him like a shadow. Life moves on, and so does Koichi when he meets Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), a young woman who has vowed to care for a young child (Sae Nagatani). The two of them join Koichi and, over time, they build something that looks like a family. Then, America tests an atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll. The bomb works. So does the radiation, which mutates the formerly dinosaur-sized Godzilla to skyscraper heights. The creature destroys a number of battleships as it makes its way to Japan. It’s an unstoppable force that must be stopped, and it may be the means for Koichi to achieve redemption. I try to admit when I’m dumb,* and try to learn and grow beyond my buffoonery. One way I’ve been dumb is the assumption that a Godzilla movie is a showcase for stuff getting wrecked and nothing more. It’s true that Godzilla Minus One does have some jaw-dropping moments of mass destruction. Director Takashi Yamazaki had a budget of around $14 million to make this film, and the end result looks as if it cost ten times that. He was quoted as saying, “…the staff and I have worked together to create a setting where Godzilla looks as if “fear” itself is walking toward us, and where despair is piled on top of despair.” That’s accurate since this is the first time I can recall Godzilla being scary. Instead of us seeing a giant monster wrestle another giant monster, Yamazaki shows us a force of nature, an earthbound god that exists beyond human concerns.  But where my assumptions are elegantly proven wrong is in Yamazaki’s script. He does the impossible by writing a Godzilla story in which we deeply care about the human characters. We’ve got an effective drama about people rebuilding their lives in post-war Japan, about the effects of PTSD and survivor’s guilt on soldiers and civilians. Wisely, time is spent getting to know these people and their lives. That means when Godzilla stomps ashore, it matters what happens to these characters. It was so effective that when a major kaiju attack took place, I was genuinely worried that Koichi and Noriko’s little handmade house would be destroyed. Consider that if you removed the Godzilla parts, you’d still have a damn fine movie. I wouldn’t want to be an actor on a project like this. It feels tricky, since you’d need to balance the usuals (staring into the sky awestruck, running, screaming) with the creation of a lived-in character. To be sure, there are some stereotypes here (the tormented veteran, the supportive pseudo-spouse, the scientist with theories nobody believes), yet the cast pulls it off with aplomb. I liked Ryunosuke Kamiki very much as the damaged Koishi. He does a cool thing with his performance where we’re initially meant to think he’ll die heroically to make up for his actions on the island, then he shows a change in Koishi. We see him discovering that he has things to live for, people to fight for, instead of a fiery death in the name of honor. It’s a performance that’s both smart and subtle. Godzilla Minus One is one of the strongest blockbusters of 2023, a movie I could see easily smashing its way onto my best of the year list. Are there other Godzilla movies out there as skillful as this one? I have no idea, but I’m pleased and kind of stunned that we have this one. Do yourself a favor and see this on the biggest screen possible."
"Dec 10, 2023",POSITIVE," Toward the end of World War II, kamikaze pilot Kiochi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) lands on Odo Island for a mechanical problem, but only he and mechanic Sosoku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) survive an encounter from an ocean god the locals named “Godzilla,” a gargantuan lizard bigger than a Tyrannosaurus rex that really dislikes being shot at. Kiochi returns to his devastated home town following the war, reminded of his cowardice daily by neighbor Sumiko (Sakura Ando). With so few people remaining, he permits a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), and an infant to stay with him in what’s left of his parent’s home. Finding dangerous but lucrative work removing sea mines with other displaced locals, Kiochi discovers the Sea God of Odo Island has been affected by the atomic testing on Bikini Atoll, appearing larger and more powerful than before. Occupied, war-torn, and disarmed, Japan is already hanging on by a thread, but a living disaster is about to strike a nation with no means to defend itself… and no one is coming to save it. Following his Japanese introduction in 1954 as the first of over 30 Toho films, there isn’t a film fan alive who doesn’t know the name “Godzilla.” Following a low point in 1998 (sorry, Matthew Broderick), it wasn’t until 2014 that Godzilla appeared in the Monarch storyline films for Legendary that an American production won over fans with their Hero-zilla. To commemorate the big guy’s 70th anniversary, Toho announced Minus One — written and directed by SFX supervisor Takeshi Yamazaki — recasting Godzilla as a force of nature exacerbated by human arrogance. The new film not only hammers home that actions have consequences but tells a human story of existence in a war-torn land with an impossible apocalypse marching toward them. It’s a tall order even for the undisputed King of the Monsters to unleash something new, but with modern moviemaking effects and seven decades of stories in the history books, where will Minus One rank among all the Godzilla movies to date? The trailer paints a disturbing and dangerous picture of Godzilla, but Kiochi’s story is the lens through which viewers experience the rise of the monster. Questioning duty, blind obedience to government politics, and what it means to be a patriot, the all-too human arc from reluctant suicide pilot ordered to die into a determined fighter by choice is organic, heartbreaking, and cheer-worthy. His fear is as visceral as his regret, unable to fight when he was told to but also unable to let it go of his guilt as a survivor. While the ladies sadly take a back seat to much of this story in a time and place where men are front and center, the actions they’re able to take are salient nonetheless. Everything else is an unholy marriage between Dunkirk and Jaws served up with a side of raw courage, making for an incredible film in addition to being a great Godzilla movie. On land, this Godzilla appears like something from Jurassic Park by way of Cloverfield through a series of up-close POV shots; his movement only appears smooth as his temper flairs, especially in his irradiated larger form. Since the water is his natural environment, the only chance one has to avoid his piercing gaze is something else unfortunately gaining his attention. His atomic breath retains the popular blue energy glow working its way up from tail to mouth, adding an extruded dorsal fin plate like chevrons on a stargate as it powers up, retracting all at once when unleashed. What’s different is the effect upon whatever that weapon touches; remember the blast from The Iron Giant when it targeted a ship off the coast and thankfully missed? Even more incredible is the reported budget for delivering this blockbuster: $15 million, a tenth of what Legendary spent making Godzilla vs. King Kong. It’s long been a discussion among fans — no matter how cheesy the man-in-suit effects actually were stomping through model cities in slow motion — what it would be like if Toho employed state-of-the-art VFX in a new Godzilla film? That has now been decidedly answered, and it’s everything one could hope for. In addition to an Apple TV+ “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” series, Legendary has also released a trailer for it’s next film — Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire — but after Minus One, it’s far more interesting to wonder what Toho will do next with their current success."
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL," For nearly 70 years, dozens of Godzilla movies – the first appeared in 1954 – have been audience favorites the world over. This one isn’t really a monster movie per se. It’s about a group of people, and a nation, and how they react to this gargantuan presence. It’s no exaggeration to say this is a masterpiece by writer/director Takashi Yamazaki. The focal character is a kamikaze pilot in the last days of World War II. Koichi (Ryunokuke Kamiki) who makes a decision not to complete his suicide mission but to pretend his plane is having engine problems. He lands on an island. In the meantime, Godzilla returns after the U. S. military completes a nuclear test on Bikini Atoll. The creature, bigger and more dangerous than ever, slogs his way to Tokyo, smashing buildings, vehicles and people on his rampage. And to tell you more wouldn’t be fair. The realistic look of the movie – battle scenes, Godzilla pursuing a boat, people fleeing the monster – are riveting. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE," Por lo general evito recurrir a la hipérbole, a hacer declaraciones precipitadas cuando apenas llevo 24 horas de haber visto un filme, incluso tras verlo dos veces ayer, en su día de estreno, pero pues… aquí va: Godzilla Minus One es la mejor película del protagonista de la legendaria franquicia cinematográfica japonesa de Toho Studios. Es la definición de un big crowd pleaser, un apoteósico blockbuster realizado con el equivalente al presupuesto de una producción de A24 ($15 millones), repleta de asombrosas imágenes, desbordándose en inmensas emociones y poblada de personajes inmediatamente entrañables. Es todo lo que un largometraje de entretenimiento masivo debe aspirar a ser, a conquistar los corazones del público a través de la empatía, de la cautivante dramatización de sentimientos humanos, mientras estimula sus pupilas con un espectáculo hecho para verse en grande, todo envuelto en un perfecto y colosal empaque. El fantástico filme del cineasta Takashi Yamazaki no reinventa la serie, pero sí la devuelve a su pasado, incluso más atrás de lo que jamás se haya explorado en sus casi 70 años de historia. No tiene conexión alguna con ninguna de las otras entregas japonesas ni estadounidenses, ni pretende ser una precuela al clásico de 1954 del director Ishiro Honda. La trama se remonta al Japón post guerra, específicamente entre 1945 y 1947, y gira en torno a “Koichi Shikishima” (Ryunosuke Kamiki), un piloto kamikaze que aterriza su avión en la pequeña isla de Odo (fans de Godzilla reconocerán el nombre y anticiparán lo que se avecina) tras reportar supuestos problemas con el avión. Allí es recibido por el mecánico “Sosaku Tachibana” (Munetaka Aoki), quien tras examinar el vehículo, no encuentra fallo alguno. Son los últimos días de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el imperio de Japón está de rodillas y “Tachibana” entiende y comprende lo que está ocurriendo: “Shikishima” le está rehuyendo a su obligación patriótica de morir con su avión, y es justo en este tira y hala entre el deber y lo moralmente correcto que el largometraje se debate a lo largo de toda su duración.  No han pasado ni cinco minutos de haber iniciado la proyección y Yamazaki ya ha establecido el dilema central de su libreto, y apenas dos minutos después, hace su espeluznante entrada el titán nipón, cuando gojira -la mítica criatura que habitaba en esa área, según sus habitantes- ataca el campamento y mata a la mayoría de los soldados luego de que “Shikishima” se paralizara del miedo al no atreverse a dispararle al monstruo. No bastaba con ya venir cargando con el peso de sus acciones pasadas -o, más bien, sus inacciones- cuando el piloto ahora también se echa encima la culpa de las muertes de estos hombres. El mero hecho de que continúe con vida es prueba de lo que él considera su mayor fracaso y los fantasmas, tanto de sus decisiones como de las vidas que no salvó, es la fuerza motora que impulsa el argumento y lo hace tan dramáticamente persuasivo. Verán, Godzilla Minus One no es tanto como un típico largometraje de Godzilla, sino más bien un melodrama postguerra, profundamente humanista, en el que el gigante forma parte del reparto.  Mucho se ha escrito sobre lo aburridos o desechables que son los personajes de esta saga, pero estos son argumentos generalmente hechos por personas que solo han visto las películas del llamado “Monsterverse”, o sea, las gringas. En las japonesas -y no es que los 33 largometrajes estén colmados de papelazos para los actores y actrices que aparecen en ellas- el componente humano tiende a ser un factor importante, y posiblemente no había sido tan valorado como lo es en Godzilla Minus One desde la cinta original. El retorno de “Shikishima” a las devastadas calles de Tokio expande el elenco a la vez que intensifica el melodrama al recrudecer el conflicto interno del protagonista, no solo por la miseria que lo rodea, sino también por cómo su vecina, “Sumiko” -interpretada por la excelentísima Sakura Ando-, lo fustiga por aún estar vivo. El muchacho halla consuelo a sus angustias en otros sobrevivientes de la catástrofe: en la amorosa “Noriko” (Minami Hamabe) y la bebé “Akiko” (Sae Nagatani), con las que forma un hogar, así como en sus compañeros de trabajo, con quienes sale a navegar para desarmar o detonar las minas que quedaron flotando en altamar.  Sin la atención dedicada al desarrollo de estos personajes y los vínculos entre ellos, Minus One pudo haber sido otro filme en el que el principal atractivo es ver a Godzilla haciendo pedazos una ciudad, pero el norte de Yamazaki no podría estar más lejos del simple despliegue de fabulosos efectos especiales. Su intención es hacer que el monstruo radiactivo se sienta verdaderamente monstruoso, algo que logra no solo a través del estremecedor diseño de la criatura -con su mirada penetrante y bestial fuerza bruta- sino mediante el poder de destrucción que guarda su distintivo rayo atómico, que esta vez se manifesta en pantalla con toda la pavorosa potencia de una bomba nuclear. No es inusual que uno le vaya a Godzilla en una de sus películas, pero aquí las lealtades del espectador -incluso las del mayor fan- están firmemente del lado de los hombres y mujeres en pantalla, lo cual hace que el tercer acto sea una experiencia sobrecogedora que alcanza estratosféricos niveles de emoción -con la ayuda de la estupenda banda sonora de Naoki Sato- y en el que el porvenir de la sociedad yace en el poder colectivo de los ciudadanos comunes, y no en ninguna agencia gubernamental, ejércitos ni sobrehumanos.  Godzilla no será sinónimo de “éxito garantizado”, y todo buen fan sabe que sus aventuras vienen de todos los colores y sabores, de lo sublime (Shin Godzilla) a lo ridículo (Invasion of Astro-Monster), de las ecológicas (Godzilla vs Hedorah) y socialmente (Godzilla) conscientes, a las que solo se tratan de ver a un montón de titanes entrarse a golpes por 90 minutos (Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack), pero ahí está el detalle que se le escapa a muchas de esas otras franquicias: Godzilla sabe transformarse y puede ser muchas cosas. Puede ser seria, puede ser tonta, puede moverse de la comedia a la acción y de la ciencia ficción al horror, subir al espacio y bajar al núcleo de la Tierra, pero siempre, siempre, siempre se esmera por ser divertida. Hasta las más malas tienen su encanto Al final del día, la gente quiere ir al cine a pasar un buen rato, y Godzilla Minus One es uno de los mejores que se vieron en el 2023. "
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The first Godzilla movie that made me cry&#44; but also the first one that made me feel afraid&#46;
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE," Aun en el 2023 todavía persiste la idea de que en el cine de género es dominado por convenciones cinematográficas comerciales con casi ningún espacio para expresión artística. Si hay una película que desafía eso y podría aplastar permanentemente ese prejuicio, es “Godzilla Minus One”. "
"Dec 8, 2023",NEGATIVE," One of the most infamous creatures in movie history is back in ""Godzilla Minus One,"" the 37th film in the franchise that dates back to the 1950s. The latest entry may be one of the best yet, combining a fantastic mix of chaos and mayhem with some stirring human elements that give it unexpected depth and heart. It's the film that Hollywood has been trying to capture for years, and have mostly failed. ""Godzilla"" takes place near the end of World War II with kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) landing on Odo Island with mechanical issues. When the island is attacked by Godzilla, Shikishima freezes up in a critical moment, unable to save nearly everyone else on the island from the creature's wrath. The guilt from the incident weighs heavily on the pilot, who returns to Tokyo working as a minesweeper. Shikishima takes in a young woman named Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe) and an orphaned infant named Akiko, who Ōishi rescued. The three form a makeshift family trying to start a new life after the devastation of the war, but just as things start to return to normal Godzilla returns — a more dangerous version of the creature encountered on Odo Island with nuclear tests conducted by the United States causing Godzilla to mutate into a seemingly indestructible force. One of the problems with Godzilla films, particularly American versions, has been the decision to go story heavy with only flashes of the monster (sometimes keeping the monster hidden for almost the entire film). Writer/director Takashi Yamazaki never falls for that trap in ""Minus One"" with the creature as much a part of the story as the human element. There are some wonderful scenes of destruction and Godzilla doing what fans expect, wrecking havoc. The sequences are spectacular with well-crafted special effects that really bring the creature to life. Just watching Godzilla be Godzilla is enough to make the film work, but what takes this film to another level is the way the audience really feels the aftermath of the devastation — the toll it takes on the human characters, especially the two leads. It's that unexpected human element, with some fun, well-developed supporting characters thrown in, that takes this Godzilla to another level. Sure, you have seen the monster before but this is Godzilla at his very best — a fun action film that also has a compelling story to be more than just chaos. "
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE," When the new Godzilla movie from its original Japanese production studio, Toho, opens with kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) going through an existential crisis and faking mechanical trouble so he doesn’t have to carry out his suicide mission, I knew something very different was about to unfold. The pilot lands on a remote island occupied primarily by mechanics, there to fix all Japanese fighter planes toward the end of World War II. Kōichi knows that the war is lost and is having issues sacrificing himself for nothing; some of the mechanics understand and even support his crisis, but others see him as the worst kind of coward—an attitude that will haunt Kōichi throughout Godzilla Minus One, a kaiju story of the highest order that takes us back further in time than any other Godzilla movie has into the creature's origins. For those keeping score, these Japanese productions have no connection to the recent Hollywood “Monsterverse” stories (including the 2021 release Godzilla vs. Kong, next year’s Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, both directed by Adam Wingard, and the current Apple TV+ series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters), but they effectively stand as the OG Godzilla films that began as cautionary tale for the atomic bomb in 1954, less than 10 years after actual atomic bombs leveled Japanese cities. What makes Minus One so unique from so many other Godzilla stories is that it actually bothers creating fully realized human characters who have something to protect and live for—namely, they don’t want another Japanese city (in this case Tokyo) destroyed by an atomic monster. Directed by Takashi Yamazaki (Space Battleship Yamato, Ghost Book), Minus One opens with Godzilla killing nearly everyone on the small island where Kōichi lands (partly because he landed there when he didn’t need to). After he returns to his hometown of Tokyo, he discovers that his entire family has also been killed, leaving him to rebuild his life, now including a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who has an infant named Akiko with her. Although Kōichi takes it upon himself to take care of the two, he rebukes the idea of getting romantically entangled with Noriko, mostly due to his shame and guilt at what he did during the war. He even takes on a job as a sea-based minesweeper, which he sees as something akin to a kamikaze pilot. Eventually, a citizen’s group is formed to keep Godzilla from flattening Tokyo once again, and the minesweepers are essential to the mission. They tie together mines into something like a net, which will hopefully kill Godzilla as he approaches—or at least warn citizens that he’s coming. The plotting of these defense mechanisms is intense, fascinating, and takes up a considerable amount of time in the film, which is not a complaint. Godzilla occupies a lot less of Minus One than you might expect, but that’s fine because the nuclear-powered monster is one of the coolest and most ferocious versions of the character I’ve ever seen. He’s mad at humanity for a myriad of reasons, so every city is something he wants to destroy.  But the real drama that had me on edge was whether Kōichi could fly a bomber into Godzilla’s mouth to kill the creature and redeem himself in his own eyes and the eyes of others. In Godzilla Minus One, it’s the human story that wins the day, and for once, the kaiju is there to support the people in their struggle to overcome wartime trauma. For those hoping for a small army of other monsters here, sorry but it’s only Godzilla, and that’s more than enough. The “heat rays” he shoots out of his mouth are as powerful as any atomic weapon, so I’m not sure how an appearance by Mothra is going to improve upon that level of destructive power. The film’s scale feels massive, the cast is large and impressive from an acting standpoint, and the visual effects are exceptional and quite realistic looking (sorry, no guy in a rubber suit for this one). But most impressive is the writing and the emotional depth of the story being told. This is one of the great genre movies in recent memory, and I hope this team goes on to make more Godzilla movies moving forward. Did you enjoy this post?

"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE," If you have any interest at all in giant creatures, see this movie on the biggest screen possible. If you have any interest at all in the future of humanity, see this movie on the biggest screen possible.  Originally scheduled for just a one-week engagement in theaters, the run has been extended by distributor Toho International, which gave me an opportunity to sneak out from work and see it. Although the film is not “true IMAX” — see this detailed Polygon explainer — I went to Cinemark 17 IMAX, which has the biggest screen in Dallas, and a tremendous sound system, especially from my seat in the middle near the top.  The experience was top-level, both visually and sonically. Early reports suggested that it was an emotional experience as well, which I scoffed at … until the movie began and displayed the Toho label. I started crying.  As a young boy in the 1960s, I often watched our 10″ black-and-white television by myself, especially ‘creature features’ that often popped up on Saturday afternoons. Inevitably, that include the likes of King Kong (1933) and, of course, multiple Godzilla and other giant monster movies. Something about the monsters attracted, rather than repelled me, and I always found myself rooting for their survival. Was it because we had a family dog who was bigger than me? Was it because my father and older brother were bigger than me? Beats me. Whatever the source of my identification with these unsung heroes, I could never imagine seeing any of those movies on a big screen in a proper movie theater. Seeing the Toho opening credit instantly sparked a cascade of memories from watching dozens of Toho monster movies.  Godzilla Minus One begins on an island during the dying days of World War II. Claiming that his engine is in need of repair, kamikaze pilot Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) has sought refuge at the military airplane facility located on the island. Head mechanic Tachibana (Munetaka Ando) reports that the engine is not, in fact, in need of repair, but acknowledges that the war is, indeed, lost, and that further suicidal actions would be pointless.  Then the island is attacked by a giant lizard that bites soldiers in half and tosses their bodies hither and thither, stomping on more as it comes ashore, impervious to the weapons wielded by the soldiers in a panic. Tachibana urges Shikishima to his plane so that he can fire his weapons, including bombs, at the creature and kill it.  Shikishima is unable to fire his weapons, nearly all the soldiers all die. Only he and Tachibana survive; he is haunted and wracked by guilt.  Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, who made his initial mark in the U.S. with Returner (2002), the film develops the guilt-wracked theme throughout the drama that develops, as Shikishima ends up caring for Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and an infant girl who she found, orphaned in the wreckage of Japan. They form a make-shift family, struggling to survive. Another family unit is created when Shikishima finds a job, which leads him to the sea and an eventual reunion with Godzilla.  The monster attacks are terrifying in their intensity and brutal in their effect upon society. Whereas Shin Godzilla (2016), for example, was all about government  bureaucrats and how their endless squabbling impacted the citizens, Godzilla Minus One is all about the citizens and how they are affected by governmental inactions. In that sense, it’s an answer film to both Shin Godzilla and Oppenheimer (2023), which both focused on the decision-makers rather than the victims of those decisions.  You may have to be a longtime kaiju follower and fan to appreciate all the creative, cinematic choices that are made in Godzilla Minus One. Yet you need only be a fan of cinema and a human being to appreciate a movie that values life. This film has no internal logic and intentionally avoids the subject it is supposedly addressing. It is technically proficient visually, but poorly written and edited and unlike the original Godzilla substitutes the reality of the horrors of nuclear war with western-style blockbuster romance and last-minute rescues.

"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE," Who could have predicted that the biggest sleeper surprise in movie theaters in 2023 would be a Japanese monster movie? “Godzilla Minus One” is the creature feature we didn’t know we needed. This film’s retro mix of 1950s-era story-telling and classic special effects is an exciting throwback with tons of heart. Here’s one that will cause even the most steely-eyed of viewers to wipe away tears as this moving anti-war portrait draws to an emotional close. Opening at the end of WWII, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) fails to carry out his suicide mission. Feeling disgraced, he lands his plane on an island. Once there, the airmen are attacked by a strange dinosaur-like beast, and Kōichi does nothing to fight back. Returning to his homeland, Kōichi discovers that his parents have been killed in bombings. His home is a damaged mess, and the villagers are scattered and broken. He provides shelter for a young woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who has taken custody of an orphan baby. Together, they care for the infant and begin to rebuild. But while Kōichi is out collecting, exploding, and safeguarding mines at sea with a crew, the dinosaur returns to attack them. But this time the monster, Godzilla, has grown and its thirst for destruction expanded as well. By banning together, the townspeople hope to prevent Godzilla from wreaking havoc on their community and Tokyo. They will need all the talents squandered and exploited during the War to confront this threat. It's a just fight that offers Kōichi a second chance to regain his honor and save his people. It’s hard to describe the studied effectiveness of this Japanese transplant to US theaters. It’s a monster movie at its core, but the drama is remarkably well-conceived and executed. With the recent release of the latest trailer for 2024’s “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” and this year’s Apple TV series “Monarch,” one hopes that a little of the “Minus One” pathos finds its way to its English language counterparts. When dull, unknown college professor Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) starts popping up in the dreams of random people, he becomes an overnight sensation. And as his star rises, he and his wife Janet (Julianne Nicholson) grapple with how to deal with such sudden and bizarre fame. Little do they know that their family’s nightmare is about to begin. “Dream Scenario” starts with a fantastic premise, and this “I had a dream about you” concept is infused with a healthy dose of social media and a pinch of the macabre. When Paul goes viral, his expansion into everyone’s dreams has a hint of credibility beyond the fantastical. The power of suggestion is on full display. With his directorial debut, writer/director Kristoffer Borgli could have embraced the horror of Paul’s predicament and dove into familiar genre conceits. Instead, he smartly focuses on Paul’s family struggles, turning the film into a bitter domestic satire. Along the way, we get self-aware comedic references, such as a sequence where Paul does a photo shoot while wearing a bladed Freddy Kreuger glove. Concentrating on the more concrete consequences to Paul, Janet, and their children helps to ground this otherwise madcap film while giving Cage a role to sink his teeth into. The always entertaining Cage is primarily restrained, approaching something like his roles in 2002’s “Adaptation.” He plays Paul as insecure, clueless, and ultimately very sad. And this makes the movie’s dour resolution a bit of a downer. Still, the challenging journey offers biting delights like a supporting turn by Michael Cera, playing the head of a public relations firm seeking to monetize Paul’s moment. John Chau was a young man on a mission with an adventurous spirit and a mighty religious zeal leading him on an expedition. In 2018, he left the relative safety of the United States to travel to North Sentinel Island in India. He hoped to share the word of his god with the Sentinelese. “The Mission” is a finely made documentary about John’s life and tragic death. We learn about his unique upbringing and his love of the outdoors. But we also discover that the intelligent cum laude graduate of Oral Roberts University was inspired by deep-seated evangelical beliefs to take extraordinary risks that ultimately helped to sign his death warrant. While John’s story should act as an intense cautionary tale about the dangers of evangelical extremism, filmmakers Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss (see the excellent “Boys State”) carefully respect his passion. Interviews with experts examine John’s religion without demonizing his faith. The film also tells the history of the Sentinelese. Viewers might not know that the government of India protects this tiny tribe that has no contact to speak of with the outside world. When people do attempt communication, the Sentinelese react violently. The idea of an isolated community in this day and age is surprising and provocative. “The Mission” combines animation, interviews, archived footage, and the rich historical record to introduce the Sentinelese from afar and John Chau in a sad, intimate manner. This documentary is one of the year’s very best non-fiction motion pictures. Almost 14 years have passed since the last episode of the long-running “Monk” series. In this movie, Tony Shalhoub steps back into the obsessive-compulsive detective role of Adrian Monk for one last personal case involving Monk’s beloved stepdaughter, Molly (Caitlin McGee), as she prepares for her wedding. Solving the case isn’t the reason to watch this one; seeing Shalhoub and the returning cast members regroup proves to be the film’s secret sauce. And the story has fun with the COVID-19 pandemic in that Monk’s peculiar obsessiveness comes in handy. In the wake of the viral outbreak, everyone has a little Monk in them. The standout here is Hector Elizondo as Monk’s psychiatrist, Dr. Neven Bell. I suspect that their scenes will soften the hardened hearts of some viewers."

"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE," Who else? This new kaiju flick, from Godzilla's home studio Toho, celebrates the title character's 70th anniversary. Released in the U.S. with minimal fanfare (no screening for critics in my area), this entry tells a standalone story, unrelated to the earlier Japanese or American films, and it feels very different from either series. For one thing, it's a period piece. It begins in 1945, with Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a young kamikaze, first shirking his suicide mission, then freezing up when he's confronted with the supposedly legendary sea monster at a small airbase in the Odo Islands. This lapse results in horrifying losses. Then when Shikishima gets back to the ruins of postwar Tokyo he's a pariah in his neighborhood. Over the next couple of years, the guilt-haunted Shikishima becomes the reluctant head of an improvised family after Noriko (Minami Hamake), a young homeless woman, takes shelter in his house with an orphaned baby she's picked up. To support them, he takes a job with an oddball minesweeping crew on a small boat, clearing the leftover mines surrounding Japan. Then one day The Big G surfaces, made gargantuan after being irradiated during the Bikini nuclear tests, and heads for Tokyo. The monster scenes here are spectacular, staged by writer-director Takashi Yamazaki with panache and a feel for dizzying ponderousness. There are some genuine jolts, too, notably Godzilla's first appearance. Best of all, the behemoth's big scenes employ Akira Ifukube's masterly score from the original 1954 film. But at some level Godzilla Minus One feels less about monster action and more about Japanese society struggling to come to terms with an almost unimaginable defeat. The big scaly guy seems more like a symbol of the magnitude of despondency that had to be overcome for the country to survive and rebuild. This, along with heartfelt acting from an appealing cast and an effective sense of period detail, makes the film unexpectedly moving. Having a failed kamikaze as the hero set the story up for an obvious payoff that I found troubling from the first scenes of the film: The perceived need for redemption from the eminently sensible decision not to carry out the lunacy of a futile suicide mission. Here, I thought, is the sort of intractable nationalism that makes for good melodrama, but in real life leads countries into war and horror and misery. I'm happy to say that G-1 is having none of it; while giving full credit to worthwhile self-sacrifice, the film is resolutely life affirming. ""This country never changes,"" one of the characters mutters, about some governmental folly. ""Maybe it can't."" But that country did change, albeit at a Godzilla-sized price, and this movie gets at the pained yet exhilarating spirit of that change. My Kid accompanied me to this film, and after checking out the trailer on the way to the theater, she disapprovingly said ""I think they're going to hurt him,"" him being Godzilla. She was right; the monster is not, here, a long-suffering defender of humankind against some bizarre alien or primal abomination, but a rampaging destructive force who must be stopped. Even his roar sounds scarier; it's not the usual nasal, irritable honk. But even so, I too felt sympathy for him during the efforts to destroy him. Something about that big lizard is lovable, even when he's being a bad boy."
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE," Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb. Far more than just a simple monster movie, Takashi Yamazaki’s “Godzilla Minus One” is a moving examination of a nation dealing with societal trauma, the Japanese populace attempting to recover from massive damage inflicted on their land as well as their national psyche. Taking place just after World War II and before Ishiro Honda’s 1954 original, the story is a bracing examination of Japan during the post-war era, a once proud country, reduced to rubble, its citizens devastated, body and soul, forced to come to terms with their tattered heritage and uncertain future. Kochi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is just one of millions uncertain about what each day may bring; that he carries an inescapable stigma only makes matters worse. A kamikaze who refused to make the ultimate sacrifice, he returns home in shame, only to find his house destroyed, his family gone. Despondent and uncertain, his path crosses that of Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a young woman who has also lost everything yet has taken in an orphaned child to care for. These three form a makeshift family, struggling to cobble together some sort of day-to-day existence. Fate shines on Kochi when he gets a high-paying government job gathering and disabling the thousands of ocean mines left behind by Allied forces. It’s dangerous work, but the salary comes in handy, while his co-workers, Akitsu (Kuranosuke Saski), Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) become trusted friends. The crew settle into a routine, but it’s violently disrupted by the United States’ nuclear bomb tests being conducted on nearby Bikini Atoll. They have not only awakened a dinosaur-like animal the natives refer to as Godzilla, but have transformed it into an unstoppable, atomic-fueled creature that is the personification of the nation’s fear. While the seminal creature is the selling point, the focus of the film is the impact WW II had on the Japanese culture. Godzilla is a metaphor for the trauma Japan has faced, a shambling, fire-breathing, six-story symbol of the PTSD each of the survivors must contend with. Not only does he represent the past, but the future as well, the monster a threat that must be faced and contained if this society is to survive. His attacks in Ginza and Tokyo are tests, the suffering of the country made real. Denial regarding their place in the world, their responsibility for their plight and the uncertainty of tomorrow are all addressed when the populace – with no help from the government – make their final stand. Yamazaki focuses on the human drama more than the kaiju shenanigans.  It’s a risky approach that’s gone wrong in less talented hands, yet his script is grounded by characters we come to care for, made sympathetic by the fine work of the cast. Their efforts provide an emotional foundation for the film that not only elicits our sympathy but gives weight to the scenes of destruction. And those moments are not only spectacular but terrifying. Yamazaki effectively combines practical and digital effects to create one nightmare scenario after another, the creature effortlessly cutting a swath through the cities, mass destruction and misery in his wake. There’s a fluidity to Godzilla’s movements that lend him credibility while the director’s camera placement – often from ground level- effectively drives home how terrifying being in the presence of a creature would be. There’s an urgency to these scenes that’s absent in the other Godzilla films, the filmmaker putting the viewer in the monster’s path, within his zone of destruction, again and again. Whereas most of the franchise entries focus on the massive property damage done, “Zero” underscores the nuclear threat the monster represents. When using his atomic breath, the damage caused is reminiscent of the pictures taken of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A shot of a mushroom cloud rising in the distance as the monster witnesses his handiwork is genuinely chilling, this genre entry driving home the dire nature of the nuclear threat far more effectively than “Oppenheimer.” In the end, this is a tale of redemption, and as such, the improbable ending is in keeping with Kochi and his brethren’s journey. Timely, exciting, and cathartic, “Godzilla Minus Zero” proves to be one of the biggest cinematic surprises of 2023, a movie that not only revitalizes the Japanese franchise but also serves as yet another bracing reminder of man’s atomic folly and the inescapable threat it continues to pose."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE," I only heard about the movie a few days ago, and I cover movies and TV shows for a living. I was confused at first. Usually there’s a big marketing push for the next star-studded, ultimately mediocre monster movie. But this one was boasting a 97% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and I’d never even seen a trailer or movie poster. This is primarily because this is not a “Monsterverse” movie. It’s a shockingly low-budget Japanese film that’s easily the best Godzilla movie I’ve ever seen. Whether it's the best Godzilla movie ever made is a bit more subjective, but as far as I’m concerned it blows everything else out of the water—something our heroes have a very hard time doing to the titular monster. 2021’s Godzilla Vs. Kong cost somewhere between $155 and $200 million to make. The upcoming Godzilla Vs. Kong: The New Empire will cost over $200 million. Godzilla Minus One had a budget of $15 million USD, and I’m still not sure how they pulled it off. The CGI is terrific, and the titular monster is terrifying and monstrous. Nothing about this film feels low-budget. That goes especially for the script, which adds a badly needed human element to the story. This is, in many respects, a WWII character drama. It takes place in the final days of the war in the Pacific and in the following years, as Japan rebuilds from the atomic bombs. As I sat in the theater, I thought about how Godzilla is a symbol of Japanese national trauma over the atomic bomb. Since 1954, Godzilla has represented the horror and destruction that the Japanese people suffered during and in the wake of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The film as a period piece delved into the horrors of war, the hope that reconstruction kindled, the frustration the Japanese people felt with their government and new American allies, and gave us a glimpse into the post-war days and the ways fear and anxiety fill in every crack. The main character, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) was a pilot-turned-kamikaze pilot who abandoned his duty at the end of the war and then soon after encountered Godzilla on a Japanese outpost island. His guilt and PTSD drag him into a cycle of misery and selfishness after the war, preventing him from connecting to his new family, comprised of Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), a young woman he meets in the rubble, and little Akiko (Sae Nagatani) an infant Noriko is raising. When he takes a job as a mine-hunter, scouring the sea for Japanese and American mines, he makes Shikishima makes new friends, but keeps everyone around him at arm’s length. For our young hero, the war never ended. He lives with his shame, but it’s no kind of life. These relationships are what drives Godzilla Minus One, and while the Godzilla stuff is exciting and terrifying—and our heroes’ plan to defeat the monster rather scrappy and creative—it’s the script that elevates this film above all the recent attempts to bring Godzilla to the big screen. It turns out that a well-written script with complex characters you actually care about and a $15 million budget is a whole lot more effective than a $200 million movie with bad writing and generic, one-dimensional characters you forget about the moment you leave the theater. Another lesson: You don’t need big-name movie stars who cost tens of millions if you have a compelling story. There are lots of great actors out there. Maybe it’s time to end our obsession with big stars and overcooked CGI. (Hey, it worked with Star Wars!) US studios should pay close attention. In an era of ever-expanding budgets and constant failures at the box office, punctuated by constant losses in the streaming market, it never hurts to save $185 million from time to time."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE," Will “Godzilla” ever go out of style? If his appearance in the stunning, Blockbuster level “Godzilla Minus One” is any indication, I sure hope not.  Though I’ve found enjoyment in the last few iterations of “Godzilla” (sans the horrendous 2019 sequel: “Godzilla: King of the Monsters”), none had quite the impact of “Minus One,” which manages to interweave a grounded, human story in between all the chaos and destruction a $15 million dollar budget can buy. And, turns out, that’s a-lot of buildings getting smashed by a giant lizard! Director Takashi Yamazaki has crafted a wondrous addition to the “Godzilla” catalog that manages to be more than just another surface level monster mash.  Sure, Godzilla wreaks havoc in Tokyo (as he’s accomplished countless times in the past), but the way it's repurposed and set in the backdrop of WWII, just as soldiers have returned home to their families, gives it a renowned sense of emotional potency. We follow Koichi Shikishima (played by famed Japanese actor Ryunosuke Kamiki), a deserted kamikaze pilot trying to survive another day. When he finally gets back home, he’s tormented with dreams of how he couldn’t pull the trigger on an earlier encounter with the colossal-sized kaiju. Now, years later, Godzilla has resurfaced and Shikishima is changed in terms of what he’s willing to sacrifice to ensure a better future for his family.  And this iteration of Godzilla is towering. And it’s all the more remarkable “Minus One” was constructed on a shoestring budget. Granted, we don’t see the prickly creature, who can decimate an entire city by just opening its mouth, that much, but when we do, it’s nothing short of riveting. It also makes you wonder how films like “Expend4bles” have price tags well over $100 million and look like giant pieces of shit.  Yamazaki is no stranger to exploring the darker sides of the war, having dabbled with its harsh realities in several projects, and the way he infuses that narrative into a “Godzilla” picture is something of a miracle. He depicts the postwar devastation and the rubble of a city who can never seem to catch a break. When the big finale happens and everyone bands together to thwart the common enemy, that’s underscored with incredible bravado by composer Naoki Sato, it sends a chill down your back in the same manner “Dunkirk” did when average civilians came to save the day.  Of course, it does end with several cliffhangers, all but ensuring a sequel from Toho Studios is in the works. Which is fine, but when you have a “Godzilla” movie thriving at this scope and scale, it’s going to be hard for anyone to top it. Either way, all hail the king. "
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One is the series' first period piece. Set in the days just after the end of WWII, the film centers around Kōichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a failed kamikaze pilot whose brief encounter with a dinosaur-like monster on a remote island in the Pacific in the waning days of the war saddles him with a lifetime of guilt. As he attempts to rebuild his life in the ashes of Tokyo after the war, he finds himself the guardian of an unusual family - a woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and baby Akiko (Sae Nagatani), an orphan she rescued from the streets. When Godzilla returns to Japan, newly irradiated and more dangerous than ever before, Kōichi sees it as a chance to redeem himself, and ensure a better future for his newfound family. This time around, the kaiju action takes a back seat to the family drama at the film's center. Kōichi's survivor's guilt makes for potent drama, and its his relationship with his family and his determination to right the wrongs of the past that make the film so compelling. Godzilla is, essentially, simply the catalyst for Kōichi's redemption story. It's also about a nation trying, and often failing, to rebuild in the face of unprecedented destruction. Left to its own devices by a United States preoccupied with its conflict with the Soviet Union, Japan is struggling to piece itself back together, and the new threat posed by Godzilla is left to citizens to solve where their government (and the world superpowers) have failed to act. It's a surprisingly moving story, a tale of a war survivor struggling to overcome his deep-seated guilt and embrace the newfound love that has found him seemingly out of nowhere. In that regard, Godzilla represents Kōichi's personal demons as much as he does the terror of nuclear destruction - giving the protagonist a deeply intimate challenge to overcome in order to feel truly whole again. It's not about saving Japan as much as it is saving his family and wrestling with the ghosts of his past in order to be the person they need him to be. That personal aspect makes Godzilla Minus One a disarmingly heart wrenching epic, a grand scale adventure with an unexpected heart that puts its American counterparts to shame. This is blockbuster filmmaking at its best - a visually striking and thrilling spectacle that never loses sight of the human story that makes its conflict so compelling. It's a film with real stakes, earned emotional beats, and a true sense of the gravity of Godzilla's destructive powers. Not only is it arguably the best Godzilla film since the 1954 original, it's one of the great blockbusters of the modern era."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla turns 70 next year, and to celebrate, his parent company Toho Studios waited until the end of this year to release the most conventional Godzilla movie in recent memory. “Godzilla Minus One” may also be the most sobering and least flamboyant Japanese-produced Godzilla movie since the original 1954 nuclear lizard disaster pic (though “Godzilla 1985” fans might disagree). Some reviews of “Godzilla Minus One” have already praised the movie as an escapist crowd-pleaser. It’s easy to see why, given the bleak but well-calibrated tone of its human-centric scenes. Yamazaki gives G-fans plenty of reasons to see “Godzilla Minus One” in theaters. He’s got a clear eye for action and a firm grasp on feel-good, saber-rattling melodrama. Yamazaki’s style, like his movie’s politics, only looks conservative compared to his predecessors. He made a good Godzilla movie, if not a great one.

"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE," There are a lot of movies out right now in the ether that you can choose from, but sometimes, it’s just so hard to pick which ones are worth your time. Luckily, we’ve watched a lot of movies lately and have picked out five films that you can check out right now that are absolutely worth spending time with as temperatures get colder and being indoors to watch a movie sounds more and more appealing for a night out (or in). This one is a breathtaking blockbuster filmmaking, chocked full of tragedy, terror and awe. The Godzilla movie has kind of become a campy brouhaha, veering away of the majesty of Gareth Edwards’ film and the sociopolitical ramifications of the 1950s original. This one combines those two films with the most compelling human story we’ve gotten in a monster movie in some time, and Takashi Yamazaki pulls from Hayao Miyazaki, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan to craft a gut-punch spectacle that tears at your heart and blows your mind. It’s the best companion to Oppenheimer we’ll get anytime soon, as Godzilla returns to his metaphorical horror as an allegory for the bomb. It’s hard in this day and age to really wow with blockbuster entertainment these days, given how meta-focused, corporate and passionless our tentpole films have become. This is a jolt in the spine, the kind of cerebral crowd-pleaser with real stakes and some big action sequences that bring in the goosebumps. I don’t say this lightly: this is the best monster movie since Cloverfield and one of the best blockbusters of the century; just blown away by what is accomplished here. This is probably the closest David Fincher will ever get to making one of those Fabelman-esque autobiographies, as he picks at the brilliant procedure that’s marked his filmography. Is the filmmaker in his bag here, hammering out baseballs during a home run derby? Sure. Although, that’s kind of why it’s so intriguing, as Fincher studies why people like him are so mercilessly dedicated to their own craft. This is about the lunacy of compulsion and the crushing expectation of perfection in filmmaking as much as it zaps the rigor out of the killer’s mythos. Michael Fassbender is so perfectly attuned with what Fincher wants to do here, down to the droll confidence of the self-serious narration to the robotic mechanisms of his work. There’s a deep desire here to splash a cold bucket of water on creative arrogance, the brash instinct we all have that we hung the moon and stars and could never, ever fudge up something so routine. Well, Fincher seems to be telling on himself a bit, humbling himself to the process and the inescapable margin for error that plagues the species. However, he’s also having much more fun with that notion than he ever has in his career, as he’s embracing the weirdo side that eats just the insides the McDonald’s breakfast sandwich, listens to the same band over and over again to get into the rhythm and, well, does 70-plus versions of the same take because it’s got to be a perfect shot… even if, you know, you’re going to miss every now and again no matter how hard you try. The sheer thrill of seeing both the Chicken Run chickens and Kenan & Kel back in action after all these years … aw hell I’m an easy mark. Really, though, Aardman just knocked this one out of the henhouse. Sure, it moves a little fast, but it’s the perfect sequel to a movie that really didn’t need a sequel, if that makes sense. It expands on the ideas and emotional developments of the first film while throwing in some fun wrinkles and ratcheting up the dark underbelly of Mrs. Tweedy’s plots. The action just stuns like it did in the first film, as Aardman remains one of the few collectives who can stage this kind of moving sequence packed with so many clever jokes and such ingenious ways of getting from A to B. No wonder Steven Spielberg wanted them at DreamWorks way back when. I was around seven when the first movie came out, and it really did a number on me. I’m 31 with this one, and I’m very pleased at how this one really did just throw me right back into it all. This is the Toy Story 2 to Chicken Run’s Toy Story, down to the very clear, delightful homages to Toy Story 2 that make that parallel for you. I loved this one. Babs forever! On one hand, the Toy Story of stop-motion animation. It’s an absolute masterpiece. On the other hand, how did the Tweedys not notice the chickens were wearing clothes and jewelry? I’m not sure this style of documentary would work for everyone, but it sure as heck works for Albert Brooks. I could’ve watched this for 5 hours. John Kramer: antihero is so, so much more interesting than anything this franchise has done in eons. Tobin Bell is spectacular here, and there are genuine stakes in the Saw world where Billy the Puppet is far, far less intimidating than the dastardly corporate swindlers who prey on the weak. This is the kind of reset the Saw films needed, as watching people get stuck in a Jigsaw trap becomes much easier to stomach if you could argue that they’re the ones who put themselves there in the first place. This is easily the best Saw film since the original. I got a little emotional there at the end during a fiercely unexpected moment where Kramer is squarely a moral center, and that’s not something I had on my cinematic Bingo card this year."
"Dec 5, 2023",NEGATIVE," As a devoted Godzilla fan and an avid enthusiast of monster flicks, my anticipation for Godzilla Minus One was already sky-high. The overwhelmingly positive reactions only added to my expectations, setting the stage for what I hoped would be a potential contender for my Top 10 of the year. Legendary’s MonsterVerse has been a mixed bag, with some entries earning praise while others left fans yearning for more, but so far, not a single installment has been able to blow me away. Trusting the creative vision of writer-director Takashi Yamazaki (The Eternal Zero), I entered the theater with optimism, ready to be enthralled by a narrative that went beyond epic monster battles. At its core, Godzilla Minus One isn’t merely a monster movie; it’s a post-war tale of one man’s quest for forgiveness, purpose, and inner peace. Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a complex protagonist, haunted by the traumatic events of the first Godzilla attack, who grapples not only with the burden of guilt from abandoning his duty as a kamikaze pilot but also with his inability to save others during the Godzilla onslaught. Yamazaki crafts an intimate narrative that delves into the protagonist’s internal struggles, revealing a man driven not by cowardice, as everyone around him believes, but by a profound desire to preserve life and prevent further bloodshed. This theme adds a layer of complexity to a film that transcends the typical monster movie narrative and explores the psychological aftermath of war. Godzilla Minus One also tackles broader topics of humanity, illustrating how people unite in the face of dire situations. Unlike Hollywood norms, which often force romantic relationships through quick montages, Yamazaki takes a less romanticized approach. The filmmaker focuses on advancing the plot and character relationships organically, using time jumps only to signify progression without compromising authenticity. This departure from formulaic storytelling is a testament to the film’s commitment to its narrative integrity. One of the movie’s standout technical elements is its score (Naoki Satō). A truly epic, cathartic composition that elevates every action set piece but also the more personal, family-focused moments. The powerful Godzilla theme resonates through the theater, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. Yet, the music also exhibits subtlety, with piano notes carrying the emotional weight of poignant scenes. It’s a delicate balance that enriches the overall experience, emphasizing the visceral impact of the often dark story. The sound design, particularly in the atomic breath scenes, is nothing short of powerful. The painstakingly crafted audio enhances Godzilla’s destructive power by encompassing the mayhem of the monster’s unleashed might in pure silence before a brutal explosion literally blows everyone away. Godzilla Minus One holds one of the most impressive atomic breath sequences I’ve ever seen, from both an audiovisual standpoint and a character perspective. For the viewers who think of Godzilla (2014) as a film that toned down the presence of the actual monster too much, Yamazaki hits that perfect balance between story, characters, and monster entertainment. A real sensory feast. Visually, Godzilla Minus One is a triumph. Kōzō Shibasaki’s cinematography is stunning and, just like the rest of the movie’s attributes, terrifically well-balanced. Not only does it capture the gargantuan scale of the monster and the devastation it leaves in its wake, but the dedication and care put into these massive sequences equally reach every frame revolving around the more personal character side, which occupies most of the runtime. The attention to detail extends to Godzilla’s design, which is totally badass. Its skin regeneration scenes, as well as how its body reacts to sudden water pressure changes, are surprising elements that lead to a banger of a third act – pacing is beautifully handled throughout the entire runtime. One minor critique lies in the brief close-ups of its face, where, weirdly, it appears to be smiling like a human being. While this doesn’t significantly impact any set piece, it serves as a minor distraction in otherwise gorgeous VFX work. In addition to this, while the writing is sharp and engaging, the lead acting occasionally veers into melodramatic territory. The emotions are present, but the over-the-top delivery at times detracts from the authenticity of the characters’ experiences. This becomes particularly noticeable in scenes addressing PTSD, where the performances sometimes become overwhelming, affecting the seriousness of the subject matter. Godzilla Minus One strikes an outstanding balance between compelling character building, a thematically rich narrative, and two hours of gargantuan entertainment, ultimately becoming a noteworthy addition to the monster film subgenre. It breaks the formulaic barriers of generic creature flicks by delivering a layered story that explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the aftermath of war. The memorable score, powerful sound design, and exquisite visuals contribute to a cinematic experience that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant. While the lead acting occasionally falters into melodrama, it does little to diminish the overall impact of a movie that has undoubtedly earned its place among the top-tier entries in the Godzilla franchise.

"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This thunderous film works on both massive and small scales, packing the screen with action, mass destruction, heroics, sudsy melodrama and terrific effects. "
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Director Takashi Yamazaki has crafted a perfect combination of pathos and excitement&#44; paying homage to the original 1954 film while bringing it into the modern age&#46;
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE," The 37th film in the Japanese blockbuster franchise, and the 33rd produced by Toho Studios, Godzilla Minus One turns the clock back to the late 1940s as it dramatises a destructive attack from the king of the monsters on a country still reeling in the aftermath of World War II. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, who also oversees the film’s copious visual effects, Godzilla Minus One is as much a lavish period drama about a country rediscovering a sense of national worth as it is an epic kaiju [monster] spectacle. Disgraced kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) has been living in shame ever since he refused to sacrifice himself and die the honourable death that his military rank dictated. He shares his modest home with Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a young woman he saves from the authorities, together with a newborn baby she pulled from the debris of their bombed-out neighbourhood, but Koichi’s self-loathing prevents him from marrying her. He is granted an opportunity to redeem himself, however, after landing a job on a minesweeper shortly after the end of the war. It is dangerous work, but pays well, and soon leads him into direct contact with the marauding sea monster. In a sequence that owes a sizeable debt to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, Koichi and the rest of the motley crew attempt to see off the beast using mines recovered from the ocean, but their efforts do little more than anger Godzilla, who heads for shore and the streets of Tokyo. As with many recent entries in this record-breaking franchise, Godzilla Minus One is not a sequel, nor, as its title might suggest, a prequel, but the latest chapter in a series that thrives on continuous reinvention. The towering lizard treads an uncannily familiar path of destruction through the bustling shopping district and across busy train lines, as composer Naoki Sato reintroduces Akira Ifukube’s iconic score to winning effect. Also significant is 2001’s Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, in which Godzilla is propelled by the ghosts of Japan’s war dead searching for revenge. The film has received criticism in some quarters for pushing a pro-military agenda, but the protagonists of Godzilla Minus One are united in vehement criticism of their government, which pressured so many ordinary citizens into wasting their lives for a questionable cause. In their stand against Godzilla, conversely, they mobilise voluntarily against a single, recognisable threat, and in doing so, deliver some of the most spectacular showdowns in the franchise’s 70-year history."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla will not die. Bullets plink off of it like raindrops. Plant a mine in its mouth, detonate it with a machine gun, and sure, you’ll blow half of its face off, but it will simply regenerate a new one a few moments later. Our desire to destroy it only seems to make it stronger. GODZILLA MINUS ONE ★★★1/2 (3.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Takashi Yamazaki
Written by: Takashi Yamazaki
Starring: Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Sakura Ando
Running time: 125 mins. So too Godzilla. The series of films featuring the scaly mountain-sized monster born from the atomic devastation of World War II has reached its 70th anniversary. It has survived technological advances that have gone well beyond a guy in a giant lizard suit, irony-armed jokesters who have spent decades lobbing cracks at Godzilla and its Kaiju cousins, and even the CGI-larded American iterations that have all but drained the joy out of the concept with blunt, un-nuanced spectacle.  Hell, during its opening weekend, the latest and most buzzed-about iteration of the franchise in a generation, Godzilla Minus One, went toe to toe with the Queen Bey herself, coming in an impressive third in the box office behind Beyoncé’s Renaissance and the latest Hunger Games movie; Godzilla Minus One‘s three-day gross of $11 million even set a U.S. record for a foreign language film. One of the simplest ways to explain its unbreakable resilience over the decade is that the creature has maintained its status as cinema’s largest and greatest metaphor—rivaled only by the Great and Powerful Oz and “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.” That is certainly the case in the monster’s latest iteration, written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, a seasoned special effects supervisor helming his 20th feature film. The movie also serves as a powerful fable about the nature of regret and the manner in which survivor’s guilt metastasizes over time. Shikishima, who lost his parents in the Bombing of Tokyo and carries the family photos of the men killed at Odo like a crown of thorns, doesn’t marry and start a family in the manner of his post-war compatriots. Instead, he runs into Noriko (Japanese superstar Minami Hamabe) while she is caring for a baby she herself found abandoned. Like the clothes they wear and the ramshackle lean-to in which they initially live in a decimated city, their lives are patched together with shards and detritus of loss.  Yamazaki’s approach to bringing the giant to life—while done with CGI like the other Godzilla movies of the current generation—feels similarly piecemeal and handmade. It may not be a guy in a suit, but this lumpy Godzilla looks pleasingly terrestrial, like a toy played with too hard and left out in the rain. Even the strange spikes that protrude from its back (it must use these to navigate, as they seem useless as a weapon) have an organic quality, resembling the ice jutting out from an old freezer in need of a defrost.  As a result of the quaintness of Godzilla’s old wrestler’s gait and the finger-smudged quality of his presentation, when Yamazaki unleashes his monster’s heat-ray breath on the newly rebuilt Tokyo, the impact feels all that much more impactful—it’s like a Van Halen guitar solo in the middle of a recorder recital.  Coming some five months after this summer’s double-barreled glee of Barbie and Oppenheimer, Godzilla Minus One also serves as another post-pandemic reminder of not just how much fun it can be to see big movies in big theaters, but how essential these experiences can be in helping us making sense of our own world, itself constantly in the churn of unimaginable destruction. The film provides an all too necessary escape from, for example, the horrors of the ongoing tragedy in Gaza. But as you ruminate on it later, it provides another way to consider why we feel the overwhelming need to inflict so much misery on one another. Movies and the moviegoing experience are like Shikishima, who over the course of time has come to see Noriko not as a charity case but the central love and focus of his life. When he meets her randomly on a Tokyo thoroughfare that is about to meet the full force of Godzilla’s wrath, he pulls her aside. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE," I there’s a golden age of Godzilla, it’s hard to argue that we’re not in it right now. Let’s face, the king of all kaiju is hotter than atomic breath right now, and on all fronts. Usually, the Toho oft-rebooted franchise is clicking, while here in America we’re getting crappy, occasionally-embarrassing versions that do Godzilla no justice. But right now with Legendary’s Monsterverse running wild, Toho has gone back to its roots and achieved the true pinnacle of Godzilla glory with Godzilla Minus One, a stunning achievement that manages to surpass even 2016’s revitalizing Shin Godzilla. In a way, Godzilla Minus One springboards from what Gareth Edwards attempted with his 2014 movie, which I found to be pretty dull. But he attempted to do something by making the humans more than just puny insects waiting to get stomped. He tried to give us real stakes so we could invest in the human cost of battling the kaiju. But with Godzilla Minus One, the formula is just right, calculating post-WWII trauma and atomic age anxiety, along with a healthy dose of survivor’s guilt. Godzilla isn’t the central character by any means. He is a force of nature, an unstoppable, irresistible presence wearing down a nation that has just lost a war, one in which its government literally told its soldiers to sacrifice their lives to a hopeless cause. With heavy restrictions placed on Japan after the fighting, any attempt at rebuilding would take multiple generations to complete. Those who would start it, would never reap the fruits of their labor. Certainly, nobody had the will to fight another war. And that goes double for kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki). In short, Koichi is a coward. He definitely sees himself as one, but so too the people forced to endure the humiliation of defeat in war. We meet Koichi as he’s faking a malfunction in his plane so as not to fulfil his kamikaze duties. He lands on Odo Island where Godzilla emerges and attacks the military mechanics. Koichi, as the only gunner, has a chance to take out Godzilla but is too scared to shoot. As a result, the other men all die, and Koichi is left to carry the burden of his cowardice. Self-sacrifice is a big theme in Godzilla Minus One. A dismissive government casts a noble spin on self-sacrifice as its soldiers hurl themselves into certain doom. But real sacrifice comes from the living, who give of themselves to help others live, to rebuild, to love, to find new purpose. Koichi can’t get over the sins of his past, but nevertheless takes in a wandering stranger, Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), and the orphaned daughter Akiko (Sae Nagatani) that she cares for. Along with ex-military men Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) and Sosaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), Koichi finds renewed reasons to live, and a use for his gunnery skills, as a destroyer of leftover mines. It’s risky work, but one he’s willing to do in order to care for Noriko and Akiko, But also, possibly, because he hopes one day it’ll go wrong and his suffering will be ended in an unexpected explosion. Koichi is constantly being pulled in different directions, with one foot in the living and one in the dead. When Godzilla threatens to destroy all of Ginza, putting the people he’s unexpectedly grown to love at risk, Koichi begins to muster up the courage to fight for them, no matter the cost. So yeah, Godzilla Minus One is basically a post-war melodrama with a dash of Godzilla. Usually, the mix is the other way around. Godzilla dominates the screen and we endure the puny little humans scattering around at his feet. But here, Godzilla is truly terrifying. There’s no attempt to humanize the creature. When he arrives, people die and towns are destroyed. Godzilla could be any force of Mother Nature; a monsoon, a hurricane, a tornado, an earthquake, a meteor making landfall. He is something to be survived, and the power at Godzilla’s disposal is beyond human measure. Because the scaly beast seems so indestructible, it makes the efforts of Koichi and his colleagues, all ex-soldiers with backgrounds in tragedy, or citizens worn down by war, even more engaging. As Koichi tries to learn to live again, it’s like he’s pulling Japan out of its collective despair into a future where they can find reason to hope. Director Takashi Yamazaki treats Godzilla with all of the reverence he deserves. After 70 years, we’ve grown accustomed to its roar, to the glowing build-up to his unstoppable atomic breath. We’ve seen it all before, tweaked in a thousand different ways to try to add something “cool”. These aspects are truly crowd pleasers, and Yamakazi uses them sparingly for maximum effect. The first time Godzilla unleashes his atomic blast you might catch yourself holding your own breath as I did, anticipating its destructive impact. I don’t consider myself a Godzilla aficionado. I’ve seen my share of the classic movies and all of the most recent ones, both from Japanese and American studios. None of them have ever had the emotional impact on me that Godzilla Minus One had. There were tears shed in the theater I was at, as people connected with Koichi’s story and his seemingly impossible showdown with Godzilla. As we all know, nothing can ever truly keep this kaiju down, but Godzilla Minus One has set a towering bar to surpass. It’s not just a great Godzilla movie, it might just be the best one yet."
"Dec 4, 2023",NEGATIVE," Despite the decimal of Godzilla Minus One‘s Japenese title, written as -0.1, echoing Hideaki Anno’s Rebuild of Evangelion series, Tōhō’s iconic series has taken a firm step away from the auteur focus that Anno himself brought to 2016’s Shin Godzilla and returned to the journeymen who made the series what it is. To call director Takashi Yamazaki as much a special effects guy as a director would undersell the success he’s had helming 3D (hit) animated movies in the Dragon Quest, Lupin III, and Doraemon series (and he directed a Godzilla theme park ride film). But Minus One, set immediately after World War II, lacks the junky fun of Jun Fukuda or later Ishiro Honda films, and in fact, it bears the stink of seriousness; it’s the most white elephant film in the series — the white ‘zilla if you want a pithy pull quote. Godzilla (him/her/it)self looks as epic and masculine and boring as they ever have. This writer, for one, misses the cat eyes. But, of course, you have to take the film on its own terms, and the visual effects look undeniably incredible, with more direct interaction between the ground-level human characters and the creature itself than we’ve ever seen before. Many have wondered how this was achieved on a slim $15 million budget, which is something there’s no clear answer to (if Japan’s 2D animation industry is anything to go by, it’s tough to imagine wonderful labor practices had much to do with it, though that’s mere speculation). It also helps that Godzilla doesn’t actually appear all that much more here than they do in one of the cheapo movies, but the balance feels more natural because the human narrative is engaging and well-paced — at least insofar as it never slows down enough to get boring (which was always one of the virtues of the spacious and silly journeymen classics). The script darts from one half-contained section to the next: there’s a whole Jaws riff set on a rickety old boat, where abandoned mines instead of barrels help to locate the underwater beast, and it’s a strong enough stretch to sustain a whole movie. It only lasts about 20 minutes. In another section, Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a Kamikaze pilot who faked his plane’s malfunction to go on living, and Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a woman who scorns that very survival, end up raising a child whose parents were lost in one of the Allied Forces’ countless civilian bombing campaigns. And like in Ozu’s Record of a Tenement Gentleman, the bitter pain and resentment of immediate post-war living slowly builds into love and the reconstruction of the traditional family. This is the emotional center that connects these often-thrilling tangents, and even then this only lasts 30 minutes before a montage ties it up in a bow. The once-fiery Noriko is quickly softened, pacified, and sidelined by motherhood, becoming almost angelic when she all but returns from the dead for a perfect, Rockwellian ending. But even at this speed, some things manage to slip through the cracks of the film’s slick and overly curated surfaces, moments of unwieldy beauty, like the blue-green of the ocean or the film’s genuine, complex emotional spectrum. Koichi’s survivor’s guilt seems to bleed through his dreams and become Godzilla itself, as if the creature is the manifestation of his personal, and Japan’s collective, death drive. And when he sees what that really means, when he witnesses the massive destruction of Ginza and the (temporary) death of a loved one, his scream seems to carry the pain of an entire nation. This personal approach certainly gives the damage on screen weight, if not quite breadth, but it starts to become problematic by the third act: because Godzilla is such an impossibly large threat, it’s hard to make its defeat feel intimate. All things considered, then, a citizen’s army is probably the next best thing. For reasons completely not worth going into (pure contrivance), neither the occupying American or Japanese governments are willing to fight Godzilla, so the people must come together and the politics of the film really start to show. There’s a certain illusory criticism of Imperial Japan in one of this new army’s rousing and sappy speeches — which is smothered in the goopy and helplessly self-serious music much of the film is burdened with — ”this country has treated life far too cheaply,” a scientist with an absurd plan to kill Godzilla reflects. And while it’s easy to agree that sending soldiers like Koichi to kill themselves for a doomed war effort is objectively bad, the film goes no further than that conclusion: when they say life, they mean Japanese life and Japanese life alone, and it’s not the method itself that’s the problem, since Koichi will send himself to almost-certain death before the Kaiju is bested. Anything beyond this mildly stated criticism of the government’s disregard for its own people goes unmentioned, and there’s certainly no hint toward the massive war crimes they just committed. We’re left only to conclude that the real problem is that the Empire wasn’t effective enough; that it lost. Godzilla becomes the perfect excuse for remilitarization — a talking point of the Japanese right since American occupation — and less an outlet for a Rambo-like revenge against a re-imagined occupier or a dirge for a pre-bomb world than a way for the Japanese people to rise above the shame of defeat (thereby mostly ignoring horrors of the occupation) and side-step an empire that failed to live up to their nobility and strength (continuing its project mostly uninterrupted). It’s no more jingoistic than the average American military movie, sure, but those deserve all the criticism leveled against them, too. On paper, the handsomely mounted and emotionally charged Minus One might be the best Godzilla movie in nearly 70 years, but in practice, it’s something much less. That’s not to overstate the revolutionary potential of the rest of the series, nor locate their virtues only within politics, but if Koichi and the citizen-soldier had built the Oxygen Destroyer — which in the 1954 original had to be destroyed once Godzilla was defeated because no man could be trusted with such power — it’s hard to imagine the film would have trouble letting them keep it for another day; for the next mission. In All Monsters Attack, the escapism of Godzilla helped a lonely young boy see something beyond the sad state that surrounded him, but in Godzilla Minus One the escapism becomes a militaristic wet dream of power and destruction; a fantasy world where Japan can reassert their might with perfect justification."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE," GODZILLA MINUS ONE. With Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Sakura Ando, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Munetaka Aoki. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. Rated PG-13 for creature violence and action. 125 minutes. In theaters. The first thing we see is a bomb. Because that’s where it all began, isn’t it? The smashing new creature feature GODZILLA MINUS ONE was made as part of Toho Studios’ 70th anniversary celebration of their signature monster and is, by my count, the 33d “Gojira” film produced by the Japanese studio and the 37th Godzilla movie in total, if you want to include those embarrassing American attempts. But the skyscraper-sized, radioactive lizard never belonged over here anyway. He originally came to life as a culture’s subconscious reckoning with post-WWII atomic anxieties about mass destruction and environmental ruin. (It’s the same psychological reason American audiences became so stupidly obsessed with superhero movies after 9/11. People tend to process things through shared fantasies and pulp.) I’m told there’s currently an Apple TV+ streaming series continuing that dreadful “Godzilla Vs. Kong” picture from a couple years back, but in theaters you can see the king of the monsters heading home to trash Tokyo in writer-director Takashi Yamazaki’s rousingly assured crowd-pleaser. This movie rules. The aforementioned explosive is strapped to the bottom of a plane flown by Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who feigns engine trouble to get out of meeting his greater glory. The war’s almost over, anyway. Our young coward gets a second chance to prove his mettle when the island where he put in for repairs is ravaged by a more svelte and smaller-than-usual dinosaur-type sea creature, a pre-nuclear upgrade Gojira who Shikishima has a chance to shoot, but chickens out again. Then we skip ahead a couple of years to 1946, when a firebombed Tokyo is trying to rebuild itself out of the ruins. Shikishima is squatting in what remains of his family home with a fetching street urchin named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and an abandoned baby they’ve come to call their own. Sakura Ando – so memorable as the mom in Hirokazu Kore-eda’s “Shoplifters” – plays a nosy neighbor who knows these kids better than they know themselves. It’s a lot of adorable domesticity until a familiar big guy shows up off the coast, all grown up, radioactive and ready to rumble. What makes “Godzilla Minus One” such an enthralling experience is Yamazaki’s embrace of straight-faced, traditional melodrama combined with cutting edge blockbuster thrills. The human story is old-fashioned and unabashedly corny, smartly resisting any urge to “modernize” the period dialogue for contemporary audiences and allowing the characters to fret sincerely about matters of honor and redemption. The movie takes place in 1946 and could have been made then as well, were it not for the astounding special effects that somehow manage to render the most detailed, photorealistic-looking Godzilla I’ve ever seen in a movie… but he still kind of lumbers around like a man in a suit with a load in his pants. The creature has a great, dead-eyed stare that is a miracle of CGI yet also ever so slightly resembles a rubber mask. This is a tricky needle to thread, and Yamazaki – who is also credited as effects supervisor – does so brilliantly. He gives us all the iconic shots we’ve come to expect from a Godzilla movie – familiar sights like screaming pedestrians being crushed underfoot, or the big guy’s bright blue atomic halitosis – rendered with current technology but a classical sensibility, accompanied by a  rip-roaring re-orchestration of Akira Ifukube’s original score. The seafaring action sequences crib smartly from “Jaws” and “Dunkirk,” while an old-school stomping of Giza blows the doors off most American blockbusters. The reported budget for this picture is $15 million, and I understand that there are matters of exchange rates and differing national production models to be taken into consideration. But still, the fact that something this spectacular cost a tiny fraction of any crummy-looking Marvel movie should have Hollywood executives hanging their heads in shame.

"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE," Not to be confused with the recent American line of Godzilla movies from production company Legendary Pictures, “Godzilla Minus One” comes from Japan’s celebrated Toho Studios. It’s Toho’s first Godzilla movie since 2016’s “Shin Godzilla”. And it’s their 33rd Godzilla film since first creating the iconic King of the Monsters in 1954. And what better way to celebrate the franchise’s upcoming 70th anniversary than with a new Toho production? Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki (who also served as visual effects supervisor), “Godzilla Minus One” has the feel of some the earliest Toho classics both in setting and style of storytelling. But don’t worry, today’s state-of-the-art visual effects and production design are on prominent display. As expected we get some jaw-dropping wide-scale destruction, and the encounters with the eponymous kaiju are exhilarating. Yet it’s the undercurrent of humanity that may catch audiences by surprise. Takashi’s story unfolds in the years immediately following World War II. Japan’s infrastructure, economy, and morale has been decimated. Its people struggle to put their lives back together, living in makeshift homes and barely able to provide food for their families. The government offers little help leading to an unstable and vulnerable country. It’s a setting that fans of Toho’s earliest films will immediately recognize – one that’s still rich with political and cultural undertones. Disgraced kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns home to Tokyo only to find his parents were killed and his neighborhood decimated from air raids in the waning days of the war. Not only is Koichi overwhelmed with grief, but he also struggles with PTSD and survivors guilt. We learn that two years prior he feigned a mechanical issue with his plane, landing on Odo island rather than carrying out his mission. While there the small outpost of mechanics is attacked by a massive prehistoric creature dubbed “Godzilla” by the locals. Koichi is one of only two survivors. In Tokyo Koichi reluctantly takes in a young woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and helps her care for an orphaned baby girl whose parents were also killed in the bombing. This  family (of sorts) have a difficult time getting by, leading a desperate Koichi to take a dangerous government sanctioned job detonating sea mines left over from the war. But he and his eclectic boat crew come face-to-face with a danger far greater than mines. Yep, Godzilla returns and has the Japanese mainland in its sights. The government tries to keep the discovery from going public, but you can only keep a giant lizard the size of a skyscraper a secret for so long. Inevitably Godzilla reaches land allowing Yamazaki to let loose with some stunning effects-drive set pieces brought to life through an array of visual wizardry. We witness devastation and destruction on a visually epic scale. And then there is Godzilla who’s presented as a terrifying force of nature yet remains a powerful metaphor for nuclear weapons. While the kaiju action he delivers is immensely satisfying, Yamazaki never loses sight of the humanity-rich stories being told at the same time. These two facets remain inseparable throughout this surprisingly heartfelt and artful throwback. “Godzilla Minus One” offers a crash course on how to make a great blockbuster. It has the signature thrills and big screen spectacle. But it’s the deeply ingrained human element that make it stand out. It certainly left me wanting more. “Godzilla Minus One” is in select theaters now. Our friend Godzilla seems to be turning up everywhere these days. I have heard many good things about this one, especially when it comes to the humanity aspect. Far from being just another monster movie. Looking forward to it. My wife and I went to see the “Minus Color” cut today, and we were just blown away by how fantastic the film was. I really loved seeing the black & white version first as I grew up on those old-time Godzilla films. It has become my favorite Godzilla movie ever. Great film. I saw this over the weekend.  It’s by far the best Godzilla movie since the original 1954 movie.  Yeah, it’s got great monster action, but the story, the characters, and the writing are all top-tier.  This is easily my third favorite movie of the year, beat only by Barbie and Oppenheimer.  This was also made for 15 million dollars, but looks like a 100 million dollar movie.  Hollywood: Are you paying attention? Now this feels like a Godzilla film although the trailer for Godzilla x Kong looks really cool and that last shot of the trailer.   I wanna see that.  Kong and Godzilla together kicking ass.  Yet, I do think there should be a new stipulation for all Godzilla movies to be made that should feature the song by Blue Oyster Cult.  I fucking love the BOC. It is official, as determine by an independent Godzilla movie rating agency (me), that this not one of the best Godzilla movies, it is the best.  Period, no more discussion needed."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE," In 1954, Japanese entertainment company Toho changed the monster movie genre forever with Godzilla, the first film in the studio’s decades-long franchise that has spanned four different eras. Now, Japanese director Akashi Yamazaki has helmed the latest instalment that marks Toho’s 33rd Godzilla film. Godzilla Minus One follows kamikaze pilot Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who fled from his duty towards the end of World War II and crash-landed on an island where he first encounters Godzilla, a dinosaur-like creature. Upon returning home to Tokyo, he tries to resume a normal life until Godzilla resurfaces, threatening the city. Although Godzilla has been a long-standing cinematic icon, Toho’s instalments are not as widely watched as Hollywood’s recent efforts. Although the 1998 version starring Matthew Broderick was a box office bomb, Legendary Pictures rebooted Hollywood’s take on the kaiju in 2014 while establishing the Western version of the MonsterVerse – with mixed results. The latest instalment, Godzilla vs Kong, was a Covid casualty, resulting in a delayed release, but it didn’t stop audiences from making it a box office hit and was the most successful launch item in HBO Max’s history until it was overtaken by the Mortal Kombat reboot. So, even after 70 years, can Toho’s Godzilla storm Western cinemas? Although Godzilla Minus One presents itself as a disaster film, the narrative has a significant human aspect to it. This is mostly driven by Koichi, who is wrestling with survivor guilt after abandoning his duty and unable to fight Godzilla when he sees it for the first time. Driven by Ryunosuke’s emotive performance and Yamazaki’s screenplay, Koichi’s struggles with PTSD allow human psychology and the theme of survival to take centre stage while highlighting the mental toil of ex-soldiers and post-war Japan. This character-driven plot enables an increased focus on Godzilla being an antagonist rather than having supporting characters unsuccessfully understand an alien species, which forms a straightforward yet more cohesive narrative – notably, man good, monster bad. As for the kaiju, he is a formidable on-screen presence. He stalks his prey in the water like the Great White shark in Jaws, his eyes show no fear, and his atomic breath effortlessly obliterates everything in its path. With Naoki Sato’s score booming in the background, it is no wonder he strikes fear upon first glance and this resultant terror feeds the film’s predictable third act that sees a band of civilian and ex-Naval soldiers, including a determined Koichi, group together to kill Godzilla. However, the simplicity of the story means that most of the characters have little to do. Throughout the majority of the film, Koichi, his workmates, his live-in partner Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and their neighbour Sumiko (Sakura Ando) adjust to 1940s post-war Japan, which sees them struggle for food, money and work while satisfying certain character tropes (the hero seeking redemption, the cranky neighbour, the unreciprocated love interest). The characters’ continued efforts to resume any kind of normalcy feel increasingly monotonous to the point Godzilla needs to return to revive the feature. Needless to say, the action scenes involving the eponymous kaiju – most of which involve some epic sea-based combat scenes – lift the film, allowing Yamazaki and cinematographer Kozo Shibasaki to deliver exciting and crowd-pleasing battle sequences full of eye-popping special effects. While Godzilla is 70 years old, Godzilla Minus One shows that this kaiju isn’t retiring any time soon. Yamazaki’s thrilling and occasionally poignant instalment not only reminds us why Godzilla is a cinematic icon but also brings back the classic monster movie to the big screen."
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Rarely do we get a creature feature with this much depth and emotion&#46; Kamiki Ryunosuke&apos;s portrayal of a broken man filled with regret is beautifully on display&#44; and the big lizard has never been more deadly&#46; 
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE," The way Godzilla Minus One opens is why storytelling is so important. There’s not just terror lurking around the corner of a giant Kaiju beast with bad breath, but a mystery revolving around the central character that is engaging. One that sets the tone for the monster picture that grounds the story ever so slightly, allowing an out-of-this-world action adventure to feel more human-relatable than ever before. The story follows a kamikaze pilot, Kōichi Shikishima (a terrific Ryunosuke Kamiki), who lands his ship at a small mechanics outpost under mysterious circumstances. Finding no empathy from the unit’s lead mechanic, Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), Kōichi finds no solace in living another day. That’s all about to change when Godzilla shows up. Our pilot freezes when ordered to shoot the monster in the head. The result is that the entire group dies, except for Kōichi and Tachibana. Kōichi returns home to find his family has been killed. He has nothing left except haunting memories and survivor’s guilt. Then, by fate, he meets a beautiful young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who has, quite literally, picked up an infant girl with no parents off the streets. They both move into his home without asking and form a partnership. As the story progresses and as the child grows, Shikishima now has a family but refuses to allow himself the joy of it or acknowledge he may deserve it. Shikishima takes on a job locating and detonating deep ocean water mines. It’s a blatant attempt not just for money but to regain some pride and earn his courage. However, that’s when they learn of an American General named MacArthur (it’s archival footage and not Bruce Willis despite the military leader looking just like John McClane) setting off a nuclear test. Godzilla is now meaner, badder, and more indestructible than ever before. Now, Kōichi and his friends begin a plan to save their country (and the world) from total annihilation. Godzilla Minus One is written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki (Destiny: The Tale of Kamakura), who has a real knack for building tension and knowing how to frame a monstrous disaster picture. That being said, the dialogue—at least the English translation—is almost overtly melodramatic. Even though we can recognize this as a style (and even homage) to the culture the genre has created, almost every syllable, particularly between Kamiki’s Koichiu and Hamabe’s Noriko, is overwrought to the point of exhaustion. However, this does create enough of an emotional resonance and a character story arc for Kōichi—mainly because of the end of a second act trope—that has an emotional heft that carries the audience throughout the picture. This storyline leads to a finale with valuable themes and solid messages. Ones like sacrifice, teamwork, courage, cultural pride, and how precious life is, some uncommon in previous entries. What you are watching is a modernized version of Godzilla because we now live in a time where mental health is not about enduring the dark clouds in our lives and living there. It is about breaking through and leaving our monsters behind. That metaphor comes to a full realization with a deeply felt turn by Kamiki. He’s Japan’s version of Tom Cruise, starring in seven of the ten highest-grossing films in that country’s history. This is Kamiki’s moment, in full-star mode, and the best performance of the young actor’s career. Yet, we know you did not come to watch Koichiu carry the burden of his fallen comrades. No, you are here for the giant lizard that will not die. For the film’s well-known limited budget, which was reportedly around 15 to 17 million dollars, there are some spectacular action sequences to “ooh” and “aww” over in the theater while you butter your fingers with some popcorn. Yamazaki also was in charge of special effects and deserves praise for his work here. While the slower but still empowering scenes of Godzilla walking through city streets give the feeling of the old style of “suitmation,” you have the King of Monster’s riotous run-a-mok through Tokyo’s Ginza district, and ocean waters are awe-inspiring feats of cinematic bliss. There is no debate: Godzilla Minus One is not just the best modern Kaiju film of all time but the best Godzilla film ever made.

"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s impossible to think about monster films without mentioning Godzilla. The iconic creature stalking the streets of Tokyo has remained in pop culture for seventy years. From an original Japanese monster film in 1954, we’ve seen Godzilla and his monster bretheran capture the imagination of world cinema. Yet Godzilla Minus One etches a powerful new chapter in the franchise. With impeccable craft, brilliant storytelling, and astonishing visuals, director Takashi Yamazaki constructs a spectacle for the ages.  Godzilla Minus One picks up in the closing days of World War II. A kamikazee pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) lands on a remote island. While there, a creature known as Godzilla emerges from the ocean. Shikishima survies but carries guilt when nearly everyone at the base dies. He returns to Tokyo and finds a makeshift family. Shikishima cares for an orphan – Akiko – and a young woman, Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), by destroying undetonated mines. However, when Godzilla begins to destroy ships in the ocean, Shikishima must face his fears.  Yamazaki immediately makes his presence known as a director. As the writer and director, he funnels his vision into every frame and story beat. He handles the tone masterfully, seamlessly shifting from contentious action sequences to quiet discussions on guilt. The ability to handle both sides of the coin makes for brilliant emotional compositions and fluid editing. While the ending takes a small step down from the power of the first two hours, it’s still effective storytelling.  Perhaps most integral to Godzilla Minus One is the incredible monster himself. Yamazaki allows his Godzilla to take multiple forms, and draws considerable influence from years past. His giant dinosaur is terrifying, even in its introduction as a smaller beast. Every bit as violent as a T-Rex, he’s even more terrifying with quick twitch strength. The design maximizes his power, both helping this version stand out while paying homage to classic character details (“the Godzilla walk” in particular). The atomic breath scenes are downright devastating. Perhaps most intriguing, Yamazaki draws from Jaws for several water-bound sequences. In each moment, he finds ways to expand upon Spielbergian ideas but keeps the tension in place.  It’s hard to imagine that Yamazaki does not have questions about the dangers of nationalism on his mind. In several sequences, he openly questions total devotion to a cause, even if it’s one you’ve sworn to protect. He finds moments to showcase the nuance and power of finding a connection. At the same time, Godzilla Minus One makes a powerful argument about those who show patriotism, even when that patriotic duty is questioned. While a militia ultimately comes together to fight Godzilla, it’s made of those who did not sacrifice themselves in the war. Around the globe, rising nationalism and fascism lead to unnecessary violence. These characters know one’s life is more than blind devotion to a country or ideology.  The performances further Yamazaki’s screenplay as well. Kamiki stands out for having to balance the extreme mood shifts stemming from PTSD. His emotional breakdowns must feel realistic, and while he occasionally pushes too hard, he lands the emotional arc. Hamabe underplays much of her role, but that comes by design. Her calm counters the outbursts from Kamiki. However, this also leaves her in a position of being underutilized. It’s in the cast that we find the most nuance to sell Godzilla Minus One. Munetaka Aoki stands out for his knowledgeable bit, somewhat excited scientist. Kuranosuke Sasaki gets a more nuanced role as a ship captain, but he gets plenty of one-liners to keep him interesting. Yuki Yamada plays an ambitious but naive fool in Kamiki’s struggling performance. Yamada illustrates the power of youth and how battles – especially those against giant monsters – change our worldview.  Finally, the disillusioned Hidetaka Yoshioka and Sakura Ando help Western audiences understand the stakes of Kamiki’s role. To them, his inaction destroyed their faith in humanity. They clarify that his lack of action resulted in real consequences, even if their thinking changes over time.  From start to finish, Godzilla Minus One feels like a standout entry in a storied franchise. A screenplay with expertly drawn characters and motivations rarely exists in blockbuster filmmaking. Yet, Yamazaki proves Godzilla still has plenty of life as a franchise. Godzilla Minus One is an instant classic that combines personal stakes, excellent visuals, stupendous sound work, and a humming score. It’s a near-perfect film, let alone blockbuster."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE," “Godzilla Minus One” restores Japan’s most famous import to a thrilling cinematic throne. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki who also with Kiyoko Shibuya was responsible for special effects, the film also heralds a new cinematic auteur. This is truly Godzilla as king of the kaiju. There is no White reporter inserted nor any White protagonist. This is Godzilla as a monster threatening Japan and the Japanese rising to defeat it and the film pays tribute to the original 1954 black-and-white film. In the US, the first glimpse of Godzilla was in 1956 in the film “Godzilla, King of the Monsters!” which was not only dubbed, but added new footage with actor Raymond Burr interacting with body-doubles and Japanese American actors to make it seem as if Burr’s character, journalist Steve Martin, was part of the original Japanese production. That film begins with Martin in the hospital and telling his story through flashbacks. The Japanese original film wasn’t officially available outside of Japan until 2004. The 1954 film premiered on 27 October, but on the first day of March in that year, the Japanese fishing vessel Daigo Fukuryū  Maru had been contaminated by the radioactive fallout from the US military Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb testing at the Bikini Atoll. The crew all suffered from acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and while most of the crew recovered, the chief radioman died (23 September 1954). Japan hasn’t been without a Godzilla film. Independent of the Legendary series, there are animated feature films on Netflix: there’s 2017 “Godzilla : Planet of the Monsters,” the 2018 “Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle,” the 2018 “Godzilla: The Planet Eater,” and the 2021 “Godzilla:  Singular Point” on Netflix.  The first three films are part of a series in which a protagonist Haruo Sakai battles Godzilla after returning to an Earth that is dominated by Godzilla. “Godzilla Minus One” begins before the original film.  In the last months of World War II, a kamikaze pilot, Kōichi Shikishima 敷島 浩一 (Ryunosuke Kaki), pretends that there are mechanical problems with his airplane and lands at the military repair station on Odo Island. Soon after the mechanics discover his airplane is fully functional, dead deep sea fish float to the top of the sea water and Godzilla appears. As the mechanics panic, their leader, Sōsaku Tachibana 橘 宗作tells Shikishima to man the guns on his airplane to kill Godzilla. Although Shikishima makes it to his airplane, he freezes. Godzilla kills everyone except Shikishima and Tachibana. Shikishima eventually returns to his home in Tokyo, but his parents are dead, his neighbor Sumiko Ōta 太田 澄子(Sakura Ando), informs him. She is initially disgusted that he didn’t die in a suicidal flight like to many others. But Shikishima meets a woman, Noriko Ōishi 大石 典子 (Minami Hamabe), who cares for an orphaned child, Akiko 明子(Sae Nagatani), and they become a family unit although there is nothing romantic between Shikishima and Noriko. Shikishima takes a job on a minesweeping boat, Shinsei Maru,  as their gunner, working with scientist Kenji Noda 野田 健治 (Hidetaka Yoshioka), trainee Shirō Mizushima 水島 四郎 (Yuki Yamada) and ship captain Tatsuo Hotta 堀田 辰雄 (Min Tanaka). Because this is hazardous governmental work clearing the mines leftover from both the Japanese and US military, the pay is extremely high. Unfortunately, the US nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll result in Godzilla mutating and becoming much larger and he’s heading for Japan. When the minesweeper is tasked with delaying Godzilla, until the heavy cruiser Takao can engage with the kaiju. A mine is released and detonated after Godzilla bites it, but although injured, Godzilla regenerates. Shikishima returns to Tokyo but when he hears that Godzilla is heading for Ginza where Noriko now works, he goes to find her, but although the Japanese military is there, Godzilla uses his atomic breath and in the powerful air currents, Noriko is blown away after pushing Shikishima into an alley. Godzilla has returned to the ocean, leaving the Japanese to devise another plan. A prototype of a new fighter airplane, the Kyushu J7W Shinden, a real fighter plane that was designed but tested on the same days as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is found and Shikishima insists that Tachibana come to repair them. The plan is to use boats to encircle Godzilla, surround him with Freon tanks to use the water pressure to kill him and if that fails, balloons would bring him back to the surface too quickly for him to survive. If all else fails, the plane will fly into Godzilla’s mouth and explode. Directed and written by Takashi Yamazaki, “Godzilla Minus One” updates the original and brings into focus the reality of post-war Japan. Godzilla here is a threat and not a hero, but the Japanese must rise to protect themselves since maneuvers by the US military in a Japan would be perceived as a threat by  the Soviet Union. Instead of the story of a scientist (Dr. Daisuke Serizawa) sacrificing himself to save Japan, this is the story of one man’s struggle with survivor’s guilt, PTSD and economic survival in a post-war Japan. This is a story about families lost and formed due to dire circumstances. And this is about a monster that was made more threatening due to nuclear testing. The Legendary series, even when the action is based in Japan or China, chooses to use a White person as the POV character. The 2014 “Godzilla” directed by Gareth Edwards, begins in Japan at the fictional Janjira nuclear plant which has a French woman (Juliette Binoche) as its nuclear regulations consultant and husband, American Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) as the lead engineer at the same plant. The movie then follows their son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Ford is married to Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), who works as a nurse in San Francisco where they live with there son, Sam Brody (Carson Bolde). There is really no reason to have a White American or European working at a Japanese nuclear plant and San Francisco is 45 percent White, but 34 percent Asian American. The percentage of East Asians in Japan is obviously higher than that. The next film,  “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” (2019, also focused on White Americans. Kyle Chandler as Dr. Mark Russell, Vera Farmiga as his former wife, Dr. Emma Russell and Millie Bobby Brown as their 12-year-old daughter, Madison Russell. The film begins in San Francisco, but quickly switches to China where Emma and Madison are living an American lifestyle in an American style house in the Yunnan rainforest .  The 2021 sequel, “Godzilla vs. Kong,” starred Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård as Dr. Nathan Lind, and brings back Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown). Rebecca Hall plays the anthropological linguist and adoptive mother of Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the young deaf orphaned Iwi native. In China or Japan or even the fictional Pacific island of Iwi, the people that are central to the movie are White. In “Godzilla Minus One,” the name of the protagonist Kōichi Shikishima 敷島 浩一 tells us that he is the first-born son. The first character of the given name means “abundance.” Shikishima is, according to Nelson’s character dictionary, another term for “(ancient) Japan.” It is also the name of a battleship. The name Tachibana (橘) is a name already connected with Godzilla but in the 2001″Godzilla Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack”) the characters Admiral Taizo Tachibana and his daughter Yuri Tachibana used different characters (立花) to express that name.  Although the surname Tachibana is associated with a samurai clan, the clan uses the characters used for the 2001 film. The name of the neighbor,  Sumiko Ōta 太田 澄子, means “big field” (Ōta) and “clear” or “to clarify.” Noriko Ōishi 大石 典子, the woman who cares for the orphaned child, pointedly calls Shikishima “o-niisan” which means older brother. Her surname “big rock” and her given name means “rule” or “law” which is somewhat ironic because she meets Shikishima when accused of breaking the law (theft). Akiko’s 明子　name means “clearness,” “dawn” and “pure.” It is part of the word for “tomorrow” (明日). Like the Kyushu J7W Shinden (九州 J7W 震電), the Takao (高雄) was a real Japanese cruiser active in the Japanese Navy as was the Yukikaze 雪風(Snowy  Wind), the Yūkaze 夕風 (Evening Wind)  and Hibiki　響 (Echo). Shinden means to tremble or vibrate, and the last character means “electric.” The National Air and Space Museum translates the name Shinden as “magnificent lightning.” As a result of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan in 1905 (Treaty of Portsmouth) gained Sakhalin south of the 50th parallel and gave this part the Japanese name of Karafuto. After the Russian Revolution, the Japanese occupied all of Sakhalin, but they withdrew in 1924; in the following year White Russian forces were driven out of the north by Soviet troops. The Soviet Union regained the southern half of the island in 1945, at the end of World War II, together with the Kurils, and Sakhalin’s entire Japanese population eventually was repatriated. The threat of what was then the Soviet Union was fresh in the minds of the Japanese in the post-war years. There is still a dispute over the Kuril Islands between Japan and the former Soviet Union. The US recognizes Japan’s sovereignty over the islands. On 7 October 2022, the Ukraine “recognized the southern Kuril Islands as Japanese territory.” “Godzilla Minus One” also brings a stark contrast with the contemporary image of Japan and post-war Japan. In its depictions of Tokyo and the now high-rent district of Ginza, the film is a good reminder of what changes Japan has seen and what the few remaining survivors of the privations of World War II had to contend with. Looking at Tokyo today, it’s almost unimaginable. The CGI-generated Godzilla design pays tribute to the original. Its face is more rounded and has bigger eyes than that of the Legendary series depiction. The tail seems more integrated into the movement of the kaiju compared to the Godzilla of the 2016 “Shin Godzilla.” “Godzilla Minus One” takes us back to the original Godzilla, but moves forward with improved Godzilla model. In addition, the storytelling is logical, historical and filled with intimate emotional moments that are absent from the Legendary series. While the proportions of Godzilla don’t always seem to be exactly right in terms of proportions, with the head seeming small in some shots, but more acceptable from a worm’s eye view, this is the best Godzilla movie in years. “Tokyo Minus One” (ゴジラ-1.0) is the 37th film in the Godzilla franchise, the 33rd Godzilla film and the fifth film in the franchise’s current Reiwa era. The film had its world premiere on 18 October 2023 in Shinjuku as the closing film of the 36th Tokyo International Film Festival. It was released in Japan on 3 November 2023 (Godzilla Day), which is the same day the original 1954 film was released. The film was released in the US on 1 December 2023.  In Japanese with English subtitles. NB: If you are wondering why the word “kamikaze” is never mentioned, in Japan the characters were originally read as “shimpū” which is the on-reading. The full term for the squad is shimpūtokubetsukōgekitai 神風特別攻撃隊 but is shortened to tokkōtai 特攻隊."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One is a blessing to Toho’s kaiju franchise and a towering accomplishment for the entire kaiju subgenre. Director and writer Takashi Yamazaki respects the balance between monster mashes and human perspectives, unlike our blockbuster domestic efforts, which oftentimes lean toward larger-than-life action thrills (although Apple TV+’s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is off to an inspiring start). After thirty-plus films and nearly seventy years, Toho confidently delivers one of their best Godzilla movies to date. Other franchises can’t sustain momentum over a measly trilogy, where Toho’s city-smashing icon shows no signs of retreating to depths unknown. Yamazaki injects the worldwide anxiety and government unreliability he felt during the height of COVID-19 outbreaks into a Godzilla film about post-WWII Japan. Kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) barely escapes his first encounter with Godzilla during active duty, after faking mechanical issues that ground his plane safely. Shikishima returns home racked by survivor’s guilt to find Tokyo’s now a rubble heap, and over the next two years, attempts to rebuild a life with Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe) and an orphaned child — then Godzilla strikes again. Japan has depleted resources, Godzilla now spews “heat blast” powers thanks to the United States’ Bikini Atoll weapons tests, and a wounded country must rely on the resilience of its citizens to survive the reptilian behemoth who seeks to destroy. Shirogumi Inc. provides smashing visual effects under Yamazaki’s supervision (with direction from Kiyoko Shibuya), delivering a Godzilla that looks spectacular on screen. From the pre-mutation version with shades of Jurassic Park models to the atomic evolution that pulsates glacier blue, can extend its scales, and imposes a dominant kaiju stance (even with those teeny T-Rex arms compared to its gargantuan size). Computer animation does Godzilla justice, tweaking Toho’s trademark Godzilla look with added ferocity, whether swimming under ocean waves or toppling skyscrapers with tailwhips. Without proper visual effects, any Godzilla movie topples — but with magnificent Godzilla effects, you lay a foundation with knockout potential. Under the scaly skin of Godzilla Minus One is a story about the ungovernable, mass resistance, and the salvation that is communal togetherness. Godzilla is in pure berserker mode as he tears through Japanese architecture and hurls battleships like bathtub toys, but the story isn’t shrouded in bleakness. For all of Yamazaki’s commentary on how post-war Japan was abandoned with the ongoing US/Russian conflict, or how little Japan valued the lives of its soldiers, an earnest upheaval of camaraderie becomes the film’s most important attribute. Yamazaki openly projects national and global fears for all to see, yet there’s also a swelling sensation of pridefulness as Shikishima joins leftover ranks — who’ve already survived one war — to risk their lives on their own terms this time. In the same beautifully shot scene, we can feel the terror Godzilla strikes and the feats humanity can achieve when working in harmony. Not only Shikishima, but others like former weapons engineer Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) or ex-Air Service mechanic Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) face the harsh reality of protecting Japan despite their homeland’s past transgressions. Godzilla movies are punctuated by highlights of the massive monster laying waste to bustling metropolitan hubs — especially when blasting its icy energy rays — but it’s humankind’s response that completes the picture. Shin Godzilla boasts the same evenhanded storytelling, whereas Legendary’s Godzilla vs. Kong can feel like a slighter rumble in urban jungles. Godzilla Minus One juggles everything, grappling with the immense formidability of both physical and existential Godzilla crises without ignoring all the smashy-crashy we all love so much. Using Godzilla, Yamazaki finds a way to relate 1940s Japanese unease to contemporary paranoias. He showcases how genre films can shoulder storytelling far more profound than the average read on “Big Monster Bash ‘Em Movies.” Noda’s master plan to defeat Godzilla isn’t about artillery shells but hail-mary logic applied to illogical circumstances. Shikishima’s guilt complex is a product of toxic nationalism that leads to heartbreaking moments about what horrible things citizens are asked to do by their ruling governments. Yamazaki strands his characters amidst shattered Tokyo homes with little to nothing, all collateral damage way before kaiju attacks. These subplots make Godzilla Minus One so compelling, because Toho so astutely understands that Godzilla movies are just as much about the people as they are the creature. Godzilla Minus One is a brilliant addition to Godzilla’s canon that shines thanks to Yamazaki’s two-pronged approach. Godzilla’s action sequences are sprawling and devastating by the handful, capturing the megamonster’s miles-high imposition that makes us feel like ants underfoot. Then there’s the human element of it all, dressed in obliterated period aesthetics that remind of frightening times at the dawn of the nuclear age not unlike wholesome ’50s horror films where Pleasantville towns must defeat a common foe (The Blob, for example). Godzilla Minus One is about finding a way to thrive in impossible times as much as it is kaiju entertainment, and with that approach, Yamazaki raises the bar for future Godzilla iterations. Officially announced by Blumhouse and Lionsgate earlier this month, a reboot of The Blair Witch Project is currently in the works, which will be the third follow-up to the original found footage horror classic that changed the game back in 1999. In the wake of the announcement, the original creators and stars have each issued joint statements this weekend. The Blair Witch Project was created by filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez – along with Haxan Films creative partners Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Michael Monello – back in the 1990s, with stars Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard heading out into the woods of Maryland to conjure up horror magic together. The actors largely improvised their performances and even used their real names in the movie, with the film’s clever viral marketing campaign leading many to believe that they weren’t actually actors in a movie, but rather real people who truly went missing out in the woods. All this to say, Donahue, Williams and Leonard are collectively a huge part of why The Blair Witch Project became a pop culture phenomenon, and all these years later they’re looking for some recognition from Lionsgate, the current rights holders of the iconic property. As Joshua Leonard first explained in a Facebook post on April 11, “I’m so proud of our little punk-rock movie, and I LOVE the fans who keep the flames burning. But at this point, it’s 25 years of disrespect from the folks who’ve pocketed the lion’s share (pun intended) of the profits from OUR work, and that feels both icky and classless.” 1. Retroactive + future residual payments to Heather, Michael and Josh for acting services rendered in the original BWP, equivalent to the sum that would’ve been allotted through SAG-AFTRA, had we had proper union or legal representation when the film was made. 2. Meaningful consultation on any future Blair Witch reboot, sequel, prequel, toy, game, ride, escape room, etc… , in which one could reasonably assume that Heather, Michael & Josh’s names and/or likenesses will be associated for promotional purposes in the public sphere. Note: Our film has now been rebooted twice, both times were a disappointment from a fan/box office/critical perspective. Neither of these films were made with significant creative input from the original team. As the insiders who created the Blair Witch and have been listening to what fans love & want for 25 years, we’re your single greatest, yet thus-far unutilized secret-weapon! 3. “The Blair Witch Grant”: A 60k grant (the budget of our original movie), paid out yearly by Lionsgate, to an unknown/aspiring genre filmmaker to assist in making their first feature film. This is a GRANT, not a development fund, hence Lionsgate will not own any of the underlying rights to the project. “As we near the 25th anniversary of The Blair Witch Project, our pride in the storyworld we created and the film we produced is reaffirmed by the recent announcement of a reboot by horror icons Jason Blum and James Wan. “While we, the original filmmakers, respect Lionsgate’s right to monetize the intellectual property as it sees fit, we must highlight the significant contributions of the original cast — Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. As the literal faces of what has become a franchise, their likenesses, voices, and real names are inseparably tied to The Blair Witch Project. Their unique contributions not only defined the film’s authenticity but continue to resonate with audiences around the world. If you’d like to support the cause, sharing and amplifying is the way to go. You’ll find the original post for Heather, Michael and Josh’s statement below, which can be shared to your feed."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"  In 1954, Japanese filmmaker Ishirō Honda created one of the most recognizable and classic figures ever conceived for the big screen, Godzilla. The classic roar of the mutant reptile has been heard through multiple generations, and, seven decades after its creation, its impact is ever strong. The first kaiju (a Japanese word that literally means “strange beast” and is associated with media involving giant monsters) paved the way for other creatures to be born, like Ultraman, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. And now, thanks to Toho and director Takashi Yamazaki, we get Godzilla Minus One, a picture that departs from the blockbuster gloss of the big studios and feels more engraved in the original masterpiece’s themes. Yamazaki’s rendition of the classic monster goes further away from the original’s 1954 setting. Godzilla Minus One takes place immediately after World War II, in 1946. A prologue introduces it, set near the end of World War II on an island that contains a feeling of forthcoming damnation. There is something eerie within those surroundings; despair and melancholy ooze from the pores of everybody habituating in that encampment. On that island, we meet our hero, Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a man assigned to be a kamikaze pilot. But after claiming to have had technical issues with his plane, he deserted his post. Kōichi may not know it in that instance, but his decision not to fix the place has just saved his life. However, what happens next will leave a scar on his mind, body, and soul. During the night, a weaker (yet terrifying) version of Godzilla attacks them, unleashing a path of destruction and flames. Kōichi, fearing for his life, is frozen. He’s unable to pull the trigger on his aircraft’s gun to shoot the creature down or even move. The image of something indescribable destroying the land where you stand in a matter of seconds leaves him cold. He is left scarred not only because of his inability to act upon such a towering force but also due to being one of the few survivors of the attack. This prologue helps us be deep in the mindset of the main character’s mental stability as he perceives the trigger of his trauma. The war isn’t even over, and Kōichi has to continue facing the horrors of WWII and the premonition of another attack by Godzilla. But at least something has helped him stay strong after those events. A few years later, Kōichi has started a family alongside a woman named Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe) and an orphaned baby. This is a grouping of people who have been left behind or separated from their past lives because of the war. While they might be isolated for different reasons, they all connect with the tragedy they have experienced and the grief each one holds. After all that suffering the three of them have gone through, they have finally stopped letting the demons eat them alive and started regaining some sense of normalcy within their lives, specifically Kōichi. His new job at a minesweeper still takes him back to the cataclysm he endured, removing and detonating naval mines, but he’s been able to confront it thanks to the people he has by his side. Unfortunately, this life that has kept him alive through these post-war melancholic days is in jeopardy when Godzilla emerges from the depths of the sea again. This time, the monster is stronger, more dangerous, and more fear-inducing than before. Kōichi puts together a crack team of veterans and ex-Navy civilians to take down the beast. They have decided to confront it instead of stepping back and letting fear run their lives. One of the most interesting things that Yamazaki does in Godzilla Minus One is making the human characters the center of attention instead of the titular beast. While you ultimately pay the ticket for Godzilla, the characters keep you invested due to their tangible emotions. You feel their sorrow, pain, and grief throughout each interaction, even with the melodramatic touches that pop up from time to time. Yamazaki gives us plenty of time to explore who Kōichi is. The Japanese filmmaker lets us into the mindset to dissect his emotions, whether it is his resounding guilt or the hopefulness of his newly formed family. In the same way he previously reinvented the character of Lupin in his animated feature Lupin III: The First (2019), Yamazaki is interested more in the characters than the spectacle, although there is a big amount of detail and attentiveness put into the action set-pieces. He develops intriguing dynamics that make us care about what’s taking place instead of them being disposable background characters. This is one of the reasons why the majority of the MonsterVerse films falter. In the past couple of years, Hollywood has been developing some features based on the aforementioned kaiju for their multi-million-dollar franchise. The assortment has been a mixed bag, except for Gareth Edward’s version of Godzilla. They are solely crafted to deliver the popcorn entertainment side of these types of films: action set-pieces, disaster film mayhem, and big monsters fighting one another. That isn’t a bad thing per se: it is interesting to see the different variations of these creatures. Still, when you look at these films in more depth, they feel hollow. The main reason why that happens is that they lack fully-fledged characters who serve as the film’s heart and soul. Without them, you get CGI monsters hitting each other for no particular reason, which occasionally looks cool but runs stale quickly. You can see the difference immediately in Godzilla Minus One, where the weight of the narrative and its characters is felt in every instance, moving the film forward to a stirring and impactful climax. Like in Toho’s previous release, Hideaki Anno’s Shin Godzilla, and Ishirō Honda’s creation before it, the creature is a metaphor for the trauma that Japanese people suffered from the destructive force of the atomic bomb and natural disasters. These are films that focus on deconstructions of the government via anti-war messaging. All of the horrors of war are put together into one devastating figure. There are many details of this analogy in the creature’s prehistoric design and in the way Yamazaki envisions Godzilla’s atomic breath. He sees it as a machine slowly building up to a powerful release of force. As Godzilla’s scales begin to appear on its back, his ultimate attack charges. And when the creature unleashes such energy, it culminates in an impact that takes the shape of a mushroom cloud, which symbolizes the caved-in impact of an atomic bomb. The sound cuts out once the attack is unleashed, leaving its surroundings decimated. That sequence is both striking and frightening. This is one of the best set-pieces of the entire year due to Yamazaki’s handling of tone – blending horror and action with the melodrama attached to its screenplay – and direction, a standout moment in the movie. The other action set-pieces are also very impressive and exhilarating. Most of them are set around the sea, as man and beast clash in grand-scale battles, referencing Steven Spielberg’s Jaws and Joe Dante’s Piranha in the process. By stripping things back to get a throwback feeling yet with a fresh perspective, Yamazaki and Toho take things in a different direction that’s more character-focused and story-driven rather than a complete showcase of spectacle. All of these elements culminate into one of the best entries in the series of kaiju-related movies. Godzilla Minus One is now available to watch in US theaters, IMAX and 4DX, and will be released in UK cinemas from December 15, 2023."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE," 
	Months later, Koichi returns to Tokyo only to discover that his parents were killed and their home is in ruins. He befriends a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who has taken in an orphaned infant girl, and the three form a makeshift family, with a friendly neighbor (Sakura Ando of Monster and Shoplifters) providing moral and babysitting support. Despite the happiness of his new relationships, Koichi is tormented by guilt, for both abandoning his kamikaze mission and surviving the massacre on the island. 
	Godzilla has long been seen as a symbolic representation of the nuclear devastation that Japan suffered, and that theme is evident here as well. But Godzilla Minus One adds a more personal dimension in the form of Koichi’s lingering trauma; the only way he thinks he’ll be able to expiate his guilt is by destroying the monster. To that end, he’s even willing to engage in the sort of suicide mission from which he previously bailed. 
	In addition to the human drama that distinguishes this effort, there’s no shortage of spectacular set pieces, including a thrilling sequence in which Godzilla chases a boat with the determined ferocity of the shark from Jaws. Despite a reported budget of a mere $15 million, the scenes in which Godzilla goes on the rampage are superbly executed, making one think that the major Hollywood studios, which think nothing of spending ten times that amount for similar efforts, should immediately head to Japan and take some lessons."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This film is a monster masterpiece delivering a perfect combination of tension and trauma&#46; It is a near perfect film only faltering in its overuse of the melodrama&#46;
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE," Contrasts the idea that soldiers must give their lives for their country (or be branded cowards) with the notion that humans have the right to live and find happiness. There are struggles with survivor's guilt, as well as shame, but there are also examples of courage, compassion, and kindness and a strong depiction of teamwork. Shikishima goes through a huge transformation, starting out cowardly and riddled with guilt. He takes in a young woman and an orphaned girl and finds himself tackling a dangerous job to be able to take care of them. By the end, he has found his courage. His co-workers are equally ready to pitch in and help one another to solve a big problem. The main cast members are all Japanese-born, and -- unlike the American-dubbed release of the original film -- no White people were added (the original made that choice because they thought it would appeal more to American audiences that way). Dialogue is in the original Japanese, with English subtitles for U.S. release. The movie also attempts to identify with and understand the mindset of the Japanese people after the destruction and despair of World War II. Guns and shooting. Dead bodies and bloody wounds. A person is attacked from behind and hit on the head with a blunt object. People punch one another and grab other by the hair. Giant monster decimates half a city with an atomic blast. (News reports that 30,000 were killed.) Giant monster stomps on and eats people, chomping on the upper half of their bodies. Monster also smashes things with its tail and feet and throws trains and boats through the air. Ocean mines, a plane, and ships explode. Person in peril, hanging on for dear life as the monster holds a train in its mouth. Dead fish bobbing in water. Dialogue about death. Small girl cries in anguish. A baby is an orphan. Parents need to know that Godzilla Minus One is a giant monster/kaiju movie set in post-World War II Japan. Expect lots of action violence, including guns and shooting, dead bodies, explosions, bloody wounds, punching, hitting with a blunt object, pulling hair, etc. A giant monster decimates a city with an atomic ray and smashes things with its feet and tail, crushing and eating humans and throwing trains and planes. There's also dialogue about death, and a baby is orphaned. There's a tentative romantic connection between two characters that isn't realized until the end. Mild language includes uses of ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""idiot,"" and ""stupid."" Characters drink sake with dinner; one person drinks more when upset, and a character is accused of being drunk. There's also background smoking. One of the best movies in the Godzilla franchise, it explores themes of human value and survivor's guilt and is surprisingly emotional. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In GODZILLA MINUS ONE, Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a kamikaze pilot during the final days of WWII. He lands his plane on Odo Island, pretending to need repairs. While there, a huge creature that the locals call ""Godzilla"" attacks. Shikishima climbs into his fighter to shoot the beast, but he freezes up. Everyone is killed except for mechanic Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), who blames Shikishima for the deaths. Branded a coward, a guilt-ridden Shikishima returns to a decimated Tokyo, where he meets Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who's rescued an orphaned baby, Akiko. Due to his good heart, Shikishima lets them stay in his hovel. Time passes, and he finds work salvaging mines from the ocean floor. He becomes fast friends with his fellow crew members, captain Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), scientist Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), and rookie Mizushima (Yuki Yamada). Godzilla, now much bigger, attacks again, and the foursome manages to hold him off. After the monster destroys a portion of Tokyo with an atomic blast, Noda cooks up a plan to defeat the beast for good. Shikishima realizes he must take to the air again -- to act as bait and clear his conscience. This great-looking, exciting, surprisingly emotional movie gets its power by setting the action in post-WWII Japan, tapping into both heart-rending despair and newfound hope. Most of the 36 Godzilla movies made before this one was released were either somewhat cheesy, or, in the case of the American versions, overly bombastic. But Godzilla Minus One manages to find an appealing new tone. Director Takashi Yamazaki's handling of the kaiju action is skillful and smooth -- and sometimes deeply affecting; Godzilla's leveling of the city with his atomic blast is truly shocking. The movie has startlingly good visual effects -- Godzilla's first appearance on a dark beach, suddenly illuminated by a spotlight, is a heart-stopper -- but the focus is squarely on the characters. It's a simple distinction, given that, historically, these movies' main goal has been to deliver an ecological message. But by settling Godzilla Minus One on themes of guilt and cowardice, as well as friendship and kindness, viewers may feel more invested in the action. Yamazaki handles things with an open-hearted quality but never lets anything get too soapy or hysterical. Even Sumiko (Sakura Ando), the neighbor in Tokyo who initially comes on strong, attacking Shikishima for his failures, settles into a more nuanced character. This sense of compassion makes Godzilla Minus One easily one of the best of the series and definitely on par with the original 1954 classic. Families can talk about Godzilla Minus One's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important?

"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,What Godzilla Minus One lacks in a sensical plot&#44; it makes up for in heart and amazing action sequences&#46;
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," 
	After countless variations and sequels, plus major studio Hollywood versions, Toho is back in the driver’s seat for the first time since 2016 with a new take on the 70-year-old Godzilla franchise, a consistent run far longer than Bond and just about anything else. The very good news here is that just when you thought there was nothing new to do with the giant lizard who enjoys stomping on cities and all their inhabitants, along comes what might be called the first Godzilla art film — or at least one where the humans actually are three-dimensional and recognizable.  
	Months pass into 1946, and the U.S. is beginning its Bikini Island nuke tests, and guess who re-emerges, now truly radioactive and lit up and ready for action? The sequence that follows is in many ways more reminiscent of Jaws than this franchise as the ill-equipped boat’s crew must battle Godzilla. You almost expect someone to say “we’re gonna need a bigger boat” at any minute.  
	Later Koichi awakens in a Tokyo hospital room, unaware of the fate of his friends but determined to warn Noriko that they must get word to the city that this fearsome monster is headed there. When Godzilla does arrive, all hell breaks loose on a city that thought it couldn’t get worse than the war. It does, as Yamazaki sets his cameras on the creature picking up entire passenger trains, citizens running for their lives and other charming clichés of movies pre-computer imagery. Fun. The question remains: Will Koichi finally stop the war within himself and do the right thing for the people? There is a plan, and it involves this kamikaze Top Gun in the mission of his life. 
	Setting the film just after WWII in Japan, still the only population center to experience the tragedy of having an atomic bomb dropped on them, is inspired. Godzilla always has represented the dark side, the result of what we have done to ourselves. To battle him is always to save our own humanity from this monster made of nuclear waste and the worst of what we do to the planet. It is no spoiler to suggest, as always, that we haven’t seen the last of what Godzilla is capable of. If anything, Godzilla Minus Zero is the thinking-man’s entry into the franchise and one that opens new doors.  
	This movie has it all, and on a $15 million budget I found that economy begets ingenuity. The action scenes and even Godzilla himself outstrip what the far more expensive effects of the Warner Bros. and Sony Godzilla reboots did with all that technology and CGI available. It is just a lot more fun to see what Yamazaki does here, less sophisticated and even with a charming wink to the, uh, less savvy earlier entries in the venrable series. The acting also is aces, with Kamiki delivering an emotional and moving performance in the lead role and the other stars lending fine support, most notably Hamabe as Noriko. 
	Naoki Sato’s score is exceptional and, showing affection to where this all started, there also is sweet use of music icon Akira Ifukube’s original Godzilla theme.

"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," At the conclusion of my Godzilla Minus One screening, an older gentleman stood up, faced the crowd, and shouted, “Hell, yeah! The Japanese still know how to make a good Godzilla movie!” I’m certainly not going to argue with him. I’d go even further and say this is quite possibly the best Godzilla movie since the 1954 original. The character has been the focus of several American movies, but writer/director Takashi Yamazaki adheres to the historical and cultural meaning embedded in it. That makes a world of difference. Rather than being a story about Godzilla, the film is really the story of Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who, realizing WWII is nearing its end, abandons his mission by pretending his plane needs repair. He also chickens out when Godzilla strikes Odo Island, leading to the deaths of many men. Following several years of survivor’s guilt, Shikishima gets a chance at redemption when the massive lizard starts making its way toward Japan. The original Godzilla thematically dealt with the impact of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which gave it real-world relevance underneath the creature feature trappings. Godzilla Minus One uses Godzilla to explore Japan’s treatment of soldiers during the war. After forming a de facto family with a woman he meets and the abandoned child she began caring for after the bombing of Tokyo, Shikishima begins to digest how unfair it was to demand kamikaze pilots go on suicide missions, knowing they had families back home. The effort to stop Godzilla allows him to come to terms with that, as well as with the remorse he’s been carrying around. His entire character arc is very compelling. American Godzilla pictures like Godzilla: King of the Monsters have used it as fuel for over-the-top action sequences designed to be “cool” and “awesome.” Yamazaki understands that it has to mean something when Godzilla comes onscreen. This film’s action scenes avoid blatant showiness in favor of emphasizing the danger to those in its path and, more specifically, the opportunity that arises for Shikishima to heal himself. That quality ensures that they’re incredibly thrilling. A climactic battle is especially taut, as it involves a multi-pronged attack designed to trap Godzilla. The visual effects in Godzilla Minus One are superb. Again, in American films, the CGI is so overdone that it looks like CGI. Yamazaki’s effects are scaled back to look real (or real within the fantasy-based world). Godzilla destroys cities in a manner that appears authentic, as opposed to being stylized to death. And when illuminated spikes emerge from its back, indicating preparation to unleash a death beam, you might just get a rush of excitement. The FX here serve the plot instead of justifying it. You can feel the respect that infuses Godzilla Minus One. It does justice to a cinematic monster that has entertained audiences around the world for decades by taking it seriously and approaching it with intelligence. I had a great time watching the film. If you appreciate Godzilla, you will too. "
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," It seems like it should be hard to make the 33rd Godzilla movie feel fresh—the 37th if you count the Hollywood versions—but Godzilla Minus One clears that bar with incredible prowess. The latest in Japanese studio Toho’s kaiju series is an unexpectedly fine-tuned action-melodrama, harkening back to the original 1954 classic in terms of style and scope, while remaining in conversation with Godzilla as a concept and cultural icon. And yet, it remains entirely self-contained while transcending some of the series’ most prominent trappings, resulting in one of the year’s most riveting blockbusters. Despite Minus One’s lack of connection to other films, it’s worth looking at the last few Godzilla entries to understand the zeitgeist into which Minus One emerges. Warner Bros.’ ongoing “MonsterVerse,” which creates an enormous sense of scale around the famous bipedal lizard, takes a page out of Toho’s 1960s sequels and treats him as a noble hero. Meanwhile, the last actual Toho film out of Japan—2016’s Shin Godzilla, the precursor to Shin Ultraman and Shin Kamen Rider—returned the character to its nuclear roots by using it to craft a satire about government bureaucracy and red tape after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Minus One, though more straightforward in tone, takes a similar thematic approach but sets its story even further back in time than the ’54 original, right in the midst of World War II, and it also succeeds in the same way recent Hollywood entries have by making Godzilla feel humongous and completely terrifying. In splitting this difference, director and VFX artist Yamazaki Takashi harkens back to Honda Ishirō’s iconic first entry, which sought to reckon with the trauma and terrible power of the atomic bomb. However, Minus One also takes a surprisingly holistic and subversive approach to World War II, telling a tale of militant heroism that ends up shockingly anti-war, anti-militarism and anti-nationalism, all while crafting a moving and stunning big-screen experience. Its closest Hollywood companions aren’t any of WB’s recent Godzilla entries, but rather, the Tom Cruise legacy sequel Top Gun: Maverick and Steven Spielberg’s Jaws. It’s a sweeping naval war drama buoyed by lurking dread on the open seas, and blockbuster filmmaking at its purest and finest. The film opens on Odo—the fictitious island where Godzilla was first spotted in Honda’s original—as kamikaze pilot Shikishima Kōichi (Kamiki Ryūnosuke) stops to have his warplane repaired at a mechanic station, but the naval technicians, led by Tachibana Sōsaku (Aoki Munetaka), can’t seem to find anything wrong with his machine. Tachibana is convinced Shikishima is a coward for abandoning his post, though another mechanic quietly whispers to him that Japan needs more people willing to turn their backs on the imperial military’s most destructive orders. Even before Godzilla shows up, Minus One offers a surprisingly nuanced look at notions of heroism and nobility, calling into question what these characteristics—so often associated with action movies—truly mean. Before long, Godzilla’s arrival on the island is portended by the mechanics spotting numerous dead deep-sea fish which have floated to the surface, their insides engorged and turned outward by the lack of air pressure—sickening harbingers of doom. As night falls, the men are attacked by an enormous lizard creature that bears a striking resemblance to Roland Emmerich’s 1998 T-Rex inspired Godzilla, which hunches over and attacks the mechanics, but tosses them into the air rather than eating them. This version of the creature has neither conscience nor predatory need. It’s simply an indiscriminate force of nature, which Yamazaki and cinematographer Shibasaki Kōzō film from a human viewpoint on the ground, making it practically disorienting to look at amidst the chaos. Under Tachibana’s orders, Shikishima has the chance to shoot the fearsome beast with his plane’s 20mm machine guns, but the pilot—having already abandoned the war once before—chokes. He can’t bring himself to pull the trigger before Godzilla kills nearly everyone on the island. Branded a coward by Tachibana, and given the dead men’s family photographs as a reminder of his inaction, Shikishima returns home to a decimated Tokyo to find his home destroyed, his parents dead, and a neighbor (Ando Sakura) blaming deserters like him for the loss of her children. His waking moments are plagued with survivor’s guilt, but sleep isn’t any better. At night, he dreams of Odo island. However, as his town begins to slowly rebuild, a curious and unexpected situation gives him reason to live: a feisty young woman, Noriko (Hamabe Minami), and the adorable baby girl she cares for, Akiko (Nagatani Sae), practically force their way into his home. Before he knows it, the trio becomes a sweet found-family, if only out of co-dependence amidst the smoldering ruins. Months and years go by, and Shikishima settles into a domestic rhythm as life slowly begins to return to normal. He even uses his skills as a naval airman to take up a job on a trawling vessel meant to catch stray mines left over from the war, where he joins up with an eclectic group of supporting characters to bring these devices to the surface and shoot them from afar. But of course, further disturbing the sea carries consequences, and the United States' nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll have irradiated the ocean, transforming the dinosaur-like lizard he once encountered into something even more terrifying: a much larger, scalier, spikier creature that stands upright, and more closely resembles the Godzilla we all know, love, and—certainly after its dead-eyed death glares in Minus One—deeply fear. Over the years, the typical Godzilla sequel has used flimsy human characters as a broad framework to support rollicking kaiju-on-kaiju action centering an idiosyncratic Godzilla with recognizable traits. The new film, therefore, runs completely counter to most Godzilla movies, since its human drama is always front and center while the monster isn’t imbued with any personality beyond rampant destruction, though this approach is arguably truer to the ’54 original than any of its successors, with numerous emotional dilemmas being forced to the surface by stirring power and destruction. Shikishima, who wouldn’t adhere to the imperial army’s strict conception of honor, is forced to find new ways to wage battle on a merciless enemy, alongside other Japanese citizens who are tired of both their government’s calls for self-sacrifice and its bureaucratic secrecy to keep pawns and soldiers in line. Rather than the abstract idea of “a country,” Shikishima is given something tangible to fight for, in the form of Noriko and Akiko, and he struggles with what form his heroism should take. The army’s militaristic and destructive viewpoint has been drilled into his psyche, yielding potent moral dilemmas that ground the large-scale, pulse-pounding action in deeply human concerns. The answers to these questions are often sappy, but they come wrapped in the sincere idea of people trying to find ways to do better (and be better) in the face of horrific loss—Godzilla’s heat breath, born from nuclear power, has never looked more realistically destructive—making each character decision feel as deeply engrossing as any moment of overwhelming disaster. With a score that quotes numerous old Godzilla compositions, composer Satō Naoki rides a delicate line between tragedy and triumph, as the movie’s sound design adds palpable weight and impact to every bit of debris tumbling across the screen. It’s a mesmerizing movie that satiates practically every audience instinct often considered base—from the desire to witness disaster, to the need for simple catharsis—all while rejecting the thought that movie heroism ought to stand shoulder to shoulder with jingoistic, fascistic notions. Instead, the film’s imagery (especially in its final act) is geared towards willing cooperation and innovation, a collective spirit, which Yamazaki channels in intensely dramatic fashion recalling great war films of old, Japanese and American alike (among them: Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk), but all the while subverting each impetus behind armed conflict, despite borrowing its cinematic appearance. Few recent productions of this scale have felt so saccharine without tipping over into self-parody—certainly not in Hollywood, where irreverent snark always seems to leak into the frame—and even fewer have been as deft as balancing awe-inspiring spectacle with both paralyzing terror and rousing romantic exuberance. Godzilla Minus One, more than most films this year, is worth watching on the biggest possible screen, and with the biggest possible crowd."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Written and Directed by Takashi Yamazaki.
Starring Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Sakura Ando, Kuranosuke Sasaki, Mio Tanaka, Yuya Endo, Kisuke Iida, Gôshû, and Saki Nagatani. Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb. Boasting maximum spectacle and effectively melodramatic emotion, let it be known that writer/director Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One is proof that just because there are 30+ installments of a franchise (a blending of Japanese and American productions, with the latter typically yielding mixed results), it doesn’t mean the series has reached the peak of what it is capable of achieving with a familiar story and cataclysmic destruction, heightened in intensity with a bombastic rally-cry score from Naoki Satô. This is a film that all but spells out what its climactic action beat is going to be as soon as it announces what the protagonist specifically did in World War II (or what he was supposed to do), comfortable telegraphing it with confidence that the performances, surprisingly moving and thoughtful narrative, craftsmanship, and satisfying carnage from the G-Man are more than enough to keep viewers tensed up and anticipating that exciting moment with baited atomic heat breath. Some might already be raising their eyebrows at Godzilla Minus One also committed to telling a robust personal story regarding its human characters, but it’s also important to note that the problem frequently is that most films, especially Hollywood blockbusters, forget to tell a compelling story around those characters or find some humanity within them and the unfortunate circumstances surrounding them that go beyond life under threat by a monster. More importantly, the pacing is on-point and knows how to appropriately push through the passage of time while hitting on key character moments with clarity and emotion, all of which are usually elevated by striking compositions from cinematographer Kôzô Shibasaki capturing a post-World War II Japan ravaged by nuclear weapons and Godzilla. Pushing through these rough and uncertain years is kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki excellently handling the intentional overacting and yelling while also demonstrating some nuance in other scenes.) He is suffering from survivor’s guilt for several reasons, chief among them being that he chickened out when it was time for him to fulfill his kamikaze duties in the war and subsequently has another cowardice moment when Godzilla first reveals himself, attacking the Japanese aircraft repair base he stops by. During the commotion, Koichi is instructed to mount a turret and rain down metallic hellfire on Godzilla, only to freeze up and watch everyone die. While taking refuge in a nearby destroyed archipelago, Koichi encounters and befriends Sumiko (Sakura Ando, who can also be seen in the brilliant, emotionally powerful Monster in US theaters this weekend), a woman tending to a baby left in her possession by a dying mother. Initially, Koichi wants nothing to do with them, but he slowly develops a bond with them that might be able to save him from despair. Unfortunately, he still regularly has nightmares and finds himself potentially with a death wish, taking up dangerous jobs cleaning up underwater mines with a likable crew who inevitably go on to become involved with planning and taking on Godzilla. There is no denying that this is a standard redemption arc, but standard is okay when the execution is this gripping. Time and location also play a huge part, as Japan is left with nothing (less than nothing if one interprets the title that way) and desperately needs to carve out a future for itself without the aid of a government disinterested in getting too involved for political reasons. The result is a private army of citizens banding together for the future in a thrilling showdown containing a rather ingenious scheme to take out Godzilla, whether it works or not. As for Godzilla wreaking mayhem, those sequences are visually stunning and unexpectedly visceral. The usual means of destruction are here, ranging from the atomic heat ray to casually stomping on civilians and buildings, but the Godzilla depicted here is more brutal while still carrying that nonchalant, stiff movement. There are also stylish and suspenseful set pieces crafted around his relentless destruction, including a perilous train escape and both underwater and airborne attacks on Godzilla. Visually, it feels as if the amount of money sunk into the film and the tons that Godzilla weigh are about equal, here unafraid to present numerous action sequences in daylight, assured that the special effects will hold up. Tragedy, humanity, guilt, redemption, love, and sociopolitical commentary provide momentous thrust to the tried-and-true exhilarating cinematic ingredients. Godzilla Minus One is a stunning epic-scale achievement suggesting that, with strong craftsmanship and the right talent, even long-standing series like this one can still reach some towering new highs."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," While it seems like the great monster-god Gojira has been around constantly over the past seventy years, there have been a few hiatus periods. The original group of films, known as the Shōwa Era, ran from 1954 – 1975. Nine years later, the Heisei Era began with 1984’s The Return of Godzilla, essentially a reboot for the franchise. This era ran until 1995. In 1999, the appropriately titled Millennium Era began with the equally appropriately titled Godzilla 2000: Millennium. This era ran until 2004, when the film Godzilla: Final Wars marked the 50th anniversary of the titular creature. Toho, the production company behind this Guinness World Record-holding franchise, decided to put things on hold for a decade. That brings us to 2014, when Toho announced the production of a new Godzilla film. Released in 2016, and kicking of the current Reiwa Era with another series reboot, Shin Godzilla was a brilliant film, accurately examining how the modern world at-large would react to the sudden appearance of a gigantic monster. Immediate upon its release, this film became widely regarded as one of the best Godzilla films of them all, maybe even better than the original. Three animated films, shown here in America on Netflix, followed, and now, for the 70th anniversary, we have been gifted with a new live-action incarnation, titled Godzilla Minus One. Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a kamikaze pilot in 1945, at the end of World War II. Frightened to carry out his assignment, he feigns trouble and lands at the repair base on Odo Island. That night, a giant creature the locals call Godzilla attacks the base, and because Shikishima froze up when he could’ve used the guns on his plane to kill the monster, all the men except himself and the chief mechanic are killed. Upon returning to Tokyo, he finds his home destroyed and his family dead from the air raids. He also ends up stuck with a young woman, Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), and a baby girl, Akiko, she has sort of adopted after the real mother died. Shikishima also suffers crippling survivor’s guilt over both his inability to perform his kamikaze duties and his inaction on Odo. Shikishima eventually takes a job on a minesweeper boat to help provide for Noriko and Akiko. Two years later, Godzilla has been mutated by the atomic testing at Bikini Atoll, making it bigger than ever, and giving it powerful radioactive breath. When Shikishima hears of a group of former Navy men who have devised a plan to destroy Godzilla, he sees this as a way to redeem his past failures. Godzilla Minus One is arguably the best in the franchise, hands down. It’s a grand achievement of everything that has come before, and it’s exactly what a Godzilla film aspires to be. While a majority of you probably think of the franchise as some-guy-in-a-monster-suit-smashing-models-and-toy-vehicles, what you might not realize is that the original Godzilla was an outright horror film. Playing upon Japan’s post-war fears, it’s a dark and disturbing film. Godzilla Minus One brings this horror back, then cranks it past eleven, up to twelve or even thirteen, at times. Never has the effects of a Godzilla attack on the people and places been so harrowingly depicted. It’s not just models and toys being crushed, it’s real people and their friends, family, property and even their souls. With this horror comes a ton of emotion. Getting to know Shikishima, Noriko, Akiko and the crew of the minesweeper, we come to truly feel what it’s like to be dealing with not only these attacks, but with life in a country almost completely devastated by war and desperately trying to rebuild. I have never had a Godzilla film make me cry…until now.

"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla: Minus One opens in the last days of World War II. A kamikaze pilot named Kōichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) lands on an island, claiming his aircraft is having mechanical issues. Engineers check his plane and determine there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s soon clear Kōichi defied his orders, wanting to live. Not long after, Godzilla appears and attacks the island. Kōichi is told to fire on Godzilla with his airplane’s guns but runs away afraid. The atomic monster kills everyone on the island except for Kōichi and another mechanic, who blames the pilot’s cowardice for everyone’s deaths. Upon returning to Japan, Kōichi finds his parents dead and parts of Tokyo in ruins from the war. He soon takes in a woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and a baby girl named Akilo, who was orphaned by the recent bombings. Together, the trio form a sort of family. Kōichi soon finds work disposing of mines in the waters of Japan leftover from the war, but Godzilla reappears, threatening the island nation. The creature destroys ships, trains, homes, cities, and anything in its way. With the U.S. unable to help Japan due to ongoing tensions with Russia, the nation ruined by war will have to contend with the atomic monster on its own. Kōichi, struggling with PTSD and survivor’s guilt, finds himself embroiled in another conflict that threatens the fragile life he’d just begun to rebuild with Noriko and Akiko. “Godzilla: Minus One” accomplishes something the American versions have yet to master, and that’s writing characters that the audience will care about. Kōichi is such a well-written and performed character. Viewers will feel every ounce of his guilt and fear thanks to Kamiki’s amazing performance. He’s someone looking for redemption and a way to protect his family. Kamiki and Hamabe provide incredible stakes with their roles. They aren’t just cardboard cutouts or exposition machines. These are real people who have lost everything and are clinging desperately to whatever shreds of a life they can build together amid the ruins of war and a giant monster attacking. The American Godzilla movies clearly come with a bigger special effects budget, but “Minus One” is far from men in monster suits fighting on tiny sets. It instantly captures the look and feel of post-war Japan and gives Godzilla some frighteningly close encounters. And while the human aspect grounds its story, Godzilla: Minus One doesn’t skimp on monster action. Audiences will still get to see the kaiju-level cities, throw boats like footballs, and devour trains. The monster design is unique, and Godzilla’s atomic breath really comes with an earth-shattering heftiness. There are philosophical themes running all through this movie about choosing life after ending a war by sending a large number of pilots to their intentional deaths just to inflict a little more damage on the enemy. One of the most fascinating aspects of Godzilla: Minus One is just comparing how Japan views this monster’s story to how America views its story. In Japan, Godzilla is a severe threat meant to humble mankind and teach about the horrors of war and atomic weapons. In America, Godzilla is a protector that keeps humans safe from other giant monsters. Japan unites to innovate and defeat Godzilla through scientific research. The U.S. assembles a ragtag team of hotshots to carry long-running themes of American exceptionalism through each monster fight. The way each country uses Godzilla to tell wildly different stories is a gift unto itself. Godzilla: Minus One packs grounded human drama, terrifying monster visuals, and top-notch sound design to create one of 2023’s best films. It’s part “Jaws,” part war drama, and part classic Godzilla throwback. It offers something for everyone to enjoy, and no part of this movie deserves to be underestimated."

For his tiny, frantically fleeing costars, Godzilla’s a tough scene partner: ungiving improviser, often plays to the camera, goes annoyingly Method on every shoot. But mostly, he’s difficult to share a screen with in a literal, visual capacity, his sheer size either overtaking the frame when glimpsed from mortal vantage or rendering people as puny ants from his.  Of course the big guy’s home studio of Toho understands this better than anybody, as evident in 2016’s reinvigorating “Shin Godzilla,” in which bureaucratic red tape held up the defensive countermeasures as a comment on the mismanaged Fukushima meltdown of 2011. With estimable brawn and brain, its follow-up “Godzilla Minus One” returns to the primal scene of nuclear devastation to ponder the value of an individual life in the face of mass death, and finds a handful worth fighting for.  He looks good for his age, and we can tell because most of the key scenes takes place in broad daylight, a much-appreciated rejoinder to the plague of nocturnal smudginess de rigeur in America’s comparatively mortifying excuses for blockbusters. His skin texture is noticeably craggier in keeping with his briny monster-of-the-deep genesis, at this point known well enough that the film can afford to instead track the origins of one Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki). Shikishima’s minimization and objectification at the hands of Japan itself can only be combatted by the love of his not-quite-wife (Minami Hamabe) and the infant they take in after she’s orphaned in the air raids. A certain sluggishness sets in during the domestic passages they share, though it’s invariably dispelled in short order by one of the many clashes photographed with a Wagnerian thunderousness: a “Jaws” riff on the high seas, an aerial dogfight giving Pete “Maverick” Mitchell a run for his money, the obliteration of Tokyo complete with musical theme and citizens scrambling not to get crushed underfoot.  With commendable spatial consistency and crisp CGI, these shows of force strike the right note of terrible awe, deepened by Yamazaki’s emphasis on how much is at stake. Shikishima matters, not because he’s so special but specifically because he isn’t, just one cell in the larger population that constitutes the true protagonist.

"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE," Seated next to a delightfully dorky family during Alamo Drafthouse’s preshow for Godzilla Minus One, I was privy to a debate between father and sons as to which kaiju battle was least satisfying. Ebirah, who looks like a crawdad on nuclear steroids, was the recipient of some serious shade. Then we all watched what was essentially a two-hour meditation on PTSD, systemic governmental failures, and the moral responsibility of individual citizens to confront global threats. Monster movies contain multitudes, y’all. They are goofy melodramas that somehow stand as noble metaphors precisely because of their oversized obviousness. They are often impressively ambitious in their cinematic carnage and frequently miss their special effect target in a way that feels purposeful. It’s as if they’re reassuring audiences that this specific horror, involving freakishly mutated beasts, isn’t real while pointing at inescapable terrors that plague our actual lives. Because without ruining anything, the general thesis of the 37th big-screen Godzilla appearance is palpably optimistic. At a time when faith in institutions is at an all-time low, when longing for death is frequent fodder for memes and jokes, Minus One says living is good and that we should have faith in each other. All military-adjacent blockbusters should be so kind and thoughtful, ain’t that right, Maverick? Set at the lizard tail-end of WWII, writer/director Takashi Yamazaki’s epic follows a kamikaze pilot named Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) who opts not to kamikaze. Instead, he fakes plane troubles and lands on an island for “repairs.” Shortly after the head mechanic, Sosaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), and his crew determine the aircraft is A-Ok, a smaller Godzilla shows up. Tachibana pleads with Shikishima to sacrifice himself to save the others, but the pilot once again does the math and realizes that his death would be senseless and useless. The two men are the only ones who survive. Shikishima returns to find his home obliterated by American bombs and meets a young woman, Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), caring for a baby given to her by a nameless mother who died during an air raid. Over the next few years, the makeshift family survives and starts to thrive, even if Shikishima can’t seem to overcome his cowardice and trauma. Then Godzilla returns, having been plumped to gargantuan by radiation. What follows is the expected tale of disaster, survival, and redemption, with a twist. That twist is the aforementioned lecturing about the sanctity of life and the power inherent in average people. The atomic breath of Godzilla is a blank canvas upon which any massive real-world calamity can be projected. If it was once a literal warning about nuclear armament, it now easily works as climate change analogy. The idea here being that we have to work against the hopelessness rightly felt at the ineptitude and malevolence of certain leaders and find our way to a collective response that keeps hope (and us) alive. Reactions to Minus One have both overhyped and mocked the effects. They are sometimes breathtaking. They are also sometimes preposterously silly. That is the duality of the kaiju, the complexity of these creature features. It’s fine if it isn’t your cup of sake, but it is firmly in line with the 70-year history of this specific subgenre. As is the broadly acted melodrama, filled with on-the-nose dialogue and over-the-top emoting. If those elements make you check out, that’s fine, but know that you’re missing something special. Kambole Campbell at Empire Magazine says “As with Shin Godzilla before it, it’s delightful to see a monster film that is equally as interested in creating a specific mood with its effects-work — rather than just effects for effects’ sake.” Kimberly Terasaki at The Mary Sue says “the film does not frame an unwillingness to die as weakness or cowardice. Instead, it reflects on the value of life when a community is dealing with tragedy after tragedy, aggravated by an apathetic government.” John Nguyen at Nerd Reactor says “What makes Godzilla Minus One exceptional is that if the director removed Godzilla from the film, the human story still holds up, making it one of the best human stories in a Godzilla film by far.”"

This Godzilla is one scary bastard. With a Bully XL jawline, the scale and intricate design of a Gaudi cathedral and the rage of a grumpy old codger, the subsea icon emerges from the cracks of modern blockbuster-making to remind the world that there is a much better way to make a monster flick. After US studio Legendary delivered a pair of murky and drab Godzilla flicks, not to mention Roland Emmerich’s 1998 monstrosity, it’s a joy to see the scaly icon back on home soil at Toho Studios and handled with such visual panache. Japanese VFX wizard Takashi Yamazaki (Lupin III: The First) unleashes his beast – a vast, terrifying creation capable of attacking a Ginza commuter train like a kid munching on a hotdog – via a series of superbly choreographed action sequences. Facing off against this threat is Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a disgraced (ie: alive) kamikaze pilot. He’s searching for redemption in the rubble of a bombed-out Tokyo, raising an orphaned baby in a platonic relationship with another young war orphan (Minami Hamabe) and earning danger money sweeping sea mines off the coast of Tokyo. Enter Godzilla and the chance to be a hero, with some help from a top weapons boffin and a few dozen courageous war veterans ready for a final do-or-die mission.Refreshingly, Goldzilla Minus One plays out mainly in broad daylight – aside from a nocturnal opening scene set in the dying embers of World War II, in which a younger, Godzooky-sized version of the kaiju battles a squad of Japanese soldiers. Yamazaki’s confidence in his own CGI work is well-earned, too. One sequence, which has Godzilla in pursuit of Kōichi’s rickety old minesweeper, is up there with the very best of the year – a riff on Jaws’s Orca vs shark scene that Spielberg would surely appreciate. His screenplay returns to the themes and fears that birthed the beast in the first place: post-war regeneration and the looming threat of nuclear catastrophe. Anyone objecting to Oppenheimer’s lack of a Japanese perspective on the A-bombs will find plenty of that here. Yamazaki’s kaiju is a nuclear weapon with a colossal payload, the Stegosaurus plates on its back glowing cobalt blue as it charges up to unleash its atomic breath across Toyko.  Occasionally, there’s a narrative disconnect as domestic scenes involving Kōichi’s surrogate family deliver faint post-war neorealist energy, while the King of Monsters lurks off screen, keen to get stuck in again. But even that pays off in a final act that earns its cheesy payoff. Here’s proof that an action movie can have an effects-heavy climax that doesn’t feel boringly generic. Hollywood, take note.

If your first introduction to Godzilla was the 1950s black and white version horribly mangled by American distributors to make a fast buck, you obviously were horribly cheated. Since then, the epic kaiju has stomped all over cities and other subsequent giant monsters to become part of the longest running film franchise in history. Now, Japanese writer-director Takashi Yamazaki has taken the original film and created a remake of sorts, showing how humans first encountered him while also interweaving the symbolism and emotional impact of the original 1954 Japanese version. The result is vastly more entertaining, thrilling and even thought-provoking given that this is a monster that has been portrayed as a god, a virtually unstoppable force of nature or even a sympathetic and misunderstood creature — depending on which side of the Pacific produced it. In Yamazaki’s film, we go back to the end of World War II during which Japan has been soundly defeated after the United States military first used nuclear weapons against an enemy, wiping out the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The hopelessness of this defeat is personified by a kamikaze pilot named Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who fakes a mechanical failure in his aircraft and lands on an isolated island in the Pacific. Kamikaze pilots were expected to sacrifice themselves by diving their bomb-laden aircraft into enemy targets. By not carrying out his orders, Koichi sees himself as a coward. Suddenly, from out of the ocean comes a strange and frightening creature that appears indestructible. Surrounded by men who were only trained as aircraft mechanics, Koichi is begged to step up and use the machine gun mounted on his bomber to defend them. But, again, Koichi’s apparent cowardice rears its head. Koichi’s fear of death and destruction can almost be seen as a mirror to what is happening to Japan. Although given the opportunity to rebuild, his emotional instability might be seen as a catalyst for Godzilla, now grown to enormous size, to follow him and wreak havoc on the mainland, leaving hundreds of casualties and injured, homeless people. The story follows the fate of Koichi, but also how his attempts at emotional healing affect a kind of makeshift family that has gathered around him, a woman named Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe) and a baby, whose parents were killed in the 1945 U.S. bombing raids on Tokyo. Although none are related, they become a family of sorts, with Koichi attempting a paternal role. While all this is happening, Godzilla is mutating, enlarging to enormous size and developing a frightening heat ray that produced what appears to be a devastating nuclear blast. When he returns, Koichi and others decide to fight back in a pointed reference to the hesitance of the U.S. and Russia to step in due to the rising nuclear arms race. In so doing, these citizens who hatch a hastily put together plan to attack Godzilla critically reflects the idea that government and military leaders can often afford to sit back and make their plans for wars upon other wars while the people ordered to fight them are seen as mere pawns, even in the face of something like a bizarre fire-breathing lizard. Inspired by his bestselling book, Because of Bethlehem, author Max Lucado invites you and your family to experience the Christmas story from a different perspective in beautiful Nashville, Tennessee.

"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla movies have a tendency to blend into one another—keeping the longest running film franchise going for seventy whole years (as of next year) will do that! If you grew up watching them on T.V. like I did then your memories doubtlessly consist of an amorphous blob of monster mayhem—Rodans and robots and bubble-burping baby lizards, oh my. Not that that isn’t fun—I love all of that dearly. But every so often, one comes along that stands out from the pack—it happened just seven years ago with the triumphant Shin Godzilla. And Toho can consider themselves officially on a roll because it has happened again this week with their unconnected follow-up, Takashi Yamazaki’s epic and deeply moving (yes I really said deeply moving!) Godzilla Minus One. The first Godzilla movie to ever make me cry actual tears while watching it, Godzilla Minus One addresses snout-on, with the full force of an atomic blast, the longstanding complaint that Godzilla movies never give us human characters to care about. A post-war melodrama that sometimes feels like an Ozu flick where a giant radioactive mutant has occasionally wandered into the frame, Yamazaki has strived to put the characters and their difficulties first at every opportunity here. Their emotional plights, their relationships and hang-ups, are the battlefield where the real wars are being fought, and within that the monster Godzilla hasn’t felt like this much of a straight-up metaphor since the original film in 1954. Our ol’ lizard pal was of course famously introduced to us as the terrifying embodiment of atomic destruction in Japan after World War II—a smaller creature that got turned into a much, much bigger one due to radioactivity, he has been for seven decades a warning to never forget that horror. But never quite as explicitly as he is in Godzilla Minus One, which unleashes the big beast only sporadically, and only when its characters seem to be finally getting their shit together. Godzilla here is a flat out refusal to let the people of Japan forget or move on—every time they try he ambles up out of the ocean and wipes their momentum clean again. He’s a real righteous bastard here! The film opens in the final weeks of World War II, with a prologue set in the Pacific Islands south of Japan where a kamikaze pilot named Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) lands at a remote way-station populated with mechanics, telling them he’s having a problem with his plane. This, the mechanics quickly surmise, is phony baloney—with the war over and lost in all but the most official capacity, Kōichi isn’t exactly pumped to have to go and fly his plane into an enemy ship when his death will have no meaning.  Some of the mechanics judge him mercilessly, while some of them understand his behavior perfectly well. But all of that flies out the window when a very large lizard—but notably not quite a gigantic one, yet—lumbers out of the water that night and begins smashing up the beach and all of the people thereon. They beg for Kōichi to rescue them, since he is the only soldier who knows how to properly wield the guns currently sitting unused on his parked plane. But again Kōichi freezes, and after getting bonked on the head he wakes up to find himself lying beside a line of their corpses in the sand. After a momentary abstract interlude set at Bikini Atoll—the spot in the Pacific Ocean where the U.S. tested their nuclear devices after the war, where we see an atomic blast and a lizardy eyeball suddenly all aflame—we cut to Kōichi’s not-so-triumphant return to Tokyo, where everyone he loved is dead and the city is nothing but rubble. Crippled by survivor’s guilt, Kōichi stands paralyzed in the wreckage of what was his parents home, until his ornery next door neighbor Sumiko (Sakura Ando) ambles over and doubles that down, telling him that his parents and her children are all dead because he didn’t fight hard enough. Good times for all, really. But as time passes people inevitably begin picking up the pieces—Kōichi takes in a homeless woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and an infant Akiko (Sae Nagatani) that she found among the rubble, thereby forming a tentative family. And he finds work (extremely dangerous work) as a minesweeper in the waters around the island. But rumors begin to swell that something monstrous is lurking out in those waters, and before you know it Kōichi is face to twenty-story-tall face with the creature he didn’t kill when he had the opportunity. And it’s here to fuck up his shit over and over and over again, in that legendary city-stomping fashion we have all come to know and love. (I do have to admit I found myself thinking at times of the legendarily ridiculous Jaws IV, aka the one where the shark follows Sheriff Brody’s wife around like a creepy stalker, so focused does this film make Godzilla’s wrath seem on one poor dude just trying to live his damn life.) And here it’s imperative that I share with you one of the single most absurd factoids I have ever learned, which is that apparently Godzilla Minus One only cost fifteen million dollars to make. Roughly the amount of money one supposes they spend on mini-bar expenses during the making of one MonsterVerse movie in Hollywood (one does suppose that Alexander Skarsgard really likes his minibar), the scenes of massive destruction, when they do arrive here, are as spectacular as anything its American tent-pole counterparts have managed—hell even more so because director Yamazaki and his actors have legitimately gotten us to care about the people standing there on the ground dodging all of the collapsing buildings.  Hamabe in particular is the film’s stand-out—crafty and kind and always ten steps ahead of the deeply melancholic Kōichi, we come to want all of the good things for her Noriko, and desperately. And when that dagnabbit dinosaur with the white-hot breath keeps mucking that up we find ourselves getting extremely worked up about it!  Eventually, it becomes clear that Godzilla Minus One means to be a treatise on recovery and healing wounds that seem impossibly deep—it has some of the same anti-bureaucratic inclinations that Shin Godzilla did, continually taking the government to task for its secrecy and inaction, and trying to place the hopes of Japan in the hands of its people. There’s a stirring yet somewhat bewildering (given this context) appropriation of the Dunkirk story that begs for an on-the-ground way forward; for people to rise up and force the way.  But for all of its epic stomping around this is still an extremely intimate tale, using Kōichi’s one-man-mission to illustrate what war and violence takes from us, and how the battle to get back to ourselves can feel fully apocalyptic. Godzilla Minus One swings enormous—its emotions are writ as large as that blessed lizard—and it will shake you right where you sit. "
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla has been many things over his near 70-year history. Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One is nostalgic for the simpler times, when the character was a terrifying elemental force; it even rewinds back to his original post-war origins as a setting. It follows Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a World War II kamikaze pilot who dodged his orders, escaping his grim duty by taking his plane for repairs. But he leaves the proverbial frying pan to find himself in the fire when Godzilla shows up at the island he landed on. Perhaps in keeping with the negative value of its title, Godzilla Minus One wastes zero time in putting the giant atomic lizard on screen, flattening or chomping any poor fool who gets the idea that bullets might kill him. That early, tense appearance doesn’t diminish his impact for the rest of the film; rather, he hangs over Koichi’s head from the beginning, a reminder of his origins as a representation of the war’s psychological impact (and more specifically, the atom bomb). After that carnage, Yamazaki takes something of an elliptical approach to the narrative, jumping a year or two ahead. After his Godzilla encounter, Koichi returns home, and ends up accidentally building a found family with the homeless Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the orphan she cares for, Akiko. Together, they try to survive as Godzilla creates a swathe of destruction through the still-recovering Tokyo — the set-design emphasising its precariousness, its spaces cluttered and isolated, the materials fragile.Amid those ruins, the dialogue often talks conspicuously around Japan’s own part in the war, but plays up a loss of faith in the government (“This country never changes... Perhaps it can’t,” one veteran muses), the civilians taking matters into their own hands not only to repair their neighbourhoods but even in defeating Godzilla. Its political commentary feels rote compared to the biting satire of Shin Godzilla, but Minus One’s human drama is emotionally engaging all the same. Yamazaki’s background in visual-effects direction and 3DCG animated features like Lupin The Third: The First lends itself to his characterful portrayal of the monster himself (in fact, Yamazaki directs the VFX here too). The gnarly VFX work on big G is a scary halfway point between his classic design, with his more jagged appearance and bulging eyes, and dorsal fins and other embellishments that bring him closer in line with more modern takes on the character. Such details feel tactile — the scales look mean and jagged, like obsidian — so that when he chases after a boat, it almost looks like a more detailed, Jaws-style animatronic; in some moments it feels like watching miniatures. The rest of the effects-work feels similarly stylised, switching between terrifying realism and wild spectacle on a dime. As with Shin Godzilla before it, it’s delightful to see a monster film that is equally as interested in creating a specific mood with its effects-work — rather than just effects for effects’ sake."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," In the immediate aftermath of Japan’s defeat in World War II, the country has a new terror to contend with, a monster unlike anything the world had ever seen, and there is no one to save them but themselves in Yamazaki Takashi’s Godzilla Minus One. A nation ravaged by Allied air raids, with their military being summarily dismantled, Japan is defenseless against the titan rising from the sea. Taking place between the final days of the war in 1945 and the reconstruction period in 1947, Godzilla Minus One predates Big G lore by nearly a decade, making this new film a reboot of sorts. Shikishima Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a soldier returning from the war in disgrace, but also recovering from the trauma of having encountered a monster on Odo Island, approximately 1,000 km from Tokyo. He arrives at his family’s home to find it little more than ashes, his family killed in the raids, and his reputation in tatters. Through happenstance he meets and eventually begins living with Noriko (Hamabe Minami) and the baby girl she’d rescued from a dying woman during the war. As they begin to pull together the pieces of a life, the spectre of Shikishima’s monstrous past appears in nearby Ginza. Godzilla, a titanic monster, now much larger than its previous incarnation – thanks to a healthy diet of radiation from atomic testing in the Pacific – is on the rampage, devastating an already fragile Japanese cityscape and sending the country into a panic. The setup for Godzilla Minus One is, admittedly, a fairly familiar one, though the execution is exceptional, making this the finest Godzilla film in a very long time. It is unlikely that there is an ongoing series of films that has been rebooted and rejuvenated as often as Toho’s Godzilla series, and this latest entry is yet another reimagining of the origin story, but with a more human and humane touch. Over the last several decades, Godzilla films have oscillated between super serious explorations of bureaucracy/humanity, and all out monster bashin’ fun. While both certainly have their upsides, there hasn’t been a film that successfully explored the humanity within the premise in a very long time, but Godzilla Minus One hits the nail on the head. Shikishima’s story is compelling, emotionally engaging, incredibly well written and performed, and never feels out of place. Meanwhile, when Godzilla gets the opportunity to strut his stuff, the results are devastating, impressive, and dynamic. When it comes to kaiju films, there are often lulls between the big action sequences as various governmental agencies come up with plans, or bicker and argue back and forth, which can really kill the momentum of the action. Alternately – or sometimes in the same films – there are some films were the monsters themselves are fairly stoic, lacking the kind of kinetic threat that gets the blood pumping. However, there is not a single moment in Godzilla Minus One that feels wasted. There’s no urge to fast forward to the “good stuff”, it’s all good stuff. Time spent with the human characters is time well spent, and time spent with Godzilla is thrilling and explosive. It’s a perfect mix of heart and thrilling monster action. Though the film is a reboot set before the original film action, it wisely adheres to much of the established Big G lore, offering plenty of easter eggs for hardcore fans. That being said, it isn’t beholden to the intricacies of the mythology, making this not only a great Godzilla film, but a flat out stellar action film that is the perfect place for new fans to start. Whether you prefer the more seriously toned entries in the series, or the goofier action-forward films, Godzilla Minus One has something for everyone, and it does it all incredibly well. With a gripping human story to tell, monster action that ranks up with the best that’s ever been done, incredible VFX, a heart pounding sound mix, and a host of wonderful performances, Godzilla Minus One is without a doubt the greatest Big G film in decades, perhaps second only to Honda Ishiro’s 1954 original."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Back in 1954, just nine years out from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese filmmaker Ishirō Honda and special effects designer Eiji Tsuburaya dreamed up a giant dinosaur-like creature that came from the depths of the ocean, mutated by nuclear radiation, a “kaiju” named Godzilla. The monster was a metaphor for Japanese atomic trauma, and the film, produced and distributed by Toho, was a hit, spawning the longest-running film franchise of all time. Some 70 years later, the 33rd Toho Godzilla film (the 37th in the franchise), “Godzilla Minus One,” written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, brings Godzilla back to its Japanese roots (it’s the first Toho Godzilla film since 2016’s “Shin Godzilla”), as well as its World War II roots. Taking place in the immediate post-war period in 1945, the film reckons with more than just the metaphorically monstrous nuclear fallout of the war, but also the devastatingly human emotional effects. When this monster surfaces, glowing neon blue from the nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll, it unearths all of the repressed shame and trauma of Japanese veterans, specifically a failed kamikaze pilot, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki). Shikishima has already encountered Godzilla by the time the monster stomps its way into Tokyo. During his failed kamikaze flight, he stopped on Odo Island for assistance, where the mythical creature came ashore to wreak havoc. Having already fled his mission, Shikishima freezes in the face of this monster, failing to shoot it and unable to assist his new friends, the airplane mechanics, who perish in the attack. Two years later, Godzilla rears its head again from the ocean depths off Japan, mad as hell. Shikishima has now formed an unlikely family unit with Noriko (Minami Hamabe), and a young child, Akiko (Saki Nagatani) who was orphaned in the bombing of Tokyo. He’s been working with a crew to clear mines from the ocean floor, and they are conscripted into tangling with Godzilla, who has been chomping through heavy cruisers and blasting them with atomic heat rays, before heading to shore to wreck its way through a Tokyo still struggling to get back on its feet. The scrappy crew aboard this wooden boat will remind audiences of “Jaws,” as will the Japanese government’s unwillingness to warn citizens about the impending threat, much like the mayor of Amity Island in Steven Spielberg’s shark movie. There are also other references to “Jaws,” like the dead deep sea fish that bubble to the surface as a harbinger of Godzilla’s arrival, and Yamazaki has said that he was inspired by that film. Yamazaki’s script does reckon with the lasting effects of World War II in Japan, and while the nuclear mutation of Godzilla is part of the plot, the themes of “Godzilla Minus One” are focused more on the the Japanese government, including their failure to protect its citizens from this threat, as well as the oppressive imperial regime that pressured young men into suicide missions during the war. It’s a group of private naval vets who end up taking on Godzilla — not the government — while Shikishima struggles with his own shame around failing as a kamikaze pilot, and failing to stop the monster back on Odo. It’s not until he can fulfill his mission that he can be free of this shame, and it takes Godzilla’s destructive arrival to bring that into focus for him. Yamazaki’s take on Godzilla is classical, utilizing the giant kaiju as a metaphor for social commentary, and his aesthetic take is classical as well, combining a retro 1940s style with cutting-edge visual effects for one of the most striking Godzilla monsters we’ve seen in years. The way its craggy fins break the surface of the ocean is almost photo-realistic, and when Godzilla’s atomic-powered glowing spine bursts with power, it’s breathtakingly beautiful. While some of the emotional beats are a bit pat, the way Yamazaki grapples with some of the wider nuances of wartime trauma feels fresh and innovative, if not radical, proving that even after seven decades of wreckage, this iconic kaiju still has plenty of gas in the tank."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"  Since its first appearance onscreen in 1954, the kaiju monster Godzilla has taken the film industry by storm. While some of the earlier entries in the franchise gave us quality blockbusters, more recent films failed to live up to their epic potential. Godzilla Minus One, the 37th Godzilla film, brings the franchise back to glory in both quality and entertainment. Japanese director Takashi Yamazaki takes us back to the beginning — a post-war Japan, where the horrors of the atomic bomb yield a new crisis in the form of a gigantic monster that won’t go down easily. If there was ever a time to rally behind a Godzilla film, it’s now with GodzillaMinus One.   In the film's opening sequence, we meet Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a World War II Japanese fighter pilot who has recently landed on Odo Island for repairs. As nearby military heroes assist with the mechanics, their progress is rudely interrupted by Godzilla, a dinosaur-like monster that was once an urban legend. Godzilla wipes out everyone on the island, leaving only Koichi and Sosaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) alive. This would be the day that would haunt Koichi forever, as he cowered away from shooting the kaiju and opted for safety instead. When Koichi returns to Tokyo, his days and evenings consist of extreme guilt and nightmares, neither of which prevent him from forming a small family with a local woman named Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe) and an orphan Akiko (Sae Nagatini). But with Godzilla threatening to destroy his newfound livelihood, especially as he approaches Tokyo full of rage and ferocity, Koichi battles between his guilt and the desire to survive.   This sets the stage for a beautifully human and compelling narrative, right in the middle of a highly entertaining and thrilling ride. When it comes to Godzilla films, many don’t really care for the human elements and would rather see Godzilla create carnage and destruction. Yet, Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One is so rich with compelling characters that it’s easy to emotionally gravitate to its central story. Not a single second in the film is wasted on silly dialogue or unfunny jokes, which seems to plague recent American Godzilla movies. Instead, there’s an urgent focus on Koichi’s mental health and well-being, as he struggles to deal with PTSD and the guilt he feels after abandoning his position. What’s exciting about this narrative is that Godzilla is still the main character even when he isn’t onscreen. As a result, there’s always a sense of danger, or a nightmarish sequence lurking.   One of the best parts about Godzilla Minus One is its nod to earlier Godzilla films and the acknowledgment of the kaiju’s history. Perhaps that is a testament to Kôzô Shibasaki’s cinematography and the visual effects. The set pieces accentuate mid-1940s Japan in a way that feels integral to the story. The country is recovering from its lowest point, after all, but just when there’s a glimmer of hope and recovery, Godzilla, whose design brings about an equal amount of horror and curiosity, is there to remind them of the lurking threat and despondence to come, whether at sea or land. In these sequences, the film also reminds us of how terrifying Godzilla is, a component that has been lacking in recent films for me. Godzilla Minus One is a visual and thrilling ride, bringing the monster back to his blockbuster glory.   Of course, in a film that spends much of its time balanced between Godzilla and the human characters, it’s important to note that it suffers from some pacing issues. This mostly occurs at the hour mark, during which Koichi struggles between his guilt and wanting to live for his newfound family. Fortunately, the pacing issues don't last very long thanks to remarkable performances from the entire cast. Not a single character was wasted, which was exactly what audiences needed.   If there’s one thing you need to know heading into Godzilla Minus One, it’s that this 125-minute feature is well worth seeing on the big screen. The storytelling is exactly what we need from a Godzilla film, balancing Godzilla’s on and off-screen presence with the sheer anguish and terror that the human characters are feeling. It doesn’t always nail its inspirational tones thanks to some over-the-top and predictable sequencing, but it is a stunning Godzilla film nonetheless. Lastly, the film's final 30 minutes is simply phenomenal filmmaking, emphasizing Yamazaki’s ability to bring quality back to the franchise and showcase a stunning achievement of human storytelling.  The fates of several characters from The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes are unknown, but one line from Catching Fire offers a hint about one. Matt Damon has a tendency to appear in minor, often comedic, cameo roles in various film projects, from Thor: Ragnarok to EuroTrip to Deadpool 2. The 3-day opening weekend projections for the Dune: Part Two box office show the movie earning a total that the original only earned after two weeks."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The most riveting MONSTER movie made in awhile&#46; An emotionally deep film that has drama that you care for&#8230; &amp; it delivers on the INCREDIBLE Godzilla destruction&#46; Probably my favorite Atomic Breathe Moment ever&#46;
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla
has been an unstoppable force in movies for almost 70 years now, and it's quite
the accomplishment that a gargantuan, atomic dinosaur monster might be the most
famous and enduring of international movie stars. That's especially true since,
for most of the big guy's history and filmography, that monster has been
depicted by someone in a rubber suit. As has
been the case in recent depictions of the giant creature (both in movies from
its homeland and in several American ones), there's no one in a rubber suit in Godzilla Minus One, even though writer/director Takashi Yamazaki
brings the monster and the basic story of it back to their roots in this newest
entry in the 33-movie franchise (not counting those American ones). It
technically goes back to before the roots of the original 1954 film, which saw
Godzilla as a metaphor for and a warning against nuclear weapons. The
notion of the only country to suffer attacks from such weapons making such a
dire and cathartic statementless than a decade after the United States
dropped atomic bombs on two of its citiesstill feels daring 69 years later.
Godzilla's longevity and continuing popularity make a good case for the power of
the metaphor in generaland, in a world that's still grappling with the
potential of nuclear war or annihilation, this particular metaphor specifically. Yamazaki's
film begins in the final days of World War II and carries on a bit more than a
year after the war's end. There's no imagery of or direct reference to the
nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for reasons that are probably too
obvious to state outright. The film doesn't need such depictions or citations,
anyway. When Godzilla unleashes his atomic breath on a district in Tokyo, the
resulting explosion, shockwave, and mushroom cloud, which the monster looks upon
almost in awe of its own astonishing power, make the point horrifically clear. There
is a lot of horror in this new film, and a lot of that comes from how closely
Yamazaki's screenplay sticks to the fundamental concept, the plot, and even some
close quotations of scenes from the '54 original. Godzilla isn't a villain here,
and the creature definitely isn't the hero it would become in a good number of
those sequels, when some other giant monster posed a threat to it or its
territory. It
simply exists as a biological wrecking machineswimming under and chomping
upon boats and ships of various sizes that get in its way, plodding through the
streets of the city to topple buildings in front of it and not noticing the
people it crushes underfoot, chomping at anything that it might mistake for food
or instinctually take to be a threat. Those scenes, which are few and far
between in this film, are what we expect from a movie featuring this monster. It's to
the credit of Yamazaki, who also served as the film's visual effects supervisor,
that the spectacle of these sequences remains in a terrified, helpless register.
Godzilla moves slowly along his path of destruction, and the joke, perhaps, is
that obviously the 70-year-old monstermuch, much older, of course, within the
world of the filmwould look as if it's a bit arthritic. The actual terror,
though, is that everyone can see this beast coming from miles away but is
hopeless to stop it. Most of
the story, as we also have come to expect from these movies, revolves around the
humans living through, trying to survive, and working out a way to stop the
chaotic devastation. That part of the story is thoughtfully considered here,
focusing on Kōichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a pilot who abandons a kamikaze
mission and is too frightened to shoot a smaller Godzilla when it attacks a
repair unit on an isolated island, and Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who survived the
U.S. bombing raids on Tokyo and now acts as the mother to an orphaned baby girl.
In the aftermath of the war, the three become a makeshift family, although Kōichi
is filled with too much grief, guilt, and remorse to consider making them a real
one. Eventually,
Godzilla returns, being awakened by a U.S. nuclear weapons test at Bikini Atoll,
and, after Kōichi and some fellow minesweepersas well as a Japanese
cruiserfail to stop the monster's progress, makes landfall on Tokyo. It's a
lot bigger, and a disarmed Japan doesn't have the military equipment to stage a
proper fight against the creature, while the United States doesn't want to
provoke the potential ire of the Soviet Union by offering its own support. The
ensuing sequence has been discussed enough already in this review, so it's
probably best to stick to the human element that makes up the bulk of the
narrative. It's melodramatic, of course, but appropriately mournful, but the
clever part of latter portion of Yamazaki's plot is how it subverts our
expectations to get at a message of humanitythe collaboration of people for
survival and the necessity of saving even one person to stay true to the virtue
of that goal. We anticipate yet another battle with Godzilla in yet another
sequence of citywide chaos, but here, the whole point of the ultimate plan is to
prevent such a destructive climax. It's
quite an accomplishment for a seriesnot to mention for the whole genre it
helped spawnthat often seems to cram human characters into these stories
without much thought and as a way to pass the time between the next monster
attacks. In Godzilla Minus One, the human characters, as well as humanity in
general, truly matter as more than victims of Godzilla's feet, teeth, and fiery
breath."
"Dec 1, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Godzilla Minus One” is an ambitious reset of the famed Japanese movie monster, a reboot of the franchise and the character introduced in the 1950s as an allegory of Japanese victimhood in in the nuclear age.  Writer-director and effects supervisor Takashi Yamazaki (“The Fighter Pilot”) gives us hints of the parable he’d like this new film, set much sooner after World War II, to be. It’s a tale told on the cusp of the moment when Japanese guilt for a war that country’s government started and prosecuted with fascist barbarity for a dozen years would morph into a populace that embraced victimhood as easier to swallow.  This film’s characters have moments where they speak to the modern Japanese audience, a top-down culture compliantly led into in economic stagnancy, declining population and unaddressed war guilt, racism and the like.  The effects are terrific, even if the assault of ravaged post-war Toyko looks a lot less firebombed than it should, even if the marauding monster marauds less on land than on sea despite amble evidence of Godzilla’s dislike of trains. The sea battles are borderline awe-inspiring.  But change in emphasis and subtexts aside, Yamazaki’s film lurches into “Same old Godzilla, same old response to her/him” silliness, with old grievances barely sublimated, silly science and old themes such as self-sacrifice watered down for modern consumption.  In the last days of the war, a kamikaze pilot (Ryunosuke Kamiki) abandons his mission on the pretext of equipment failure. Koichi Shikishima lands on an island where he and the locals face a new threat, a monster who shows up who Koichi has a chance to fight, and again he shows cowardice.  Koichi and the ex-Navy crew he serves with on a wooden trawler used to clean up Japan’s seaborne minefields, and a plucky scientist (Hidetaka Yoshioka) will be among those called on, in a demilitarizing Japan, to save Tokyo and the country from this new threat. The Americans? They’re taking their lumps further off in the Pacific, but they’re worried about stirring up the Soviets (who had nothing resembling a real navy, and didn’t yet have The Bomb). So Japan will have to use its cultural cohesian and communal knowhow and bravery to save itself.  For long stretches, “Godzilla Minus One” concentrates on relationships and conversations, which despite their intent, do little to advance the plot or illuminate simply-drawn characters.  The coward must redeem himself. The scientist must use his out-of-my-lane expertise to save the country, not arm it. Assorted Navy veterans must move on from years of hubris followed by humbling defeats to rally against a new foe. But it’s all a tad less satisfying as this and new take lowers the stakes in many ways, ones that rob the picture of much of its potential pathos.  I like what Yamazaki was trying to do. But his timidity in themes he might introduce to the film’s native Japanese audience shows and it muzzles his monster movie.  And that matters a whole lot more than the “direction, script and effects by” credit he collects on this production. The biggest question any new “Godzilla” movie has to answer after 70 years of such films is “Why?” I think he had an answer and lost his nerve. I think Yamazaki had plenty to say with this one, and I think Moore misses some of the Japanese-centric cultural context here. The movie explores the themes of self-sacrifice and duty that pervade Japanese culture — and in particular are core to Dr. Sarazawa’s arc in the original film — but ultimately rejects them as unfair to the individuals and their loved ones. This isn’t “losing his nerve,” it’s rather a core theme, this idea of self-forgiveness and how living for one’s self allows you to live for your loved ones. That idea might be a little more obvious/sentimental to the western audience but in rooting the film in Post-WWII Japan I think it comes across loud and clear all the same. Yes, it almost speaks to Japan today. And tries to speak to the past. But only in a whisper, in ways guaranteed not to offend. He wimped out. See the utterly wussy finale for the exclamation point on that.  What I took from the movie was, “Don’t wait for the government to solve the problem. WE need to do it.” Tug boat drivers, fisherman, broken men… And to do “it” (whatever the big “it” may be) takes more than just sacrifice. It takes a strong will to band together and to LIVE  (literally) together. Those things require forgiveness; both of ones self and of ones neighbor. This idea gives us hope… And hope is something the world needs now, with the suicide rate at its highest since WWII… Interestingly enough. That may not be the answer you want but it is an answer and, in my opinion, one the modern world needs a reminder of. Their government failed them was easy to read into it. The script still has a “brush over our guilt” feel, and as “Godzila” was really about Japanese victimhood as the world’s first to suffer an atomic bombing — “Never mind WHY it happened to us” — that’s a cop out. Wow.. Interesting perspective. One with which I respectfully disagree. I think you missed the mark on the director’s intent. But that’s fine. I suppose unanimous critical acclaim is almost impossible to attain since most films aren’t perfect, and this one certainly isn’t, and it’s a good, healthy thing some disagree with general consensus. I don’t agree with the dismissive sentiment of it being “just a Godzilla movie.” Mainly because there’s no metric behind it other than the negative connotation planted on by yourself. What is “Just a Godzilla movie”? Why is it something that seems to lack merit?
Is it just referring to the lowest lows of monster movie shlock that the series has ever reached? If so, then this absolutely isn’t “Just a Godzilla movie” because this is nowhere near the plenitude of scenes across films where Godzilla propels himself across the Earth with his atomic breath, or shoves a tree down King Kong’s throat, etc.
A common criticism for most Godzilla films are that the human characters lack agency and completely detract from the monster we want to see, but the characterization and decisions made by the human cast are directly tied with it, both narratively and thematically, even if you were disillusioned with the themes. I have other things to say about this review, but I dont want to write a thesis in your comments on my day off. That was just a line that irked me. I think overall your review is much more coherent compared to the other negative reviews I’ve found (found you through Rotten Tomatoes, but I feel it’s a little disingenuous of them to label yours as negative when its a hard 50%. Not many places where that’s an objective negative outside of school. Perhaps you label it as such yourself. I admit my ignorance to that part of the process.) Usually, when the consensus on all ends is positive, reviews like this get the hounds unleashed on them, but I’m glad that there’s a lot of civil discussion in the comments, especially for a new addition to an iconic media franchise like Godzilla. I’m here in “negative” reviews that I normally dont bother with because I think this movie is great and I want to talk about it. I want to keep developing my analysis as that deepens my enjoyment, and hopefully a lot of fans visit this review with the same mindset. Read that back to yourself, and repent.
It’s cheese, chief. Seventy years of cheese, monster movies for an infantalized culture, here, there and everywhere.
The point of making this “Godzilla” a period piece is making a comment on Japanese culture then and now. And what’s the one “message” that we can all agree is here? That 70 years into this series of monster-as-science-run-amok fantasies, “sacrifice” is pointless and unneeded. That’s comfort food for folks and fans who’re OK with “It’s somebody else’s problem/fault” — the very obsessive, escapist target audience of these movies.
Sorry you’re under the impression that this is great art, it isn’t. It’s a junk genre that occasionally scores points on culture, history and the warnings of science, etc. These movies — I’ve seen maybe a dozen — are almost instantly forgettable, and a little attempt at period detail here doesn’t suggest this one will be any different.
And if you think the third act in this one was anything but a not-funny-laughable cop out, you need to broaden your horizons a little bit, maybe watch the new Japanese drama “Monster,” for starters. "
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One isn’t just a good Godzilla movie.
It’s an excellent Godzilla movie – arguably among the best ever to grace
the screen. With just enough character development to keep the humans from
becoming props and spectacular sequences of destruction, the movie justifies
its two-hour running time. The special effects are as good as anything
Hollywood has offered for a kaiju film and the technical aspects – set design,
sound, cinematography – are perfectly wed to the screenplay. Granted, an innate
appreciation for monster movies is a necessary characteristic, but those who
are biased in favor of Godzilla will be more than satisfied with his latest
romp. There are lessons that Hollywood could learn from Godzilla
Minus One. The first is the unimportance of canon and continuity. In the
last ten years, Godzilla’s origin story has been rebooted three times – first
in Gareth Edwards’ Americanized version in 2014, second in Toho’s 2016 Shin
Godzilla, and finally in this movie. The mantra seems to be to tell the
best self-contained story possible without much concern for previous or future
installments and the approach works. One doesn’t need to have seen any previous
Godzilla movies or to have spent countless hours watching a streaming service
in order to have a full theatrical experience with Godzilla Minus One.  Then there’s the budget. Reportedly, this cost $15M to make.
Yet it looks every bit as good – and perhaps even better – than the recent
American Godzilla trilogy of Godzilla (budget: $160M), Godzilla: King of the Monsters (budget: $170M), and Godzilla vs. Kong (budget: est.
$180M). The explosions and disaster porn set pieces are as stunning, the
creature effects are as show-stopping, and the end result is as breathtaking.
For many years, the Godzilla movies were beloved for their cheesiness – a guy
in a monster suit jumping around fighting some other guy in a monster suit. No
more. Yet, for the amount of money that might fund a low-budget indie drama,
Toho has assembled one of the most technically adept releases of 2023.  The story is a rarity for a Godzilla film – a period piece.
In retelling the monster’s origins, writer/director Takashi Yamazaki returns to
where it all started: the post-World War II era. In addition to turning back the
clock some 75+ years, he returns to the themes of the original (1954) production
about the consequences of war and the dangers of harnessing nuclear power
without the requisite ethical constraints. From a story perspective, Yamazaki
ignores all the previous movies in the long-running series, instead opting to
start with a clean slate. I don’t think anyone will mind. The movie opens in the waning weeks of World War II. With Japan
on the verge of surrender, kamikaze pilot Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) chooses not
to fly his suicide mission, instead landing on Odo Island with the complaint of
“engine trouble.” While the mechanics are examining his plane, a monstrous
dinosaur-like creature, named Godzilla by the natives, emerges from the sea to
destroy the base and kill everyone except Koichi and one of the mechanics. Having
had an opportunity to (possibly) destroy Godzilla but not taking the shot, Koichi
blames himself for the massacre.  Several months later, he arrives in a bombed-out Tokyo to discover
that his parents were killed in a raid. Setting up shelter in the remains of
his house, he does his best to move forward, struggling with little food or fuel
for heat. One day, he takes in a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who, like
Koichi, lost her parents in the war. She is caring for an orphaned infant named
Akiko. Over the course of the next two years, the trio forms an unconventional family.
Koichi and Noriko have feelings for one another but do not act on them, in part
because of Koichi’s PTSD/Survivor’s guilt. Akiko regards the adults as her parents,
although Koichi is uncomfortable being called “Daddy.” Meanwhile, Godzilla is
in the vicinity of Bikini Atoll at the time of the nuclear test. Mutated into a
bipedal monster of massive destructive ability, the creature heads for Japan’s
mainland, taking out warships along the way. Koichi resolves that, should he
have another opportunity to stop Godzilla, he will not hesitate, even if it
costs him his life. One of the pleasures of Godzilla Minus One is that it
feels like a Godzilla movie through-and-through. As well-made as some of
the American movies were, even in the best of them, the title monster seemed
like a bit of an imposter. (Note: “imposter” would be too kind of a word for
the thing that wreaked havoc in the unfortunate 1998 Roland Emmerich movie, which most Godzilla fans prefer to forget.) Here, however, we are
presented with the real Godzilla, enhanced by cutting-edge special
effects but still 100% recognizable. Even the roar hasn’t changed. As for the
atomic breath…its effects have to be seen to be believed. This film is darker than most Godzilla stories, focusing on
many of the negative consequences of the monster’s attacks. The death and
destruction feel tangible, especially in the way it directly impacts Koichi.
The characters are better fleshed out than one expects from a Godzilla movie and
the understated romance between Koichi and Noriko is touching. These things
make the stakes higher when Godzilla attacks and add a layer of peril to scenes
that otherwise might be appreciated on the basis of their technical acumen. Toho has enough faith in the movie that, as they did with Shin
Godzilla in 2016, they are opening the movie wide in U.S. theaters (with
subtitles, not in a dubbed version – if the latter is available, it’s not
playing anywhere near my location). Given the enduring popularity of the
monster, which has been enhanced by his American movie appearances, it’s not a
risky proposition and, although the film isn’t likely to top the box office, it
offers fans an opportunity to see one of the most accomplished kaiju movies to
date on a big screen."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," NOW IN THEATERS! I mean, the formula is simple. When you reboot a beloved franchise, modernize the effects and production but keep the heart of the story…the reason we love that franchise intact. That’s precisely what director Takashi Yamazaki did with Godzilla Minus One. It’s getting close to the end of World War II. Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a kamikaze pilot returning to the airstrip because of “engine problems.” The airfield staff shuns the failed pilot for not fulfilling his duties as a kamikaze. The shunning doesn’t last long as a giant reptile, Godzilla, attacks the strip. As one of the only survivors of the monster attack, Koichi returns home to his bombed-out village, where his parents had been killed while he was away. With barely a home, Koichi takes in a young woman, Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), and a small girl, Akiko—an orphaned toddler. Years later, Koichi and Noriko have made a home, but without warning, Godzilla has returned, having grown to gargantuan size thanks to the nuclear tests in the Bikini Islands. Godzilla destroys the nearby city of Ginza, killing Noriko and leaving Koichi alone with the Akiko. As Japan is now reeling from Godzilla’s attack and being defenseless as a result of the war, former WWII veterans are asked to band together and defeat Godzilla before he reaches Tokyo, knowing that their guns, bombs, and tanks are useless. Godzilla Minus One is a hard reboot of the Godzilla series, and this is his origin story. Like the original Godzilla, the film stars are Japan, Godzilla, and Koichi. As much as Godzilla Minus One is about Godzilla, the story is all about Koichi’s character arc. The film follows Koichi’s journey from disgraced kamikaze pilot to the only survivor surrounded by death to potentially Japan’s great hero. From the film’s opening moments, I knew this would be a great movie because it had a hero we can all relate to. Koichi is a survivor…but why him and not his brave comrades…with families? Toho Studios never forgot that Kaiju’s stories are human stories. Details are the other thing that Godzilla Minus One gets right. How can Japan stop Godzilla with military might when Japan is not allowed to have military might…it’s all explained. Godzilla is no longer a guy in a suit. His design looks like a guy in a suit, but he comes with an upgrade, such as an energy bolt that’s downright devasting and awe-inspiring. When he stomps down the streets of Japan, he crushes actual buildings, not paper ones, and steps on real people, not diecast models. The best part of the Godzilla is the realization halfway through the film that nothing works to stop the unstoppable. So how is Koichi going to come on top in the end? Godzilla Minus One is smart, and smart wins out in the end. If you’re a fan of Godzilla, prepare to have your mind blown with Godzilla Minus One. Set your expectations high, and enjoy the ride. Cast Marvel aside and get ready for the Toho Godzilla Cinematic Universe. See it on the biggest screen and with the best sound system…and bring a few friends while you’re at it. Never set your expectations high. You’re more likely to be disappointed. I had no expectations and ended up liking it. It might be my favorite movie of 2023. And I am not a Godzilla fan. When Jurassic Park came out in 1993, big studios took a giant step forward in terms of the power of computer-generated imagery and massive but affordable... Returning to our series on the cinematic history of Kaiju Monsters, Toho Studios brings us the giant monster battle King Kong vs. Godzilla. Did Toho catch... To me, giant monster movies are very similar to superhero films. The stories are the same, but then we have a new hero with different powers with each...

"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," The creature-feature title notwithstanding, “Godzilla Minus One” could easily be mistaken for a 1950s romantic melodrama. On one level, it’s the story of a Japanese couple raising a small child in the aftermath of World War II. Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a former kamikaze pilot who survived only because he abandoned his mission, feels shame for his cowardice and wants to make up for his mistake. Noriko (Minami Hamabe) is his nontraditional partner; they sleep in separate beds but have a strong emotional bond. Together, they live in bombed-out Tokyo — across the street from their sometimes babysitter and frequent parenting adviser — with the baby girl Noriko has taken in after promising a dying women she would take care of her child. There’s not enough work, the roof leaks and Koichi has what today would be called PTSD. In this reboot of the 1954 “Godzilla,” filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki — juggling the jobs of writer, director and visual effects supervisor — mixes the tried-and-true beats of a modern blockbuster with the emotional and political tone of the original film. The result is nothing short of magical: a feast for the eyes, an entertaining epic in every sense of the word. The film begins late at night, during the final days of the war at an isolated airstrip that is suddenly attacked by a mysterious creature. While many modern Godzilla adaptations lean into size and spectacle, Yamazaki prefers suspense, shooting from below to return the titular creature, or kaiju, to its horror roots. This Godzilla is, for the first time in a long while, genuinely terrifying. Only later does Yamazaki shows the rampage from a wider angle. The spectacle returns, but with an added edge: Godzilla is not a boxer going toe to toe in a ring with another kaiju, but certain death slowly inching toward you. While the recent American Godzilla films (part of a monster-verse that includes King Kong and other so-called titans) have their strengths, their focus on science fiction, advanced tech and backstories involving ancient civilization has eliminated some of the human emotion of the original film. Here, it’s up to ordinary people, not other monsters, to stop Godzilla. This ups the emotional stakes. Monster movies live and die by such investment of feeling — and it’s there that “Minus One” thrives. The first hour features little of the titular reptile, instead focusing on the connection between Koichi and Noriko, which begins with her handing him a baby as she runs from what we’re led to believe is an angry shopkeeper. Eventually, Noriko moves in, and they grow in fondness for each other in the wreckage of their country. The first half of the film does most of the heavy lifting, establishing the intense sentiment that is essential for the second half. Even after Godzilla returns, the film’s tender core is carefully nurtured. That’s not to say the spectacle isn’t also effective. The scenes of urban devastation are expertly choreographed and gorgeously shot (by Kozo Shibasaki). If, in some of the large-scale scenes, you can feel the impact of the film’s comparatively small budget, the majority of the effects are well-constructed. For example, the film’s rendering of Godzilla’s “atomic breath” — a blue-white beam that shoots out of its mouth — is astounding. The buildup to its first appearance is electric, a sensation of raw power that does not diminish as the effect is reused. The Godzilla franchise had — and still has — deeply political implications. The 1954 film critiqued the Atomic Age and the effect of nuclear weapons on the planet broadly (and on Japan more specifically). That implication remains valid, with sequences in Tokyo eerily evocative of photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Layered on top of that is criticism of Japan’s imperial government and the military’s policy of self-sacrifice, underscored by Koichi’s refusal to “die honorably.” The final act features some of the best blockbuster filmmaking in years. Naoki Sato’s score builds as repurposed Navy cruisers engage with Godzilla in open water. At their best, such action sequences operate like symphonies: individual instruments moving as one and responding to one another. When well orchestrated, they result in catharsis. Yamazaki achieves this, creating a climax reminiscent of the best work of action directors Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron and Christopher McQuarrie. “Top Gun: Maverick” showed us there’s still an audience for movies that combine concise and creative action with emotionally resonant characters. “Godzilla Minus One” is another reminder — and quite possibly the better movie of the two."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," In ""Godzilla Minus One,"" blockbuster filmmaking is structured, tactile and grounded. It's a big ol' monster movie that delivers the goods on both a human storytelling level and that of a big ol' monster movie. Apparently it is, judging by the bumbled efforts we're typically fed from Hollywood. ""Godzilla Minus One"" comes from Toho Studios in Japan, and is the latest entry in its modern ""Godzilla"" saga, and it works on its own because of its simple story and throwback pleasures. It's ""Godzilla"" going back to its roots. Ryunosuke Kamiki stars as Kōichi Shikishima, a WWII pilot who is disgraced for shirking his kamikaze duties during the war. He's a survivor of an island attack from Godzilla who helps the military plan an attack on the beast; Hidetaka Yoshioka is Kenji Noda, a weapons engineer who devises a plan to sink the big guy. Meanwhile, Shikishima is given a future to fight for, after he agrees to help raise an abandoned child with Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a woman he meets in the wasteland of post-war Tokyo. So we have characters, stakes, and a whole lot of stomping going on, as Godzilla attacks by sea and land, laying waste to Ginza with his radioactive breath. Writer-director Takashi Yamazaki, who also handled the film's visual effects (along with Kiyoko Shibuya), gives viewers plenty of Godzilla but builds the story around its human elements, highlighting its themes of coming together after a time of disaster. He delivers a thrilling, fun, impressive monster movie that shows with a little heart and ingenuity, the classics can come roaring back to life."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," 
The best Godzilla movies are about more than just big kaiju battles. Environmentalism in Godzilla vs. Hedorah, scientific hubris in Godzilla vs. Biollante, bureaucratic inertia in Shin Godzilla â all themes that give those films depth. The spectacular Godzilla Minus One has equally grand ambitions: to explore the soul of postwar Japan.
 
While arguably better known for family-friendly releases like his two Doraemon movies, writer/director Yamazaki has dealt with historical drama before: in kamikaze drama The Eternal Zero and The Great War of Archimedes, his fictionalized retelling of the construction of the battleship Yamato. But it's not just his skill with rendering waves crashing on bows that made him the perfect pick for this kaiju period piece. There's a questioning aspect to his earlier dramas, an attempt to understand Japanese martial and imperial culture, and that's front and center once again in Godzilla Minus One.
 
More specifically, it's given human shape in Koichi (Kamiki), a veteran with a dirty secret: He was a kamikaze pilot who fled rather than suffer an honorable death in flames. As his neighbor, embittered widow Sumiko (longtime Hirokazu Kore-eda collaborator Ando) spits at him, maybe if he'd done his job then they wouldn't be sat in the rubble of a bombed-out Tokyo, surrounded by grief, ghosts, and guilt. Koichi has plenty of that, buried in survivor's guilt even if he almost unwillingly builds a proxy family with Sumiko, young drifter Noriko (Hamabe), and Akiko (Nagatani), the orphaned infant that the gutsy Noriko has taken in. At the same time, Koichi seems to be daring death to finally take him, working to clear the tens of thousands of mines that were left in the seas of Japan by both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Allies.
 
Right there, that's more than enough to provide an enthralling historical drama about Japan's postwar reconstruction, and Yamazaki embraces that story and those characters with tenderness and thoughtfulness. And then Godzilla stomps through the city.
 
This could be a cumbersome juxtaposition, but, as with those best Godzilla films, the monstrous carnage doesn't crush the human drama but only adds to it.
 
As for Godzilla himself, this is a great design: a mixture of the sinister, snarling leviathan of the early Heisei era and the bubbling, twisted, cancerous mass of Shin Godzilla, with a stunning new version of his energy-channeling back spikes. To see him smash through a newly rebuilt Tokyo to Akira Ifukube's classic theme, filmed in a way that might trigger memories of Saving Private Ryan, is both astounding and oddly sobering. It's a spectacle throughout which Yamazaki keeps Koichi, his proxy family, and his oddball workmates centered. The real conflict is within, as the pilot faces a simple but defining choice: to finish his kamikaze mission, or to protect and embrace the life he doesn't feel he needs. And that's where Yamazaki truly finds the heart of Godzilla Minus One: as a simple metaphor for the postwar change in Japanese culture from one where you were expected to sacrifice yourself without question to one where the hope is to live for others. There's as much of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru here as there is the rubber-suit genius of Godzilla creator IshirÅ Honda (himself never shy of political subtext), and that's a pairing as powerful as any monster mash-up.

"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A perfect Godzilla movie that seamlessly blends modern action with the feel and spirit of the originals&#46; Not only is this the best-looking Godzilla&#44; but it&apos;s also the most badass and terrifying one too&#46;
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. Even as Godzilla, the kaiju, has been reimagined as a baby, a Westernized egg-laying creature more akin to a dinosaur, and a metamorphosing terror from the sea, Godzilla as a concept has never really lost its connection to its original allegorical self. By fully embracing Godzilla’s ability to exist as both a literal monster and a lens through which storytellers can explore humanity’s capacity for monstrosity, Toho has been able to give its iconic creation a kind of immortal life at the center of a sprawling franchise.  Recent Godzilla movies’ depictions of the present day have been interesting largely because of the way modern filmmakers are more able to create spectacular scenes of large-scale destruction. But rather than focus on how far the king of monsters has come, writer / director Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One turns back to the titan’s origins to tell a devastating story that lays bare the original myth’s brilliance. Set during the very tail end of World War II after the nuclear bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Godzilla Minus One tells the tale of how a devastated Japan is mobilized back into action by the sudden arrival of a 164-foot-tall reptilian behemoth that breathes atomic radiation. As Minus One opens in 1945, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) has no way of knowing how imminent Japan’s surrender will ultimately be. But from the moment Kōichi decides to touch down on Odo Island rather than sacrifice himself to the war, he knows that — in a very profound way — the life he’s known has come to an end, both because of the conflict itself and because of the guilt that will follow him to what remains of his home. Though Kōichi’s survival instinct keeps him alive, in the eyes of other soldiers and civilians whose lives were upended by the war, the truth of his actions would mark him as a coward, which is why he hides it in Minus One’s opening act. But as hopeless as Kōichi already feels about the future, he’s even more traumatized when Godzilla attacks Odo Island, leaving only the deserter and former Navy service member Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) as survivors. Beginning with the original film, most Godzilla stories have framed their titular monster as an embodiment of the nuclear horrors wrought upon Japan by the United States as part of WWII. But because it takes place a bit earlier than the original, and focuses on the story of how a pilot reluctant during the war then rises to the occasion when Japan is imperiled by a new external threat, Minus One feels like a film that’s also interested in exploring the complicated feelings of resentment that come when a nation’s people are conscripted into global conflicts. People might have a hard time buying the idea of a monster lizard killing a platoon of soldiers after crawling out of the ocean, but everyone Kōichi meets as Minus One unfolds knows how they were all pushed to their breaking points by their government’s decisions. And while some shun Kōichi for his moment of hesitation, others like Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe) understand that banding together in the wake of tragedy is the only way people can ever hope to truly start rebuilding their lives. As Minus One adds figures like engineer Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) and captain Yōji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki) to the picture, you can feel the film emphasizing how a community’s resilience is rooted in interpersonal relationships rather than the power held by any governmental or military body.  But as Godzilla begins to surface more frequently, Yamazaki uses his hulking, visceral take on the monster to remind us that nothing unites people quite like a common, unmistakable adversary. And while Minus One’s human heroes absolutely put up a tremendous and ingenious fight that’s captivating to watch play out, the movie also features some of the Godzilla franchise’s most arresting depictions of the epic beast. Vivid memories of Godzilla haunt Kōichi all throughout Minus One in a way that provides some excellent close-up shots of the monster and evokes the post-traumatic stress disorder soldiers are often plagued with after war. Godzilla never quite looks or feels “real,” per se, but rather like an uncannily realized nightmare made flesh — one whose crushing footsteps leave the camera rattled as helpless humans run for their lives in abject terror.  Though this Godzilla is massive, Yamazaki puts emphasis on the creature’s aquatic grace and unimaginable physical strength in scenes set on the high seas where countless sailors meet their bitter ends. But it isn’t until the Minus One’s fully evolved Godzilla makes landfall that you can see how, for all of its modern filmmaking sensibilities, Yamazaki has still made a spectacular disaster movie in Toho’s classic style that blends digital, practical, and sometimes cheesy effects together to create a finished product that feels more than the sum of its parts. There are so many new, forward-facing riffs on Godzilla and a pantheon of fellow titans out right now or on the horizon that Minus One might initially strike some as a tamer, less-timely feature that’s primarily focused on tapping into nostalgia. But as much of a throwback as the movie is, it’s one worthy of standing alongside the original as a seminal piece of the Toho canon."

When I was  a kid growing up in the Nineties, Godzilla reigned supreme. The king of the monsters was a schlock superstar, and as a disciple, I worshipped at an altar of VHS tapes. It was a good time at the height of Heisei era, with disasterpieces like Godzilla vs. Biollante hitting the American market, and my baby brain was none the wiser that I was mostly being spoon-fed decades-old dubs and reissues of Showa classics. I had a hero! One that fit in nicely alongside green-skinned contemporaries, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. That all changed one day when my dad sat me down to watch his Godzilla — 1956’s Godzilla, King of the Monsters! 
	And as we near his 70th anniversary, Godzilla returns once again as a message on the horrors and human toll of war, in Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One. And it is spectacular. 
	It only takes a few scenes viewing Minus One for your brain to register, “That’s Spielberg.” The hallmarks are apparent and numerous, from the romantic and rosy period aesthetic, marred by sadness and a sweeping sense of what used to be. The action sequences are built on ratcheting, razor-sharp tension yet remain neatly choreographed. Taking stronger lessons from Jaws than Gareth Edwards’ 2014 outing, the film never shies away from showing Godzilla, but focuses on more effective use of scope. There’s a scene of Godzilla chasing survivors on what amounts to a tugboat that you’d swear was done animatronic, with the monster’s eerie human eyes locked in a gaze just above the ocean’s surface. 
	Written during the pandemic at a time when isolation and global distrust of the powers that be permeated the collective consciousness, the film takes aim at the Japanese government for its wanton lack of empathy and devaluing of human lives, both in its WWII-era use of kamikaze pilots and how, fully disarmed by the U.N. in response to their actions, they remained unable to protect their citizens lest they risk tripping up foreign policy. Instead, it’s up to the Japanese people to stand up and fight — against their grief and failures, and for the hope of a better tomorrow. 
	Rolling into North American theaters at the same time as Apple TV’s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters hits streaming, and in its contractually obligated off-year ahead of 2024’s Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, Godzilla Minus One offers an alternative to shared universe syndrome. It’s an artfully made throwback to kaiju classics and likely the first Godzilla movie that dares to make you cry. See it on the biggest screen possible. "
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a really good film&#46; It&#8217;s very sad for much of the journey&#44; as we&#44; as an audience&#44; are in mourning with the Japanese people&#46; For them&#44; fighting Godzilla is not a conceptual or moral issue&#44; but a practical goal in the fight&#46;
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," Next year will mark the 70th anniversary of the debut of Godzilla, the now legendary kaiju, who made its first appearance in the 1954 Japanese film that bears its name. I’m dating myself when I say that my first exposure to Godzilla will have come on WOR Channel 9’s Saturday-morning monster movies, a fixture in the greater New York City metropolitan area in the 1970s and into the 80s, with the appalling Westernized version of that film, reedited to shoehorn in Raymond Burr, WTF, as an American reporter covering the kaiju attack on Japan. I guess it was still too close to the war and the idea was that Americans couldn’t possibly empathize with the Japanese experience, so we needed a white guy to translate for us the horror of *checks notes* a giant irradiated lizard stomping around your city. (It’s sorta horrifying to realize that little me sitting in front of a cathode-ray TV in the mid-late 70s was only 30ish years postwar… and hence closer to WWII, though of course I’d have no memory of it, than I am now to 10-year-old boob-tube-addled me.) Still, I have vivid memories of being a smart, sensitive kid — and somehow a geek from birth, obviously — riveted to the screen by even the Burr version… and even more vivid memories of, as a grownup in the 1990s, seeing the original Raymond Burr–free version of the film on a big screen at NYC’s Film Forum and being, like, damn, this is cinema. Cuz the authentic 1954 Godzilla is pain personified (socialified?). It is Japan’s collective horror at the war, at the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, made plain and inescapable and, well, monstrous. Like, the giant lizard movie is judging America, and maybe also Japan itself, and this is fair. And now we have Godzilla Minus One, a reboot of the king of all monsters, and not that long after the reboot that was Shin Godzilla less than half a decade ago. Huge kudos to Japanese film studio Toho for taking Godzilla in multiple directions at once. Because Shin was all “What if Godzilla didn’t make his first appearance until the 2010s?” in an obvious but totally appropriate nod to Japan’s then-recent horrors (hello, 2011’s tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear meltdown). And now Minus One rewinds the big lizard to before the 1954 debut to posit that maybe the giant kaiju showed up to stomp Tokyo in 1945, long before the postwar American occupation even ended in 1952? What I’m getting at now is that never mind whatever you have been culturally programmed to think is the cheesiness of Godzilla movies: this latest is maybe the closest to the sincere, unironic horrors of 1954 than we’ve seen since. This is the first Godzilla movie that is a period piece, that has the hindsight to look back on what Godzilla might mean to us in retrospect today rather than what it looked like at the time of its creation. And it doesn’t have much to say that is generous about what we’ve brought upon ourselves. What I’m also saying is that maybe it’s not a coincidence that 2023 has given us both Oppenheimer and Godzilla Minus One. That maybe it’s not a coincidence that generational time is calling for a new reconsideration of nuclear weapons. (Um, for the kids who might not know: Godzilla is a creation of American atomic bombs. To add to American war crimes.) See also Apple TV+’s so-far-brilliant new series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, which is not only reconsidering the atomic horrors the United States unleashed on the world but is also asking what responsibility we humans bear toward the kaiju that are our creations. The war — the last big war, World War II — has just ended when former kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki: The Secret World of Arrietty, March of the Penguins) returns home to Tokyo… and don’t think that the status of “former kamikaze pilot who actually survived the war” isn’t a thing. I am not deeply steeped in Japanese cinema, and I’m sure homegrown Japanese culture has long been confronting the legacy of how the nation approached World War II, but as a Westerner, I cannot recall an instance of a film asking, softly and compassionately, whether the sacrifice of kamikazes was worth it and whether it was cowardice or wisdom that guided some to avoid suicide. It shocked me, in the best way, to see that here. (Koichi is a gentle soul, and the movie is kind to him.) Amidst this conundrum, Koichi returns to his bombed-out home to find rubble, an orphaned infant, and an angry neighbor in Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), who most emphatically does not believe that any kamikaze should have avoided his divinely appointed fate (she will come around from that). Profound trauma haunts him, and everyone he encounters. It’s heartbreaking. There is much bittersweet drama in “reject the past” and “hope for the future” and “build your own family out of the ashes” here before we ever get giant stomping lizard that you kinda forget that we’re waiting for giant stomping lizard. It’s all genuinely lovely how these people find something to live for and build upon amid the ruins and the chaos. And then then Godzilla arrives, in a horrific sequence that appropriately calls to mind nuclear bombing, complete with terrifying mushroom cloud, though this one is called up by kaiju fire breath. And then acclaimed filmmaker and visual FX artist Takashi Yamazaki, who wrote and directed and did the VFX for this flick, just lets Kamiki’s Koichi scream in fear and outrage and grief when he witnesses that kaiju mushroom cloud and the devastation it leaves in its wake. This is the second new film I’ve seen recently that just lets people scream in outrage and grief in the face of unimaginable disaster, which feels both like an important step in our appreciation of how we approach trauma and a harbinger of cinematic depictions to come. I mean, I want to scream out loud on the regular, and I’ve never even seen a kaiju. I guess the last thing I’m saying is this: If you’re hoping that this new monster movie might offer some escape from terrible reality, you’re probably not going to find any such comfort here. Man i’m excited to see this! Not sure if I’ll make it to a theater or will have to wait until home. Ive loved godzilla since i was a little kid. All monster movies, really. Wheres our new gamera movies?!
I haven’t started the show yet. I always wait until most eps have been released. I was lucky enough for my first Godzilla exposure to be the original cut, on a big screen. My somewhat-local independent cinema used to do Sunday morning scifi screenings while I was in high school (the cinema is still hanging around, but no more of this sadly), and I caught it there. I was stunned; as you say, the cultural cheesiness programming was completely blown out of the water. I have since scene the Burr re-cut, and been pretty. . . well, disgusted.
anyway, this sounds terrific. I hadn’t heard anything about it before seeing it pop up in showtimes for next week, and I had been pretty dismissive out of the gate. You’re making me reconsider my kneejerk reaction; the premise itself is intriguing. I’ll try to catch it!"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," For much of Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One, Toho Studios’ 33rd film in the beloved kaiju franchise, the iconic monster exists as an abstraction. After a brief, brutal rampage to start, he is kept offscreen, a shadow in the mind of our hero Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki). To a certain extent, this entirely symbolic usage is nothing new: the deeply ingrained allegory for nuclear annihilation that Ishiro Honda’s 1954 original presented has persisted, and often been adapted to fit the times: the most recent Japanese live-action predecessor, Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi’s ferociously incisive Shin Godzilla, tackled the tangled bureaucracy ill-equipped to deal with the Fukushima disaster head-on. But Yamazaki moves back before the source: his prologue begins at the end of World War II, on an island where Kōichi, a would-be kamikaze pilot, touches down after claiming to have technical issues. That night, a smaller-but-still-fearsome incarnation of Godzilla attacks the encampment; Kōichi is frozen by terror, unable to pull the trigger on his plane turret, and the resulting devastation kills almost everybody else. Upon returning to a firebombed Tokyo, he forms an ad hoc family with a homeless woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), and an orphaned baby, taking a job aboard a small minesweeper clearing the detritus of war. This humble existence is threatened when Godzilla, mutated and greatly enlarged by American nuclear testing, emerges once again. The weighting of information in the previous paragraph is intentional: Godzilla Minus One, despite its curious title, is effectively a small-scale drama, spending much of its screen time with Kōichi, his found family, and the motley minesweeper crew. Often set among the cramped interiors of Kōichi’s childhood home, the film is locked into his mindset––one doubly tormented by both the knowledge of his survival when so many others lived and his inability to take action, whether at the cost of his own life or not. Duty and honor as instilled by culture and society inevitably tie into this struggle, and it is given a potential, perverse outlet with the rise of a new enemy as destructive as the conquerors who inadvertently reawakened it. The scenes of actual devastation are concentrated largely into sea battles (the first acts as a very tense Jaws homage) and a single land-based attack on the luxury district of Ginza, which does achieve the horrific level of carnage expected from any self-respecting monster movie. But these stand shoulder-to-shoulder with what emerges as a men-on-a-mission climax, an effort on the part of ex-Navy civilians, led by Kōichi and his minesweeper crew, to kill Godzilla. Such shifts in scale––from grand calamity to intense revelations, from personal trauma to collective resolve––distinguish Godzilla Minus One. It is unabashedly sentimental, even risking a certain ideological simplicity in its groundswell of former troops fighting a new, potentially more worthy conflict on their own terms. But its journey towards this destination is hard-fought, willing to stay in the quiet anguish for uncomfortable lengths of time so that the ultimate release is all the sweeter."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the better Godzilla films&#44; and while it may not contain the level of violence that some of the other modern films have&#44; what we&#8217;re given is spectacular and riveting thanks to the characters&#46;
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," Movie production company Toho’s giant monster franchise Godzilla is the longest running film series in history, making it by default also the biggest sci-fi series and horror series of all time. While Hollywood studio Legendary Pictures continues to produce their own broader MonsterVerse shared cinematic world that includes the famous atomic-powered creature, Toho has continued releasing their own Godzilla pictures, and the latest reboot Godzilla Minus One is one of 2023’s greatest films. Western audiences are familiar with Godzilla, including decades of the Japanese films airing on TV and screening in theaters, as well as the success of the modern MonsterVerse universe of films from Legendary Pictures — including Godzilla, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Godzilla vs. Kong — all of which I liked to varying degrees — and the upcoming Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, as well as excellent new streaming series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters on AppleTV+. (You can read my review of Godzilla here, Godzilla vs. Kong here, and the tie-in MonsterVerse movie Kong: Skull Island here. And read my interview with Godzilla vs. Kong screenwriter Max Borenstein here.) The films and spinoffs have enjoyed varying levels of success, some becoming blockbuster hits and others fizzling out. Qualitatively, Godzilla movies have likewise offered quite different experiences, some great, some good, and some pretty bad. The original Godzilla in 1954 remains a masterpiece of foundational science fiction cinema and horror cinema, responsible for creating the kaiju genre in a film with deep social and historic themes, strong characterization, and an unexpected verisimilitude applied to what could’ve been a sillier B-movie story. (You can watch the original Japanese version of the film — not the Americanized hatchet job typically seen by western audiences — in a lovely remastered version on Pluto TV, which is free and merely requires signing up). Compared to 1953’s The War of the Worlds, the visual effects at times are considered quaint and cheap, but I’ll posit that the flashier and colorful Oscar-winning VFX of Hollywood’s alien invasion movie don’t have the same raw sense of place and time Godzilla achieves, and the sense of scale and impression made by Godzilla’s visuals is inspired and effective in ways more expensive and supposedly more “realistic” film visuals didn’t achieve. Emotionally, few sci-fi films of the era compare to the shockingly personal, painful relevance and resonance of 1954’s Godzilla. Proximity to the events of World War II lend it an immediacy that permeates every scene, the complex messages and cultural mea culpa combining with overwhelming weight of grief, loss, and sense of moral certainty about the dangers and evils of nuclear weapons — and of nuclear power. Sequels, spinoffs, and related film projects have come and gone, but the original Godzilla retained a dignity and power few of its predecessors could come close to matching, and certainly could not surpass... Godzilla Minus One is essentially a remake of the 1954 Godzilla, with inspiration (particularly in its first and third acts) from Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack. But while the film borrows the basic story structure and certain themes from those films, it brings a great deal of original storytelling and characterization to the table, while improving upon those inspirational elements from other films. Writer-director-visual effect supervisor Takashi Yamazaki’s magnificent script is full of real, delicate, flawed people trapped in horrifying circumstances and facing impossible expectations and odds (both internal, cultural, international, and of course in the context of a giant atomic monster). The characters are then brought to vivid life by a tremendous cast, led by Ryunosuke Kamiki and Minami Hamabe in one of the most touching and heartbreaking relationships in any film this year. The supporting cast is likewise remarkable, with Kuranosuke Sasaki and Sakura Ando as notable standouts. Munetaka Aoki is also wonderful in a smaller but crucial role. Visually, Godzilla Minus One feels more photo-realistic in its big effects sequences than any other film in the series, including the far bigger-budgeted Hollywood films. See this film in IMAX or Dolby Cinema, if at all possible. This is the sort of moviemaking that demands such premium theatrical experiences — this is exactly the sort of movie such things are made for. There’s an almost matter-of-factness to the depictions of Godzilla’s emergence and actions, with far less posturing build-up or overstated disaster film visualization — including “9-11 dust” and entirely CGI extended sequences. Here, almost everything except the monster is real, and Godzilla is inserted into the footage in ways to structure his appearance as consistent with the footage, rather than the reverse (which is how most other films seem to approach such sequences of the creature’s destructive appearances). The scenes in the ocean, for example, are less crowded or excessive than similar ocean-based sequences in other modern Godzilla movies, including Hollywood’s, but look like footage of an actual kaiju attack on the Japanese Navy. Underwater, Godzilla moves swiftly and is agile, compared to on land where he is heavy and encumbered by his own massive weight. This creates nice distinctions between the various attack sequences. And when Godzilla does move onto land and unleashes his atomic breath, the effect is mind-blowing and unparalleled in giant-monster cinema. It’s chilling and shocking to witness. Importantly, none of this is ever disaster-porn, it’s not intended to thrill us and excite us. It’s meant to terrify, to disgust, to bring us to tears. And it does, not just because of the sheer immersive magnitude and human toll we are forced to witness, but also how the film ties every such event directly into the lives and stories of the characters. The result is that Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla film ever made, and a masterpiece of kaiju cinema — a statement I’m sure many fans and cinephiles will disagree with (indeed, I suspect even director Yamazaki might take exception to my declaration of his film’s dominant status in the series). But it’s no insult to the quality or legacy of the original film to say that Yamazaki built upon the original’s greatness by applying not only modern cinematic capabilities and budgeting, but also the unique perspective of hindsight and historic consideration of the story’s themes and what it means for future generations. That Yamazaki is able to not only retain and amplify the first film’s message, but also demonstrate that those themes are indeed prophetic and strongly resonant for today’s generations, enhances the status of Godzilla Minus One. Many audiences who might not sit easily through the original Godzilla — whatever brilliance you or I find in it, many modern viewers have expectations that subvert their ability to respond positively to older films — would therefore miss out on its important topical points and emotional appeal, but Godzilla Minus One will have no trouble whatsoever reaching them with those messages. Which, in turn, might lead them to seek out the original, and thus find a connection to it they might otherwise lack, or more likely never even attempt. Godzilla Minus One is well aware of the grandeur and importance of the original, and besides being a reimagined remake, it also includes plenty of homages to that movie, as well as to Giant Monsters All-Out Attack. The image above, for example, is from an attack sequence involving a train, homaging the same attack and train encounter found in the 1954 picture. The film also takes inspiration from several other sources as well, notably Jaws in certain pacing, locale, and characters in specific sequences at sea. My first reaction at about 15 minutes into the film was to pause it (I watched a screener) and make a quick note to myself that it felt like a Steven Spielberg movie, and then about 30 minutes in that note became all the more relevant. I also felt some inspiration from Spielberg’s 2005 War of the Worlds (which is the best adaptation of that story, just for the record), as well as Studio Ghibli’s spectacular film Grave of Fireflies by the late, great Isao Takahata. But this is Yamazaki’s film, through and through, and he weaves his various inspirations and homages into something that is entirely new and masterful, a vision of one of Japan’s greatest cinematic stories as well as the nation’s collective memory, history, and conflicted feelings about honor, sacrifice, guilt, redemption, and the beauty of life even amidst tremendous loss and suffering. We must live — we must choose to live and to believe and to feel, even when we want nothing more than to stop feeling anything at all, because that is the only way to honor those we’ve lost and to make something better of this world than merely the dust and debris left in our wake."
"Nov 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The superior visuals and sound are at odds with the terribly paced story and downright boring characters&#46; It all just feels so underwhelming&#46; 
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," The town is Tokyo, and the O.G. is the original Godzilla. This is the 37th movie about the rampaging reptile since he first lumbered onto movie screens back in 1954. So O.G. might also stand for “old Godzilla.” Except, in Godzilla Minus One, the Godzilla saga rewinds, back to the beginnings and a “youthful” GZ, long before Japan’s iconic, dependably durable all-terrain mega-monster would go on to face off with Mothra, Rodan, Ghidorah or King Kong. Before he became a Hanna-Barbera cartoon in the 1970s, or fed in the imagination of Steven Spielberg as the fledgling director was stewing on Jaws and Jurassic Park. How bad can it get in Tokyo? How low can things go? Well, Godzilla’s arrival makes things even worse—“minus one,” a calibration below zero, on the underside of losing just about everything. The movie reminds us of Godzilla’s cinematic roots in the unbridled destructiveness of a wide-ranging conflict that ended in nuclear mushroom clouds, and how the creature has always been a metaphor for the monstrousness of forces beyond our control—or sometimes, even our comprehension. Godzilla may be a monster, but he’s also a subject that invites our sympathy, as a primal “innocent” creature drawn into conflict, relying on his instincts to survive. You probably won’t recognize any of their faces, but the cast of this all-Japanese production (subtitled in English) has plentiful credits on TV and film in their homeland. This gives it an authenticity lacking in many other Godzilla flicks, which were peppered with Anglo actors (like Raymond Burr, Bryan Cranston, Matthew Broderick, Elizabeth Olson and Sally Hawkins) to broaden their appeal. It’s Godzilla back on his home turf, rip-roaring again in his original element, back in the day when he and Tokyo were just beginning their long “relationship.” Everything happens here around four key episodes of Godzilla coming on like a wrecking ball, trampling people, toppling buildings, snacking on train cars like candy bars, rocking battleships like they were bathtub toys and topping things off with the firepower of his “atomic blast” breath. He puts the thunder in thunder thighs in the spectacular, super-size monster mayhem that you’d expect to see from the King of the Monsters. But it might also surprise you, and move you, with its level of heart and emotion, poignancy and inspirational uplift. Godzilla Minus One reminds us that just like ol’ ‘Zilla keeps getting knocked down but coming back for more, the human spirit is likewise remarkably resilient—even after atomic bombs or facing down beasts from beneath the sea."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," You have to like Godzilla’s style. Confident, with an almost stately groove to his step — and why not? With “Godzilla Minus One,” the giant prehistoric lizard is heading toward the 70th anniversary of his Toho studio franchise. Once again, Japan emerges from World War II only to face this atomic colossus, whose appetite for destruction remains unabated and a reliable spectacle. In a prelude, Godzilla makes landfall during the war on an island where a kamikaze pilot, Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki), has just detoured to desert. Koichi survives the monster’s attacks, becoming a ball of guilt and shame. He resettles in Tokyo’s rubble with a stranger, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), who’s caring for someone else’s baby. They’re a nuclear family, as it were, but remain unmarried, simply co-survivors. Koichi’s camaraderie with crew members on a mine cleanup ship lightens the mood, but soon Godzilla rears his leathery head again with attacks on ships, streets and the people unfortunate enough to be there. Less vengeful or bored than just a phenomenon, Godzilla stomps and chomps away, spiky, dead-eyed, his hide rough as cooled magma. Signature moves include the snap-and-toss (grabbing and flinging a human or train-car aside) and his blue ray (not the high-resolution disc but rather an explosive thermonuclear beam). The writer-director, Takashi Yamazaki, integrates crowds and effects with a sure hand, and endows the violence with a dour air. The mood suits as citizens band together and decry Japan’s wartime disregard for life. The heroic arc is creaky, but despite the chintzy clichés about Godzilla movies, this one keeps bringing blockbuster brio to heel with a sometimes heavy heart."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," When it comes to bringing Godzilla to thrilling, terrifying life, America’s track record has been spotty at best, marked by a few minor highs (2014’s Godzilla, 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong) and lots of lows (virtually everything else, including Apple TV+’s current Monarch: Legacy of Monsters). Not so, however, in his homeland. As Toho Studios’ new Godzilla Minus One proves, the Japanese know how to get the iconic radioactive behemoth right. The 37th feature in the 70-year-old franchise, and arguably one of its finest, Godzilla Minus One, which hits theaters Dec. 1, harkens back to the kaiju’s 1954 origins, yet is far from merely a nostalgia play. On the contrary, Takashi Yamazaki’s film is a faithful update that, like its 2016 predecessor Shin Godzilla, melds then and now with blockbuster-grade brawniness. Skillfully balancing its human- and titan-sized concerns, and going light on socio-political allegory in favor of muscular mayhem, it delivers just about everything fans could want from a sequel—including plentiful larger-than-life chaos and madness. Writer/director Yamazaki wastes not a second getting to the good stuff, as no sooner has WWII kamikaze fighter pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) landed on Odo island in 1945 to have his faulty craft repaired than he and the rest of the island’s military inhabitants are beset by Godzilla, who’s at this early stage less a skyscraper-tall monster than an overgrown dinosaur. If his stature is relatively small, though, his ferocious temper is already mature, and he viciously decimates everyone and everything in his path. In the morning, the sole survivors of this massacre are mechanic Sosaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) and Koichi, and the former largely blames the latter for these casualties due to the fact that the pilot had Godzilla in his plane’s gun sights but, at the moment of truth, froze. Upon returning to decimated Tokyo, Koichi is haunted by the ghosts of his fallen comrades and plagued by guilt over his cowardly failure to fulfill his duty as a kamikaze pilot and to act against the prehistoric marauder. Via the sort of twists of fate that largely happen only in the movies, Koichi acquires a surrogate family in fetching Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe) and baby Akiko (Sae Nagatani), whom Noriko took in after the child’s parents perished in the Tokyo air raids. Yamazaki doesn’t exert excessive energy trying to sell this as believable, since corny contrivances are part and parcel of his cine-spectacular storytelling approach, which later involves a random character revealing himself to be a brilliant naval expert. Still, Kamiki and Hamabe have chemistry and their dynamic is smartly positioned as a microcosm of Japan’s uneasy post-war attempts to overcome trauma, heal, and unite. That process, unsurprisingly, is complicated by Godzilla. Godzilla Minus One offers up a fleeting montage of American intelligence reports to explain how nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll supersized the brute, and then swiftly pits him against Koichi and his coworkers (and friends)—captain Yoji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), brainiac Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), and rookie Shiro Mizushima (Yuki Yamada)—aboard a pitiful wooden ship that they’re using to clear some of the 60,000 mines still littered off the Japanese coast. They’re of course no match for their gargantuan adversary, yet Yamazaki devises smart ways to have them survive in the face of this seemingly unstoppable threat. In every big action set piece, the filmmaker’s plotting is as sharp as Godzilla is brutal. Godzilla Minus One doesn’t skimp on sequences of its main attraction doing what he does best, and in its bookending aquatic showstoppers, it more than faintly becomes a steroidal version of Jaws, complete with the creature’s fin-like dorsal plates cutting through the water as he stalks his prey from beneath the surface. However, whereas Spielberg famously minimized clear glimpses of his marine monster to heighten suspense (and, also, to hide its subpar construction and unconvincing appearance), Yamazaki revels in reverentially depicting his atomic-powered fiend, affording copious views of his title character as he savagely roars and rampages. Resembling his classic form but juiced to awe-inspiringly burly proportions—especially with regards to his powerlifter-grade thighs—Godzilla looks awesome, and the director knows how to shoot him to elicit both wonder and horror, never more so than in an image of the colossus bellowing at the base of a mushroom cloud caused by his destructive heat ray. In such moments, as well as in Koichi’s struggle to deal with his PTSD as well as the shame and remorse of his wartime shortcomings, Godzilla Minus One acknowledges Godzilla’s historical roots as well as the country’s difficult literal and spiritual reconstruction. Nonetheless, the film finds hope amidst its despondency, and just as shrewdly, it doesn’t allow its obvious undercurrents to interfere with its basic monster-mash objectives. If Godzilla’s initial clash with Koichi and his mates at sea is nerve-wracking, his subsequent landfall in Tokyo’s Ginza district is exhilarating, with the director paying homage to his illustrious predecessors with every composition of the beast’s feet crashing to (and through) the street as pedestrians flee in panic, and of his fists and tail pummeling and swiping through buildings as if they were made of cottage cheese. Its kicks are at once old-school breathtaking and new-age violent. Kamiki has a tendency to overemote and his costars fall short of making their supporting characters truly memorable—an inadequacy that can largely be pinned on the script’s reasonable desire to wedge in as much Godzilla pandemonium as possible, which in the final tally comes off as a fair trade. Moreover, Godzilla Minus One adheres to a familiar American summer-extravaganza playbook that renders its late surprises predictable and compels it to conclude with comforting (personal and national) triumph rather than the catastrophic tragedy it’s spent most of its 125 minutes teasing. Even so, there’s considerable pleasure to be had from watching a talented craftsman ply his trade, and Yamazaki exhibits a knack for balancing ground-level sorrow, fear, and joy with epic carnage and calamity. When those two forces meet—say, during close-ups of Noriko, Yoji or other soldiers gazing in dumbstruck astonishment at the scaly giant—the film hits the spine-tingling sweet spot that all Godzilla efforts seek."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A colossal achievement in blockbuster cinema that demands to be seen on the big screen&#33; &#91;Full Review in Spanish&#93;
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,There&apos;s a richer sense of emotion to act as glue for the endeavor&#44; which launches outstanding acts of mass destruction&#44; but also finds time to care about those facing such a fearsome enemy&#46;
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29 (UPI) -- Godzilla Minus One, in theaters Friday, is faithful to the 1954 original while updating the franchise for 2023. That goes for updating the thematic content as well as the visual effects. Returning to Tokyo, Shikishima raises an orphaned baby with Noriko (Minami Hamabe). Shikishima gets a job on a boat locating and detonating mines left over from World War II. By 1947, Godzilla resurfaces and the crew which Shikishima is a part of is in a position to help the military battle the monster. Ultimately, scientist Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) devises a plan that the citizens of Japan can enact on their own. A man could still wear a suit in the shape of this Godzilla if so inclined, but with computer effects that is no longer necessary. Godzilla Minus Zero is already 25 years worth of technology past the first American Godzilla remake, and has advanced accordingly. Godzilla bites people at the waist and stomps on others. This film's realization of Godzilla's atomic breath captures his nuclear power as tangibly as Oppenheimer conveyed the bomb that theoretically caused the evolution of Godzilla. This sort of mega destruction of cities is no longer the sole domain of Godzilla. Yet in a cinema full of Marvel superhero battles and natural disaster movies, Godzilla Minus One retains the unique destructive qualities of its title monster. So it's clear that this Godzilla is a problem for the people of Japan to deal with. He has not yet become a hero they need to fight even deadlier monsters. The notion of a citizen-led Godzilla task force denotes a chance of pace from the usual reliance on government and military in this franchise. Furthermore, every Godzilla attack that Shikishima survives only increases his guilt at having survived his tour as a kamikaze pilot. The first half of the film from 1945 - 1947 effectively builds up characters while still checking in with Godzilla frequently. By the time main characters start to fall, they have been established as more than just Godzilla fodder. As such, the Godzilla destruction that fans came to see is not gratuitous. One sequence of metropolitan chaos establishes the power of Godzilla, but every other monster sequence is plot focused. The action in Godzilla Minus One consists of attempts to address the problem of Godzilla. As all this focus builds up to the climax, the classic Godzilla theme kicks in to confirm this is simply a new approach to a decades-old dilemma. Godzilla Minus One succeeds in using new visual effects to capture traditional monster mayhem. Writer/director Takashi Yamazaki also skillfully weaves in thoughtful commentary worthy of the classic original."
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE," Going into his 70th anniversary, Godzilla has had quite a decade: multiple animated films, a stunningly good run of comics from IDW Publishing and a popular ride in Tokyo, and three largely well-received Hollywood co-productions, with a fourth in the wings for 2024. Not to mention the ongoing Apple-produced streaming series, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, which defies the odds by being surprisingly good, or Hideaki Anno’s visionary Shin Godzilla, the only other live-action production from Toho Studios in the past 20 years and one of the greatest entries in the series. It’s a good time to be King of the Monsters, and Godzilla Minus One is a pretty stellar launching pad into his next era, blending classic elements with an intense, well-conceived human perspective that gives the film a unique character all its own. Godzilla stories have generally been set in either the present day or far-flung future. Minus One upends convention by seeing its tale in 1947, only a year and change after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. Writer-director Takashi Yamazaki chose the setting, and the title, to depict a decimated country without any military capabilities whatsoever, reliant entirely on a generation of civilian men and women still recovering from the wars and political turbulence that defined their society for a decade-and-a-half prior. The emergence of Godzilla in this environment means setting the clock back before even Year Zero of their recovery. It’s a smart creative choice and the right move to make after Shin Godzilla, which made modifications to the character’s nature to account for society’s 21st-century capabilities. Shin presented the largest Godzilla ever; no longer an allegory for nuclear armaments, he became symbolic of a society that chose to play god with nuclear power and a country rife with bureaucratic decay that made it nigh-impossible to combat. The time period doesn’t mean Minus One is a remake of the original Gojira; it’s actually just as indebted to Shusuke Kaneko’s 2001 film Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, an influence Yamazaki has apparently admitted. In that film, Godzilla doesn’t just represent the destruction wrought on Japan by the atomic bomb (or the variety of other, broader themes given to the character in the years since – none of which really work as well). There, he represents the forgotten souls of the war and the atrocities committed by both Japan and other powers alike. In that film, he becomes a cross-generational allegory, a reminder of the war in its totality after generations simmered in history. The story follows Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who fled his duty to die by claiming mechanical problems with his aircraft. He lands on Odo Island for “repairs,” a fateful decision that leads him to encounter Godzilla, a creature known to the local islanders, and Kōichi is one of the sole survivors. Soon after, the war ends and Kōichi is sent back to Tokyo, where he learns his family was killed in the American fire bombings. Although he quickly forges a found family with Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and Akiko (Sae Nagatani), a woman and her adopted child, Kōichi can’t shake the compounding survivor’s guilt and post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his time at war. Although he loves his partner and surrogate child, Kōichi can’t let them into his life. He can’t leave the war behind. Unlike most Godzilla films, which feature varying types of human stories – which I wrote about in my review of Monarch – Minus One is the first one to really make Godzilla himself feel like the supporting character for a specific character’s story arc. The focus for most of the film is squarely on Kōichi and his pain. The supporting cast – including the film’s resident scientist, Kenji (Hidetaka Yoshioka) – are all part of Kōichi’s story rather than characters leading their own lives or conflicts with Godzilla. It’s not that Godzilla films have never had main characters or emotional through-lines, but none has ever gone quite this far or so intimately followed a specific character’s journey. Godzilla is the war, and Godzilla isn’t ready to let Kōichi go, either. It’s all fertile and compelling ground for a new story featuring Godzilla, and for the most part, the film is successful at mining all the potential therein. Kōichi’s relationship with Noriko and Akiko is deep and effective, the two of them also surviving the deaths of their respective families during the war. I’ll admit: As a parent of small children, Akiko’s presence hit me where it hurts. She’s never put in artificial danger to raise stakes. Instead, the responsibility Kōichi feels toward her seamlessly accomplishes all of that work. If you aren’t concerned about depth or character in your Godzilla films, well, there’s still plenty of Godzilla action to wet your whistle. The film takes conflicts between humans and Godzilla in a different direction by setting most of the action at sea, embracing the monster’s amphibious origins in a way generally untapped across his 70 years of wrecking shit. This makes for the best action in the film, especially the first major encounter with him, which I will definitely show my Godzilla-obsessed 4-year-old son once it shows up on YouTube. (The rest of the movie will wait until he’s old enough, as it would upset him now.) Godzilla also smashes the Ginza district of Tokyo, which makes for some good city-smashing. But here’s the thing: despite the best special effects in a Toho movie, the film’s version of Godzilla feels static at times and strangely immobile. This was the case in Shin Godzilla, too, and I’m not quite sure why. Is it a budget thing? An aesthetic choice? I have a hard time imagining it’s solely the latter given the major differences between Anno and Yamazaki’s approaches to the character, but then again the “why” doesn’t matter. It looks strange and makes for sequences that aren’t quite as visceral as they could be. Say what you will about suitmation, but the limitations of filming men wearing rubber costumes meant creatively filming around them to create the illusion of size and terror. Here, there are quite a few sequences where all I felt was, “Yep, that’s a pretty cool rendering of Godzilla standing there.” Still, a pretty cool rendering of Godzilla counts for a lot, and at least composer Naoki Satō knows when to drop the character’s classic themes by Akira Ifukube. The American films have had a serious love-hate relationship with the audio motifs that are so integral to Godzilla, and I’m glad Toho has maintained them. They’re not the entirety of the soundtrack, however, and Satō deserves credit for his own score, which is much more modern in composition but blends well with the older material. I had to laugh, however; there’s a sequence that feels decidedly similar to Dunkirk in the later part of the film, and in that moment Satō’s score also feels directly inspired by Nolan’s film, too. I’d be remiss if I didn’t celebrate the way Satō drops the classic Islander theme from King Kong vs. Godzilla, a total banger criminally left absent from the recent Godzilla vs. Kong. Shin Godzilla famously ended with a tease at a potential sequel that never came. No matter. That film didn’t need a sequel. It felt like a statement beyond simple IP management for Toho Studios. I’d say the same for Minus One, which leaves an open door to a sequel I don’t ever need to see. The emphasis on Kōichi’s story might put off some audiences who are only watching in hopes of big-monster action and nothing more. But as a fan of the franchise, I’m fairly over the moon with what Yamazaki has accomplished. I can’t wait to watch it again."
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE," “Godzilla Minus One” is the latest Japanese rendition from Toho Studios, which hatched the giant, nuclear-breathed amphibian in 1954. Director Takashi Yamazaki, who also wrote the “Minus One” screenplay and is credited with the film’s splendid visual effects, is perhaps the biggest name in Japanese moviemaking that no one’s heard of in the United States. Beside helming some hit anime and live-action sci-fi features, Yamazaki has a special interest in critically examining history adjacent to World War II (“The Fighter Pilot,” “The Great War of Archimedes,” “Always: Sunset on Third Street”). Here Yamazaki simply but brilliantly shifts what Godzilla has always represented to the nation’s psyche — the atomic calamity made scaly flesh — to the war’s end and immediate aftermath.  Ryunosuke Kamiki, a Japanese actor and prodigy there known for his voice acting in several of famed Studio Ghibli animator Hayao Miyazaki’s films, plays Koichi Shikishima. We meet him in the waning days of the war as a kamikaze pilot who chickened out. Once repatriated to the charred husk of his Tokyo neighborhood, he’s haunted by PTSD dreams of the men his cowardice left to a pre-irradiated but still big and scary Godzilla.  When, following a Bikini Atoll nuke test, the much larger lizard comes to town a few years later, Koichi is a man with little left, like all of Japan. But precious more to lose. Yamazaki persuasively depicts the postwar devastation and, later, the scientific and manufacturing ingenuity that would lift the nation out of the ashes. The atomization of the society’s martial and familial traditions is addressed in melodramatic yet piercing ways as Godzilla’s looming threat paradoxically helps to reconfigure them. The social and character insights here are hardly as deep as Yasujiro Ozu and Akira Kurosawa’s used to be, but it’s nice to see a little inspiration from Japan’s midcentury cinema masters finally leak into a film about its most popular screen export. And how is this movie’s Godzilla? Physically, it’s somewhere between the relatively lithe guy-in-rubber-suit Toho started with and the chunkier behemoth in Legendary’s recent run of soulless American Kaiju spectacles. Its face is pure creature, not a hint of the anthropomorphism or humor that has crept into the monster’s sillier portrayals. But Yamazaki’s creation has the most spectacular spinal spikes yet. These bony projections have something to do with firing up the titan’s heat ray, which, when unleashed, wrecks everything it touches more realistically and gorgeously than any previous iteration of Godzilla. Those blasts also leave “Oppenheimer”-worthy mushroom clouds in their wake, which is just one of the things that make this movie an apt Japanese response to Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster. The main effect this film’s commitment to emotional intelligence has is to show us what has been missing from the franchise all along. That, and to deliver a climax that will bring tears to your eyes — unless you’re some sort of beast. “Godzilla Minus One”: Science fiction. In Japanese with English subtitles. Starring Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe and Yuki Yamada. Directed by Takashi Yamazaki. (PG-13. 125 minutes.) In theaters Friday, Dec. 1."
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE," The Big G returns to his roots in Godzilla Minus One, a Toho film about the abject horror of industrial scale warfare. Plus, Godzilla chases a boat like Jaws! Unless he’s palling around with Minilla or Godzilla Jr., it’s hard not to see Godzilla as anything other than a 20,000-ton, fire-breathing metaphor. When used well, that symbolic weight crystalizes the terror of living in a world in which 100,000 people can have their lives snuffed out by atomic weapons. When used poorly, well, Godzilla fights a smog monster.  Within its first minutes, Godzilla Minus One sidesteps that problem with a unique dilemma. The film opens on Odo Island in 1945 Japan where pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) sabotages his plane to avoid his kamikaze mission. When Godzilla attacks the island—here younger, smaller, more savage—fear grips Shikishima and prevents him from firing his plane’s guns at the monster, resulting in the death of most of his fellow soldiers.  More than a personal choice, writer and director Takashi Yamazaki frames Shikishima’s refusal to shoot as a matter of national honor. Upon returning to his war-ravaged community in Tokyo circa 1947, locals curse Shikishima for failing to do his duty and thus allowing the Allies’ devastation to continue. Even two years later, nightmares drive Shikishima to wonder aloud if he’s a ghost, trapped in a postwar hell as punishment for his cowardice.  Kamiki shines in these moments, immediately earning viewers’ sympathy with his troubled brow and burning eyes, suggesting rage against the war machine that too often sublimates into self-hatred. Even when teamed with the small crew of sailors hired to destroy ocean mines, or creating a found family with fellow survivor Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe) and the abandoned child (Sae Nagatani), Kamiki plays the tension between the need for belonging and his inescapable guilt. Hamabe gets less to do as Noriko, a fairly one-note doe-eyed character reduced to supporting Shikishima through his PTSD, but she makes for a warm presence in a bleak setting.  Yamazaki’s film better serves co-stars Hidetaka Yoshioka, who plays engineer Dr. Noda, and Kuranosuke Sasaki and Yuki Yamada as Captain Akitsu and young trainee Mizushima, Shikishima’s shipmates aboard the Shinsei Maru. Yamazaki borrows heavily from Steven Spielberg’s Jaws in these sequences, combining the stress between the mismatched crew, particularly Mizushima’s disappointment that the war ended before he could enlist, with the camaraderie they quickly develop while blasting mines out to sea.  Compelling as the humans are, Yamazaki never lets them distract from the main event: Godzilla himself. Serving as visual effects director alongside Kiyoko Shibuya, Yamazaki gives us a Godzilla even more beefiness than his current American counterpart without losing the feel of a person in a rubber suit.  Unlike Toho’s last outing, the equally excellent Shin Godzilla (2016), the monster of Godzilla Minus One remains fundamentally dino-like, even in his earliest incarnation. But where the younger Godzilla had a fleetness that recalls the T-Rex of Jurassic Park, the mature monster thunders with unadulterated power. Yamazaki reimagines Godzilla’s atomic breath as a more machine-like buildup, with the scales on his back mechanically popping up as they turn blue. The sound cuts out when Godzilla releases his blue blast followed by a mushroom cloud at the point of impact, which decimates the surrounding area with a hurricane gust that first radiates out and then implodes in.  As that description suggests, Godzilla of Minus One once again represents the uncontrollable destruction of atomic weapons. But Yamazaki broadens the movie’s metaphorical view to link Godzilla to war in general, a seemingly unstoppable death dealer with no understandable motivation.  On one hand, this shift in perspective lets the U.S. off relatively easy. A quick shot of the atomic explosion at Bikini Atoll juxtaposes with an extreme close-up of Godzilla’s eye, establishing that U.S. testing mutated Godzilla into the hulking beast we know, but not that it created the monster in the first place. Characters briefly mention the dangers to civilians posed by magnetic mines left in the Pacific, but quickly turn their criticisms toward their own government. When the American military refuses to help Japan fight Godzilla for fear of arousing Soviet suspicions, the Japanese characters nod in understanding. To the cynical, that shift reveals the commercial hopes of Godzilla Minus One, as Toho hopes to garner an audience among us easily offended Americans. However, the movie frames nationalism as part of the war machine that breeds death and destruction. For all of the horrific violence onscreen, Godzilla Minus One is an endlessly hopeful, life-affirming film. It sees Godzilla as a representation of humanity’s warlike nature, which can only be resisted through the indefatigable will to live.  Against the frequent use of worm’s-eye-view shots that relate the human’s perspective of the towering monster, Yamazaki pans his camera across people banding together to help each other and holds on shots of Shikishima embracing Noriko. Mighty as the warlike Godzilla is, Godzilla Minus One remains convinced that humans working together are even stronger and gives us compelling, fully drawn human characters to make us believe it. "
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE," With close to 40 films to Godzilla’s name, stories about the gargantuan radioactive lizard have taken numerous forms: A steady procession of monster-of-the-week style battles, where Earth’s guardian defends its turf against invading kaiju; reimaginings such as Shin Godzilla, which reframed these attacks through layers of governmental bureaucracy; or the up and down Hollywood spins on this material that tried to create a giant creature-themed cinematic universe. However, like many long-running series, it often gets lost in the shuffle that the original film is intriguingly singular, and thanks to its brilliant melding of camp and sharp social commentary, it sits among the best sci-fi flicks ever made. While 1954 Godzilla’s stance on the horror of nuclear weapons has been well-documented, it is just as much about the general hurt of a devastated post-war Japan. As Tokyo burns for the second time in a decade, a survivor clenches their fist and curses Godzilla, who serves as a clear stand-in for the unhealed wounds delivered by American B-29s. The latest in the franchise, Godzilla Minus One, has a great deal in common with this first entry, a comparison that very much works in its favor. Between its thoughtful approach to its post-war setting, human focus and ability to communicate widespread calamity, it’s a well-considered reboot that stands near the top of this lineage. Godzilla Minus One begins in the last days of World War II as Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a pilot ordered to carry out a kamikaze strike, feigns that his plane has mechanical issues to avoid his death. Unfortunately for him, he finds that he’s fled from one massacre to another. As he lands on a small island for repairs, a prehistoric creature appears from the sea (spoilers, it’s Godzilla) and attacks the crew, killing nearly everyone aside from Shikishima before diving back into the ocean. Having lived through these encounters, he returns home to learn his neighborhood has been obliterated in air raids. While he finds some semblance of family with Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a woman who also lost her home, and her adopted daughter Akiko (Sae Nagatani), he’s unable to fully move on from the survivor’s guilt of having escaped the war—and this monster—while so many others didn’t. Years go by until Godzilla, now mutated by radioactive waste, returns and sets its sights on a still-recovering Tokyo. From the jump, it’s apparent that Takashi Yamazaki’s script and direction are more interested in the human side of the equation than some of the particularly bombastic entries in the series. The apocalyptic destruction of World War II comes across in shots of smoldering ruins that used to be communities and the pained expressions of their inhabitants left clinging to the tattered remains of their former lives. Beyond the physical scars of this conflict, we see its mental weight: Shikishima is tormented by his self-perceived “cowardice.” Even as he builds towards a fresh start after taking in Noriko and Akiko and meeting buddies at his dangerous job defusing ocean mines, he still can’t move on from his alleged failings and the trauma he endured, a dynamic that only becomes worse as his white whale re-emerges. Shikishima’s struggle with shirking his “duty” to carry out a kamikaze strike reverberates throughout Godzilla Minus One, giving him a compelling character arc that ties in with this narrative’s greater criticisms of Imperial Japan. The growing cast of characters, including Shikishima’s work friends, grapple with distrust and distaste for a government that treated its own people like disposable commodities. There’s Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), or Doc, a former naval engineer who vows to help build a better world where young people aren’t sent to the slaughter. Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), the crusty captain of this group’s mine disposal boat, initially comes across as someone who would favor the old guard. Instead, he expresses disgust for how things have been. These characters push for societal reform that embraces the sanctity of life while Shikishima grapples with the toxic expectations of a deposed regime that sentenced young men to die in the name of nationalism. While this story convincingly captures the physical pains of rebuilding, it also depicts the deeper struggle of expunging these lingering expectations. More than just intellectually communicating these ideas, Shikishima’s well-conveyed relationship with his found family and coworkers gives this conflict emotional stakes and inspires hope that he’ll be able to accept his new life. But of course, this internal drama is only part of the picture, and if a certain irradiated monstrosity had a say in the matter, Tokyo would be reduced to rubble long before these people could resolve their interpersonal problems. When Godzilla finally arrives at his old stomping grounds, it makes for some impressive displays of blockbuster filmmaking. Cinematographer Kōzō Shibasaki’s low-angle shots emphasize the enormity of the beast as it sends rail cars sailing through the sky, nonchalantly topples buildings, and crushes fleeing civilians underfoot. The more intimate perspectives portrayed in these scenes pair well with the overarching human focus and represent the sheer terror of this attack from the eyes of its victims. Additionally, solid special effects work from Shirogumi gives us appropriately explosive moments, such as desperate naval battles and crumbling urban environments. Although it can occasionally feel as though we’re just seeing replays of the hits—like when tank fire ineffectually bounces off Godzilla’s hide, or a few other explicit references to the original—quite a few sequences stand alone. Perhaps the single biggest setpiece comes after the creature unleashes its atomic breath at a particularly inopportune time, resulting in a blast that fully captures the terrifying impact of thermonuclear annihilation. Godzilla Minus One may not be quite as concerned with the ramifications of the atom bomb as many other entries in the series, but this scene, alongside Godzilla’s unsightly appearance, serve as striking reminders of these ideas. Similar to Shin Godzilla, the previous live-action effort from Toho Studios, the monster’s stiff movements and permanent snarl reflect its radioactive mutations and make it appear as even more of an intimidating, near-immortal foe. Much like the movie that started it all, Godzilla Minus One cements itself among the best entries in the series by successfully operating as both an evocative disaster flick and a more human-oriented drama, using each half to bolster the other. Its action sequences are gripping thanks to impressive special effects and clever camera angles that emphasize the scale of the carnage, and because we’re endeared to its cast and their struggles, making us fret over their fates. The destruction sown by Godzilla dovetails with this rendition of a beleaguered post-war Japan, alluding to the literal destruction and emotional damage wrought by this conflict. Godzilla Minus One beautifully bridges these disparate parts, combining thrills with moments of thoughtful character growth. Perhaps most surprisingly, for a series so often obsessed with the spectacle of mass death, it serves as a poignant portrayal of finding the will to live on despite everything.

"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Godzilla Minus One is a much-needed&#44; reset for the franchise&#46; The King of the Monsters is scary again&#44; as writer-director Takashi Yamazaki depicts the iconic kaiju as a terrifying force of nature for the first time in ages&#44; returning Big G to his roots&#46;
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE," Deep in the recesses of our subconscious is an encounter with something so hostile and unnatural it hard-wired us to feel fear and act in the interest of survival. When fear faces us, we might choose to flee or freeze. In Godzilla Minus One, we see people learning how to stand up and look fear in the eye. Seven years after Toho rebooted its prized Godzilla franchise with the politically minded Shin Godzilla, the historic Japanese studio has again reimagined the atomic lizard synonymous with the kaiju genre in director Takashi Yamazaki’s Godzilla Minus One. Set during Japan’s postwar recovery in the late 1940s, the “Minus One” in the title refers to Japan starting from zero — only for Godzilla’s emergence to plunge the battered nation further into a deficit of despair. Yamazaki’s latest movie is as dark as that sounds, but it’s also a stunning portrait of bravery and resilience against overwhelming odds. It suggests that puny people can be as strong as a monster when we fight together for the right reasons, and it does so while being so many things at once: an emotionally charged family drama, a war epic, a Jaws homage, and a gruesome monster horror. Regardless of what shape Minus One takes over its runtime, it remains a well-directed feature about giving oneself permission to keep on living at any cost. When protagonist and kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) enters the movie, Yamazaki’s camera is fixated on the undetonated bomb beneath his plane. It’s a stark reminder of Godzilla’s creative origins rooted in the atomic decimation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It also doubles as a symbol of the movie’s narrative thrust. Shikishima is a kamikaze pilot who didn’t do the senseless and costly he was meant to do. (For those in need of context, kamikaze bombers who survived or narrowly escaped their duty endured public shame.) Shikishima’s own shame is amplified tenfold when he meets Godzilla on an island in a rousing opening set-piece where his fingers tremble on a trigger he never pulls. The rest of the movie follows Shikishima building a new life literally atop the rubble of Japan after World War II. In a ramshackle makeshift home, Shikishima enters a platonic relationship with another survivor (Minami Hamabe) as they watch over a baby orphan in a subplot that is amusing until it becomes genuinely moving. Inevitably, Godzilla returns, now bigger and more dangerous from exposure to U.S. nuclear tests in Bikini Atoll. With Japan left defenseless, Shikishima finds himself in the company of war veterans who take it upon themselves to stop the monster from obliterating them all. Director Takashi Yamazaki is a darling in Japan’s movie industry, a veteran of VFX-heavy productions who understands how to prioritize the most essential and emotionally relatable parts of his films. His filmography speaks to an artist born to direct a Godzilla movie, too. His 2007 dramedy Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 opens with a Godzilla cameo played to comic effect. With Godzilla Minus One, Yamazaki demonstrates a more understated but no less effective sense of humor, but never betrays his intended somber tone. Yamazaki is quite unlike many other spectacle-oriented directors for whom maximalism is the point. Whether it's giant spaceship battles or just his actors weeping on hospital beds, his staging is clear and compositions consistent. This is especially true here, with Godzilla’s unholy massacre of bustling Ginza technically sound with a coherent sense of space. That Yamazaki also knows how to really sell the beast’s imposing stature aids in our recognition of Godzilla as a foreign entity. Though kaiju films are ubiquitous and their potency diluted by superhero climaxes, Yamazaki’s overall grasp on Godzilla Minus One restores the eerie foreignness of a nuclear-powered dinosaur crushing buildings in broad daylight. Yamazaki’s Godzilla is fully a VFX creature with a thunderous sound design whose roars chill the spine and footsteps feel like cannon blasts. The director re-cements Godzilla’s Lovecraftian nature as an indescribable monstrosity whose presence can drive witnesses to insanity. During the movie’s staple city stomp, a long stretch of haunting visual poetry, a news crew standing close by on a rooftop have their eyes and lenses fixated on Godzilla. His tail swipes the foundation of the building from under their feet and we follow them all the way to the ground. The effect is almost enough to induce vertigo. It is not hyperbole to say Godzilla Minus One is perhaps one of the finest movies of the kaiju genre ever put to screen since Ishiro Honda’s Gojira kicked off the franchise in 1954. It’s as bleak and zealous against the inhuman cost of war as Honda’s movie but brims with verve over its affirmations of life as a gift to share with others. Drop any and all notions that kaiju films are empty-calorie disaster porn. In contrast to Toho’s own camp sequels or the gaudy, Americanized MonsterVerse, Godzilla Minus One is beautiful in its mindfulness and honesty. It is a picture full of awful destruction yet cherishes the value of a single life by the totality of its complexities."
"Nov 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"  Yamazaki remains true and aware of the Godzilla mythos. This is most apparent in the film's potentially most iconic scene when Godzilla descends upon the Ginza district and rampages amongst the panicked and fleeing populace, a clear homage to the original, iconic 1950s iteration. However, his writing and directing approach give Godzilla Minus One its distinct identity, which resonates with the next generation as much as it does with those who grew up with the franchise. Setting the story in the past allows for a sense of distance. While some critics might protest this as skirting the current global anxieties of the early 2020s, Yamazaki's choice to set the film in Godzilla's era of origin proved not only wise -- forgoing timeliness for timelessness and ensuring this film's enduring impact -- but especially effective, poignant, and ultimately necessary, making the themes of war, its consequences, despair, and the callous expendability of life, all integral to the story.   Godzilla Minus One is only as good as its titular star, and Yamazaki delivers one of the most beautiful iterations of the kaiju ever put to film. It might seem odd to call Godzilla ""beautiful,"" but it's an apt description -- the legendary monster has never looked better than in this film. The design for the creature, the CGI, and the special effects come together splendidly to create a terrifying being, monstrous and imposing yet still easy on the eyes. This Godzilla inspires awe, fear, and admiration in viewers. Its appearance is traditionally reptilian, with the heavy, coral-like black texture of the scales evoking the ocean shelves, hardened lava, and heavy armor, emphasizing Godzilla's impenetrability and contrasting with its unsettling human eyes. The signature spikes on the creature's back serve a plot purpose, growing and glowing whenever the creature absorbs attacks and then charges its famous atomic breath.   Here, Godzilla is portrayed as an animal, a force of nature, and the embodiment of Japan's despair, lending a sense of dignity to its ferocity and presence, even as it kills people and destroys buildings. It bites but doesn't eat its victims, tossing them away like old toys; it marches at a steady and almost funerary pace through the city, agitated by weaponry; its smashing of buildings and landmarks comes across as pure animal instinct and retaliation as opposed to destruction for destruction's sake -- which makes its deployment of its atomic breath, and its slow buildup, all the more shocking to watch. As a villain and antagonist, this Godzilla is perhaps one of the most remarkable iterations.   The human cast doesn't slouch, either. This film has some phenomenal, believable, and endearing performances. In contrast to most American-made monster films, this cast is deeply developed and extremely likable. While some characters have harsh moments, Godzilla Minus One has one of the most well-developed and sympathetic casts in cinema, thanks to Yamazaki's gentle approach as writer and director and the performances of this excellent cast, which includes a grieving mother, a sarcastic, gruff yet affable sea captain, a noble and remorseful naval commander, a gung-ho young upstart, and Noriko, a strong-willed yet sweet-natured young woman with her adopted baby in tow. The most impressive is that of the lead role, Koichi Shikishima, a fear-stricken and guilt-ridden ex-kamikaze pilot, played by Ryonosuke Kamiki, who gives one of the most nuanced performances of the film. With pitch-perfect accuracy, Kamiki delivers the character's toughness, trauma, emotional fragility, brittleness, and vulnerable human selflessness. Shikishima is first introduced to viewers as a kamikaze pilot who flees his duty to an island of mechanics. He's paralyzed by despair and the fear of death, first by his duty as a kamikaze to sacrifice his life as a suicide pilot, second by the shame of abandoning said duty, and lastly, by Godzilla's first and deadly appearance, during which he finds himself unable to take action, with devastating results. His struggles with despair and guilt make the backbone of this film, showing the consequences of war on both a personal and collective level, most notably with Noriko -- who he takes in after the war -- and with the crew of ragtag misfits who undertake the battle against Godzilla.   Although this film has no shortage of death and destruction, the violence and casualties of Gozilla Minus One is surprisingly bloodless. The element of restraint in portraying suffering and chaos makes this film and its overt violence tasteful and mature. While the stakes are high and the threat of death is ever-present and immediate, never at any point are any of the characters treated as disposable monster fodder. Deaths are treated seriously, even when they occur en masse due to Godzilla's rampage. In many ways, this restraint makes the destruction and losses all the more real, poignant, and impactful. This ties into one of the film's central themes. The postwar setting is integral to the plot and themes, with the majority of the cast all reconciling with their personal losses and failures during the war and Japan as a nation facing a reckoning with the culture that led them to the losing side of the war, and the multiple ensuing casualties.   In many ways, Godzilla Minus One serves as a deconstruction and reconstruction of the Japanese spirit. Considering that Godzilla was created by the consequences of war -- specifically the atomic bombs deployed by the United States, effectively ending WWII and sealing Japan's defeat -- it's fitting and quite beautiful that the true battle against Godzilla is undertaken by the ordinary people, specifically war veterans still coming to grips with their actions and losses, after their government leaves them behind. One of the principal characters, the endearingly dorky engineer, Kenji ""Doc"" Noda, portrayed with nuanced sweetness by Hidetaka Yoshioka, summarizes this theme in a particularly poignant speech, decrying the cheapness of death as imposed by war and the Japanese government while at the same time affirming the preciousness of life, the nation and its spirit, urging the makeshift team of veterans and civilians to fight against Godzilla, determined this time not to needlessly sacrifice themselves and others -- leading to the climactic final battle against Godzilla. This culminates in one of the franchise's most nail-bitingly tense yet cathartic and satisfying climaxes.   On a technical level, Godzilla Minus One is perhaps this long-enduring franchise's most breathtaking and aesthetically pleasing film. The set design, costumes, and color palette accurately represent the immediate post-war setting. Despite the muted swatch of soft taupes, mauves, blues, browns, green, and white, with the occasional washes of black and bursts of fiery orange, Godzilla Minus One feels colorful and full of life. Even scenes of devastation or gloom are well-lit, a stark and satisfying departure from the HDR-enforced darkness rampant in American cinema. The cinematography is stunning, with close, intimate, and lingering shots during intimate scenes and tight angles and wide, panoramic shots during the grand Godzilla appearances. Yamazaki's slower pacing allows scenes to breathe and develop naturally, never lingering or dragging longer than necessary. The dialogue is serious, restrained, and straightforward, with just the right balance between telling and showing, allowing actors to express and the viewers to interpret the characters' emotions and motives for themselves.   One of the most effective aspects of Godzilla Minus One is the sound design. The most explosive and dynamic thing about this monster movie is what isn't audible. The soundtrack, created by Naoki Sato, is subtle, a balance between the gentle, spare, and haunting single-line melodies of intimate and emotional scenes and huge, dark, and full of explosive scare chords during Godzilla's rampages. During the more triumphant scenes, Sato channels Studio Ghibli mainstay Joe Hisaishi, putting sweeping orchestras against the characters' heroic speeches. But equally important to the scenes with music are those without. Godzilla Minus One has many moments where the ambient sounds make up the only soundtrack -- lending a sense of peace and realism in the human moments and greater dramatic impact to those where Godzilla is on the loose.   Godzilla Minus One is a towering kaiju of a film, standing heads and shoulders above its contemporaries as a phenomenal film -- not just within its legendary franchise but as a cinematic achievement in its own right. Although a monster movie in principle, this film is achingly human down to its core, balancing high-stakes drama with subtle humor and bittersweet tenderness amongst the carnage, ensuring Yamazaki's take on the timeless monster will be a timeless classic.  Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb.

"Nov 28, 2023",POSITIVE," Writer-director Yamazaki Takashi’s Godzilla Minus One begins on an island outpost in 1945, as kamikaze pilot Kôichi Shikishima (Kamiki Ryûnosuke) makes an impulsive choice to feign technical issues so he can avoid carrying out his suicidally nationalist duty. To him, living in shame is preferable to dying for glory, though the airman’s decision fatalistically coincides with the first appearance of a certain ravenous reptilian, who devours his way through a troop of aircraft mechanics while Kôichi cowers just out of sight.  Is Gojira, a.k.a. Godzilla, a manifested consequence of one man’s craven tendencies, or a symptom—as he often is in the decades-long series of films in which he appears—of some larger sociopolitical unease? This iconic movie monster began and often serves as a metaphor for deep-seated fears of nuclear testing and warfare, but in Godzilla Minus One he proves little more than a gargantuan antagonist, which is good enough for what Yamazaki sets out to do. Any disappointments primarily stem from the film having to follow Anno Hideaki’s Shin Godzilla, a Fukushima-alluding cautionary fable inventively fused with a Thick of It-esque bureaucracy satire. Yamazaki, though, certainly gives himself as potentially potent a template, setting Godzilla Minus One mostly in the aftermath of World War II as Japan is at its cultural and economic lowest, and any sustainable future seems a pipe dream. Kôichi comes home from the battlefield to find his family vaporized and his neighbors shunning him for his spinelessness. He quickly connects with a homeless girl, Noriko (Hamabe Minami), and an abandoned child, Akiko (Nagatani Sae), who they both adopt as their own. By 1947, Kôichi has restored his house and created a surrogate family that appears built to last. But he’s still haunted by his fearful first encounter with Godzilla. To assuage his guilt, he teams up with a ragtag bunch of navy men, as well as a former weapons engineer, Kenji (Yoshioka Hidetaka), to clear the waters near Tokyo of the ship-immolating mines left over from the war years. Little do Kôichi and his companions know that everyone’s favorite bulging-thighed behemoth has been nuked by the American Army at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific, with the blast quadrupling him in size and making him effectively indestructible. Of course, Godzilla is headed right for Tokyo, so given Japan’s defanged military capabilities, it’s up to science, in-the-moment ingenuity, and survivalist gumption to save the day. The larger theme of Yamazaki’s script is the will to live through the worst of circumstances, and how that ethos evolves from Kôichi’s singularly mutinous act in the film’s first scenes to a mutually motivating force by the end. As one man rises from the wartime rubble, so does all of Japan—a lovely sentiment that Godzilla Minus One strains to fruitfully realize. Unlike Anno’s expert balance of Shin Godzilla’s many disparate and seemingly incongruous elements, Yamazaki allows spectacle to trump all else, his characters becoming little more than pawns in a chomp-and-stomp game of whack-a-mole. Not that there’s anything wrong with that when the spectacle is as impressive as it is in Godzilla Minus One. Two set pieces in particular stand out. In the first, Godzilla swims after Kôichi and his crew’s craft like a steroidal Jaws, every bullet proving ineffective, and a jaw-rending incendiary device easily shrugged off given the creature’s rapid healing abilities. In the second, Big G takes an afternoon stroll through Tokyo’s Ginza district, flattening fleeing citizens underfoot, razing buildings with claw and tail, and tossing around train cars like a toddler would their toys. And this latter sequence culminates with a jaw-dropping display of Godzilla’s blue-tinged atomic breath, the cold-blooded colossus silhouetted against an ever-expanding mushroom cloud as an already deeply anguished metropolis is further devastated. For all the unbridled destruction, Godzilla Minus One remains perversely light and fun, a Roland Emmerich-like disaster flick helmed by an actual talent. Yamazaki’s conception of Godzilla is especially inspired, most notably in full profile shots where the beast moves eerily between the man-in-suit herky-jerkiness of Honda Ishirô’s 1954 classic Godzilla and a more modern motion-captured smoothness—a Brobdingnagian superstar cast from the molds of multiple eras. The human drama may pale in comparison to the titan roaring calamitously overhead, but the audience’s collective lizard brain will still be more than satiated.

"Nov 27, 2023",POSITIVE," No doubt about it, this is a magnificent time to be a fan of the King of the Monsters. Not only is the MonsterVerse among the healthier movie universes out there, with Monarch Legacy of Monsters conquering the small screen to much acclaim and next year’s Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to reduce cinematoriums to rubble again, but the legendary (pun intended) Toho studios have realised a brand new Godzilla to cinemas in Minus One. Their 33rd Godzilla, and a Christmas present for both fans of the radioactive reptilian, as well as fans of soulful, passionate cinema itself, to cherish. Set in post-WW2 Japan, the film sees a country that lost everything and was left with zero, but with the arrival of a devastating natural force in Godzilla, a creature amplified by the after-effects of mankind’s weapons, they are set to lose even more and be left with minus one! Ahead of Godzilla’s 70th anniversary next year, writer/director/VFX artist Takashi Yamazaki’s new film is a masterful, emotional and thematically rich kaiju story that does the utmost justice to the iconic creation of Ishirō Honda. Scarily, like in 1954, we are still living under the ominous shadow and threat of nuclear annihilation, and Godzilla’s return to being a metaphor for radioactive devastation could not be any more meaningful. A story of nature blown out of proportion, post-war trauma and the affliction of duty and regret, Minus One is a human tale, as moving as it is crowd-pleasing. Feeling at times like Spielberg’s Jaws crossed with a wartime picture of loss, retribution and the pain of survival. Lead stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and Minami Hamabe give this film its poignant human core as Kōichi and Noriko, respectively, as they headline an all-round superb cast of memorable characters, so plentiful in number you could list and discuss a mighty majority of the supporting cast here. The highlight, perhaps, is Hidetaka Yoshioka’s reflective weapons engineer, Kenji. This is certainly one of the best-assembled rosters of human characters in any Godzilla feature ever.  Mind you, we would guess you are all probably eager to hear about Godzilla himself. Well, he has never looked better, in all his atomic dorsal finned beauty, with a design as majestic as it is frightening (wait for that atomic breath). While Naoki Satō’s stirring rendition of Akira Ifukube’s classic score leaves you as breathless as the spectacular seat-rattling set piece spectacle. Minus One shows so many modern blockbusters how it’s done visually (indeed, what Yamazaki has achieved here on this budget ought to be studied by all) but even more so narratively, in a thunderous, profound, and exciting cinema experience that is absolutely not to be missed! "
"Nov 27, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla, and Godzilla movies, has been many things over the past 69 years—the King of All Monsters has changed in character as often as he’s changed in design, from horrifying force of nature to heroic defender of the Earth. It’s fitting then, that his latest incarnation refocuses on Godzilla in some ways, and his human foils in others, to create a throwback that feels invigoratingly fresh. That comes in Takashi Yamazaki’s remarkable Godzilla Minus One. Part reboot, part loose extrapolation of the legendary kaiju’s original roots in the iconic 1954 movie, this time we are transported to the immediate aftermath of World War II, as Japan finds itself dealing with rebuilding in the wake of the devastating end to the war only to be confronted with the nuclear terror of Godzilla’s emergence. Focusing on a young man named Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki)—a kamikaze pilot who returns home after the war’s end, burdening the regrets of having faked an engine malfunction to avoid going into battle—Godzilla Minus One shines in letting itself rest on Kamiki’s performance and Koichi as its lens. Human drama has always been the core of any great Godzilla movie, but more often than not, those humans are movers and shakers, government or military forces, larger than life entities who combat the threat of Godzilla through administrative bureaucracy or military might. Minus One, presenting us a harsh reality where Japan has no willing allies to come to its aid, a battered people, an uncaring government and dwindled military assets, spends its first act building up almost a sense of dread in its focus on the human spirit. As we watch Koichi and his neighbors pick through the wreckage of firebombed Tokyo to rebuild their homes and their lives—first distrustful of each other but increasingly more united and resilient—there is a tension inherent to knowing that this is a Godzilla movie: these people, these characters we come to admire through an intensely focused perspective, are building proverbial houses of cards out of the ashes. So when Godzilla comes, Minus One never shies away from either the terror that such a threat should be, nor the political allegory of Godzilla’s representation of nuclear anxiety—one all-the-more heightened by its post-war setting. Yamazaki’s eye for special effects here is incredible: Godzilla has a presence in Minus One that feels real, and in a wonderful nod to its retro-aesthetic, a texture and stylization that feels like part living beast, part man in a suit. And yet, he is indeed all-terrifying, and seemingly all-unstoppable when all our heroes have to stop him is a flotilla of fishing boats and past-decommissioning mines. He is, pointedly as well, a nuclear threat: although Godzilla’s rise is built up throughout the early acts of the film, in his first true attack on Japanese soil he carries the weight of total nuclear destruction, leveling city blocks in an awesome, horrifying blast from his heat ray that leaves nothing but devastation and the tell-tale mushroom cloud in its wake. If Shin Godzilla, Toho’s last kaiju film and now nearly a decade behind us, made a Godzilla that was alien in its horror, Minus One’s is a fear grounded in our reality, one that is keenly known to the context of its characters, and to its audience. Just as cleverly as Minus One both builds up its human elements and its stunning take on Godzilla himself, when it comes time in the final act for Koichi and the community he has built around him—one we have seen grow throughout the film—to be the immovable object against an unstoppable force, Yamazaki beautifully dovetails all the threads he’s laid down to deliver a climax that evokes Godzilla films at their most classic: a story of high melodrama and terror, but one intensely focused on, and enamored by, the capability of the human spirit—to stand up, to help each other, to love. But that is also the underpinning of its real message. Minus One isn’t a movie about Japan as a nation state reacting to Godzilla, and what the imagery of the King of all Kaiju represents. It is a movie about people—the communities we build in our lives as individuals, what we value and what we keep when there is nothing else willing to support us—facing this titanic, unflinching threat. Even as Minus One excels in establishing the horror of its titular antagonist through remarkable effects work and grippingly framed action, it is ultimately a movie that is not about its monstrous headliner, but the hope in its human characters. That Minus One excels in this balance between the human and the monstrous is a triumph all of it its own. But that it does so as well by so masterfully using its period setting to make its political allegories clear and explicit to its audience—to provide them the spectacle of its shock and awe, the joy of its human spirit, but also the bitter pill of its powerful political message—makes it more than just one of Godzilla’s best cinematic appearances ever, but one of the year’s best movies full stop.

"Nov 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"  Though not the only movie monster out there, there is perhaps no more iconic figure than Godzilla. Whether you’ve seen merely one of his many movies or all of them, the towering figure has long cast a shadow over the trajectory of cinema itself. A monster of epic scale with atomic breath that he unleashes on the world, he has had the longest reign of any being put to screen. His latest, Godzilla Minus One, sees director Takashi Yamazaki taking the King of the Monsters back to his roots and offering him the chance to smash his way to new heights. Though always a destructive force, this film is the one that sees him being unleashed in new ways. Nothing and no one is safe from his destructive force as he becomes his own all-consuming being in one of the most thrilling takes on the character in recent memory.  Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb.  This isn’t to diminish some of the other recent efforts, as both the surprisingly engaging series Monarch: Legacy of Monsters and the spectacular film Shin Godzilla have felt refreshing. In fact, Godzilla Minus One feels like it exists in the middle of the two, both in thematic interest and in quality. It is better than Monarch: Legacy of Monsters in that it doesn’t get too caught up in clunky narrative developments while not quite reaching the heights of something like Shin Godzilla. It ends up having more sweeping spectacle and tense action while also gesturing towards the more complicated themes of the latter as it grapples with the immense destruction of war. Whether you want to read it as a metaphor for immense loss or just get swept up in its thrills as a solid monster movie, Godzilla Minus Onehardly ever makes a wrong step, even as these are mighty big feet it is working with. The King has truly returned.   First picking up in 1945 Japan at the end of World War II, this all begins with the troubled young Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who is a pilot making what he says is an emergency landing. Of course, after doing so, he discovers that there is a being on this island that soon attacks him and the soldiers there. The more dinosaur-like creature is initially quite small, at least relative to how we expect Godzilla to normally be, but the military is still no match for him as he gobbles them up. It is a bit of a shaky start, as the early design of this creature feels a little too reminiscent of elements of the disastrous 1988 American film, but it still settles in much better because of the commitment to the effects that will only grow more consistently incredible throughout the film. In this opening, everyone is killed, save for Shikishima and the lead mechanic, Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), who must then try to rebuild their lives over the next couple of years in the aftermath of postwar Tokyo.   What is often already dire gets much worse when the United States conducts nuclear tests that mutate this being into a gargantuan Godzilla, leaving the people of Japan to come together to fight off the monster or be obliterated forever. While very much about history and the loss of war, it is grounded in people rather than being about how great the government is, as one character remarks that there is no one there who “will take responsibility for the chaos.” Though not a robust criticism by any means, as it skirts around some of the more troubling aspects of its history, it still offers up a slight dose of cynicism to chew on.   There is then an element of personal redemption at stake for Shikishima, just as there is an existential threat bearing down on all of them. He first begins working as a minesweeper with an eccentric crew that will then come face-to-boat with Godzilla. It makes for one of the most understated yet still tense sequences, as they must survive in their rather rinky-dink vessel that could easily make for a nice snack for the monster. This is merely the beginning of the outstanding visual effects that are not only impressive in terms of their spectacle but also in how they are deployed. Just seeing Godzilla swimming in pursuit of the boat is as stunning as it is sinister. It feels more like a scene from Jaws than it does an enormous monster movie. However, that makes it all the more effective as it gets more expansive with all that follows.   Though Godzilla Minus One isn’t afraid of showing Godzilla in all his glory, it also doesn’t go all out right away and instead patiently builds up the looming threat that he represents. The moment where they think they’ve defeated the creature, only to see how quickly it regenerates, is perfectly played as a grim stomach-drop of a moment. It’s the type of film that leans into being a hopeful crowd-pleaser, frequently in a way that undercuts its emotional moments, but the craft behind it remains magnificent. Godzilla Plus One is a film that showcases the art in the often undervalued work of VFX artists. They are as much a key to this film as anything.   Every sequence with Godzilla, while often sparing, as is a common complaint of the series that will likely arise with this one, hits hard for those patient enough for them. You feel every thundering step crashing into the ground as he makes his way through a crowded city that is struck with terrifying awe when he begins to build up his explosive power. The film isn’t quite as strong without him, feeling a bit lost in the middle and in some elements of the end, though the monster at the core is enough of the main attraction to smooth over any such flaws. When it all comes down to it and the door potentially left open for more, Godzilla Minus One more than carves out its place among the best entries of this long-running series. Whatever comes next for this refreshingly unique incarnation of the creature and his seemingly insatiable hunger for destruction, one can be glad this beautiful behemoth rose up once more.

"Nov 27, 2023",POSITIVE," Nearly 70 years and more than 35 films into the series, it’s a testament to the enduring appeal of a skyscraper-sized lizard that Godzilla movies can still surprise you. He may not be the most flexible nuclear-powered dinosaur, but the concept is undeniably malleable. In this century alone, we’ve seen Big G square up against an alien race of Xilians in Godzilla: Final Wars and inspire the Kafaka-esque satire of Shin Godzilla. Whatever genre perches itself on  Godzilla’s spiky spine will be well cared for, which helps explain the veritable Godzilla renaissance we find ourselves in. Godzilla Minus One, the latest in Toho Studio’s “Reiwa” era, returns Godzilla to his origins and provides a fresh take on a kaiju assaulting Tokyo. Amid a host of American “Monsterverse” films and streaming shows and the three anime Godzilla features preceding it, the quadragenarian King of the Monsters stands tall in his latest, a postwar melodrama punctuated by the series’ most thrilling monster attacks yet.  Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, Godzilla Minus One is simultaneously classical and experimental. Set between the tail-end and immediate aftermath of World War II, the film finds common threads between the past and present, harnessing Godzilla’s allegorical might for a story about survivor guilt, COVID-era political disillusionment, and, ultimately, human triumph. It’s also the rare Godzilla film where the humans are as compelling as its star.  Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot experiencing second thoughts, first meets Godzilla after failing his one suicidal mission. His guilt drives the film as he attempts to rebuild his life as a sea-based minesweeper living in the slums of Tokyo while his neighbors label him a deserter and a coward. Due to his shame, Shikishima further alienates himself by rejecting the love of his female companion, Noriko (Minami Hamabe), and her unspeakably adorable daughter, Akiko (Saki Nagatani). Making a beeline from the narrow government focus of Shin Godzilla, Shikishima joins a citizen-led effort to quell the beast and heal his trauma. Yamazaki’s austere postwar melodrama plays surprisingly well with the monster. Godzilla has rarely looked or sounded better than he does here against the striking 1940s aesthetic. Generally defined by bulky rubber suits, it is often difficult to see the monster’s genuine threat. Yet, Godzilla’s power has never felt so immediate than in this approximation of postwar Tokyo.  One could pull Godzilla out of the movie and still be left with a solid World War II drama, but you wouldn’t want to. Taking cues from American blockbusters like Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Dunkirk, Yamazaki’s varied action sequences, encompassing planes, trains, and tugboats, capture the tremendous power of Godzilla’s size and strength and the absolute terror on the ground. The monster’s deafening roars and jagged teeth tear through the film with a fury more terrifying than the 70-year-old beast has ever been. Equally effective are the close-ups of the hordes of people rushing away from his nuclear beams, providing a solid rebuttal to the horror Oppenheimer teased earlier this year.  The humans carry Godzilla Minus One toward a finale that’s  a hair too crowd-pleasing by half. Star Ryunosuke Kamiki invests fully in Shikishima’s trauma in a story arc more reminiscent of Hal Ashby’s Coming Home than All Monsters Attack. Yamazaki’s script finds a surprising number of ways to play off Shikshima’s guilt, transferring his conflicting feelings of militaristic failure to his inability to kill Godzilla when he had the chance. Meanwhile, a Godzilla is ruining Noriko’s first day at work in a runaway railcar sequence that makes 2014’s Godzilla look like Nintendo 64’s Gex: Enter The Gecko. When Godzilla tears through Tokyo in the film’s most relentlessly terrifying, most showstopping sequence, the two plots fuse into a unified whole,  grafting Shikishima’s political woes to Yamazaki’s feelings of government abandonment during the pandemic.  Godzilla Minus One does what all the best Godzillas strive for, successfully using Godzilla as a foundation for robust storytelling. With drama as compelling as the action, the film proudly breathes its nuclear breath so the audience can feel the heat. The old tropes, now the stuff of tired parody, return with renewed power here as Yamazaki finds the humanist message amid the rubble of a destroyed Tokyo. Godzilla Minus One might be as good as Godzilla films can be, which is to say, there’s still a lot of life left in this lizard."
"Nov 26, 2023",NEGATIVE," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzThe aesthetic period piece Japanese sci-fi monster blockbuster is a rousing spectacle, challenging the 2016 Shin Godzilla for best Godzilla sequel (the first live-action one since the 2016 film). It begins where the 1954 Japanese filmmaker Honda Ishiro’s Godzilla ends. And its thoughtfully written and directed with taste and political acumen by the outstanding Japanese filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki (“The Fighter Pilot”/”Always: Sunset on Third Street”). It delights as melodrama (except for a few lapses) and is special as a work of romanticized history.The throwback film is a crowd-pleasing one, capturing the same spirit as the debut film. At a budget of only 15 million dollars it can’t compete with the CGIs of the blg budget MonsterVerse Godzilla films. But I enjoyed the visuals, especially the one where Godzilla uses his teeth to lift a commuter train off the tracks.We note on Gojira’s 70th anniversary that there were 33 Toho Studio sequels plus 4 others made by other studios, giving it a grand total of 37.One of the important things to note in this film is that ‘Gojira’ was originally a dinosaur but mutated into an atomic-powered giant monster lizard because of nuclear bomb tests in the Pacific.In Japan’s post-World War II period, the ex-kamikaze pilot, the grim Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), seeks redemption with Godzilla after his bad encounter with the beast just before the war ended and he still wants revenge instead of just gettng on with his life.In the summer of 1945 Kōichi makes an emergency landing on Odo Island (a fictional place). The mechanic Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) thinks the pilot has given up on the lost war and fakes engine trouble to get out of flight duty because he is just looking to survive. While the men are standing around, a fierce giant monster attacks and crushes the airport buildings and swallows the soldiers stationed at the outpost.Two years pass and the guilt-ridden war survivor, Koichi, attempts to rebuild his life and help rebuild his country, while living in the rubble of post-war Tokyo, in his old neighborhood. Koichi suffers from PTSD, and lives with a caring woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who previously adopted an orphan girl, Akiko (Saki Nakatani). Koichi finds work on an old wooden boat as a minesweeper, cleaning the ocean floor, and relates well to some of his eccentric ex-servicemen neighbors: Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), a.k.a. Doc, the nerdy techie; Seiji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), a.k.a. The Captain; and Shirō Mizushima (Yuki Yamada), a.k.a. The Kid.These neighborhood scenes show how the determined Japanese people are overcoming their losses by working hard and building powerful relationships through their community gatherings, but only a few of them are like Koichi still willing to die for their country if it’s threatened.The country is threatened by the radioactive monster Godzilla, now bigger and fiercer then ever, and armed with radioactive scales, who in Tokyo threatens to annihilate the population, as things are bleak with no government or army help. So it’s up to the civilians to figure out how to save their ass.That Koichi and his pals have figured out a ridiculously ingenuous way to attack the monster with a delivery system from an airplane containing a cocktail of chemicals with a Freon base, makes the film that much more exciting–even if the monster can never be completely vanquished and we will always have to deal with its traumatic effects no matter what. Yamazaki intelligently interjects an anti-war message in the narrative by showing the destructive monster is a product of nuclear testing and the world’s war-like mentality. His messaging goes seamlessly with its spirited narrative and compelling character study and set-piece Godzilla sightings. During its tense emotional moments, there’s just the right humor to keep things light. While its social commentary is even-handed: as it critiques the Japanese Imperialists Army for being ruthless in its use of kamikaze pilots and or being untruthful with the people about its war aims. Yamazaki also takes shots at the world powers, the Americans and Soviets, for going nuclear, scaring the world with a Cold War and for being so nationalistic. But he never vilifies America for its postwar control of his country.The film centers on how the civilians must solve the postwar threats in Japan and not rely on either the military or bureaucrats to do it. Yamazaki can be real even when telling a fictional story, and he can do it with the ease of a filmmaker making a B film without camp but with a deep love for his characters. The touching performances by both Kamiki and Hamabe elevated the pop culture film with some impressive dramatic moments, while still keeping it entertaining. But the film relied on the shock and awe confrontations with Godzilla, the indestructible one, as a scary looking monster with a powerful roar, who grabs our attention on the Big Screen and makes us think twice before we can go to the concession stand to get our popcorn."
"Nov 24, 2023",POSITIVE," Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla and its sequels proved we have the technology nowadays to make a convincing, photo-real version of the original kaiju and the cities that he stomps on. With Godzilla Minus One, Japan takes that baton back and runs with it, going full Peter Jackson on the original Gojira by remaking that very first movie of the 33-film series and even setting it in 1945 to preserve the original era that spawned the beast. For the first time in a long time, it’s also a solo Godzilla story, presenting an additional challenge.  While fans are naturally inclined to root for him to smash stuff, he’s the villain again now. That’s an uphill climb for monsters like King Kong and Godzilla, who began their cinematic lives as dangerous threats representing deeper cultural fears, but over the years and many TV reruns became beloved by children who want them to win. Godzilla went on to become Earth’s defender against worse monsters, while Kong became a progressively more tragic figure in each of his reboots. The newest Godzilla represents atomic fears again to a point, but more specifically embodies survivor’s guilt now. He first emerges in smaller form than we’re used to — about the height of a Jurassic Park tyrannosaurus — to attack Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosake Kamiki), a would-be kamikaze pilot who has lied about his plane’s mechanical condition in order to land on a repair island rather than die flying. Ordered to shoot the monster with his plane, Koichi freezes up with fear again, leaving all but one of the mechanics to die. He’s shipped home, ashamed as his guilt grows with the body count. So too does Godzilla grow as the reptile gets caught in the Bikini Atoll nuclear test and mutates. In the devastated ruins of a Tokyo flattened by firebombing, Koichi takes in female refugee Noriko Oichi (Minami Hamabe) and the orphaned baby she cares for. As they build a (seemingly platonic) life together, a desperate Koichi takes a job on a boat trawling for undetonated mines. This soon turns out to be a front: scientist Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), who runs the operation, has been apprised of the existence of Godzilla and is actually tasked with slowing his inevitable approach to Tokyo. The lengthy sequence on the boat is like its own mini-movie, specifically Jaws — and not just because Godzilla swims dorsal fins-up. These four men have a bond similar to the three from Spielberg’s shark movie, although this time the traumatized veteran is quite a bit younger.  He’s not the youngest, though. For contrast, one of the four is a young man who never quite got old enough to serve while the war remained ongoing. His disappointment to that effect shows his naivete, but also his ability to think outside the military box. But let’s cut to the chase: of course they don’t prevent Godzilla from getting to Tokyo and giving it the ol’ smashy-smashy. The atomic breath is more symbol-laden this time around — when he fires it at a target, the object that gets hit explodes with a mushroom cloud and a shockwave. It’s not a full-force nuke, judging by the fact that nobody’s skin melts. It is, however, devastating and ruthless. This Godzilla is like honey badger giving no damns. He will kill you, because he is actively malevolent.  Since he’s a little bit smaller than usually depicted (his full-sized mode is a similar height to Roland Emmerich’s 1998 Godzilla in name only), he’s actually scarier, because that scaling down allows the big guy to stare directly at someone or knowingly step on them. Some Godzillas get too huge to relate to, but this one needs to see the prey he’s tormenting. As in most of these movies, there’s a significant second-act stretch where he vanishes from the narrative, but on the whole there’s more monster stuff here than in any other solo Godzilla film. Though the movie never establishes this as literal fact, thematically the one person he can’t kill is Koichi, since he is effectively the embodiment of Koichi’s trauma and every tactic against him (narratively speaking) is bound to fail unless Koichi can beat his fear of failure and embarrassment in survival. Godzilla movies don’t often do the greatest job of making us care for the puny humans, but director Takashi Yamazaki (ironically a special effects guy) puts a lot of work into giving us reasons to root for Koichi’s makeshift family.  You don’t have to be a refugee or veteran to get it. Anyone who has ever “made” a family to replace one lost for any reason can tap into that desire, not to mention they can also understand that people in such circumstances often have a dark cloud they’re trying to leave behind. Said cloud usually isn’t such a literal, living WMD, but such is life in kaiju flicks. While American Godzilla films focus on the monsters as literal characters, Godzilla Minus One has him as a sort of spiritual curse powered by negative emotions, which is a longstanding trope of Japanese folklore and a lot of anime. It’s inherently digging deeper than the films that focus on monster fights like they’re a WWE main event. There’s a major populist streak here, too, as the men — they’re all men — who come together to fight Godzilla do so without sanction from the government, which, in the late 1940s, hardly seemed qualified to protect Japan from anything. At the risk of a vague spoiler, there’s one plot point that’s mildly troublesome, and a lose-lose proposition. Played one way, it risks being a misogynist cliche; played the other, it arguably undercuts some of the jeopardy. Viewers who wholly give themselves over to the emotion and Koichi’s trauma battle likely won’t mind, but on an intellectual level, it’s a little frustrating. Nitpicking intellectual points in a Godzilla movie, however, sounds silly even as I write it, though it’s a testament to where this one ranks in the kaiju pantheon that it actually makes the viewer think about themes and characters. Shin Godzilla was arguably the best in the series until now. Minus One is at least equally good in different ways. It can’t have the same groundbreaking impact the very first Gojira did, but it echoes it in ways very few successors have even approached. Luke Y. Thompson has been a professional film critic since 1999, and part of the toy blogging community since the aughts. He was the first blogger to cover Comic-Con panel by panel for a major trade publication, and has several LA Press Club awards and honorable mentions, including one for reviewing fast food."
"Nov 23, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One begins at the end. It is 1945, Japan’s wartime defeat is now a foregone conclusion and, whether out of fear, or perhaps in obedience of his parents’ injunction to live, pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) aborts his final flight as a kamikaze. He heads to the aeronautical base on Odo Island, where he claims that his plane was malfunctioning – even though the head engineer Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) can see that it is in good working order. Shortly after a dinosaur-like creature, known to locals as Godzilla, emerges from the water. Only Shikishima’s plane is equipped with heavy artillery, but when the moment comes to fire on Godzilla, the terrified pilot freezes – and the monster, unchecked, kills every soldier there except Shikishima and Tachibana. Shikishima returns to a Tokyo that has been fire-bombed to near oblivion, and finds his parents dead. Left with nothing but the ruins of his old house, he takes in the homeless Noriko (Minami Hamane) who herself has adopted an orphaned baby girl, and together, with help from the neighbour Sumiko (Sakura Ando), these three form a tentative family unit. The monster of the past, however, will soon resurface, much larger and newly irradiated in the wake of the first US nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1946, to wreak further havoc upon these already fragile lives, as they attempt to redefine themselves. These are the two contradictory poles that lend Godzilla Minus One its principal tension. On the one hand, there is the impulse to rebuild, to forge new connections, to live again and to embrace the hope of a better future, while on the other hand there is the deep trauma, the survivor’s guilt and the desire for revenge that keep characters like Shikishima unable fully to let go of their past or to consider their war over. Ashamed at his failure either to fulfil a suicide mission or to save others around him, Shikishima is so fixated on the death which he feels is his due that he agrees to take on dangerous mine-clearing work with fellow veterans Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka) and Yōji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki) and young wannabe warrior Shirō Mizushima (Yuki Yamada). Several times Shikishima will even wonder aloud to Noriko whether he is really still alive or just a dead soldier’s haunted ghost. His undead status reflects the state of a nation struggling to emerge, dazed and zombie-like, from the mass graveyards of war – and here Godzilla both instantiates Shikishima’s nightmarish (self-)destructive fantasies, and also offers him and other ex-soldiers a chance at redemption and making good on past failures. This time, Shikishima and his comrades are facing the enemy of their own free will, and, in a new ideology that radically breaks from Japan’s recent Imperialist past, choosing life over death. The subtitle Minus One comes with multiple resonances. For this is a prequel of sorts, set some years before Ishirō Honda’s original Godzilla (1954) while inventively recreating several of that film’s key scenes (Odo Island, the news crew filming a rampage, Godzilla’s attack on a train and naval vessels) while showing them from radically different perspectives. Yet the title also refers to the Ground Zero left by America’s air raids on Tokyo, not to mention the nuclear annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, repeated by Godzilla’s destructive onslaughts which take the city back even further. The ‘Zero’ was also, of course, the nickname of the fighter aircraft favoured for kamikaze missions. These characters who only want to move on from their country’s devastation instead keep being taken back to less than zero by a monstrous force that will not allow them the peace that they crave."
"Nov 22, 2023",POSITIVE," Maybe it's because of the strike-related delays, but this fall movie season has so far lacked a true standout blockbuster. In general, the arthouse films and Oscar bait have been strong and the few big mainstream releases have generally been ... fine. Okay. Mediocre at worst, pretty good at best, but little to get super excited over. ""The Marvels""? It's fine. ""Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes""? It's fine. ""Napoleon,"" ""Wish,"" ""Trolls Band Together""? Haven't seen them, but I'm not super interested based on the general reception. The big Thanksgiving releases have mostly been hovering in the 50s and 60s on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, some attracting more appreciation or disappointment than others, but there's not a single ""Barbenheimer"" among them. To the rescue comes ""Godzilla Minus One,"" the exact sort of scary, inspiring, super entertaining large-scale popcorn movie we've been missing this season. If Americans are willing to read subtitles in the movie theater, this should be a massive hit. The first live-action Japanese ""Godzilla"" film in seven years since 2016's ""Shin Godzilla,"" it easily clears the American ""MonsterVerse"" movies. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, whose resume is equally split between World War II dramas and popular anime franchises, ""Minus One"" returns the King of the Monsters to Ishirō Honda's original intention, representing the horrors of war and the atomic bomb. And unlike in a lot of weaker kaiju films, the human elements work just as well as the monster scenes. 
The main character this time around is Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a pilot who backs out of a deadly kamikaze mission in the final days of World War II, hiding on an island repair station under the fake excuse of a faulty plane. He wants to live but has nonetheless internalized the belief he's a coward for doing so — a survivor's guilt that only grows after barely surviving a rampage by a pre-nuclear Godzilla.





When Kōichi returns home to Tokyo after the war, everything is in shambles. Japan is at its lowest point — and then a few years later, America's bomb tests in the Bikini Atoll turn Godzilla nuclear, resulting in the title's threat of Japan going from ""zero"" to ""minus one."" America refuses to do anything about the monster due to Cold War tensions with the USSR, and Japan doesn't have its own military anymore for obvious reasons, so the mission of neutralizing the threat goes to a ragtag team of civilians, mostly veterans seeking some form of purpose. Though Kōichi has formed a makeshift family with a kind woman (Minami Hamabe) and a war orphan child, he's nonetheless preparing to lay down the life he feels he doesn't deserve in order to defeat Godzilla.





Much of the action in the film is set at sea, and the rapport between the characters positively evokes the original ""Jaws."" The nautical sequences showcase the film's strongest action and visual effects work. Godzilla himself is well-designed as an imposing force of seemingly unstoppable destruction. The kaiju is sometimes subject to inconsistent CG-rendering quality, but perfect special effects have never been this franchise's forte. Considering the budget for this was only $15 million – a tiny fraction of the American ""Godzilla"" movies' budgets — this is some impressive work.

Takashi Yamazaki's approach to ""Godzilla Minus One"" is similar to Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi's approach to ""Shin Godzilla"" in terms of treating Godzilla as a source of horror akin to the original 1954 film. In most other ways, however, the two most recent Japanese ""Godzilla"" films are wildly different. Anno and Higuchi's masterstroke was to translate the horror of the concept to the present day and to counterbalance it with hyper-stylized satire, using the Fukushima disaster as a blueprint for how the modern Japanese government would deal with a kaiju attack. As a period piece covering more well-trod ground, ""Minus One"" doesn't have the same creative vitality but makes up for that with strong execution. It's ""Godzilla"" as a ""dad movie,"" more or less, but it's a damn good one.





How the film covers its period setting will surely inspire discussion — one I'm perhaps not best equipped to actively partake in but sure am interested in listening to. Certainly, anyone who criticized ""Oppenheimer"" for not showing Japanese perspectives on the bombings owes it to themselves to see this movie, which is all about post-war Japanese civilian points of view. The film's relationship with nationalism and militarism feels complicated: the Japanese imperial government is strongly condemned for its devaluing of human life, but the imperial army's soldiers nonetheless get a chance at redemption by reapplying their skills to more positive ends.
Yamazaki's historical films have caused controversy in the past, and I'm not enough of an expert on the current Japanese political situation to say how ""Godzilla Minus One"" will play politically. What I can say is that this story of optimistic redemption against impossible odds plays super effectively on the levels of drama and entertainment. At the press screening I attended, the audience was screaming in the film's darkest moments and cheering at the most victorious ones — and keep in mind, this was a press screening for critics. This is gonna be a crowdpleaser.

"Nov 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"  Godzilla Minus One challenges as the best film of the storied kaiju franchise. Writer/director Takashi Yamazaki delivers a monster attack masterpiece that transcends the genre with powerfully emotional themes. A psychologically wounded protagonist returns to a devastated Japan after the horrors of World War II. Survivors cling to life in the ruins while trying to make sense of their country's heinous actions. This reckoning of sins unleashes a new terror emboldened by the dawn of the nuclear age. Heroes rise to the occasion in thrilling defiance of seemingly insurmountable odds. They discover an embrace of community that shines a light towards a hopeful future.   In 1945, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) lands his fighter at a remote naval station on Odo Island. Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), the lead mechanic, can find nothing wrong with the plane. A tortured Shikishima admits to losing his nerve. He couldn't take his own life as a weapon of war. Tachibana doesn't admonish his failure as their conversation is interrupted by a strange sight on the beach. Fish bubble to the surface as something ominously swims towards them.   Weeks later, a shaken Shikishima returns to his shambled home in Tokyo. His neighbor, Sumiko (Sakura Ando), curses him for cowardice when he asks about his parents. They're dead, including her children. She has nothing left but despair. Shikishima roams the streets in a daze until a startling twist of fate. Noriko (Minami Hamabe) thrusts an infant into his arms as she's being chased. The bewildered Shikishima holds the baby girl for hours. He finally gets up to move as Noriko comes forward. She had been watching the whole time. Why did he not abandon the child?   A year later, Shikishima, Noriko, and little Akiko have stayed together, their fledgling family unit a result of pure circumstance. Noriko wonders why Shikishima screams at night. What burden does he bear? Shikishima refuses to admit his shame or the monstrous creature that reinforced it. He decides to accept a dangerous job. Akiko will die of malnutrition otherwise. His life means nothing.   The Shinsei Maru has been contracted to clear hundreds of ocean mines. The wooden ship won't attract magnetic bombs. Captain Yōji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), a former weapons specialist, and the eager Shirō Mizushima (Yuki Yamada) are happy to have an ace pilot aboard. Shikishima quickly proves his worth as a gunner. But his hopes for some semblance of peace are dashed when deep sea fish appear in the water around the boat.   Godzilla Minus One keeps the classic origin story but takes the narrative in a completely unexpected direction. Shikishima, played superbly by Kamiki in a gut-wrenching performance, is crippled by PTSD. Noriko asks, ""When will your war end?"" He cannot move on from his tortured past, but unintentionally inspires others by acts of kindness. Everyone he encounters can see a good man underneath the wreckage. Captain Akitsu and Noda repeatedly try to motivate their dear friend. He has been given a chance with a good woman and a precious child. The demons that haunt him must be vanquished. Shikishima's lack of self-worth threatens a flicker of happiness. He finally understands that incredible value as another tragedy looms.   Yamazaki, a lauded filmmaker with multiple Japanese Academy Awards nominations, frames Godzilla Minus One in the right context. Scenes of hungry, battered people walking wide-eyed around a destroyed Tokyo reflect somber truths. An awful price has been paid for their country's flawed ambitions and the Americans' atom bombs. Noda curses those that led them to doom in a searing monologue. Their lives are not worthless. They will no longer be sent to the slaughter. The battle against Godzilla requires a unity of purpose beyond ideology and nationalism. A new culture must be created to cherish peace.   The film's superb dramatic arc means nothing if the monster element isn't absolutely terrifying. Godzilla is an ass-kicking hurricane of epic destruction. The snarling beast chomps the hapless fleeing, and then flings their severed bodies wildly in the air. Crowds are stomped to a pulp as buildings crumble under unstoppable wrath. Its nuclear-fueled heat ray creates a mushroom cloud blast that incinerates and literally blows away anything still standing in a stupefying shockwave. It's undeniable that Godzilla has never been more frightening and ferocious. Fans are going to lose their minds.   Godzilla Minus One obliterates expectations. There's nothing campy, frivolous, or contrived here. You genuinely care for the engaging ensemble as they face annihilation from an indiscriminate killer. Cheers and tears abound in a riveting cinematic experience. Hollywood, take note. Yamazaki teaches a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking.   Godzilla Minus One is a production of Toho Studios and Robot Communications Inc. The film was screened in New York at a special presentation by the Japan Society.

"Nov 22, 2023",POSITIVE," 
	With an emotionally engaging storyline and plenty of city-stomping, heat-ray-breathing action, the first live-action Godzilla from Japan since 'Shin Godzilla' marks a high point in the long-running series. 
	Chief among the film’s everyday heroes is Koichi Shikishima (Ryonosuke Kamiki), whom we first meet as a kamikaze pilot in the war’s final days. Pretending to have engine trouble, Koichi puts in for repairs on the fictional island of Odo. No sooner has his charade been uncovered than Godzilla emerges from the depths and wipes out everyone except Koichi and the garrison’s chief mechanic, Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki). 
	Having frozen at the moment he might have been able to save the men and destroy the creature, Koichi returns to civilian life with survivor guilt and PTSD that registers powerfully thanks to Kamiki’s fully committed performance. It is interesting to compare Koichi with the central character of Yamazaki’s 2013 smash hit “The Eternal Zero,” about a kamikaze pilot torn between dying gloriously for the Emperor and wanting to survive for his family. The message here that kamikaze pilots who survived deserve to bear neither shame nor guilt will resonate strongly with modern audiences. 
	In the rubble and despair of Tokyo, which looks like Godzilla has already trampled it, Koichi meets Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a young woman who has taken an orphaned baby girl, Akiko, into her care. Helped by kindly neighbor Sumiko (Sakura Ando), the couple make a home together out of necessity, but romance is not part of the equation until deep into the proceedings. The screenplay wisely decides that survival is all that initially matters in long and dark days that begin to look brighter when Koichi lands a job on a mine-sweeping boat. In the lull before Godzilla inevitably reappears, there’s enjoyable, crowd-pleasing camaraderie between Koichi and an appealing crew of ex-servicemen, including gruff captain Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki) and Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), a nerdy former navy tech genius. 
	Such slightly better times naturally don’t last long. Courtesy of U.S. Bikini Atoll nuclear tests, a much larger and angrier Godzilla — replete with all-new, radiation charged retractable spiked scales — awakens and makes a beeline for Tokyo. With Japan’s defense forces no longer standing and the U.S. too preoccupied by Soviet military maneuvers to offer any help, it’s nothing more than a stroll in the park for Godzilla to destroy large parts of the city and become the monstrous embodiment Japanese post-war trauma. That theme plays out strongly in scenes of citizens hurriedly gathering to discuss plans to avert annihilation.  
	It is completely unnecessary though amusing nonetheless for the film to conclude with a shot suggesting — shock, horror — that Godzilla might not be vanquished after all. If we want to entertain the thought of anything being certain in this world, surely it’s the ability of this giant radioactive lizard to rise up and stomp another day."
"Nov 22, 2023",NEGATIVE," There is no fictional character whose resume can match the King of the Monsters. Over the course of 70 years and 37 films (and counting), Godzilla went from laying waste to human civilization to drop kicking insect creatures, from embodying the fear of nuclear holocaust to representing the pride of a nation on the world stage. Ask a group of Godzilla fans about their favorite movie in the franchise and you would get different answers – maybe it’s the one where Godzilla does a victory dance in space (Invasion of Astro-Monster) or the one where he uses his atomic breath to propel himself into the air to fly (Godzilla vs. Hedorah). Even Legendary’s take on the monster has been an overall success in my eye. I admired Gareth Edwards’ restrained approach with the 2014 Godzilla and I had the biggest grin on my face throughout most of Godzilla vs. Kong. Of the many American attempts at bringing Godzilla onto the big screen, Adam Wingard understood how to make a monster rumble. But a new Godzilla movie from Japan will always spark my interest. Toho has reinvented this character time and time again. It is the place to go to find a new interpretation of this cinematic icon. After all, the last Godzilla movie made by Toho (2016’s Shin Godzilla) won Best Picture at the Japan Academy. Rightfully so, as I have expressed in great detail why Shin Godzilla is the best of the franchise since the 1954 original. In the case of Godzilla Minus One, writer and director Takashi Yamazaki is less interested in a sophisticated deconstruction of government. If Hideaki Anno tackles bureaucratic red tape in Shin Godzilla like it’s Dr. Strangelove, Yamazaki delivers Godzilla Minus One like it’s Japan’s Dunkirk – centering on a few human characters through a war/action movie, with Godzilla on the side. The biggest departure for Minus One is the decision to have the story take place immediately after the events of WWII, in a clear throwback to the original 1954 classic. But instead of having its cast of characters come from the Japanese government, the script instead rallies around a group of veterans and private citizens who are combating their trauma during the war. Ryunosuke Kamiki is excellent as the lead protagonist Kōichi Shikishima, a runaway kamikaze pilot struggling with his survivor’s guilt and the abandoning of his post. Most importantly, the film takes its time for us to get to know the human characters, as multiple title cards show the years pass and Shikishima attempts to rebuild a life with a group of survivors. It’s even telling for this kind of movie that Shikishima’s job after the war is to join a minesweeper crew to “clean the ocean” and be rid of any remnants of the war. Though the human drama is much appreciated, it does occasionally stumble. A line of dialogue can seem too on-the-nose or a particular performance can feel a bit too theatrical that the film can start to feel like a soap opera at times. Thankfully, not only does the script fully commit to these emotional moments, but Yamazaki even finds clever ways to tie them back to a grand central message in the story, with some satisfying surprises and payoffs along the way. Connecting all of this drama together is the looming cloud of fear and trauma, and that’s where Godzilla comes in. Fans will find countless things to point to and admire about Godzilla’s design here. His classic roar from the 1954 original film is largely kept here, and his overall appearance feels like a clear throwback to his look in the Heisei Era (specifically the films from 1984-1995). He thunders ahead slowly, indestructible as always, but with some extra work done to his eyes, Godzilla just seems more expressive and mean this time. For the traditional rubber suit fans, he may be fully CGI (there’s a couple shots where he’s a tad weightless) but he retains that “big bully” energy here. It’s a grand return to form, especially for audiences who struggle with Shin Godzilla’s mutated grotesque look. Though Godzilla Minus One is clearly a much less sophisticated film, it has a lot on its mind and it wears its heart on its sleeve. It jumps back and forth between being grim and solemn over the mass casualties while still feeling natural in the more humorous moments, thanks to some much-needed human camaraderie or some good ol’ dramatic irony. Most Godzilla movies struggle with their human cast, but the human characters this time around are not only likable, they’re memorable and well-acted. Where Shin Godzilla excelled was having its protagonist be the country of Japan, as it critiques every nook and cranny of its bureaucratic government while laying out the groundwork on how it can do better, so Japan can rebuild and stand with pride. Godzilla Minus One takes the opposite approach, acting as the perfect companion piece. By keeping itself firmly grounded to just veterans and private citizens who have experienced great loss during the war, the film speaks of the government as an apathetic entity. Characters talk about how human life was never valued during the war – tanks were designed with poor armor, planes had no ejection seats, and pilots were ordered to fight with kamikaze tactics, just like our protagonist Shikishima. As melodramatic as it is, Godzilla Minus One is powerful at the right moments, when we see normal citizens rally together to fight Godzilla. It’s not about national pride, or fighting one last battle because the war was lost. It’s about ensuring there is a better tomorrow for the next generation. All of that comes together in a heart-pumping third act that will put a lot of smiles on people’s faces. The iconic theme from Akira Ifukube is thoughtfully used, the visual effects and destruction sequences are jaw-dropping, whether it is Godzilla’s tail “accidentally” destroying a building as he turns around or Godzilla tossing a ship into the mainland like it’s a toy. But nothing will prepare you for his atomic breath. For Godzilla’s most famous and most destructive ability, his atomic heat beam is beautifully realized – the cinematography and deafening sound will take your breath away. Even when this is the nth time we’ve seen a Godzilla movie, the presentation makes it feel new, providing a genuine sense of danger and suspense. Godzilla has been the King of the Monsters for 70 years now. Whether you love him as a metaphor for nuclear destruction or as Japan’s tourism ambassador, his versatility is his greatest strength. With Godzilla Minus One, I am happy to report that the franchise is still alive and well. Long live the King, and may his reign continue."
"Nov 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A rousing&#44; exhilarating and crowd-pleasing spectacle with just the right amount of action&#44; suspense&#44; humor and heart&#46;
"Nov 15, 2023",POSITIVE," I will admit, my perspective on this film will be heavily skewed. When I asked Toho International about attending a press screening, I was instead invited to the US premiere. It was my first premiere and was a remarkable experience in an unparalleled theater. Despite being the 34th film in a 64-year-old franchise, Godzilla Minus One is neither a sequel nor a prequel. It’s also not connected to Warner Bros. Monsterverse films. It is a reboot, in a new timeline, which makes it an excellent place to start for newcomers and longstanding fans alike. Godzilla Minus One is a period piece as much as it is a Godzilla film and succeeds brilliantly at both. Set in post-WWII Japan, the film is not about the might of world power conquering nature. Instead, it’s about people recovering from war, only to be hit by something even worse. The film is markedly different from the American Monsterverse movies. In America, Godzilla is frequently the hero, fighting to restore balance to the world by killing Kaiju who threatens the natural order. But this film reminds the audience that he is a metaphor for nuclear power, which does not discriminate between right and wrong or balance any natural order. The film notes how the Americans mutate Godzilla and then abandon Japan to deal with the fallout of their actions. It’s an unfortunate but eternally poignant note on how U.S. foreign policy has a history of picking fights and then leaving innocents with the consequences of our actions. Godzilla’s creature design is terrifying and you can see director Takashi Yamazaki’s history of VFX work throughout the film. GMO does not have the budget or scale of the Monsterverse movies, but this Godzilla is arguably the most terrifying version ever put on screen. Godzilla’s tail is used in attacks just as much as his claws or jaws, which makes it feel like he can and will attack from any angle. His spines extend when charging his atomic breath, only to retract at the moment of attack, truly making Godzilla feel like a living weapon. At the same time, much like the shark from Jaws, Godzilla is just as scary when he is offscreen. Yamazaki does a great job of building dread and anticipation for the monster.  As a period piece, the film confronts Japan’s actions during the war, addressing the effect they had on the Japanese people. It notes how the Japanese government prioritized victory at all costs, cheapening lives with poorly armored tanks, no ejection seats on planes, and kamikaze tactics. Due to this cultural history, the film does not frame an unwillingness to die as weakness or cowardice. Instead, it reflects on the value of life when a community is dealing with tragedy after tragedy, aggravated by an apathetic government. The film shows that many Japanese citizens are understandably disillusioned with dying for a country that left them in the lurch after the war. Still, that makes it all the more powerful when people rally, not out of nationalistic pride or duty, but because they want to do the right thing and protect their home. It’s not just veterans and pilots coming back for one last battle. The film sees people defending their friends and families and working for a better tomorrow. There are no small roles or small actors in this film, and you get the feeling that every character is the protagonist of their own story. Forgiveness is another important facet of the film, as the main character, Kōichi Shikishima, deals with his own survivor’s guilt. Ryunosuke Kamiki plays the character brilliantly as a man who wants to move on but is so broken by his guilty conscience that he sabotages his happiness. The film notes that forgiving yourself and others is an important part of the healing process and is vital to survival. Also, while the film is male-dominated, the women are not wallflowers. They are active characters also working to rebuild their lives after the war, clinging to any form of hope they can. The lead actress, Minami Hamabe, portrays an amazing amount of strength and resilience. When her character Noriko makes a decision, she stands by it and will not be swayed from the course of action she knows is right. I won’t spoil anything for you, but trust me when I say that Godzilla Minus One is just the film we need for the complicated, sometimes hopeless times we live in. The film reminds its audience that there is always hope as long as you are willing to fight for a better tomorrow."
"Nov 14, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One is a movie that’s even bigger than its title character. Director Takashi Yamazaki specializes in sweeping crowd-pleasers like this one, and Toho’s 33rd Godzilla picture (and the 37th in the series overall) is a blockbuster in every sense.  Although it was produced for a mere $15 million — less than 10% of the budget for Legendary’s last Monsterverse entry, Godzilla Vs. Kong — Godzilla Minus One looks expensive, making intelligent use of period sets and drone shots whooshing over wide stretches of ocean. Scenes of kaiju-fueled destruction similarly impress: A shot of a gigantic warship flying across the screen like a piece of kindling is worth seeing in IMAX all by itself.  Godzilla Minus One also has the stirring sentiment of an Independence Day movie, complete with rousing speeches. Here, however, the fervor is channeled away from any particular government (this is postwar Japan, after all – moral ambiguity abounds) and into rah-rah populism. The story revolves around an ex-kamikaze pilot, Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), whose encounter with Godzilla in the last days of World War II sets him on a path of vengeance and redemption. We first meet Shikishima making an emergency landing on Odo Island in the summer of 1945. He claims his engine is malfunctioning, but mechanic Sōsaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki) suspects the truth: That Shikishima is shirking his duty. Tachibana is sympathetic — why die for a lost cause? The war will be over soon anyway — but the two men have barely had time to commiserate when a T-Rex-like monster attacks the outpost, crushing makeshift buildings and swallowing soldiers whole. Fast-forward two years, and Shikishima is living amid the rubble of postwar Tokyo with Noriko (Minami Hamabe), a woman he met in the aftermath of a firebomb attack, and their adopted daughter Akiko, to whom neither are related by blood but for whom both would give their lives. The influence of another iconic summer blockbuster – Steven Spielberg’s Jaws – comes into play when Shikishima takes a job as a minesweeper aboard a rickety wooden boat with a familiar crew of eccentrics: Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), a.k.a. Doc; Seiji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), a.k.a. The Captain; and Shirō Mizushima (Yuki Yamada), a.k.a. The Kid.  The crew’s work puts them into contact with government secrets, both American and Japanese. In May 1947, they encounter the wreckage of a ship torn apart by a big, mean something in Tokyo Bay. That something turns out to be Godzilla, blown up to even more monstrous size by American nuclear testing in its South Pacific habitat. In a nod to Yamazaki’s favorite Godzilla movie – and an acknowledged influence on this one – Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, Godzilla returns as the embodiment of Japan’s war trauma and guilt, a metaphor that’s close to the surface here. This theme is also reflected in one of Yamazaki’s innovations for the character of Godzilla: Here, the creature’s atomic breath explodes like an H-bomb on impact, producing a mushroom cloud and an enormous blast radius. Godzilla’s regenerative powers are emphasized as well, using visual effects – supervised by the director himself – that give the creature tactile texture as well as solid, animalistic weight.  Ironically, the one thing that’s smaller than usual in Godzilla Minus One is the king of the kaiju himself. Toho’s last live-action Godzilla movie, Shin Godzilla, introduced the biggest incarnation of Godzilla yet, standing 118.5 meters at full height. (He’s since been dwarfed by his anime counterpart, but that’s another story.) The monster we see here tops out at 50 meters – the height of the 1954 original, the closest analog to this Godzilla in timeline, if not in looks. (The actual design combines elements from the Heisei era of the ‘80s and ‘90s and Legendary’s more recent version of the creature.) As with many Godzilla movies, there could be more Godzilla in Minus One. Instead, the focus is on character development – namely, Shikishima’s arc from wartime coward to kaiju-fighting hero and family man. The film only sags a bit in the middle, between Godzilla-driven set pieces, and overall the mood is much more hopeful than in the cynical Shin Godzilla. There’s more swell, in the score and on the heart strings; there’s less terror and more pride, even (or perhaps especially) while evoking a vulnerable period in Japan’s history. This is a film designed to make audiences stand up and cheer – and when Akira Ifukube’s Godzilla theme kicks in, it’s difficult not to comply. A rousing, spectacle-filled blockbuster, Godzilla: Minus One takes the king of the monsters back to his roots in post-WWII Japan. The story is character-driven, but the monster scenes are exciting and effective."
"Nov 13, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla Minus One is the next big live-action Godzilla film from Toho since Shin Godzilla in 2016, taking the king of the monsters and dropping him into the setting of post-war Japan. Director Takashi Yamazaki was tasked with creating an epic monster film while delivering an engrossing human story starring Ryunosuke Kamiki and Minami Hamabe. The result is the best Godzilla film since the original 1954 film thanks to the compelling story, Godzilla doing what Godzilla does best, wonderful cast, and stunning cinematography. Japan was devastated during World War II, leaving the country with no self-defense force or armaments. To make matters worse, a new threat in the form of a giant dinosaur-like monster has arrived, Godzilla. With little defense, it’s up to the citizens to figure out a way to stop the kaiju from destroying everything in its path. Godzilla is a menace, and this is one of the deadliest versions of the kaiju that has ever graced the screen. His massive size and tough skin are already an obstacle, but his atomic breath is on a whole other scale. The focus is the human story, but when Godzilla appears on the screen, he is shown in all his glory. (He isn’t teased like in 2014’s Godzilla.) The MonsterVerse films (Godzilla vs. Kong, Godzilla: King of the Monsters) focus on Godzilla as a monster that brings balance to the world, Godzilla in Godzilla Minus Zero is a monster focused on destruction and mayhem.  Ryunosuke Kamiki delivers a gripping performance as Koichi Shikishima, a failed kamikaze pilot who is struggling with his past. Minami Hamabe portrays Noriko Oishi, a woman who has adopted an orphaned girl with love and empathy. Together, the two are the anchor of a human story of love, loss and sacrifice. The rest of the cast includes Yuki Yamada as Shiro Mizushima, Munetaka Aoki as Sosaku Tachibana, Hidetaka Yoshioka as Kenji Noda, Sakura Ando as Sumiko Ota and Kuranosuke Sasaki as Seiji Akitsu. They each have their distinct personalities and backgrounds and are a likable and colorful bunch. What makes Godzilla Minus One exceptional is that if the director removed Godzilla from the film, the human story still holds up, making it one of the best human stories in a Godzilla film by far. The setting of post-war Japan gives the filmmakers a chance to explore the Japanese psyche of what it means to help out their fellow countrymen without the aid of the government. In a time that is focused on dying for your country, what happens when you live for your country? Since this is a Godzilla film, whenever the angry giant appears on the screen, he is a force to be reckoned with. There are parts in the film where I was torn between rooting for Godzilla and rooting for the humans. It’s a testament to the writing and directing of Takashi Yamazaki.  The film has a wonderful score, but the one that gets the audience pumped up is the Godzilla theme. It’s used to great effect when the kaiju stomps and destroys everything around him, and it’s the right amount that gave me goosebumps. Godzilla Minus One is truly a human story that digs deep into the Japanese psyche of life and death. Godzilla is a beast and is a spectacle whenever he’s on the screen. Even if you take away the kaiju element, the human story still stands on its own. Godzilla Minus One stomps onto theaters nationwide on December 1st, with Early Access Fan Events Screenings on Wednesday, November 29th in participating premium large format theaters. "
"Nov 12, 2023",POSITIVE," I can’t help but admire Toho’s commitment to backing their iconic Kaiju character in exciting ways. Godzilla Minus One is a triumph in numerous ways, be it the commitment to a more somber tone, the actual scariness of this rampaging monster, or the crowd-pleasing elements that will allow for plenty of cheering in the aisles. Between 1954 and now, it hasn’t always been this way. Even as a massive Godzilla fan, it’s easy to see the range of films and different ideas at play for what was felt to be the most appealing to certain audiences for the time. However, with the character approaching its 70th anniversary and stomping around with legendary status, let alone having to follow up 2016’s 7-time Japan Academy Film Prize winner, Shin Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One is now in the position of having to keep the good faith from the original studio’s investment with this giant movie monster going. Fortunately, this film is a blast and then some. Picking up initially in 1945, we follow Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a reluctant kamikaze pilot who manages to survive a Godzilla attack. A few years later, plagued by survivor’s guilt, Shikishima has built a new life with a woman who has moved in with him (Minami Hamabe), along with an orphaned child whose parents were lost in the bombing of Tokyo during WWII. Working aboard a minesweeper, Shikishima and the crew soon encounter Godzilla, who has grown due to the U.S.’s nuclear tests. Now, with the giant monster set on destroying nearby portions of Tokyo, Shikishima becomes a vital part of the efforts to somehow stop this deadly beast. If it seems strange that some random crew member of a minesweeper would be involved in the plans to stop a rampaging Kaiju, that’s due to the approach to this story from director/writer/visual effects lead Takashi Yamazaki. While Shin Godzilla balanced its kaiju action with amusing bureaucratic satire akin to The Thick of It or Veep, Godzilla Minus One plays out as the Dunkirk of Godzilla movies. This movie focuses on the civilians and underdogs involved in this dire situation and how they come together in the face of immense odds when those at higher levels of the estate choose to look the other way. It all adds to the central conceit of placing this Japanese story immediately in the aftermath of WWII. Much like the original Ishirō Honda classic, this is a film grappling with the lingering trauma of actions taken during the war, let alone the nuclear strikes. Shikishima serves as a terrific central lead in a film that wants to ground the actions taken by humans in some form of reality, even as a massive monster begins destroying everything around it. It becomes all the more serious when Godzilla unleashes its atomic breath and leaves behind an evocative depiction of that level of destruction. Speaking of the power of this Kaiju, Godzilla Minus One also does something I’ve rarely seen in this franchise – it makes Godzilla scary. Sure, the existential threat of this monster plays well in the bleak original film. Even 2001’s GMK: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack supplies a more villainous take on the character, complete with spooky white eyes. For this 2023 depiction, however, it’s an immense monster who can genuinely frighten. Thanks to some skilled editing, the arrival of Godzilla comes as a surprise (there’s at least one Jaws reference in place here) in some instances. The way it causes damage on a small and broad scale equally shows what a threat this creature is. I’d even argue that making Godzilla a bit smaller than we’re used to seeing as of late makes the monster feel even more intense this time around. Add to that various levels of tension surrounding whether its impact will affect certain characters, and you have a film that understands how to make this monster a true terror. There’s actually a good amount of Godzilla featured in this film, with key action set pieces utilized to show off the work done to balance the pretty solid CG visual effects with whatever other practical means were utilized, all while still harkening back to the original look of Suitmation. Arriving with Godzilla are plenty of great uses of production design, sound design, and music to really make his onscreen appearances memorable. Without getting too far into it, any fan of this series will have reason to cheer when they hear some of the choices made to emphasize what’s taking place from both sides of the battle. Plus, for those looking closely enough at what Yamazaki is doing with Godzilla’s various actions, there are references galore to fans throughout. Between the use of Godzilla in this film and the focus on specific characters, it all speaks to what a crowd-pleasing adventure thriller this plays out as. Yes, as a monster movie, it does the things we hope to satisfy. Still, it means even more to see the amount of respect being given to both the monster in question as well as the post-war Japanese population and the inherent struggles that come from how things played out. It’s pushed to a point where the severity of the situation can lead to some awkward cheers, as we surely want to see Godzilla in action but must also realize that massive death tolls being read out on screen are striking and even discouraging to what we initially may have felt we needed to watch. Absent another monster for Godzilla to fight, this is a massive creature causing real harm, making it all the wiser on Yamazaki’s part in how much he limited Godzilla’s time spent on land. With that in mind, as solemn as the subject matter may be at times, the thrills of this film accompany the fun to be had throughout. There’s good camaraderie between the Minesweeper crew, allowing for a good build on the character side of things before everything gets twisted. Given the nature of these movies, I’d argue this film easily does some of the best work in handling the small character beats of all 37 Godzilla films. That comes from having Kamiki involved, who is a Japanese superstar, all things considered. Along with the rest of the cast, more movie star charisma is going around than average, which goes a long way in a film like this. If one is coming for the chaos, Godzilla Minus One has that in spades. For those hoping to get something more out of a Godzilla film, even if this film is coming up a bit short compared to the very ambitious Shin Godzilla, this is still a top-tier entry combining the strengths of the more thematically rich entries with the sheer fun of it all when it comes to scale and wonder. Given the all-in approach Toho appears to be taking with their delivery of modern Godzilla films, it’s exciting to see one that feels so complete in what it has set out to do, which speaks even more to why this signature Japanese icon continues to be the king of the monsters."
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE," Godzilla is a character that has stood the test of time. Reimagined in all sorts of ways, it has adapted and transformed over the course of 70 years to change with the world its audience lives in. For us here in the States, we’ve spent the past decade with the MonsterVerse, which, admittedly, has failed to capture the right balance between the human elements within a kaiju story so that it can stand on its own two feet. In Toho Studios’ latest Godzilla venture, Godzilla Minus One, we are reminded of what has long been missing in our kaiju fare here: soul. In Godzilla Minus One, we meet Kōichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who has deserted his post to fix his faulty plane. This decision throws him face to face with a pre-suped-up Godzilla, but the legendary creature’s impact is undeniable. He survives the attack but is forever changed. The survivor’s guilt eats him alive. Reinforced by soldiers, civilians, or his own demons, the war is still going on for Shikishima as the years go by. Now, in 1948, just when Shikishima’s ready to permit himself to let go and allow himself to live again, Godzilla has returned and has more power than ever before. While Godzilla is the hook, the character Shikishima and those around him keep us invested. Their struggles, their sorrow, and their pain are all tangible. Whether as cannon fodder in a war none of them thought they could win or civilian casualties written off by governmental bodies, these everyday people are the heart and soul of this film. All of them are trying to find some sense of normalcy after the war’s closure, but when Godzilla emerges from the oceanic depths, they are faced with the remnants of their lived history. In some ways, it can be argued that Godzilla is representative of the past. There’s the obviousness of the prehistoric design it’s carried throughout the multiple incarnations it has shifted into. But, in Godzilla Minus One, its looming presence takes the citizens of Japan back to war. Having just barely crawled out of the wreckage left behind in the aftermath, everyone is stumbling along to move on. With the newly mutated Godzilla, its evolution propelled by the United States’ Bikini Atoll Operation Crossroads nuclear tests (with the region suffering from the long-term effects to this day), the war still exists in the hearts of the soldiers who returned from the front. They must either confront this beast or leave behind a restless, painful future for the next generation. Directed, written, and with visual effects by Takashi Yamazaki, Godzilla Minus One is a love letter to the kaiju we all know and love. But it also serves as a testament to Yamazaki’s skill and attention to detail that the film is so successful. The rendering and execution of the titular creature is nothing short of breathtaking. The detail of the scales, the texture of the skin, and how the body changes when dealt damage show how meticulous Yamazaki and his team are. Running at just over 2 hours long, you’d think that the film would struggle with pacing, but it doesn’t. Instead, by focusing time on developing our characters’ internal struggles, building out their family, their motivations, and their characters, and then tying them to the incoming threat of Godzilla, Yamazaki can successfully keep things moving along at the right speed. Never once was there a dull moment, and that’s saying a lot. Tonally, Yamazaki strikes a balance between heartfelt, comedic, and serious without sentiments feeling out of place. Part of this is achieved through the dialogue itself and the delivery given. Oscillating between the different tones helps again with that pacing, but also keeps things from being bogged down. Given the serious nature of World War II and its subsequent aftermath for Japan, that balance is even more impressive. Part of this would not be possible without the impeccably dedicated cast. As the protagonist, Ryunosuke Kamiki portrays the complexities of survivor’s guilt and PTSD with care. He wears Shikishima’s guilt heavily but, as he stands the risk of losing everything, seeing the emotions shift in his eyes and in his body language show how truly skilled his acting is. There isn’t much time spent with Noriko but, as the light combatting Shikishima’s darkness, Minami Hamabe provides that contrast to Kamiki’s performance. Noriko is ready to move on from the war, even after what she’s witnessed, but understands the pain that has its hold on Shikishima. If there is a sequel, more time spent on Noriko would be nice. She felt the most underserved character in this. Taking her place is Shikishima’s support group of found family: Shirō Mizushima (Yuki Yamada), Kenji Noda (Hidetaka Yoshioka), Yōji Akitsu (Kuranosuke Sasaki), and even Sumiko Ōta (Sakura Ando); all of whom get their individual moments to shine.  Through these four actors, we see the various levels of trauma left behind by the war, and particularly through Mizushima, we see the hope and what the future represents. Godzilla Minus One is a reminder to audiences why we fell in love with this kaiju, but also the universe in which it resides. It’s not enough to have flashy monsters just smashing each other to bits. Without the proper balance, the lessons these creatures carry on their scaly backsides can’t be properly conveyed to audiences. In Godzilla Minus One, we are reminded to take courage, to find our motivation to live, and to ultimately persevere against even the most impossible of obstacles. As it stands, Godzilla Minus One will win the hearts of fans everywhere. Not just for Godzilla, but for the human characters within that reminds us why it is important to infuse soul into a kaiju or monster film. If able, viewers should aim to see the film in theaters to capture the full breadth of the sound design, score, and visuals to create that wholly immersive experience.

"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE," Primal terror and psychic wound, Godzilla is brought to ferocious life in writer-director Takashi Yamazaki’s gripping monster movie. Nearly 70 years after the release of the original film, Godzilla Minus One returns the titular beast to its roots as a metaphor for Japan’s postwar anxiety and grief, in the process delivering a stirring spectacle that also contains a palpable emotional undercurrent. Buoyed by impressive effects work supervised by Yamazaki, this confident crowd-pleaser throttles the recent Hollywood remakes, much like Godzilla pulverising another metropolis. Already released in Japan, where it achieved nearly $7m in its opening weekend and broke IMAX records for a live-action film, Godzilla Minus One opens in the US on December 1 and the UK on December 15, hoping to attract genre fans uninterested in the season’s more mainstream fare. (The presence of stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and Minami Hamabe may also provide a commercial boost.) The first Japanese-produced Godzilla picture since 2016’s Shin Godzilla ($78 million worldwide), the film will be competing with the recent Warner Bros. releases Godzilla: King Of The Monsters ($387 million) and Godzilla vs. Kong ($470 million). Expect strong reviews and glowing word-of-mouth. Set in the 1940s in the wake of the Second World War, the picture introduces us to Koichi (Kamiki), a cowardly kamikaze pilot who escaped his destiny by faking a mechanical error in his plane. But with the war over, he faces a new danger when Godzilla attacks, threatening the Asian nation still reeling from death and devastation. Befriending a young woman named Noriko (Hamabe) who, like him, has lost her parents, they jointly raise an abandoned baby, Akiko, while he teams up with scientists and others to defeat this seemingly invincible foe. Veteran blockbuster filmmaker Yamazaki crafts his Godzilla picture with an eye towards ensuring that the action set pieces capture the right amount of awe-inspiring scope. Towering over mere mortals, Godzilla is a remorseless killing machine, its jagged dorsal plates cutting through the water like a shark’s fin – except infinitely more terrifying. With a deafening cry and an ability to blast powerful radiation rays from its mouth, the monster shows no mercy. But Naoki Sato’s booming, mournful orchestral score suggests that Godzilla is a symbol of something greater — the horror and inexplicable agony of the brutal war the Japanese have just endured. This idea, of course, was central to the 1954 Godzilla, released less than a decade after the end of the Second World War, and Yamazaki populates the film with characters who have already suffered so much, barely able to comprehend tackling this frightening monster. Godzilla Minus One exudes an underdog spirit as Koichi and his comrades find inner strength in order to save the day, although this life-or-death battle is about more than defeating Godzilla — indeed, it is a rallying cry for a grieving nation to put the past behind it and fight its way to a brighter future. As is often the case with monster movies, the proceedings lose a little momentum when Yamazaki focuses on the humans. Kamiki and Hamabe, who star together on the Japanese series Ranman, have a likeable rapport, even if their characters are one-dimensional. Koichi is especially cliched as the cowardly pilot who, predictably, will eventually find himself in another dramatic situation in order to prove his bravery. The supporting players are also very much types, although Hidetaka Yoshioka acquits himself well as Noda, the resident genius who will come up with a fairly brilliant plan for toppling Godzilla. Serving as the effects supervisor, Yamazaki produces a suitably fearsome monster. Its eyes penetrating, its movements slow but menacing, this Godzilla is the stuff of nightmares and the filmmaker takes care to limit its appearances on screen so that, when it does make itself known, it’s always arresting. The mushroom-cloud explosions and toppled buildings are compellingly rendered, and that is just when Godzilla is on land — in the ocean, it possesses slinky cunning and unnerving speed, torpedoing through the water like a missile.  Indeed, there’s a reverence shown to Godzilla Minus One’s gruesome colossus; audiences may cheer the havoc it wreaks, but Yamazaki understands Godzilla’s sombre societal implications. It represents all the horrors that cannot be contained, the unknown terrors that lurk out there waiting to strike, and the fears that Japan’s trauma from the Second World War will never heal. Even when the film lurches into melodrama, that anguish doesn’t subside — the beast will never cease.  Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Nov 9, 2023",NEUTRAL," Nearly 70 years since its debut, Japan’s most famous monster is back. “Godzilla Minus One” is the latest in a long line of films starring the titular beast and the first live-action production (from Japan, anyway) since 2016’s “Shin Godzilla.” This new take on Godzilla by director Takashi Yamazaki, who also created the film’s visual effects, is a period piece set in postwar Tokyo. Fire bombings have reduced the city to rubble and its defenses to zero — so when a rampaging monster shows up, things go from bad to, well, minus one. The film begins in the final days of World War II, when reluctant kamikaze pilot (can you blame him?) Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) fakes engine problems and lands on the fictional island of Odo for supposed repairs. At night, a dinosaur-like monster the locals call “Godzilla” attacks the garrison stationed on the island. Koichi is ordered to use his plane’s gun to kill the monster; when he hesitates, almost every human is killed. After Japan surrenders, Koichi returns to Tokyo wracked with survivor’s guilt and PTSD. Over the next few years, he and the city at large begin to slowly rebuild, but when Godzilla reappears (supersized by the American nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll), Koichi vows to get his revenge.
