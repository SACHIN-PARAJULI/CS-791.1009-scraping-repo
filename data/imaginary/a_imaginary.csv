"Apr 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,OMG this was just awful beyond what words can piece together! Whoever gave this movie the green light should seriously consider another line of work!
"Apr 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely  Fantastic and just the right amount of Scary  for a teenager (13) and a 10 year old. Great Story too. We all loved  it. 10/10
"Apr 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it alote to me it was more R then PG-13 and gave me conjuring vibes if God does get me to buy this I would definitely buy it but it was still a little unholy I just think it underrated
"Apr 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was okay in the first half-ish, me and my friend jumped at one or two little scares. but in the second half stuff got real goofy lmao, the worldbuilding was ass and it was really funny when the old lady died cause the bear paw was so clearly a cheap prop, and a cheap cliche death. old ladys acting sucked too. my friend and i and the couple in the back of the theater were laughing so hard, it was so awful üò≠ two stars because sometimes a shitty horror movie can be fun to laugh at lol"
"Apr 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was horrible, but in amidly hilarious way. It's entertainment, I guess."
"Apr 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Acting was atrocious, Characters that were introduced that had zero impact on the story whatsoever. The ‚Äúvillain‚Äù or antagonist of the story seemed to continually change, was it Chauncey ? Was it this entity that is connected to everyone‚Äôs imaginary ? It was a bit confusing but overall, mediocre at best."
"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary had a lot of potential, even though that dumb bear was named Chauncey. Imagine a movie that got scarier as it went...that's not this movie."
"Apr 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Its decent, I thought the story was pretty engaging but the ending was missing something for me, didn't like how it was executed. I thought it was kind of weird."
"Apr 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,I couldn't see anything during the low-light parts of the movie so I turned it off after 20 minutes
"Apr 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This might not be the bone-chilling horror some critics are slamming it for, but it delivers a campy, creature-feature charm that scratches a specific itch. Here's the thing: if you go in expecting a modern ""Annabelle"" or M3GAN,"" you'll likely be disappointed. But if you approach it with the mindset of a 90s Goosebumps episode aimed at a slightly older audience, then ""Imaginary"" becomes a surprisingly fun ride.

The plot is familiar: a young girl befriends a creepy-cute stuffed bear named Chauncey, and things take a turn for the weird. The scares are more jump scares and spooky atmosphere than genuine dread. But there's a certain enjoyment in the cheese factor, a wink-wink nudge-nudge to classic horror tropes.

Here's the comparison to Goosebumps: ""Imaginary"" has that same blend of childish scares and genuine creepiness. It won't terrify you, but it might make you look twice at your own childhood toys.  And isn't that part of the fun?"
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it. Not super scary but definitely family friendly. My teens enjoyed it.
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There are plenty of movies featuring a family moving into a large home, being affected by a paranormal occurrence. A child is usually the affected party, followed by an introduction to a psychiatrist, psychic or knowledgeable 3rd party who quickly explains what ghost or demon is the culprit. We then have parents who slowly learn the threat is real, toss in some plot armor and end with the entity supposedly being extinguished and the house being destroyed. Other similar movies: Sinister, Poltergeist, Annabelle, Boogeyman etc.. At the end of the day, you have another generic movie with a paranormal threat that's usually some ancient evil, awakened to terrorize a small suburban family."
"Apr 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,The movie was OK. I liked the plot twist and some of the classic practical effects. Some of the acting was not so good too really bad! Not something I would watch again.
"Apr 9, 2024",POSITIVE,The pace was perfect and the anticipatory story kept you guessing.
"Apr 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, i dont get why everyone is hating?? people who are hating must like the typical movie where they trip on air and end up dying. this movie was unpredictable and infact did NOT still from the movie m3gan. the plot was entirely different from m3gan and had huge orginality. Although the movie wasnt as scary as chucky or m3gan it definitely was the type of movie that u cant look at since ur afraid. and notice how the people who are hating literaly have the most trashiest reasons to not like the movie. everyone is focusing on a specific scene that had a flaw in it and decided to hate the entire movie because of it? i also hate they compare m3gan to imaginary. they are NOT in common. the plots are entirely different. although i think this movie could've had more money and effort added towards it, haters need to hop off this movie cause You all have trashy reasons to hate it i saw a comment that said ""imagine something better"" go imagine ur dad....anyways i rate this movie a 9/10."
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Family friendly horror movie with gooey soft ending.  No real sense of danger or evil lurking. Only plus good to see Betty Buckley. She awesome in as gym coach in Carrie.
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst movie of the year for me.  The script was horrible and the acting was just as bad, if not worse.  I can't imagine how anyone could read this script and think to green light it.  Definitely ruined my Friday night."
"Apr 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,I mean I didn't hate it but considering the fact that it was made by the some director that made the five nights at Freddy's movie I was excited to see I did feel like it was just a little too predictable the acting was pretty good though and I did like the premise of the story I don't know if this was an original idea and it just wasn't executed that well or if this is from a novel and it wasn't executed that well just don't overhype yourself up going into this movie like I did
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary is another bland and generic pg 13 horror movie. While the cast does a decent job, and there's a decent twist thrown in here, it still doesn't do enough to stand out. It's an okay movie though I suppose, so maybe check it out if you are really intrigued."
"Apr 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Very good scary movie!
"Apr 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It started off okay but then just got dumb at the end. I had high expectations for Blumhouse, as I always do, but this missed the mark completely."
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, it was fun, had some scares and the story was intense. I don't understand all the hate. The horror characters were a little goofy tho"
"Apr 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Blumhouse with another huge miss
"Apr 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,"El cine de terror suele caer en temas repetitivos y redundantes, en momentos vistos una y mil veces, y en una reiteraci√≥n de claves ya por todas conocidas, empezando por un abuso de los sustos gratuitos que no conducen a nada. Jeff Wadlow intenta salir de todo ello con una historia que comienza de forma convencional y avanza para mostrarnos una historia m√°s dram√°tica y con algo m√°s de poso, pero, sobre todo, con un tercio final rebosante de buenas ideas y con un ùò≠ùò∞ùò∞ùò¨ visual √∫nico y muy interesante. No corrige todos los defectos del g√©nero, pero intenta sorprender y no abusar de los sustos, por ejemplo. DeWanda Wise es la perfecta protagonista de esta historia y se echa sobre los hombros la pel√≠cula sin despeinarse, aprovechando especialmente la relaci√≥n con las hijas de su pareja. Lo que propone en el tercer acto llega demasiado tarde y no est√° del todo aprovechado, porque promet√≠a mucho m√°s. Aunque la pel√≠cula visite casi m√°s el drama que el terror, no es capaz de escapar de muchos clich√©s del g√©nero que hacen el guion mucho m√°s rampl√≥n de lo que deber√≠a, desde el padre que no se entera de nada a la hija adolescente que no acepta la nueva figura materna. Se aprec√≠a mucho el intento de sorprender en este g√©nero."
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie had some lessons, even though it wasn't too scary. I think the overall theme of the movie was good. I was fond of the world that the film introduced the audience with. Whoever made ""The Chauncey Song"" needs a raise."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Seemed like a good horror movie up until the last 45 min. Seemed like they didn't know how to finish it off and they just threw it together and put it out in theaters. The book the step mom in the movie  wrote was probably better written than this movie. 2.5/10
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie totally sucks in so many ways. The acting from everyone is super whack. Anything that‚Äôs supposed to be scary is ridiculous 
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was ok. Needs more scares.
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't know why a lot of people were saying negative things about this movie. It was very enjoyable to my kids and I. It was scary, funny, and suspenseful. I don't take movies like this so serious just lay back and have fun with it. I'd definitely say if you want to experience it in theatres do it."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"#Imaginary is another big miss from Blumhouse üò¨‚Ä¶ It's basically a mixture of Insidious and Poltergeist, rolled into one, and it doesn't work.¬†

The cast do their best, especially with what they were given, the dialogue doesn't work, and it's not scary enough to call it a good horror movie.¬†

I know I was late to watching it, but it just didn't work. It's the same generic formula that we've seen a million times before, and the ending sets up a sequel, but I think they should just leave it.¬†

3/5"
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is very good I recommend watching it in a smaller room with less people. This movie had a great story. The many plot twists were great. It all made sense and it was great. Definitely one that id recommend.
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another mid movie by blumhouse. The only remotely disturbing thing about this movie is the weird big bear that looks like a mix of an actual guy in a suit + some cgi.
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is a worst horror movie of all time in 2024. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie, but they made it so hard to. The concept of this film had me really excited, I even enjoyed the lore they introduced in the film about the imaginary friends. I've really been struggling to find things I liked about this film. Visually, the film looked great, and for the most part, the acting was fine. With standout performances by DeWanda Wise, Pyper Braun, and of course the legendary Betty Buckley. Besides that the film felt very hollow. They could have done so much with this concept."
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary is a flawed film that has so much potential in it's ideas from the start. The ambition was there. But after all, the story turned into a convoluted and rather annoying. The ideas for an imagination based horror movies were endless but their execution was awful. However, the film is so bad it enters the so bad it's good territory for me. I had a good time with the film personally. The film also isn't a horror film but rather a suspenseful film with unsettling imagery. Overall, a flawed film with lost potential."
"Apr 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall, I thought it was a fun film. I absolutely love the practical effects. probably the biggest selling point for me. a lot of the jumpscares are predictable but that didn't really bother me since most horror movies nowadays are extremely formulaic. i do hope this gets an over the top sequel that takes place primarily NeverEver!"
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was terrible! Acting was bad, story is all over the place. The premise of an imaginary friend could have been so much better. Blumhouse needs to be a little more careful on what movies to stand behind. Ugh!"
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely dreadful. The plot had no purpose and made very little sense. I was looking forward to the movie. That changed quickly once the movie began.
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,I feel like I have seen this move already. It's exactly like Boogeyman from 2023.
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Honestly it was a bit cheesy but it had my full attention the whole movie!
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,My bf and I thought it was really good! We hope it comes out with a part 2 to tell the little boys story
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"First 80% of the movie was actually pretty good. Some scenes you knew what was next as to the general feeling of this movie. Other times some single one liners came across as a bit much in the face of acting (wouldn't happen in real life). I told my wife in the beginning of this movie it would quickly get worse as soon as they showed the ""entity"" (monster in this case) and it held very true. It was almost humorous. Not a bad watch for @ home but I wouldn't have spent the coin to take the family at the movies."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Started slow but ended good! Very good and very creatively freaky.
"Mar 31, 2024",NEUTRAL,"when I watch the trailers  for upcoming horror movies,  my expectations aren't very high. With that being said,  it was pretty good, I liked it."
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"OMG the worst horror movie of 2024 so far, bad acting, horrible villain, bad plot twist, the characters were not good. 
It's just bad"
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"MOST POINTLESS MOVIE OF 
THE YEAR SO FAR!"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,I saw this movie on March 30th 2024 and as a girl who once had an imaginary friend (who oddly enough was a teddy bear) I fount this phscopathic monster amusing. I love the slow burn of this movie. I will say I have alot of biases towards to concept but my sister who is more into the gore and shock horror still loved this movie. We saw it in the same cinema at the same time at the same place.
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,I really appreciated that it relied more heavily on the psychological buildup and less on cheap jump scares!
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The cast and premise looked promising, but the  bad acting, editing, pacing, nonsensical story/plot, terrible music score, and overall end product gutted what could have been a great film."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,O filme √© a verdadeira defini√ß√£o do √ìbvio. O fato do plano seguinte mostrar que o urso se mexeu tira toda a imers√£o da cena.
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's annoying that they have to explain everything while it's so obvious. With imagination you could defeat it but they don't really use it‚Ä¶ it makes no sense.  Waste of time
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"also with a lot of benevolence, boring, tiring and not the least bit entertaining"
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Una pelicula con poca imaginaci√≥n, que ir√≥nico."
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie started a little slow but picked up and was intense. I loved the premise of the movie. This is one that I'd love to own.
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was good until the complete foolish twist
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was so good I don't know why people hate but I want a sequel Chauncey coming back at the end and his monstrous look plus the creepy music
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The start off was good and certain parts of the film were really good and the concept was really good but the way they delivered in the film was just terrible and unfortunately, a movie that with a good concept that could have been good turned into a mess of a movie and slowly just got worse and worse as the film went on."
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"In a time where everything is a remake or based on a book, I have to say I really appreciated the originality of the storyline. It was entertaining and unpredictable all-around. Pyper Braun does a great job in her role and it‚Äôs filled with surprises. I will be watching it again when it‚Äôs released. "
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film seems to take an aim at childhood trauma, and how it carries through your life. The protagonists never reach a conclusion, you would think it would end with it facing her fear and overcoming her past trauma. The ending almost leaves it open for a part two that should never be considered. However the acting was okay, and it did not become intolerable until the last 15 minutes of the movie."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just bad. Started off okay and just spiraled.
"Mar 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A alright movie that did some well and some bad, but I do like a idea and villain design"
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,I really liked it a little confusing at the end but overall pretty good hope they make a next movie showing them going to destroy the bear so it never harms anyone again
"Mar 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Maybe I'm not enough of a horror fan, because while I agree this wasn't particularly scary, I'm fine with that. The family issues offset the surrealism nicely. For better or worse, this is one of the few films I have watched a trailer of, seen all the way though, and then thought, ""This is exactly what was advertised."" 

Pretty formulaic, but what isn't these days?

Nothing about this movie makes want to watch it a second time, but it was interesting enough to watch the whole way though, which is more than I can say for some films."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is probably better suited to tweens and teens. It's not scary at all. It's goofy, and reminds me of the 'Are You Afraid of the Dark' series on Nickelodeon. Campy, if anything."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie was slow and boring
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary √© bem mediano. Tanto que o filme √© puro clich√™ , n√£o me apeguei  com nenhum dos personagens. As √∫nica coisa  boa desse filme √© o o designer dos monstros  que eu gostei bastante."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Not sure why there were so many bad reviews.  I thought it was Great!  Any flick that delivers things you could potentially miss such as quick flashes of something lurking in the background is exactly the sauce I would deliver if I had the means to make a horror.  it encourages another viewing or finger on the rewind button.  it wasn't overly scary no..but it was creative with a nice twist or two.  I wouldn't have been disappointed seeing it in the theater.
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,THIS FILM RIPP'S OFF POPPY PLAYTIME AND FNAF
"Mar 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary had the beginnings of a good concept let down by poorly explored back stories and several plot holes. That said, there were enough jumpy moments to keep us entertained, and the young actress was very good. My daughter enjoyed it, in fact, at certificate 15 it may have in fact censored itself from an ideal, younger audience that would have probably made it a hit."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A few jumps and scares but not up to the usual BH and Lionsgate standards for horror. But for $24.99 instead of a $19.99 rental, I now own this. So there's that."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was an ok movie, kind of predictable and not really built up to anything great. I would say it's a great scary movie for kids 12 and younger"
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't believe Blumhouse put their name on this.
"Mar 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,it was pretty good boring at some parts but besides that it was good
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"lack of horror films, dialogues and acting lead you out of the vibes and the story. Over-acting. for a nice idea. It feels like a parody or a scary-movie, where the cuts are to strong from a logic dialogue and sequence."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Could be better... The imaginary world doesnt work for me.
"Mar 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Generic yet entertaining. Imaginary's interesting ideas, nice practical effects, and cool villain make it a decent movie that could've been really better had it been given the proper script."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Um filme de terror gen√©rico  qualquer
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,ABSOLUTLY HORRIBLE MOVIE. I can not begiin to explain how trash this stinky movie was. This movie was worse than a dhar man video. I don't even know why I continuted to watch it because it was to trash. Absolutly no horror in this movie. plot was Disgraceful absouty disgracefULL. If I EVER see anything about this movie I will literally throw my phone in the ocean. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,'Imaginary' is a passable horror which falters in execution of its interesting ideas.
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Edge of your seat, jump scare filled film. A basic physiology film with the effort of horror injected in the plot. Not a bad movie to kill time with or to actually enjoy. I'll leave that up to you... the viewer. "
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Better than I thought. I'm not sure about the PG13 rate though...It could be an R.
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"From the very beginning, Imaginary 2024 grabs your attention with its intriguing concepts and mesmerizing effects. The narrative takes you on a journey through uncharted territories of imagination, exploring realms that defy logic and challenge conventional storytelling. Sure, it may not be hailed as the most innovative piece of cinema, but it doesn't need to be.
What it offers is a refreshing take on familiar themes, sprinkled with enough originality to keep you hooked.
Imaginary 2024 has gotten some hate, but I really enjoyed it.
It's not the most original movie, but it's definitely interesting. The way it mixes real life with imagination kept me entertained.
And visually, it's awesome. The special effects are really cool and make the movie feel like a wild ride.
Overall, Imaginary 2024 might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're up for a fun and imaginative journey, give it a shot!"
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Don't waste your time or money. I had more fun going to the gas station.
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible, poor acting. Soo so cheesy"
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I liked Blumhouse's Nightswim, watched it twice, and Megan was fun. But the studio is really ripping off movie goers now with movies like Imaginary. This is a bottom of the barrel movie. It probably could have been made for a few thousand bucks as it's full of unknown or budget actors, and it's mostly filmed in a house. I know Blumhouse makes cheap horror, but this is a very low budget film with a desperate, ridiculous premise they try to sell. The only person who might enjoy this movie is someone who just crawled out from under a rock and is watching a horror movie for the first time."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Blumhouse is going to Blumhouse!!!!! They come up with a interesting movie idea but they execute it poorly. This movie isn't one of Blumhouse's worst movies but it certainly isn't one of their best. It's mediocre and generic
"Mar 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Honestly the worst movie I have ever watched..speachless.
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it, the theme was a learning experience. I would invite my grandchildren to watch it."
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Imaginary offers a mix of elements that keep the audience engaged, from good scares to a unique twist, albeit a bit clich√©. The combination of these factors seems to create an enjoyable and captivating experience for viewers."
"Mar 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was a great movie, it was corny in the middle but it pulled through towards the ending."
"Mar 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,At√© que tem um plot twist bom.
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie. Had a nice twist to it.
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Our entire group found Imaginary to be a delightful experience.especially from the horror genre.  The movie had just the right amount of jump scares, humor, excellent performances by the cast and a well conceived and original plot.  We LOVED it!!!!!"
"Mar 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was a good concept, not so good execution. Couple of jump scares, that‚Äôs about it."
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie.... SLAPPED. Liam had me GIGGLINGGG!! And Chauncy killed those hoes slayfully. 6/5 STARS!! üòúü§©‚ù§Ô∏èü§ûüèªüòãüè•üíÄ
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Another great film by Blumhouse. Lots of scary scenes and jumps! More of an original story with some notable twists. Very entertaining.
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I want a refund.  Confusing plot, corny effects, and no resolution."
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was a chore to sit through. Only one death in the whole movie, and it happens off-screen behind a closed door. A main cast member just goes away mid movie and is never mentioned or seen again. The only scary moment is a jump scare toward the beginning of them movie. This movie kinda felt like Blumhouse had a leftover Five Nights at Freddie's costume and let a drunken chimp write a script to use it. This movie was such a pain to sit through that at the first false ending, the line, ""The end of one story is the beginning of another."", I literally shouted in the theater, ""Please, don't tell it."". I've eaten Taco Bell and been more terrified going to the bathroom than I was while watching this dud of a movie."
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Better than Blumhouse's first of the year (Night Swim); Imaginary almost feels like it COULD'VE been way better. The production design on this went insane, the one gory kill was great, and the premise itself is also pretty good. But this LACKED with a PG-13 rating. The pacing in this is offbeat, some of the writing was just not good, and some creative decisions‚Ä¶ yeah. Not horrific, this has some good moments, but it's very minimal. Definitely dug the Coraline vibe though."
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"OK, HEAR ME OUT. Going into this movie, I was nervous that it wouldnt be a fun watch and I would be miserable watching this. In the first 20 minutes or so.. yeah I was kinda. I thought the acting was questionable, the plot layout was weird and the effects of the bear was CW quality. However, by the middle of this movie, my mind changed. The plot layout was to me unique, laying out a new kinda way of portraying a horror movie, it had A TON of twist and turns and to me the imaginary world's (""Never Evers"") CG and set was AWESOME AS HELL. It scared me geniunely a couple of times, without any blood, guts or cheap scares. There was a jumpscare which felt cheap in the beginning, the second half scared me with none of that. The practical effects were cool as hell, especially when she started sinking through the paper floor slowly and the main characters struggles, the acting was definitely stepped up. Everyone who hates on this movie, all thry can say is its not as bad as ""Night Swim"" (which I did not see because even the premise I thought was terrible). However, it is probably better than most of the new horror movies coming out lately, better than ""Knock at the Cabin"" (BY FAR), better than ""The Boogeyman"" from Stephen King, even better than ""Five Nights at Freddys"" (which hurts because thats my childhood). He had unique quality, and plays into making you think your right about it being trash before in the middle flipping everything you thought and expected on its head. Yeah some of the plotting is eh but if thats not good cinema, I dont know what is, it left me surprised and entertained. Thats the most that matters."
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Trailer was scarier than the movie. Lots of plot issues
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's got a really interesting story and characters. 
I like the fact that the bear was also not real because it made me question everything. 
I really like when they go in the the door of imagination. But I think it couldn't of been scarier because it only made me jump a little and a little uncomfortable but it wasn't scary in the sense of it was hard to weached. Which was kinda of what I was expecting"
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Great concept but not well executed. Wish they would've done more with the camera work with the ""Never Ever"" and went into the girls' past with their bio mom."
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went to see this movie with my daughter, and both found it very entertaining. The jump scares were excellent and better in a nice loud theater! My only complaint would be the special effects, and the scary creatures could have looked a little more realistic. But my five-year-old loves creepy things, and I think she could handle this one which is excellent. Both my daughters now want a plush Chauncey, lol. I would see it again, and I can't wait till it is on streaming to watch with my whole family. Fingers crossed, they make a sequel!"
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Chato, cansativo e um terror sem terror. Filme muito ruim em que voc√™ n√£o se importar com ninguem e nem os sustos funciona, enfim uma perda de tempo"
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,too much story too little scares still great
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Neat concept with some great potential but fell short. It will keep you entertained and wanting more but never really fills those needs fully. Worth a watch if you like fun but cheesy horror.
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,It was good didn‚Äôt expect that from a pg-13 movie jump scare dropped my popcorn!!
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,WAS NOT PG13 more like R
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Heavily mediocre and all the fun was in the trailer. There definitely could have been more imagination put into the script and direction of the film. 

Overall, I'd give this a 4/10"
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,It held my attention.  It was unique.  Great acting. Great horror movie
"Mar 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,good movie to pass the time.
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Imaginary wasn't good and very dragged out and confusing!!!
"Mar 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This was a good mid-day flick, both in terms of the story and the performances. It feels like some parts of the narrative were left on the cutting room floor, and several minor character actors give fair performances with dialogue that feels like we've seen and heard it before. Yet, the core concept and compelling performances of other actors give plenty of moments to make you believe in the imaginary. Yeah, sounds like a PR person wrote that, but it's really me who saw the movie on Saturday for $10. If you don't see it in theaters, you'll still feel satisfied watching it when it comes to one of those red boxes or hits a streaming service üòä"
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Interesting plot. More of a fantasy, sci-fi genre. I liked this movie. "
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"I personally really liked the film, I understand that it may not appeal to those looking for heavier horror, but the film is good within its limitations."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it would be just like any other horror movie, but it wasn't. I am normally one who can detect plot twists and easily tell how a story will go. But the two major plot twists in this movie really caught me off guard. I was so amazed by them that I knew I was gonna rate this movie 5 stars. I enjoyed the acting and over all creativity of this movie. This is not just like any other horror movie, it is definitely worth the watch."
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A decent premise that didn't deliver on the scares.  There's a bit of world building that is appreciated, but it's difficult not to chuckle every time the ""monster"" of the film comes on screen.  There's a few twists and turns along the way, but none of them are particularly unpredictable."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved this movie.  Good jump scares.. good twists.
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,NGL Theis movie was amazing. Some might say its to slow but IDC it is still cool
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,The popcorn had a lot of butter. Would definitely recommend!
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,Major plot holes. Really good until the last 20-30 minutes
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible either. Somewhere in the middle. The first portion of the movie was good, but the climax was a bit underwhelming for my taste."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,YEAAAAA MF THAT WHAT YOU GET YOUR FREAKING PRODUCER OF M3GAN STUPIT PRODUCERS THATS KARMA FOR RUINEING THE FNAF MOVIE
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Decent movie. The bear was pretty creepy not gonna lie. I wish that they would've followed through with the jump scares and not just cut the scenes. The deeper meaning behind it all made the movie a little scary/creepy but if you are looking for something that is visually scary this isn't it.
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie feels really flat but starts getting better getting close to the final act. It's not terrible but definitely worth a watch.
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a nightmare for a 2-year-old child, give me my money back! An interesting idea with a terrible pitch"
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It was pretty good concept and the build ups were great
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"For a ‚Äúscary‚Äù movie nowadays it was pretty good. Most scary movies suck so much now but this one wasn‚Äôt too bad. It wasn‚Äôt scary but it was definitely good. The editing  wasn‚Äôt dumb like most movies when they add in a bunch of close up scenes that look dumb. If you like scary movies that aren‚Äôt scary but have a great story then this is great for you. Although the whole concept was lost like others were saying. 
Very interesting and not what u would expect but definitely a cool movie. "
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It was good! Worth the watch.
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Honestly save your money and don't waste your time. Wait for it to come out on a streaming platform. This movie was so boring..
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,This review was the worst movie that I have ever seen and I go to the movies often. The storyline made no sense and the acting was even worse. This isn't even worth seeing at home for free.
"Mar 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,What I like about it is that it had many twist and turns throughout the story but I feel like they could have done a little bit more with the scares they played it Tuesday
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,After seing the trailer i thought it was weird...but the concept was actually cool...in the opposite!
"Mar 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,Good horror movie to watch with the kids.
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was hyped gave a few good scares
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,HAD ME SCREAMING AND LAUGHING. REALLY GOT PSYCOLOGICAL!!
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,I want my money back
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked the twist to the movie.
"Mar 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a new concept! And its a switch from the same old movies!
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I enjoyed the cast, I didn‚Äôt like the story all too well. So many questions left unanswered, leaving the movie room to twist anyway it. That allowed a lot less thinking going into the writing of the script."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"good idea, the actors are all very good especially the main dewanda wise! a few solid scary moments, I was invested in their fates. overall fun watch, nothing amazing but definitely not ‚Äòbad' or ‚Äòthe worst'. Worth the 1hr30min"
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Probably the worst horror movie I've seen this year so far. So cheesy and not scary in the slightest. Would not call it a horror film at all. For any horror fans like me, don't even bother to waste your time!"
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie fool me on what I thought was the and it wasnt
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Overall the concept of the film is good. However much of the concept gets lost in the predictably of the executed product. A lot of the ""twists"" are seen a mile a way. Along with this, the trailer from the movie provides the same concept of the whole movie. I will say that the performances from the actors and actresses was okay, but it does get bogged down by poor story direction and poor dialogue between characters. The special effects were below average and overall seemed like an afterthought in production. The use of costumes instead of some cgi also made the film seem outdated at times. Along with this, some scenes were dragged out and others way too short. It seemed like directors seemed way to focused on world building rather then executing a good story. If you see this don't go in with high hopes."
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it! There was a great story, perfect pacing and great characters"
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not as scary as I thought it'd be.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Hands down the worst movie of 2024 (so far).
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst thing I've ever seen, I'm feel sorry for the actors that had to go though the whole thing.
Everything was so obvious and bad scripted, so slow on every aspect, a pain to watch, horrible colors and bad actors choice overall. The father of Alice had like ten years more than the actual daughter.
I wish I didn't spend my money on this and I advise you don't spend yours."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Wasn't what I was expecting. Left you with alot of questions
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The storyline had so much potential but it ultimately fell flat. Poor writing and acting, didn't feel any connection to the characters. A few very obvious plot holes that distracted you from the film. A couple good jump scares, but would not see this again and don't recommend."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The plot was slow. Not a horrible film, just a little confusing and drawn out. The ending was off in my opinion."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Didn‚Äôt love the end but liked the beginning and was scary üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,kids wouldn‚Äôt stop being loud and obnoxious to even hear and enjoy the movie. got stuff thrown and others were very mad
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There were some good scares and the first plot twist was good but overall, the movie doesn't feel fulfilling. There's something missing. They also didn't know when to end it"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This has to the worst horror in 2024 like the scenes wasn't even hitting like there was no jump scared the story at the end was this trash I give it a rating 0.2/10
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I like it a lot I do recommend it
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's okay. Just a tad bit boring and predictable. The plot twist didn't hit as hard as I would have hoped and the switch of one of the characters was pretty much guaranteed. Also, the characters were very surface level, I did not feel any emotion towards them and they were just very 'meh'."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just bad. Though I did laugh out loud, not what was intended I'm sure."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in a theatre.

No redeeming qualities. Not creepy, not frightening, not scary, not interesting, not well written or, ironically, imaginative.

Some of the actors do well with the little they are given to work with. That's the best I can say."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,DeWanda Wise tries very hard but this movie falls a little flat. And long story short‚Äî there's not even a need for the teddy bear. I love the lead actress in other projects and hoped this would've been better than it is.
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was super cute and a fun movie
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was cringe. Looks like a bootleg version of Cocaine Bear
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I haven't seen such a good horror movie in a long time. This movie was very well executed, with a very good script and an incredible plot."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,It had some good jump scare but the narrative could have been better.
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A potentially good idea that falls flat due to lack of imagination.
The film is technically sound. It looks good on the big screen. It has a polished look and the film is edited well.
That being said, the movie started with an awesome horror sequence that captivated, but, unfortunately, the remainder of the story drags throughout the majority of the film until you hit the last act. The pacing is terrible and weighs the movie down heavily.  Aside from the pacing, the story becomes rather predictable and lazy, and loses any mystique it had going for it. You're left with too many questions left unanswered when the credits roll.
The characters were simple, uninteresting, and underdeveloped. The cast, at least, did a good job with the underwhelming characters that were created. We spend very little time exploring the antagonist, which is the most interesting aspect of this entire movie. I still don't quite understand how the monster operates. 
There's no blood or gore in this one to save it from mediocrity. It's unfortunate, because this movie started off rather scary, but that quickly dwindled as the movie progressed. The action picks up in the third act where we get more horror sequences that work and are effective. The creature designs were neat and we needed to see more of that on screen. This is where to movie shined and actually worked.
What a disappointment. I was not expecting anything grandiose, but at least something entertaining. The bear gimmick is short lived, and not enough was done to properly and coherently expand this monster and how it works and lives. This movie would have worked better in a short format, at least the idea would  have been more focused."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bland, unflavorful & cliche."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was very suspenseful. Not many jump scares, but lots of anticipation. The acting was great from all the actors and actresses. The only thing that I was disappointed was the actual monsters on the climax of the movie. They weren't scary enough once you saw them in its entirety. But the actors expression towards them made them scarier than what they actually were. Again, the actors were so convincing you felt the emotion they were portraying. Great for people who are starting to get into scary movies."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,There was a fight in the theatre that was more entertaining than this movie.
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Good plot line and resolution
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a combination about some movies of horror while it try's to make a good story, and it is, cause it has some interesting elements and characters that make it great, but some horror scenes doesn't help to much about it"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Even though the film has some well acted and even kind of disturbing moments, that just makes it even more infuriating when the rest of it is just so clich√©d, jump scare heavy, and stupid. It had so much potential and the majority of it feels wasted."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"While the movie isn't 100% horrid, it certainly was not good. While it did have its moments and there was a good twist, it suffers from annoying characters, confusing and just plain bad writing, and a villain that didn't come off as scary and was more goofy."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wish I had never watched this.

The idea for the movie itself was interesting, but I don't think they played it out well at all. Not to mention the acting itself was shocking‚Ä¶ and not in a good way."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Was not scary and the plot could have been much more developed
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is your standard formulaic horror film.  They stick to the formula because it works.  It's cheesy and relies mainly on jump scares.  There are some moments of unsettling tension throughout.  Acting is okay, but dialogue is flat and predictable.  They spoon feed the lore to you which always comes across as forced.  The movie is fine if you're looking for your standard horror movie experience.  Don't expect anything more from this one."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the suspense but would have like them to more explaining on the mother and the old lady neighbor.
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was fun, not everything has to be some magnum opus, just a fun weekend horror flick."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,. Lot of people are hating on it but it really isn't that bad it's entertaining and different it is a bit cheezy at times but also have some creepy points to it and one of the jumpscares actually made me jump. It could've been better bit I'd say 7/10
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Good movie to sleep in
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved it. The drugs I was on made it amazing. If i was not on drugs I would've walked out.
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It was amazing!! Me and my husband loved it for date night! It wasn‚Äôt scary scary but definitely something different to watch! Hope you all enjoy it like we did ^^
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. How is it even possible for it to get funding?
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was pretty bad, was on my phone half of the time."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Decent concept, but a poorly-acted snooze fest with unearned sequel baiting. Won't watch again."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,??üòÇ girl please lol
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,this movie was so funny! u guys have to see it with friends. i didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with this movie!
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very boring and actually pretty stupid movie.
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was a good movie, Hopefully there will be a sequel soon"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was really good, I liked the acting in it especially the girl who played Alice, I hope they make a sequel too imaginary, if they do I will see it"
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Blumhouse's Imaginary turned out to be an okay horror movie. I definitely didn't find the movie to be great, nor did I find it to be terrible. The biggest flaw I personally have with Imaginary is the pacing. Some scenes did feel pretty slow and I feel like they sometimes go on for too long. The story, although decently written, can actually be quite predictable at many points. The movie does have its scary moments & jump scares, but only one or maybe two I actually did find were somewhat effective and even caught me off guard at one point. Moving on to the positives, Imaginary has a really cool concept and it actually is pretty creative & the cinematography is also great, along with some cool visual effects. Great acting was also present throughout the movie, especially with DeWanda Wise as Jessica, Taegen Burns as Taylor & of course, Pyper Braun as Alice. The movie also packs a surprisingly interesting plot twist, which I won‚Äôt discuss for spoiler reasons. Overall, Blumhouse's Imaginary is an okay horror movie that definitely could've been a lot better, but also could've been much worse for me. As for my rating, I'm going to rate Imaginary a 6/10."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,i mean it sucked but it was fun
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,I was really excited to see this movie and it didn't disappoint in a way! The final product was something I don't recommend watching in theaters but definitely something to watch with friends at your house in the dark! The premise is really good I just wish they went a more darker and scarier way with it! But overall a great watch!
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Very captivating and suspensefulteenagers loved it too!!!
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Took my 9 year old daughter to see it and she liked it. There were a couple boys her age in the audience and it was tasteful viewing for their age IMO for a pg13 film. I found it kinda creepy. Couple jump scares. Does a good job on the main characters story and learning more as the movie progresses that explains what's going on, a classic formula. If you're a horror fan that likes a lot of gore and scares, this wouldnt fit the bill"
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot line was ridiculous.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary is a cool film if you imagine it, a 5.1/10 for me. It's an interesting film that passes the time, and an interesting story line about Jessica and her sinister imaginary friend. I guess time will tell if it deserves a sequel."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That was one of the absolute WORST movies I have ever seen. The acting, awful. The plot, ridiculous and awful. The dialogue, painfully awful. In its entirety, that was all together a disaster and never should have been made. For a ""horror"" movie I sure did spend a lot of the time laughing at how terrible it was. The supposed ""scary creature"" looked like a knock off Chuck E. Cheese animatronic. This movie should have never been filmed, and the producers should be fired for approving this garbage. Don't waste your time and money. I wish I could get that hour and a half of my life back. -5/10 do not recommend"
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Eh it was very basic. Not scary imo. the bear's monster form made me laugh lol. the most interesting part was the lore on imaginary friends too bad it wasn't a big part of the movie. i hated most of the characters.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imagin√°rio, eh onde deveria ter ficado a ideia de fazer esse filme, meu Deus kkkkkkkk. 
Come√ßou com um certo ar de dar medo e Soh, parou por a√≠, primeiro problema foi que eu Soh conseguia enxergar a In√™s Brasil como protagonista hahahaha da√≠ lembrava dos memes em cada cena. 
O filme eh ruim de roteiro, de jumpscare, de atua√ß√µes, eh muito fraco. Mas calma, nunca reclame, pois sempre pode piorar. No trecho final, parecia que eu estava vendo Detetives do Pr√©dio azul, misturado com FNAF. Tr√°gico, o plot twist eh horroso, a atriz mirim foi mto mal, e a melhor atua√ß√£o foi do ursinho, nota 2"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I like the teddy bear that was in it
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The film was disappointing und very boring. For horror fans it is not worth watching but maybe for easily scared people.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not scary and lowkey cringe
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary had its jump moments which the background suspense music helped realize, but it felt like there were too many unrealized plot lines going on. Sometimes simple is best."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Watched it with my friend. We laughed through half of it, not because it was funny, but mostly because The Labyrinth has better CGI then this movie‚Ä¶ The acting was interesting‚Ä¶ and frankly it seemed basic and nothing 100 older movies havent done."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was ok until it got weird in the end.
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,It is good but it's not as scary as it looks
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I thought this would be a good movie but it reminded me a lot of like a Dar man video. The acting wasn‚Äôt good and it was hardly scary
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unique but not something I will watch again!!
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It felt like I was watching something cheaply made for the syfy channel.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"horrible movie. the acting or lack of, was hilarious.  it's like they were reading the script. terrible. don't waste your money. ever."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was a fun movie, cliche, but fun"
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,THIS IS BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"People are giving this movie terrible reviews, but, it's not that horrible.  The film is clearly not a horror film, perhaps this disappointed some, they made an effort to put in some jumpscares, most of them were flawed, however, as the story progresses you become curious to understand the character's past, the connections that the film brings it and when you're not expecting it, boom, another twist.  For a low-budget film, it managed to exceed expectations.  I don't think it deserves all these low reviews.  Again, it's quite flawed as a horror, it's more of a mystery and fantasy, which doesn't necessarily make it bad."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Big Bad Bear Bites Betty Biuckley
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This Movie lacks some originality, and is a boring experience leading up to the ending. A very forgettable movie in my opinion, would not recommend watching."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"At√© a metade tava filme chato e clich√™ de brinquedo do mal, mas o final foi diferente e eu gostei. Tiveram uma abordagem assumindo a fantasia e outras dimens√µes, me fazendo lembrar de Coraline, por√©m √© uma pena n√£o serem t√£o criativos e inventivos apesar de tentarem."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,This movie had a good plot and some scary scenes.
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"kinda funny, not bad."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Save your self the time don't watch it. It's boring and has some plot holes. It's just a waste of time
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Enough with the little kid horror movies that aren‚Äôt scary
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yes I love horror movies. Did not love this one. Seemed to start out ok, but once it went to another dimension, that was it for me. If there is a sequel, I will not be going. Nothing scary about it."
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Finally, something that not only entertains, but leaves you riveted to find out what is going to happen next! The whole cast was awesome! If you like Betty Buckley, again, and again she does not disappoint! I would recommend ""Imaginary""."
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is going to be an honest review. The movie was good, not great but certainly not terrible. There's definitely some world building that theorists would love. My and my wife spend the rest of the night just analyzing the movie after watching it. 

Is it a perfect movie? Not even close. There's a few plot holes, inconsistencies, things that could have been done better, perhaps some better choice of actors, but does the good make up for the bad? For sure! 

Personally, I would recommend it if you have a nothing blamed and just want some good entertainment. But I wouldn't tell you to drop everything and go see it. 

For me it is comparable to the conjuring movies. It's a solid peice of entertainment that is shallow enough for someone to jump in and enjoy it, but also deep enough for theorists and lore enthusiasts to enjoy as well.

I gave it a 5 out of 5 because it def doesn't deserve 50% audience score. I'd like to see this thing at 70-80% audience score. It wasn't a bad movie at all,  but I can see how it wouldn't be some people's cup of tea. I mean it's a movie about an imaginary friend‚Ä¶ let's be honest, there's a handful of people that were never going to like it. But I think there's something here to enjoy, and I'm excited for a sequel."
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked it because it was different type of movie. I didn‚Äôt dislike it
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Expect boredom. Two jump scares and a LOT of bad bad acting.  This movie was a cobbled together mess, with absolute trash special effects and no direction.
Another lame attempt at horror by writer director Jeff Wadlow (who should waddle his ass far away from making movies ie: ""Fantasy Island"" and this movie)
You know the story is BAD when they have to intruduce a character in the third act who basically has alll the answers and explains the movie to the audience.
Oh yeah and whoever thought that using  ""tanning sunglasses/blockers"" and silly putty on the actors eyes would be ""scary"" you're wrong. It looks dumb."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Started off well in the first 2 minutes of the movie and then went flat.  The acting from the whole cast was rigid and unbelievable.  The story was generic and I honestly feel like this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  I expected much better from Blumhouse
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie is surprisingly better than the reviews would lead you to believe. It was original and creepy. With that said, they flubbed the last 40 mins and totally changed directions, but it was still a fun watch."
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs more of your typical horror fare. Will not exactly be memorable, but it‚Äôs a fun watch"
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why there is so many bad reviews for this movie it's not scary at all the plot is great!!! Btw this will have spoilers: 
I didn't expect for Taylor to say so many cuss words it was very funny and Camila dies like there's blood coming from the door 
but she deserves it my theater was clapping 
Anyway i would give this movie a different watch and I hope you enjoy Imaginary like I did Bye!!!!!!!!"
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I feel like this movie got way too much hate, it was a good concept and personally the only thing I thought was bad about it was the fact that it wasn't horror and seemed more fantasy and suspense based. Besides that though, the movie was good and I feel like people had too high of expectations for a movie that was pg-13. The movie had a good plot, made sense, and I just don't see how some people don't understand certain aspects of the movie. But that's just my opinion, so I hope you found this helpful. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pyper Braun merits praise, 'Imaginary' otherwise falls flat.

I was never locked into the story and I didn't really care for the characters at any point, even Braun's Alice isn't all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress. DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's 'The Walking Dead'.

The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.

It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"". It was only when I finally noticed it written down visually that I realised! üòÇ

In conclusion, credit to Braun but everyone else onscreen and off it could've done better in my opinion."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I took my wife and we enjoyed it she said it reminded her of her childhood
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Maybe this isnt a movie for horror fans who are obsessed with blood and gore, but it is the right movie for those who want a good, cheeky time and a whole lot of heart."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad popcorn movie for a weeknight! I wish they'd kept the main character trapped in dreamworld longer, with more of a chess match between her and the entity. She should have entered dreamworld earlier in the movie and it would have had better flow."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,Story kept me engaged and there were many twists. Some good cinematic shots and the acting was decent. Final 30min did feel a bit rushed. Not too many jumpscares or horror elements but pretty fun movie overall.
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was extremely horrible all around.
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,i just imagine a good movie but came out with a bad one
"Mar 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary had a good storyline, plot and plenty of twists and turns along the way. Although it was not very scary, the story and hidden monsters in the shadows brought chills and the ending was a masterpiece. I would see this movie again."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was a great balance of story and jump scares. I liked it way more that the other Blumhouse movies.
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie ever acting was bad and so was the story
"Mar 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary was pretty interesting. It had some points that were reminiscent of other horror movies and the elements of spellcasting to open spaces for wicked entities to step in seemed a bit predictable at moments. 

However, I still liked it. I am sure that others who enjoy Blumhouse movies, particularly fans of FNAF and M3gan would definitely appreciate it, but there were some things that I felt the writers could've done a bit differently to make it flow with a bit more mystery to throw the audience off. 

All in all, it was an enjoyable movie, and had some decent jump scares."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty good! It was just very weird, that's all. Kept me invested throughout the whole movie, with some twists and turns. Some moments made me angry, but that's a response that means the plot of the movie sticks with me. Overall, pretty good, but I liked Night Swim better!"
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was thrilling And terrifying and it's so much better than night swim
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie and it was an great story 
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Don't waste your time watching this movie. It is one of the worse film I have seen in my entire lifetime.
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,It was to me a pretty good suspense thriller movie.  It kept me sitting on the edge of my seat while watching this movie.  The creators and writers of this movie film script really created some imaginary characters.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"My 20 year old daughter and I share our love for horror movies and she wanted to see Imaginary for her birthday. At first we were skeptical due to the ratings, but Imaginary proved to be a fun idea and a decent movie. There were a few twists and turns, which weren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúmind-bending,‚Äù but they suited the PG13 rating. There‚Äôs a few jump-scares and some, ‚Äúleave you on the edge of the seat moments,‚Äù but over all it was decent. Worth a watch."
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Very much a typical Blumhouse horror movie. Not a super deep story, no amazing character development, but it passed the time."
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't a horrible movie. Some parts felt misleading while other parts made me think it was an Insidious movie. It had a nice plot but failed to deliver during potential jump-scare opportunities. Once the movie climaxed, all I wanted was for it to end."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"DeWanda is the entire heart of this movie. And as a giant scaredy cat - this is the perfect mix of comedy, adventure, mystic and a dash of horror."
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,I'm sincerely belived they may do a better job with this movie  is kind slow and the movie story line is kind poor and afflicted the actors performances.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Starts off as an OK PG-13 horror movie. You've seen the previews - child being weirdly influenced by a toy bear that talks to her. Then there's a massive and unnecessary infodump complete with scholarly references and the movie spins into phantasmagorical mostly not scary badness.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,It‚Äôs was good the ending was a bit weird but trippy lol
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Contrary to the typical critics,  I feel the movie is well paced, well thought out and decently acted and directed.  IMO or if the better horror movie in the last few years. 100x better than the nun"
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies I‚Äôve seen, belongs on Tubi or something. Had to walk out after an hour"
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Solid horror movie, good date night Tuesday cinemark movie type"
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Save your money and time for a better movie.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Jeff Wadlow needs to stop making horror movies and do other types of movies
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot had too many unresolved problems and resulted in leaving you confused at the end of the story. Not too much horror overall.
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it, was fun. Good acting, good story."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie enjoyed it a lot
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Don‚Äôt even bother! Wait for it to steam at home.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not just another ""evil doll"" movie (nor, in this case, ""evil teddy bear"").  At first I was bored as it seemed to concentrate too much on cloing little kids (but they were good child actors).  But later it became kinda interesting, even if mystifying (& confusing), as it went into an other worldly, sometimes 'Escher-like' landscape of fantastic peril. Things were not as they seemed. Giving it 3 stars, as it 'passed the time' well enuf, tho I wouldn't rec it to everyone.
    Saw it AMC 'lerton, 3.12.24."
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A good watch, much better than the rating"
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Pretty great movie. I'll probably give it a 8/10
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring and very basic.
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was a pretty decent offering.  No gore, the story line was good and suspenseful. It could have used more jump scares but it's hard to get me.  We enjoyed it."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Betty Buckley was insufferable lol
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was really stupid stupid
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"So I know a lot of people dislike this movie, but I thought it was a fun time! While the movie had flaws and some unexplained plot points, I thought it was good overall and worth the watch! I felt like the first half of the movie wasn't too slow and gave us plenty of small scares before the second half. I thought all of the actors did a good job. (Spoilers ahead, skip to final sentence for spoiler-free final thoughts) I thought it was a little bit cheesy when Chauncey was talking, and I think it would have been cooler if we only heard the little girl talk and not Chauncey. I did think it was awesome when it turned out that almost nobody else could see the teddy bear! Also, I liked the scavenger hunt she had to do to get to the Imaginary realm. I loved it when Chauncey was messing with the neighbor's kid. I think they did a good job of revealing Jessica's back-story and explaining things you were confused on in the beginning. If you're here for horror, let's just say this is more of a suspenseful film. The second half took a twist from light horror to a horror-action mix. The imaginary realm was pretty creepy, but I think that it could have been more colorful since it was representing a child's imagination. I did love how they had to paint a door on the wall to get to the imaginary realm. I thought it would have been a bigger twist if the old lady was actually one of the entities. Another thing I liked was the scene with Taylor locked in the room with the sound and light projector. I thought that was really creepy! One thing I was confused on though were the entities. There was the actual-bear version of Chauncey (who looked much better in the film than the trailer), a spider thing, and a faceless human (unless the faceless person and the spider were the same thing). I believe they could have better explained their origins because I couldn't tell if Chauncey was shape-shifting or they were 3 different monsters. I did like the design of the monsters. I did like the twist where it turns out Jessica never left the Imaginary realm, but I thought the alien-eyed people were a bit cheesy. I think they should have had the same eyes as the Ghost Child who possessed Foxy in FNAF. The last thing I didn't like was the over-usage of ""Never Ever"" which got old after about 3 times. All of these were small things that didn't affect the overall film. The ending with Chauncey in the hotel was pretty cool, and I loved how they played the Chauncey-tune at the beginning of the credits. (Spoilers end here) If you are a casual movie goer who isn't expecting to be terrified and can look over the minor flaws, I believe you will enjoy this movie. (If you liked FNAF, you'll probably like this). It's better than anything Disney's been putting out since 2020."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,I honestly really liked it. sure some parts where not as interesting but the idea and consept of it his great! I love Chauncey and I even made a stuff animal of him and brought it to the movies when I went to watch it with a friend. Not going to lie but Chauncey reminds me of five nights at freddy's freddy
"Mar 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I thought the entire movie was well shot and a pretty good story was told, just the ending seemed a bit rushed"
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I had high hopes for the film, the trailer made it look amazing. The premise of a teddy bear imaginary friend was great, but the fear factor never came from the film. The husband in the film seemed peculiar, it starts by making him seem central, then he just gets in a car and leaves and comes back at the end of the film, I would have preferred he was there for the whole film or they spent less time introducing him at the start. The neighbour's kid with the drugs, completely pointless addition to the film because the climax to the scene was his mum coming and telling him off, it would have been better to have something horrific happen to him. And the elderly lady neighbour who babysat, she was wooden, unbelievable and seemed comedic in what was supposed to be a horror film, another unnecessary distraction. I did enjoy some of the twists, but every time the suspense built up it seemed to deflate itself rather than peaking."
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"The story was pretty good, the acting was good and there are really good scares, most of them sadly being spoiled in the trailer but that alright. The ending was pretty crazy too!"
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary's trailer gets you interested because you're hoping for something more to the story, at least I was. The movie is a complete mess, story is all over the place, boring, acting is subpar, cast is predictable. It's really distracting while you're trying to enjoy it, it brings the movie down. The only part I enjoyed was the imaginary world if you can call it that. I had some fun laughs but it was more like a goosebumps episode and the story was ehhhhh."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie with good acting and some really good jump scares. The plot had some cliches and the fake-out ending was kind of weird, but other than that it was a good movie to watch. Parts were funny, others touching or horrifying, and suspenseful the whole time."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was more for kids lol
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"I actually really liked this movie. I think it was a nice twist, and it had a lot of moments that really kept you at the edge of your seat. Not super scary, but definitely had me jumping and closing my eyes. I believe this movie was done well. You could tell they really really went all in in making the graphics look as real as possible. Those eyes! The *thing* at the end! Well done, blumhouse. Can't wait to see what else you have to offer. I LOVE the creativity, and twists, too! It's not your typical ""scary movie,"" and I love how much your movies are getting better and better at it!"
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Would have made more sense in the original unwokified script, but still wasn't terrible. Not good but not the worst either."
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,There was nothing to like. It was boring and not scary. The acting was subpar and disliked all the characters.
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,it was good in my opinion.
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Descends into a ridiculous mess.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Definitely not as good as any other Blumhouse movie. I watch everything from them. I can't believe I actually paid to see thisin the theater. It was terrible.
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Original, suspenseful story. Well acted. Perfect PG13 movie to make you jump. "
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Thought it was pretty good

Really enjoyable for my taste in Horror films with good story"
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Very very very good movie! Must see!
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Well, after seeing such, there is a few parts that I can enjoy, some of the jump scares do work from the beginning but they did dull down until the climax which the reveal of Chauncy was disappointing.
DeWanda Wise was the best out of the whole cast since she acted her best while the kids were just generic and the rest were just there being generic.
Well, Betty Buckley was okay yet was falling out of place near the end.
The way the imagery felt was decent but led right towards a disappointing ending.
You could say this movie didn't imagine hard enough especially for a monster out of itself.
3/10."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No where as scary as I was hoping it would be, just a bland, okay movie."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty Good creepy movie with a couple intense moments,not as scary as i expected"
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"You don't expect this kind of movie to be nominated for an Academy Award, but I do expect to have a great time watching it and a great time it was.  Good scares, some great twists and turns, and a lot of laughs."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,The film wasn't bad but not as good as you can expect. It's a movie where you can guess what's gonna happen.
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"I would give this movie an 80% because I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I really enjoyed the plot. It wasn't an Oscar worthy movie but it's worth to see in theaters, for a fun time."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"it's terrible, yes, but oh my god is it funny."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A premise with some promise, this film is really bad!  Mind you, I was entertained the entire time...laughing and scoffing.  Some decent creepy visuals, but never really any scares.  When the worst actress, perhaps of all time - the old neighbor who used to babysit the female lead enters into the fray, this goes from ho hum to utter trash in no time.  It has to be seen to be believed.  I've never seen a single character derail an entire movie like this."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,I was so excited to see this movie and convinced a friend to go with me - I have never been so embarrassed. So dreadfully flat and slow with half-realized allusions to other horror classics. The only success here was the marketing that tricked me into the theatre. At least I had fun laughing with the stranger next to me while after my friend fell asleep.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a half decent horror movie. Seems like the scariest scenes were all in the trailer. Not something I'd watch again but I don't regret seeing it.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There was some really good potential here but the direction they took most of the story is pretty nonsensical. 

Spoiler warning-ish
I was hoping for the grandma to be like a red herring or someone who is just really interested in the supernatural/inner psych of children and their limitless imagination. Would have made the """"twist"""" less cliche. I add quotation marks because it really isn't a twist it's so predictable. 

If this movie was animated or I fell like it would have given a better atmosphere with the whimsical features in the movie. It felt like scooby doo imo.

One more thing, the actor that played Jessica's dad did a phenomenal job"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Imaginary"" is the sum total of everything that is wrong with modern-day horror cinema and Blumhouse. A terrible bombardment of clich√©s built on a completely calculated formula. I almost had a heart attack while watching the movie.

A cute daughter who sees ghosts, a jerk big sister, a sexy neighbor boy, a stepmom ready to fight, a busy father, and a fake Elise Rainier. Seeing supernatural but moving on like nothing happened. Everyone becomes friends in the end. 

Like c'mon!"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm not a big fan of scary movies, even though some would say this isn't a scary movie. I do think it is quite ironic that this is like the scary juxtaposition of the upcoming movie, IF. Overall, this movie still had a good storyline and was kind of funny at times,"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,The story fell flat. The acting and script needed work to force this to work unfortunately.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This was a decent horror movie about imaginary friends as a child. Going into this I thought it would be average so I had low expectations. But I'm glad that I had those because it tuned out to be better then I thought. The family chemistry with the main actress and the kids was really well done and a few jumpscares here and there



SPOILERS 


I wish that the final scenes weren't really in this whole other dimension where the imaginary friends come from. I would have liked it more if the final fight/scenes took place just in the house. Would have been a little more realistic of sorts"
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was great and enjoyable. While it did have some scenes that fell flat, overall, it's a good film. It had a few unexpected plot twists that I didn't see coming. In conclusion, it's a great movie, and I highly recommend you watching it."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,it wasn't that scary
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,good movie took a while to get going but overall kept you guessing definitely seem worse movies from the same production company
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Slow start to a funny ending. I hope Blum house don't keep this up.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Too complicated of a set up - and the usual weak ending greatly diminished the film's potential.
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,I love this movie it pretty good. it is thrilling and all of that recommend watching it
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,it was ok. not great not the worst I've seen. would recommend seeing for free on a streaming app rather than paying to see in theaters
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"My 13 year old son said that it was finally a movie that he didnt want to end. So, if he said that, its definitely great to take your kid. My son is not a big fan, when it comes to any movie. I also thought it was a different, but a movie that had you mesmerized throughout. I definitely think this was a five star movie."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"What usually is boring, cliche, and generic suprizingly scared me and drew me in! Definitely better than expected and left me leaving the theater satisfied! Well done!"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is one of those movies where the concept was there, but the overall execution fell flat. The chemistry between the characters was non existent kind of like they accused the teddy bear of being üß∏. I will ""never ever"" watch this movie again."
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was so good! Blumhouse never misses. Plot twist was crazy
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Jeff Wadlow is the only director I know who can have a great idea and find a way to mess it up in the execution.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,The first part of the movie was actually pretty decent but it got worse and worse and monster looked so fake terrible movie
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,Could‚Äôve been better 
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Way better than average scary movie.
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"it's definitely different , but I enjoyed it. I would recommend it üëå"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was a bore and a disappointment from the moment the lights went off in the theatre to when the credits rolled.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just close your eyes and imagine the movie is good!
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"it was good, loved it"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The acting was subpar. I think I laughed a little bit more than jumped. The main character I love her as an actress, I‚Äôve seen her in other stuff. But don‚Äôt waste your money. Wait til it comes out and watch it on a day when you‚Äôre bored"
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie and story ‚Ä¶really creepy bear with awesome monsters too!
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"An absolutely underrated film, and while cheesy at times, it delivers with twisted reveals and good horror!"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,It has some nice jump scares but pretty slow in the beginning
"Mar 11, 2024",POSITIVE,good twist and very entertaining
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,characters were generally written and acted well.  The story was neat with some good reveals.  Glad I watched.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I did not have high hopes going into this movie. Do not get me wrong, it wasn't a spectacular but it was a decent movie. There was a lot that can be improved upon. Some of the imaginary characters were more comical than scary. I liked the acting from Alice played by Pyper, the little girl. The concept was pretty original."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was  okay movie nothing i would brag about. But it wasn‚Äôt a horrible movie
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"From someone who hates horror movies and would prefer a cartoon, fantasy or sci-fi, I am glad it wasn't scary. Yes, there were a few jump scares, creepy toy music and a freaky bear..but the story behind it wasn't a horror as I would have more than likely hid the whole way through. There was an interesting twist but besides that it was very slow and unfortunately it was wasn't very imaginable. Had the potential to be a terrifying movie but it definitely fell short. Even the demonic bear wasn't very scary, looked more like a children's idea of a scary bear with long claws and lots of teeth rather than an adults version."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,More funny than scary creature design was ok.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,It was funny at the bear and the teen boy part
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Started a bit slow, but the whole plot and graphics were really good üëå. If you're a fan of horror or thrillers I recommend it"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,The first half of the movie is actually pretty good‚Ä¶but then it just loses ANY and ALL control. It turns into a comedy that's kind of funny‚Ä¶the problem is that it's clear that isn't the intention which is what makes it awkward. It's hard to believe it has the same director throughout and they didn't switch off midway through the movie. It's like a plane ride that soars high..and then just..loses all engine power and nosedives straight to the ground into a fiery explosion.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"A wee bit underdeveloped, but overall enjoyable PG-13 horror fare, with a few interesting twists and jump scares."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Really good. Went from a basic story to something no one would ever think of. Does have jumpscares, and can get pretty scary."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Story was dumb and nothing was scary or interesting.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring and confusing.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"‚ÄòImaginary' brings a lifeless tale with cliched, sour and barley developed characters with the real show witnessing the horrendous writing and dialogue, some characters holding the award for ""Dumbest Character In A Feature Length Horror Movie."" And coincidences along with scenes that contradict major points and twists in the movie. As a plus, doesn't shy to point out everything. The Directing And Effects are solid, along with Pyper Braun's acting and some notable scares, other than that, the imagination behind this film wasn't very inventive."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,First 40 minutes movie is good. Resf of the movie is junk waste of time and money
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary held a lot of potential but unfortunately, it didn't deliver on its promises. While the acting was decent and the characters were engaging at times, the movie lacked the punch it needed to stand out. The story had unique elements and creative setups for scares, but it didn't deliver on them. Additionally, the balance between horror and comedy was off, which made it difficult to fully enjoy the film. While some parts did make me chuckle, it felt like it was trying too hard to be funny at times. I would still recommend seeing it in theaters to get the full theater experience."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I believe what makes great a horror movie is it's ability to make you scared from thinking ""that could happen to me,"" and get you to go home that night and turn on all the lights to make sure everything's ok. This movie did well, but just for the first half. For the second half I started to ask myself ""what am I watching?"" Live action Coraline?"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Movie was enjoyable. Made me laugh more than it scared me though. Plenty of jump scares, which Im not a fan of. I loved the concept. I just think more could have been done with it. Or less. It was worth one viewing for entertainment."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Overpowers it's cliches, Which i guess is the best they can hope for."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed the storyline, cinematography, and scare factor. Great for all ages too without gratuitous violence. Highly recommend."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was just OK. There is a lot  potential for this film, but I feel it falls short in many areas. I wouldn't say it was convoluted, but rather an oversimplified plot that is reminiscent of a poor man's ""Poltergeist"" with added elements of ""Coraline""."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was honestly super great, there were things they could have done differently, but the same con be said about any other movie. I'm probably gonna buy it when it comes out because as someone who loves horror movies, I thought this one was incredible and creative!"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,First half not bad but the second half was all over the place grabbing storylines from other movies.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,Honestly this movie was not that bad. It was a fun experience to go watch in theaters. I really hope it to have a sequel soon.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Had an okay theme behind it with a mediocre story that the actors did their best with. While there were moments of suspense, I never got a real sense of fear or danger."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"(spoiler alert) ok so i did not like this movie for a number of reasons. 1.) the ending didn't make any sense at all.  the bear is just some random werewolf thing that is haunting random kids childhoods? and what about the dad i don't get what happened to him it doesn't add up. and the grandma too, she just turns against them and dies out of nowhere? 2.) the little girl had better acting than anyone else in the movie. she literally carried the entire movie. 3.) i have a lot of questions that weren't answered in the movie and that could just be the way it's set up, like a cliff hanger or something but it's just not for me. 4.) lastly, for a ""horror movie"" that mind as well be a disney movie. i did not feel scared at all during the movie and i know it probably made for kids but it wasn't scary at all. ok thanks for reading. (watch at your own risk) - a very disappointed girl who thought this movie was gonna be good üò£"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie would be horrible, but it wasn't bad. It was a good way to pass time. The lead actors were solid. The jump scares were funny, the entire theater was gasping and laughing. The plot wasn't 100% predictable. I'd say it's a solid option to watch on a boring day. Just go into it lighthearted and don't take it so seriously."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a slow-burn film, but when it hit the third act, it was amazing!"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,I almost fell out of my seat with all the twists and turns this movie threw at me. Loved it! ü•∞
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Went into this movie not expecting much, however, I was pleasantly surprised. With great performances from DeWanda Wise and Pyper Braun, this movie exceeded my expectations."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,A child could probably write this movie better but it definitely stuck the landing.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,It wasn't bad. Not scary either. Overall just mediocre but still worth a watch if nothing else to do.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,average thought it was going to be something but wasn't.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Omg. This movie was the worse.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,It had a few good parts but wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting from the trailers
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Super corny, definitely not scary at all."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Too much going on. Plot was boring. Cute bear tho
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was starting good but then the story got dumb.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Great plot! Had me at the edge of my seat with unexpected scenes! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I mean, it was ok. It has a solid premise,  good acting, and nice scares. But beyond that it fell kinda flat. 
But the worst part, Chauncey's probably still hungry :("
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,I feel like this could be a good series after they learn where they can improve from the first film and come up with an another twisted story line.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible wasnt scary feel asleep
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed the movie, don't trust the critics score. Thought it was a unique horror story with consistent suspense."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie really brings teddy bears to life.  Otherworldly, with hints of evil but not so scary that I'll throw away my own toys after going home from the theatre."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"A great thriller! Kept me on the edge of my seat, even through some of the cheesier moments."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very great concept with a mess with your mind feel!! Great for a casual horror movie watcher! Myself being someone who only likes certain horror movies such a as Friday the 13th series's, footprints,zombeavers, and many more. I enjoyed the story and the hints it dropped. I'm a simple guy that doesn't like super crazy horror movies. This was perfect."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Written for kids, good for the family"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,I have not watched to many movies that I cant predict and this was one that creeped me out and kept me on my toes.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary has fun practical effects and a simple storyline. It doesn't tread any new ground and is exposition heavy at time but it was a fine matinee and I'm glad to have spent some time with it. Also, little Pyper Braun delivers some of the best acting in the movie."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was skeptical because of the reviews but it was actually very good. Constant jump scares and twists and turns. There wasn't much gore, however, I don't think it needed it. My heart pounded out of my chest the whole time. Its no slasher but its amazing on its own."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! This movie has many jump scares, would definitely recommend for 8 and older. Blood and scars are definitely not for kids. Movie scared some kids in my theater so bad, that they straight up screamed. 100% recommended üòÇ"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,so lame. it was very over hipped just for the audience and movie to ruin it. the plot was literally everywhere and then at the very end they decide to bring up a plot‚Ä¶ stupid. if you wanna see a mid movie that you can watch to fall asleep then this one is for you!
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Imaginary is one of my favorite movies Blumhouse has ever made. Sure, the pacing could have been work on a little bit. But the delivery was great. Also, sometimes you can see the scares from a mile away, but it still gave a good scare out of me. Overall, Blumhouse cooked on this movie, and that was good. Imaginary is a movie I would put on anytime."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Got a couple scares out of me and the concept is there, but the result was just something you can put on to pass the time."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,More people could've died
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wow, it‚Äôs bad. Really bad. Like, how on earth did this get made?? It‚Äôs so bad."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Could have been scarier. Should have gotten an R rating and taken it a bit further.
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very solid and very silly horror flick with just the right amount of goofiness to keep you entertained. The child actor did a fantastic job as both the daughter and the imaginary friend, the story was well paced and despite it being somewhat lacking at times and over reliant on jump scares I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves silly horror like I do."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Corny just all over the place I was confused
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It started out like it had some potential √†nd a story..then I waited and waited for it to become a scary movie then the last 45 minutes or so which should have rewarded the wait just brought a bizarre mishmash of an ending that was so ""stupidly crafted"" that it actually had me laughing at scenes. Jokes on me.. they took my $ and ran!"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved the visuals, Everyone did a fantastic job on the movie and I adored it. It was so awesome."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, Thought it would be more of a horror movie."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,it could have had more scary scenes and it really wasn't that scary not worth buying a movie ticket but maybe we'll find the movie when it comes out only reason I say it like that because you have to buy drinks and everything out at the theaters you can just buy the movie if you don't like it you don't allowed to watch it again but not a movie ticket waste of money
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary is a mediocre film. Though it's filled with many moments that will surely give you a fright, and the cast does a great job, the movie falls short of clich√© expectations and tropes. The movie suffers by its smaller budget(lack of antagonist) and Blumhouse's style and flare. But it's not a bad film at all. It's a film that should be enjoyed at home, but is fun and watchable once in theaters."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The premise of the flick is really interesting and there's some wonderful moments in it, but the dialogue is absolutely atrocious and I felt bad for the actors having to try and pull a good performance from it. It was hard to get through a lot of the cringeworthy writing. Excellent monster too though."
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I know the budget is probably a lot more, but this looked like it was made with 100k. The main character was so good and so kind that even though the bratty teen needed to hear she's awful, the MC only said it because it hurt her more to say. Like, I must not be very kind because I would've said it long ago. And everything was too easy and no one died. Well, the person you expect died. Overall, it felt like a made for TV movie that comes on at three a.m."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Wow what can I say.. this film has a great story very good acting and creepy jump scares I absolutely loved it! The costumes were very well made and gave me a very heavy vibe on creature feature style monsters! Ofc the only problem I had was that there was only one proper death in the film but even though there was one it worked pretty well and it didn't really feel like the film needed to be a bloodshed. Thats as much as I can say hope this review was helpful!
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was what I expected it to be. Ok story with a few twists. Unfortunately, it just didn't quite hit the mark for me. I would say if you decide to wait until it hit streaming services..it wouldn't hurt anything."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Imaginary takes the idea of a lonely kid using a coping mechanism to help themselves, & turns it on its head. The idea that a child could end up with something akin to a vampire when they just wanted a friend is so terrifying, yet so believable. Imagination is a powerful thing, who knew it had A-Bomb kinda kick? No wonder we lose it as we age!"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Imaginary takes us on a journey into the eerie depths of childhood imagination. Jessica, portrayed by the strong-willed DeWanda Wise, revisits her childhood home with her family, including her stepdaughter, Alice. On discovering a teddy bear named Chauncey Alice's behaviour takes a strange turn under his influence, leading to very unsettling events. Jessica senses something is wrong and embarks on a frantic mission to rescue her daughter from the grip of this seemingly real, imaginary companion.

The film cleverly taps into a human fear‚Äîthe hidden darkness that can reside within innocent childhood fantasies. It reminded me of movies like The Babadook (2014), where the boundary between fantasy and reality blurs, evoking a sense of unease. However, Imaginary falls short of reaching the same psychological depth of horror. While it delivers some atmospheric moments, the scares rely more on sudden jumps and noises than on sustained dread.

The performances are strong, with Wise carrying the emotional weight as the determined mother. Young Pyper Braun skilfully portrays Alice's transition from innocence to something more unsettling, effectively capturing her character's descent. Some of the side characters in the movie feel like they could use more depth, and their reasons for doing things are a bit unclear.

The visual style of the film is a bit mixed. While the use of colours effectively sets a gloomy tone, the special effects, especially in later scenes, start to look like unconvincing CGI. The editing keeps things moving at a good pace, but some transitions feel abrupt and disrupt the overall flow.

What really stands out about Imaginary is its sound design. The music is a blend of twisted nursery rhymes and eerie strings that perfectly match the unsettling vibe. The sound of Alice's panicked whispers while playing with Chauncey gave me chills.

Imaginary is a film with a promising concept. It doesn't quite reach its potential, but it still manages to deliver some decent scares. The performances are solid, and the atmosphere is eerie. The sound design is top notch. However, issues like underdeveloped characters, inconsistent special effects, and pacing problems prevent it from being truly terrifying.

For fans of horror movies who enjoy exploring themes related to the darker side of childhood, Imaginary offers an entertaining popcorn flick experience. It may not scare you to the point of hiding under the covers. But it will certainly make you reconsider the make-believe companions your children make friends with!"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Big spook
Not much else"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was horrible this is a horror for a four year old the monster bear just took me out good story line but awful in scary department this should've went straight to crackle
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Slow and dumb. not scary at all and for some stupid reason there will be a part 2. Don't waste your money
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The theater didn't work and the movie was canceled and I'm VERY, VERY Disappointed with amc theater!!!!"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The story was good, plenty of scary moments, but I was a little confused"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Do not waste your time or money. Movie is so corny. B-Type movie. Straight to DVD.
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was terrible. Concept was ok, but had a very poor execution. Acting was subpar and ending was awful."
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,Well acted. Story was decent. Great creature design and special effects.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot I felt was dragged along. There were some good scenes that hyped me up. I feel all the good scenes were presented in the trailer of the movie.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Blumhouse let me down.
I was not scared, anxious, or terrified or chair clingy at all.  I  get the story line but I love scary! I'm talking I wanted to be so scared that I came home and set my daughter's stuff animals on fire.  

instead, I got a movie scary for a 5 year old"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,I really did not like it at all. Horror movies should foreshadow not forespoil whats going to happen. The scene with her talking to the bear under the covers. All I could do was laugh. Horror = make me think the kid is there and not a little unscary teddy. Our cabbage patch was scarier than that. My teens liked it
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,There were some good ideas in this movie but by the time they get there you don't care about any of it. Oddly overly suspenseful music felt out of place and the first hour is a slog. Disappointing.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,IT SO FUCKIN ASS IMAGINARY
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoy it my crush and me love that movie she got scared that I hold her
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Too childlike for adults. Too adult for children. They didnt have a real plan for making this movie.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Awful, terrible, waste of time and money."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Ok movie. Had a lot of pontinal tho!
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs definitely a great concept. Kept us entertained not a masterpiece but a nice horror start think insidious but with a teddy bear lol. Chauncey will definitely be a Halloween treat
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Great introduction to scary movies for younger fans of creepy things.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not for children, would like a refund"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,What a stupid movie. I knew the critics had panned it but I thought at least there would be jump scares.  The special effects were lame as well. Do not waste your money!
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrendous acting and boring
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was like a real good episode of Goosebumps
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ted‚Ä¶for horror movie fans
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Cute and a bit scary.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Wooooooooooooooooow.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Both comedic and funny.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Controversially meh but amazing.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Imaginary should be a teen horror classic.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Not underwhelming as I expecting it to be but fantastic.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Jeff Wadlow's Best horror film for teens and tweens.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,I ate chocolate strawberries while watching this film.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Better than the happening.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Chauncey is so cute in this film, I love it."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Critics are so wrong about this movie.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great jump scares. step mom beautiful great acting. Father was worthless. story was a little all over the place but not a bad thing.  It may get a second watch from me.
it's well worth a watch."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Critics have the same opinion. This movie is filled with more plot twists than I can even explain. There are moments in the film where you still think about what could happen in a sequel even after the movie's over. Fun jump scares, and doesn't even have a good or bad ending... it has a mysterious ending. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!"
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wow i think this movie is great 
Every jumpscares always get me 
From the beginning to the end the story gets even darker this is amazing, Chauncey is freaking creepy DAYUM!! 7.9/10"
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Well crafted, slow burn story and character development keeps you engaged."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"An interesting twist on childhood  imaginary friends...  of course, don't let the kids watch it :).  Definitely on the upper end of Blumhouse productions."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Cash grab. I have a better time watching scary cheesy 80's horror. This was what it was like watching a bad low budget flick on HBO in 1995.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was had some scary sceens that would make you jump.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Not really scary to me but still loved it
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good movie to relax too
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was the best PG-13 horror movie of 2024 right now in my opinion, the movie was appealing and the plot was great, I recommend it. 10/10"
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a good PG 13 movie, not too scary but scary enough."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was a total waste of time and money. There is no horror in that movie, which had potential in the beginning, but the story plot was so stupid and it was so long that we couldn't wait to get out of the theatre. It is more of a fantasy movie than anything else."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie great horror!!!!
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was so real and kept you on the edge of your seat
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Super lenta, no ocurre nada interesante hasta casi al final donde luchan con un ser que no tiene ni apariencia fija si no que tienen que estar cambi√°ndole de forma para dar miedo"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story had promise‚Ä¶ but it didn't realise its full potential. The director built the tension, but it failed to be truly scary."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I don't know why this is getting hate by the critics. I went it fully expecting it to be awful. Instead I was pleasantly surprised by the wild ride the movie was. Sure the writing isn't the best, but it's an all around fun watch."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good, In a switch off brain, friday night movie way.
Not too scary, and fun in places.
It looked like the ideas were bigger than the budget, with some budget effects, and parts of the movie felt heavily borrowed from other horror movies.
But still more enjoyable than recent blumhouse."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not the worst horror movie out there. Definitely worth watching just for fun or to kill time. Dont expect great things from this movie tho.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary had potential to be a fun horror film, but failed to execute. Many plot holes. Ridiculous jump scares that aren't scary. The practical and makeup effects were impressive. The main actress and the little girl did a great time. I enjoyed their relationship."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Rating: 6/10. 68/100
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's a horror movie that isn't the least bit scary. Most of the scares were in the trailers. Too many unnecessary characters who leave little to no impact on the story. Terrible writing. Wasted potential. Zero creativity.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was a great laugh. Not the best horror movie in a long shot.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,its a great movie more horror than fnaf but not to the point that you are shiting your pants if i was you i would go and watch it now i hope you have fun plus there is lore! good bye.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"I wasn't expecting much from a generic concept, but somehow everything was almost perfectly executed! The suspense, the pacing, the SCARES, etc Were all super well done!!! Great job to Blumhouse!!!"
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,My kids loved it better than I thought it was going to be. Kept me entertained!
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Easy to figure out was one step ahead of movie whole time not scary relied on jump scares plot and storyline was weak and acting not good ending was ok all the scary movies this year are disappointing and this one is no different but maybe a little better
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked it. It was part Coraline, part Alice in wonderland, and part poltergeist. Marvel could take notes on how to make a female lead action."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Great spin on an all to common childhood fear. Blumhouse did a great job.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Theater audience let out an audible ""sigh"" when it ended. Was relief from the pain of watching such a terrible movie. AWFUL acting. Dialogue was PAINFUL. Had potential but knew it was going to be bad from the jump with the acting."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Lots of  jump outta your seat surprises !
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Great first time horror/suspense for kids/pre-teens. Its a great time for the family. Even as an adult it had a few jumps and pauses.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was fun, scary, and I had a great time. I got what I came for!"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The second half was unexpectedly entertaining, the ending was great and lots of points for creativity!"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,First 20 min were the scariest. After that it was pretty poopoo
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,1/10 the worst ending of all time. Stupid Stupud
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,I feel the film even though Entertaining and Scary in important spots it just doesn't keep a consistency. Maybe that's the point? Maybe a dark twist on Alice and Wonderland? I don't know but if so it's the fact it just couldn't decide on what movie it was trying to be and I think that's what hurt it the most in story telling. 6/10
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Such a creative take on an old concept. There are so many puzzle pieces that this movie beautifully connects together at the end. Definitely worth seeing again.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Blumhouse's Imaginary, from writer-director Jeff Wadlow, is an uncannily off-putting experience that provides real thrills despite not being scary."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,I think I would‚Äôve enjoyed shooting myself in the foot more.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,More silly fun garbage from Blumhouse.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Hands down best movie! Great twist!
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"When Jessica moves back into her childhood home with her family, her youngest stepdaughter, Alice, finds a stuffed bear named Chauncey. As Alice's behavior becomes more and more concerning, Jessica intervenes only to realize that Chauncey is much more than the stuffed toy bear she believed him to be.

If this one is anything, it certainly is ambitious.  The first half is formulaic,  but the second half is a TRIP!! Lots of twists and crazy imagery!

The child actors and main actress do a very good job despite the hokey dialog. One character in the movie is almost just there to provide exposition.  I started calling her ""Exposition Granny."" Also, the film does explain quite a bit which kind of makes one feel alienated; that they felt the audience was too dumb to comprehend everything. 

Overall,  a fun time at the cinema and worth the trip. Just don't set your standards super high.

Imaginary is imaginative!

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 3/4

Grade: B"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked it! Went with a friend to see a scary flick with no real lasting effect and it delivered. Sure the CGI is subpar and the ending sucks, but it's Blumhouse, come on now. The overall story was good! I always love the ""child innocence"" motif with the teddy bear. The main child actor was great as Alice. It had some good jumpscares, and though a lot of plot holes were left unexplained, the ending did wrap up everything that was mainly important. Pretty good, I'd recommend if you're bored and looking for a typical PG-13 horror movie!"
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Just an absolute fun scary movie. Cheap scares, with throwback 80s nods to horror classics hidden in there, this movie is exactly what it should be: a great time."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was wild tropey fun.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"So underrated, critics need to shut up like come on dude this is a great movie, I didn't get the 30% rating at all after I watched the movie. Great story, good scares, definitely worth a watch."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Mediocre horror movie with a few good ideas but gets progressively worse as the movie goes along.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,I was expecting a stinker but I was wrong.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,I want more attention for this movie for it's greatness.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Ted Meets Coraline and Insidious.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Nonsensical fun lazy fantastic film!
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,some what a good surprise of a film.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,I left early due to a obnoxious person
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Its a very good story, 100% a suspense movie not a horror movie"
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie makes Ted look like a whining baby.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Better than Ghostbusters 2016.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Haven‚Äôt been to the movies in a long time took my lady tonight and literally a copy and paste of insidious, conjuring and a twist of Freddy fazbear lol had few jump scares and decent story line decent acting but if you seen those movies I mentioned you like it but only difference is the movie is with an imaginary bear lol go see it tho"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie ever! Bad acting. Bad story line. Bad special effects. Bad makeup. Bad costumes. Just Bad.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was actually very good
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was such a good movie
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Every one was in theater completely scared lol.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wow this sucks, characters are not recommend, horror wasn't bad and could be more intense. This is the second worst film by blumhouse this year, the first being NIGHT SWIM. Jason Blum is stupid, the dialogue, writing and story was my God that was awful jezz I would see Cabrini more because that has better story, dialogue, character development and the writing. The creature wasn't bad but would be more bloodier, more scarier and more intense like ""A creature was stirring"" that was more entertaining. The Characters were forced and no one likes that. The is the first film that Universal Pictures did not distribute this film, Lionsgate distribute this film. This is a 0.2/5 there is so much stupidity and I won't watch this again."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Imaginary is a slog that doesn't amount to much more than a lazy combination of some of the most generic modern horror tropes. It's story is muddled and doesn't live up to it's concept.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie had a lot of corny and crazy moments to it. It was a little jumpy, but that‚Äôs it."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Must watch for horror fans! Dont listen to the critics. They always try to tear horror movies apart, instead of just sitting back and enjoying them."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Very good good story good movie
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was ok, it was not like a big blockbuster horror film, but it was fine."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you have seen Insidious (2010), The Boy (2016), or The Boogeyman (2023) you have already seen this film. Imaginary is a horror film that ironically lacks imagination and creativity. Feeling like a mix of clich√©s that we have seen before in the genre, this becomes just another ordinary supernatural horror film. The only positive aspect that was well handled, without giving spoilers, was the plot twist related to the teddy bear. It was a detail that I did not anticipate and gave a positive point to this film. Unfortunately, when it comes to the script, plot and acting these are average. The lack of gore and scary moments was to be expected due to the PG-13 rating. This is not a movie for horror fans who have seen everything and expect a good scare. Instead, it is more appropriate for people who want to watch a ""horror movie"" without being scared. Although of course, there are better options for that."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,A classic. A horror mystery film made for all with a very charming cinematographer.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was awesome I loved it I would go back again to watch the movie. I'll give 10/10
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Meh, semi interesting, but nothing to recommend with the price of tickets nowadays."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"From what I've seen from critics expressing their honest opinion on this new horror, it may not have been the best to some people, but to me, this movie still packs a bit of a punch in terms of creature features. Defo recommend if you're a fan of creature features."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,So fresh and creatively done. Very good movie if you love horror and mystery movies.
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,Teddy Bear Horror Movie Plays It Too Safe and Toothless
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,deadly but fantastic.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Just my imagination!!
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,This is a bloody freaking miracle!
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Common generic blumhouse movie, lazy greatness."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Phenomenal as heck!!!!! Great Job Jeff.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely must see!
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's actually not awful with some good scares here and there and good running length with some ok twists at the end.  I seen worst horror flicks.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a great movie an was definitely unique only downfall was the jump scares they weren't great and felt repetitive but I have to give it 4 stars because of the originality of this film and it felt fresh.
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Blumhouse has been churning out duds lately.  There were good creepiness, but very few and far between.  The third act was a mess for me and the teen and child actors were pretty annoying."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"A pesar de sus fallos, tiene un buen desenlace y final."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,I love Blum house movies! Great scary movie!
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,Imaginary is another blumhouse scary movie .. not the usually tongue  in check dialogue .. a few jumps scares .. not a waste of time
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Other than the fact that it was very slow moving and very predictable, my only wish is that I had imagined that I spent time watching it."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Expected better from Blumhouse. It was a mediocre ""horror"" film, little to no jumpscares and the storyline was so predictable."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is what you want from a theatrical movie!! the humor, horror (but not too scary for those scaredy cats like myself), storytelling, double twists, and just a good time! Great for dates and friends."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,So much potential and love some of the ideas but overall this was meh. The dialogue is the true imaginary because sheeesh.
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Quite possible the worst horror movie I've ever watched. It was boring, not remotely scary, and the acting was awful. Zero chemistry between the actors. Horrible writing, casting and acting. Don't waste your time."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So boring and not scary at all, like the concept but this is better than night swim"
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imaginary is a predictable, run of the mill horror movie that relies on jump scare to do the heavy lifting even as it toys with campiness before fully embracing it in its final act.

"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie, bad acting all around. Don't waste your time."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Was OK. Fell apart in third act. The more it tried to weave a backstory, the sillier it got. Audience was laughing at screaming I saw. "
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,A thoroughly uncreative frightfest - ironically enough - Imaginary is as rudimentary as PG-13 horror gets.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"[SPOILERS] Probably the most compelling horror movie I have ever seen, and all for the wrong reasons. This is a horror movie. There isn't a lot of suspense, and there is only one death in the movie, but what really got me in love with the movie is the imaginary aspect. The movie played, and I got so attached to a lot of these characters, and they killed their roles perfectly. The girl really did catch me off guard at times, especially at the nailed fence scene. I was wide-awake, seeing so many twists coming. The concept where imagination is hell's creation really sets the theme of the story, and had me on the edge of my seat. I think there could've been more, but it was extremely well-done. Really the only flaw in this movie was the neighbor was pretty useless, and he should've been replaced by the dad. If I would rewatch many horror movies, it's this movie right next to M3gan because they did such a great job with character development and subtle twists."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I had no idea what this movie was really about when I went to see it. The story line develops well, however I wish there had been more jump scares. The concept was good as imaginary friends is a cool concept. The end got more intense and had a nice twist to it when you thought it was ending. It's an enjoyable watch and kept me entertained, but I probably would've been buoyed it just as much streaming."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Original suspense/thriller with some tense moments, although not particularly scary. Still, a good overall movie that didn't resort to gore for shock value. It started out tense and kept the interest high, although it did devolve into more of a satirical, campy ending. Not the best, but worth a watch, especially with the dearth of good movies out currently."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not a good movie. Was expecting something different. Acting wasnt the best, and the storyline was weird."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I walk out of the theater,boring and lame"
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really great psychological horror/thriller type of movie! I do think there could've been a lot more animation of horrifying imaginary characters. I found the actual horror aspect a little lackluster, but overall is a good film. If you go into this with more of the mentality of a psychological thriller, you'll love it. I am just an avid horror fan, so maybe this was just too mild for me. I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunities because of this being made as a PG-13 movie instead of rated R, which sadly seems to be a common trend in horror now a days sadly. Worth a watch, just wish more had been done to add to the scare factor!"
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was alright. Nothing special but somewhat engaging. It's a fun movie to see with friends and yell at the screen. Some of the performances left a lot to be desired.
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"i didn‚Äôt see the movie , the place was trashed up and it stink real bad"
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a watchable, but below average scary movie to me. I found the scares to be just okay and the story line to be so-so at best. It also has an ending that was just unnecessary given the final results. This is one that held more promise in the trailer than it really delivered."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you want a horror mix between coraline and drop dead fred, go see this movie. I took a star off because the final ""battle"" was kind of weak, but the twists were kind of cool."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, jumpscares, pretty good plot, all around good horror film"
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,the plot twists in this movie!!
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"In Imaginary, a really good job was done with the characters and its lore. The scares were not bad but could've been better. Still, I really enjoyed the story and the performances from DeWanda Wise and Pyper Braun were excellent."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,There are very good jump scares and the suspense to me is what took the cake but overall I would recommend this movie to anyone.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,I went in expecting a basic haunting movie but I ended up getting something totally unexpected. The twist in the 2nd act was GREAT.
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Took a minute to get started, good ending."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terribly written.  Freddy fazbear meets Alice in wonderland meets Caroline, yes Caroline.  Well done for the actors, but I can't say that for the prosthetic makeup that looked cheaply done. Blumhouse needs better story lines better writers. Snooze fest.  Come on Blumhouse you can do much better. "
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The writing just makes no god damn sense. It sticks out like the biggest sore thumb and really is to the film's detriment. The film [otherwise] has surprisingly fun-enough horror and tone. It really is just such a shame the writing went to such waste.

"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's a Blumhouse film so the movie has to be fantastic, right? No. It's just bad. Maybe it's the rockstar dad who serves no real purpose but to be the reason the kids are in the movie? Or the stereotypical teen/stepmom storyline? Or maybe it's the high hopes I had at the beginning of the movie that were crushed when I realized these were actually the main actors? Horror movies are a Blumhouse specialty, so how did it all go so wrong? For starters, the characters weren't likable - at all. It seemed more like a high school performance than an actual Blumhouse movie. The mother of the teen next who lived next door gave the best performance in her less than 30-second role only to be overshadowed by the adorable maltipoo who pranced in and out a couple of times. I'm so disappointed and really hope Blumhouse learns from this flop."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Further proving Blumhouse hasn't mastered the art of horror movies just yet, ""Imaginary"" is unoriginal and rarely scary."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,I bit predictable but a fun movie. The scenes in the dark were a bit blurry but could have been our screen.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Plot Twist and story.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is very good it is the best blumhouse movie since Halloween 2018.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Imaginary puts Blumhouse back on the right track of horror.

Blumhouse has become synonymous with spine-tingling tales that often leave audiences debating the fine line between fear and fascination. Their latest offering, Imaginary, is no exception. As one of my favorite studios, known for hits and occasional misses, this film captivated me from the start. ""Imaginary"" ventures into the realm of childhood imagination, a territory both familiar and unnervingly surreal. The concept of imaginary friends takes a chilling turn as the narrative unfolds. It pushes the boundaries of its PG-13 rating with creativity and finesse.

The film excels in its ability to deliver heart-stopping jump scares. It also maintains a premise that is both fun and wildly imaginative. The world Imaginary builds is vibrant and whacky, inviting viewers to immerse themselves fully in its eerie charm. One standout element is the character of Chauncey the bear, whose unsettling presence lingers long after the credits roll. Rising star Pyper Braun delivers a standout performance as Alice. She effortlessly steals the show with her portrayal of a young girl caught in the grip of something sinister. Joining Braun are DeWanda Wise and Taegen Burns. They both shine in their respective roles, contributing to the film's overall sense of female empowerment and camaraderie.

For first-time horror watchers, this Blumhouse film is an excellent introduction to the genre.
It expertly navigates the balance between suspense and spectacle. The film offers a thrilling ride that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. At its core, ""Imaginary"" explores the eerie world of childhood imagination with a fresh perspective, inviting viewers to reconsider the things that go bump in the night. With its inventive premise and stellar performances, this film deserves both a sequel and spin-off to explore its captivating universe further. In a recent interview with Imaginary stars Veronica Falcon and Alix Angelis, the actresses shed light on the film's production and their experiences bringing their characters to life.

I give Imaginary 4 out of 5 stars. It's a must-watch for horror enthusiasts and casual viewers alike. It offers a thrilling blend of scares and storytelling that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating what Blumhouse has in store next."
